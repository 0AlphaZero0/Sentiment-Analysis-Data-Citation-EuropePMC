Despite their importance, the way different hosts control and suppress malaria infections remains poorly understood. With recent developments in next-generation sequencing techniques, however, it is now possible to quantify the response of the entire transcriptome to infections. We experimentally infected Eurasian siskins (<italic>Carduelis spinus</italic>) with avian malaria parasites (<italic>Plasmodium ashfordi</italic>), and used high-throughput RNA-sequencing to measure the avian transcriptome in blood collected before infection (day 0), during peak parasitemia (day 21 postinfection), and when parasitemia was decreasing (day 31). We found considerable differences in the transcriptomes of infected and uninfected individuals, with a large number of genes differentially expressed during both peak and decreasing parasitemia stages. These genes were overrepresented among functions involved in the immune system, stress response, cell death regulation, metabolism, and telomerase activity. Comparative analyses of the differentially expressed genes in our study to those found in other hosts of malaria (human and mouse) revealed a set of genes that are potentially involved in highly conserved evolutionary responses to malaria infection. By using RNA-sequencing we gained a more complete view of the host response, and were able to pinpoint not only well-documented host genes but also unannotated genes with clear significance during infection, such as microRNAs. This study shows how the avian blood transcriptome shifts in response to malaria infection, and we believe that it will facilitate further research into the diversity of molecular mechanisms that hosts utilize to fight malaria infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>host response</kwd><kwd>immune defense</kwd><kwd>Plasmodium</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>experimental infection</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria parasites (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.) are intracellular apicomplexan protists that are most commonly known because they cause the disease malaria in an estimated 200 million people every year, resulting in over 600,000 deaths (<xref rid="msv016-B70" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2013</xref>). These parasites are transmitted through dipteran vectors to an extremely diverse range of vertebrate hosts including primates, bats, rodents, reptiles, and birds (<xref rid="msv016-B27" ref-type="bibr">Garnham 1966</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B39" ref-type="bibr">Levine 1988</xref>). Most of the research on host responses to malaria have been performed on primates and mice, with the effects of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> on other vertebrate hosts and the mechanisms they use to deal with infections remaining largely unknown.</p><p>To understand why some hosts are greatly affected by malaria while others have evolved different mechanisms to resist or tolerate infections (<xref rid="msv016-B51" ref-type="bibr">R&#229;berg et al. 2009</xref>), it is imperative to characterize the molecular responses to infection across different taxa. To date, there has been little integration between different host systems and between wild and laboratory (model) organisms. Most of the research on molecular host responses to malaria have concentrated on humans and laboratory mice. In contrast, studies on wild populations, which are mainly on birds, have focused largely on ecological factors associated with distribution patterns, and hence the diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying infections is still mostly unknown. However, investigating the molecular responses and immune mechanisms of birds has several potential advantages. The way natural selection shapes the evolution of host responses can be studied without interference by vaccinations, medicines, mosquito control, and other anthropogenic preventive measures. It is also possible to perform controlled malaria experiments in wild birds in order to follow host responses over the course of infections. Inbred laboratory mice strains are well suited for infection experiments, although they have been artificially selected and cannot accurately represent natural host responses in other vertebrate taxa, including humans (<xref rid="msv016-B69" ref-type="bibr">White et al. 2010</xref>). Studying the molecular responses of wild birds to malaria infections therefore presents a unique opportunity to better understand the ecological and evolutionary basis of molecular host responses. Considering that many major malaria discoveries have historically been made in species other than humans (<xref rid="msv016-B20" ref-type="bibr">Cox 2010</xref>), several of them in birds, studies encompassing a broader host diversity are likely to provide important advances in malaria research.</p><p>Birds represent a major host group to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Around 50 morphological avian malaria parasite species have been described (<xref rid="msv016-B61" ref-type="bibr">Valki&#363;nas 2005</xref>), but over 500 evolutionary independent lineages have been discovered using sequence divergence in the mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>b</italic> gene (<xref rid="msv016-B14" ref-type="bibr">Bensch et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="msv016-B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Several <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species infect numerous bird species and have a near global distribution, whereas others are more host specific with limited transmission (<xref rid="msv016-B52" ref-type="bibr">Ricklefs and Fallon 2002</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B13" ref-type="bibr">Bensch et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B31" ref-type="bibr">Hellgren et al. 2009</xref>). Their virulence often varies substantially both within and between host species, and interestingly, some birds seem to be resistant to malaria parasites (<xref rid="msv016-B48" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="msv016-B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The disease symptoms in birds range from asymptomatic life-long chronic levels without apparent fitness effects on the host (<xref rid="msv016-B15" ref-type="bibr">Bensch et al. 2007</xref>), to severe anemia, cerebral paralysis, and even death (<xref rid="msv016-B60" ref-type="bibr">Swann and Kreier 1973</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B10" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al. 1995</xref>, <xref rid="msv016-B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B48" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cellier-Holzem et al. 2010</xref>). They have also been shown to inflict drastic consequences on wild populations; for example, <italic>Plasmodium relictum</italic> has caused major declines and the extinction of several endemic bird species on the islands of Hawaii (<xref rid="msv016-B64" ref-type="bibr">van Riper et al. 1986</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B9" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson and LaPointe 2009</xref>).</p><p>Studying the molecular mechanisms of host immune responses to malaria infection in general is extremely challenging. The immune defense of vertebrates is highly diverse and complex, with numerous cells, proteins, genes, and pathways, interacting and activating various components of the immunity. Previous methods used to characterize host molecular responses to malaria parasites have focused on microarrays and/or various genetic techniques targeting a set number of candidate genes. However, these tools rely heavily upon already existing knowledge of the gene sequences and are limited in their ability to comprehensively monitor and accurately quantify host transcriptional response (<xref rid="msv016-B66" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B47" ref-type="bibr">Oshlack et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B68" ref-type="bibr">Westermann et al. 2012</xref>). This makes it difficult to gain a holistic picture of host genes activated during different stages of infection, particular in nonmodel organisms, and it prevents potential discoveries of novel genes and pathways with important roles during infection. With the advent of next-generation sequencing methods, we now have the unprecedented opportunity to accurately evaluate the overall molecular response to infection in a wide range of taxa. One of these new sequencing techniques is RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), where total mRNA is sequenced and analyzed with bioinformatic approaches, resulting in a complete representation of the transcriptome.</p><p>In this study, we examined the response of the avian transcriptome to experimental malaria infections in vivo using RNA-seq. We caught wild malaria-na&#239;ve Eurasian siskins (<italic>Carduelis spinus</italic>) and housed them in aviaries throughout the course of the experiment. Three birds were injected once with blood containing <italic>Plasmodium ashfordi</italic> parasites, and a control bird received only blood. We collected blood from the birds at three time points: Before infection (day 0), during the acute stage of infection (peak parasitemia; day 21), and when parasitemia was decreasing (day 31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). RNA-seq data on whole-blood transcriptomes across the three time points were used in the following way. First, we characterized overall transcriptome changes in relation to malaria infection and tested for differentially expressed genes between infected and uninfected birds. Second, we examined whether there were differences in gene expression between the peak and decreasing parasitemia stages. Third, the functions of the differentially expressed genes were determined by investigating annotation status and performing gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), where we tested for overrepresentation among gene ontology (GO) terms. Finally, we compared the differentially expressed genes in this study with genes found to be associated with malaria infection in humans and mice to identify potentially conserved gene responses across evolutionary divergent taxa.

All individuals, including the control bird, moved in a positive direction along the PC1 axis with approximately similar magnitudes over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). This, together with additional evidence discussed in Materials and Methods, indicated that PC1 captured transcriptome-wide expression variation caused by the effects of experimental procedure and time, but not by malaria infection. PC2, in contrast, represented expression variation between infected and uninfected birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>), that is, the response to malaria. The transcriptomes from all infected samples were well separated from the uninfected ones on the PC2 axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), implying similar transcriptome responses to malaria in all infected birds and during both parasitemia stages. Consequently, the PCA indicated that there had been a considerable shift in the blood transcriptomes of infected birds due to malaria, and that the effects of experimentation were clearly distinguishable from the effects of infection.</p><p>Next, we performed differential gene expression analyses to identify genes that significantly contributed to the transcriptome-wide differences between infected and uninfected birds. First, we examined changes in gene expression during peak parasitemia by doing pairwise comparisons of expression levels in inoculated birds at day 0 (uninfected) to the same birds at day 21 postinfection (peak parasitemia). In order to separate the effects of malaria infection from the effects of experimentation, we used information gained from the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref>). From the set of genes found to be differentially expressed, we only selected those with PC2 loading scores greater than PC1 loading scores (hereafter referred to as PC2 filtering) (see details in Materials and Methods). After this filtering step, we found a total of 795 significantly differentially expressed genes during peak parasitemia that loaded more strongly onto PC2 than PC1, representing the response to malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Of these 795 significant genes, almost two-thirds (<italic>n</italic> = 516; 64.9%) were upregulated during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), with some genes exhibiting very high log<sub>2</sub> fold changes (up to 8.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>).

Employing the same PC2 filtering method as in the previous analysis, we found a total of 1,106 genes that responded significantly to malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Similarly to the results of peak parasitemia, more of these genes were found to be upregulated during infection (<italic>n</italic> = 654; 59.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>).

This result suggests that gene expression levels were very similar during the two infected time points, despite the much lower parasitemia in the birds 10 days later during the decreasing parasitemia stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Therefore, hosts seek to minimize the time immune processes are active. This is perhaps the reason why we see a reduced immune response in the birds during the later stage of infection. There were, however, two strongly significant overrepresented immune functions during the decreasing parasitemia stage that were not significant during peak parasitemia. Interestingly enough, they were both related to &#8220;mature B cell differentiation&#8221; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F5">fig. 5</xref>). This is the process where a naive B cell acquires the specialized features of a mature or memory B cell during an immune response. Some immune genes were found significantly differentially expressed during both stages of infection. For example, <italic>MR1</italic> is a gene related to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, one of the most important and variable gene families of the adaptive immune system. This gene was significantly upregulated during peak parasitemia (<italic>q</italic> = 7.96e-3), and even more highly upregulated during decreasing parasitemia (<italic>q</italic> = 2.47e-5).

Different stress-related functions were activated during both parasitemia stages, although they were slightly more significant during peak parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F5">fig. 5</xref>). During an infection, innate immune cells release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to attack parasites (<xref rid="msv016-B58" ref-type="bibr">Sorci and Faivre 2009</xref>). These highly reactive nonspecific molecules target all living cells, capable of causing much damage to surrounding host cells and tissue. In addition, malaria parasites also generate cytotoxic compounds when digesting hemoglobin, which may cause further damage. Events like these may trigger oxidative stress responses. Previous research has found evidence of oxidative stress in hosts during malaria infection by measuring oxidant and antioxidant levels in the blood (see, e.g., <xref rid="msv016-B59" ref-type="bibr">Stocker et al. 1985</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B24" ref-type="bibr">Erel et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B11" ref-type="bibr">Becker et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B56" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B34" ref-type="bibr">Isaksson et al. 2013</xref>). Our study supports these findings and provides evidence of molecular regulation of oxidative stress in birds infected with malaria. For example, during peak parasitemia &#8220;glutathione transferase activity&#8221; was significantly overrepresented (<italic>q</italic> = 7.57e-4) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The significant genes contributing to this term were all upregulated glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which play critical roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress (<xref rid="msv016-B4" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong 1997</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and McLellan 1999</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B30" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Strange 2000</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B57" ref-type="bibr">Siritantikorn et al. 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Death Regulation</title><p>During peak parasitemia we found several significantly overrepresented functions related to &#8220;negative regulation of cell death&#8221; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F5">fig. 5</xref>). Hosts often kill their own cells by programmed cell death (apoptosis) as a mean to control infections (<xref rid="msv016-B7" ref-type="bibr">Ashida et al. 2011</xref>). Here however, various mechanisms, such as apoptosis inhibitors, prevent cells from committing suicide. In contrast, not a single function related to cell death was found significantly overrepresented during the decreasing parasitemia stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F5">fig. 5</xref>). One explanation for why these functions are overrepresented during peak, but not decreasing levels of parasitemia, is that the birds may protect themselves against anemia. Because malaria parasites infect red blood cells, it is known that an infection can cause reduced levels of hematocrit and lead to anemia in the host (see, e.g., <xref rid="msv016-B60" ref-type="bibr">Swann and Kreier 1973</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B18" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Stevenson 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B48" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B17" ref-type="bibr">Cellier-Holzem et al. 2010</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is able to manipulate the host cell apoptosis regulatory mechanisms to its own benefit, in an attempt to evade the immune system. This strategy has been discovered in a wide variety of pathogens (reviewed in <xref rid="msv016-B36" ref-type="bibr">Lamkanfi and Dixit 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B7" ref-type="bibr">Ashida et al. 2011</xref>), including <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref rid="msv016-B65" ref-type="bibr">van de Sand et al. 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Telomerase Activity</title><p>Our analyses showed that the function &#8220;telomere maintenance via telomerase&#8221; was significantly overrepresented during peak parasitemia (<italic>q</italic> = 0.059) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Telomeres are the essential structures located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, protecting them from degradation, with telomerase being the principal enzyme involved in telomere lengthening. High rates of telomere shortening are an indicator of stress, and it has previously been shown that malaria parasites can increase the rate of telomere loss in infected birds (<xref rid="msv016-B5" ref-type="bibr">Asghar 2012</xref>). One of the significant genes in our study contributing to the overrepresentation of &#8220;telomere maintenance via telomerase&#8221; was <italic>PINX1</italic>, a potent telomerase inhibitor linked to telomere shortening (<xref rid="msv016-B73" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Lu 2001</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>PINX1</italic> and other telomere-related genes indicated that telomerase activity was potentially reduced in birds with malaria during infection. In fact, as part of another study, the telomere lengths of the birds used here have been measured and it was found that the inoculated birds did indeed have reduced telomeres during infection (Asghar M et al., unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic and Catabolic Processes</title><p>Many functions related to metabolism and oxidation&#8211;reduction processes were found to be significantly overrepresented among the significant genes during both parasitemia stages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary tables S4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">S5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). An infection induces a major shift in the metabolic priorities of the host (<xref rid="msv016-B43" ref-type="bibr">Lochmiller and Deerenberg 2000</xref>), and so the overrepresentation of metabolism-related activities in infected birds is not surprising. Metabolic processes have also been found to be of importance in other host species infected with malaria (see, e.g., <xref rid="msv016-B41" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B1" ref-type="bibr">Albuquerque et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sengupta et al. 2011</xref>). Interestingly, however, is that catabolic processes were initiated in the later stages of malaria infection in our study, as only one GO term related to catabolic processes was overrepresented during peak parasitemia in comparison to 11 during the decreasing parasitemia stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F6">fig. 6</xref>).

Therefore, we evaluated the percentage of genes differentially expressed in response to malaria infection containing annotation of one or more GO terms. Of the 795 significant genes differentially expressed during peak parasitemia, 79.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 629) had GO annotations. Similarly, 82.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 915) of the 1,106 significant genes found in the decreasing parasitemia stage were annotated. Altogether, about 20% of the genes responding to malaria infection had unknown functions. This suggests that we would have greatly underestimated the avian host transcriptional response to malaria if we had used other molecular methods based only on known candidate genes. In fact, four of the top ten significant genes from the peak parasitemia stage were completely uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv016-T1">table 1</xref>). These highly significant uncharacterized genes represent potential targets for future, more detailed research that may reveal novel host&#8211;parasite interactions.</p><p>More specifically, we observed that several unannotated miRNA genes were highly important in the host response, comprising five of the top ten most significant genes during both parasitemia stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv016-T1">table 1</xref>). miRNAs are small regulatory RNA molecules principally involved in posttranscriptional silencing of mRNA. An increasing number of studies are now finding evidence that miRNAs have critical functions in the immune system (<xref rid="msv016-B42" ref-type="bibr">Lindsay 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B16" ref-type="bibr">Carissimi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B72" ref-type="bibr">Xiao and Rajewsky 2009</xref>).

We also compared mouse genes to human genes, and found 240 genes (18.4%) shared between the two mammalian hosts. Thirteen genes were present in the transcriptional response to malaria in all three organisms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv016-T2">table 2</xref>). Of these 13 significant genes, several are highly involved in the immune defense and/or cell death regulation, for example, lymphocyte antigen 86, B cell CLL/lymphoma 6, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="msv016-T2">table 2</xref>). These results suggest that there are potentially highly conserved evolutionary immune responses activated by malaria infections which might provide valuable targets for research into disease control programs. We want to emphasize, however, that the overlap of gene response is based on only three species investigated by two studies, and should therefore be treated with caution. With future sequencing of more transcriptome responses to malaria, this will be possible to evaluate in greater detail.

Wild juvenile siskins were caught with mist nets in the summer and housed in aviaries. Experimental procedures in this study were approved by the International Research Co-operation Agreement between the Biological Station Rybachy of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Institute of Ecology of Nature Research Centre (25th May 2010). All efforts were made to minimize handling time and potential suffering of birds. The full experimental procedure incorporated several birds and the results from the complete infection study is currently under preparation. Siskins have proven to be excellent study organisms for avian malaria experiments (<xref rid="msv016-B48" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="msv016-B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). They are susceptible to several <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lineages, yet juvenile siskins caught early in the summer are uninfected. They are abundant at the study site and suitable to house in captivity as opposed to several other small wild birds. We used three inoculated birds and one control bird as part of this transcriptome study. Although the sample size is small (three replicates per group, with four uninfected birds at the start of the experiment and one additional bird for control), it provided us with enough variation to perform all analyses. This setup allowed us to follow the same individuals over the course of the experiment using a longitudinal design, minimizing interindividual variation in expression levels.</p><p>The inoculated birds were infected with a single injection of blood containing the erythrocytic stages of <italic>P</italic><italic>. ashfordi</italic> (lineage GRW2), described by <xref rid="msv016-B63" ref-type="bibr">Valki&#363;nas et al.

It was subsequently multiplied in common crossbills (<italic>Loxia curvirostra</italic>) and then deep frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. Prior to this experiment, a single crossbill was infected and served as donor of the infection. Crossbills were used because they are large enough to provide the amount of blood needed for injections. Importantly, they are also susceptible for this particular strain, free from other blood parasites, and suitable for keeping under laboratory conditions. By utilizing only one donor, we effectively made sure to distribute the same clonal strain and parasite quantity to the recipient birds.</p><p>All birds were originally screened for parasites with both molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening methods (details in <xref rid="msv016-B32" ref-type="bibr">Hellgren et al. 2004</xref>) and microscopic blood smear examination (described in <xref rid="msv016-B62" ref-type="bibr">Valki&#363;nas et al. 2008</xref>) to ensure no prior infection. A subinoculation of a freshly prepared mixture containing infected blood was made into the pectoral muscle of the recipient birds (details in <xref rid="msv016-B48" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al. 2008</xref>). The control bird was injected at the same time as inoculated birds, but with blood from a donor crossbill free of parasites. The birds were observed continuously throughout the duration of the experiment. Blood for quantitative estimations of parasitemia levels was sampled before and throughout the experiment in heparinized microcapillaries by puncturing the brachial vein, and subsequently smeared on blood films for microscopic examinations and stored in SET-buffer for quantitative PCR. Blood for RNA-sequencing was collected at three time points in empty tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80 &#176;C until extraction.

BGI performed library preparation, cDNA synthesis, and paired-end sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

A combined total of 720 million paired-end reads, partitioned into 90-bp-long reads (392 million), and 65-bp-long reads (328 million) passed read quality control and filtering (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p></sec><sec><title>Read Mapping</title><p>Quality filtered reads were mapped with TopHat2 (v. 2.0.9) (<xref rid="msv016-B35" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2013</xref>), which makes use of the aligner Bowtie2 (v. 2.1.0) (<xref rid="msv016-B38" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>), to the unmasked zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>) genome (v. 3.2.4.73) (<xref rid="msv016-B67" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al. 2010</xref>), obtained from Ensembl (v. 73) (<xref rid="msv016-B26" ref-type="bibr">Flicek et al. 2013</xref>). Reads were allowed a maximum mismatch rate of 20% and were guided in TopHat2 using the zebra finch transcriptome (v. 3.2.4.73) (<xref rid="msv016-B26" ref-type="bibr">Flicek et al. 2013</xref>). By using a genome-guided approach instead of a de novo assembly of reads, we effectively made sure to discriminate from any reads originating from the malaria parasite in the analyses.</p><p>Five hundred and forty million unique reads were successfully mapped to the genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Two main factors will reduce the proportion of sequence reads mapped in this study. First, a substantial part of the reads in infected birds originates from the parasite&#8217;s mRNA and hence will lower the proportion of avian reads. This can be seen in the reduced percentage of reads mapped in infected birds compared with the same bird before infection, day 0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Second, the bird species sequenced was Eurasian siskin, and even though avian genomes are highly conserved (<xref rid="msv016-B23" ref-type="bibr">Ellegren 2010</xref>), use of the zebra finch genome will automatically reduce mapping statistics due to evolutionary divergence between the two species. Taking these two factors into account, the percentage of reads mapped to the genome was nonetheless relatively high (84.1% for 90-bp reads and 64.2% for 65-bp reads). Average base pair coverage per individual relative to the zebra finch entire transcriptome was high (137.5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary table S10</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), despite sequencing only blood and therefore we expected low or no coverage from tissue-specific genes. Reads used in this study have been uploaded to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the accession number SRP045347.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Component Analysis</title><p>Unique reads that mapped unambiguously to genes were counted using HTSeq (v. 0.5.3p9) (<xref rid="msv016-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anders et al. 2014</xref>) and SAMtools (v. 0.1.19) (<xref rid="msv016-B40" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>), and subsequently analyzed in DESeq2 (<xref rid="msv016-B44" ref-type="bibr">Love et al. 2014</xref>). In order to avoid any bias of experimental design, variance stabilized transformation of counts (explained in <xref rid="msv016-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>) was used in DESeq2 to evaluate sample clustering and sample distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F4">fig. 4</xref>), and the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). The PCA was performed on all genes and all individuals concurrently, with 28.4% of the variance explained by PC1 and 20.1% by PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). The PC1 represents expression differences seen in the birds due to the experimental procedure. By injecting all birds with blood they potentially experienced a minor immune response directly after injection at day 0. However, mean survival time of red blood cells after heterologous blood transfusion in birds has been estimated to only 0.1&#8211;2.6 days (<xref rid="msv016-B54" ref-type="bibr">Sandmeier et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B21" ref-type="bibr">Degernes et al. 1999</xref>). It is therefore highly unlikely the response to blood injection would still be present during sampling 21 and 31 days later. Instead, PC1 most likely represent the birds&#8217; response to being caught, handled, and having blood collected for both RNA-seq and parasitemia estimations. The act of catching wild birds and housing them in captivity induces a wide range of different environmental stresses and stimuli (<xref rid="msv016-B46" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Tromborg 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B22" ref-type="bibr">Dickens et al. 2009</xref>). Taken together, these factors are likely to affect expression levels in a large number of genes, whereas infection triggers changes in fewer, more targeted genes. This is supported by the observation that all four birds (regardless of parasitemia levels) moved in the same direction and with similar magnitude on PC1 from day 0 to days 21 and 31 of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Additionally, different bird individuals were found interspersed on PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv016-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), indicating broad underlying baseline differences in the blood transcriptomes between individuals, which is expected. Our interpretation of PC1 as the experimental procedure response is strongly reinforced by evidence from GSEA, where functions related to stress, coagulation, and wound healing can be seen in significant genes contributing more to the loading of samples on PC1 than PC2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary tables S6</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">S7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p></sec><sec><title>Differential Gene Expression Analyses</title><p>Differential gene expression analyses were performed with DESeq2 (v. 1.0.19) (<xref rid="msv016-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv016-B44" ref-type="bibr">Love et al. 2014</xref>), in R (v. 3.0.2) (<xref rid="msv016-B50" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team 2014</xref>), using a pairwise design with individual as a blocking factor. Plots were made using ggplot2 (<xref rid="msv016-B71" ref-type="bibr">Wickham 2009</xref>). DESeq2 is suitable for studies with fewer replicates, and consistently shows high sensitivity and precision (<xref rid="msv016-B44" ref-type="bibr">Love et al. 2014</xref>). In this software, counts are normalized for library size differences using the geometric mean, and modeled with a negative binomial distribution. While earlier methods based on a Poisson distribution model underestimate the effect of biological variability, the negative binomial distribution model tests for overdispersion and makes fewer type I errors (<xref rid="msv016-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>). Shrinkage of dispersion and fold changes estimates are implemented in DESeq2 to improve stability and interpretability (<xref rid="msv016-B44" ref-type="bibr">Love et al. 2014</xref>). In practice, this means that logarithmic fold changes will have stronger shrinkage when there is little information available for a gene (i.e., low read count, high dispersion, or few degrees of freedom). Differentially expressed genes were corrected for false positives using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing (<xref rid="msv016-B12" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>), and the corrected <italic>P</italic> values are reported throughout the article as <italic>q</italic> values. Underlying data distribution has been depicted using density curves and MA plots in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary figures S3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online.</p><p>Several strict filtering criteria were used in DESeq to ensure that we only examined genes which changed expression in response to malaria infection. First, for every differential expression test, only the genes with a combined mean count of &#8805;5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and FDR (<italic>q</italic> value) &lt; 0.1 were classified as significant. This resulted in an initial set of 1,230 genes (during peak parasitemia) and 1,784 genes (during decreasing parasitemia) significantly differentially expressed. Second, in order to tease apart the effects of infection from the effects of the experiment, we removed from the set of significant genes, all genes that had a larger PC1 than PC2 score. The reasoning behind this screening was because the PC2 dimension explained expression variance present in the birds due to malaria infection, and PC1 explained variance due to the experimental procedure (see previous paragraph about PCA). By using strict selection criteria in our analyses and scrutinizing all significant genes with higher PC1 scores, we miss the genes that changed expression levels both in response to malaria infection and in response to experimentation, simultaneously, provided that their experiment response was higher than their infection response. It is therefore important to note that these results are likely to represent more specific responses to malaria infection and may underestimate the importance of general immune mechanisms and stress responses that are also activated by handling the birds and collecting their blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Validation of Differential Gene Expression Results</title><p>Validation of gene expression results was examined by employing a second method testing for differential gene expression using edgeR (v. 3.4.2) (<xref rid="msv016-B53" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al. 2010</xref>). In edgeR, infected samples at days 21 and 31 postinfection were tested separately against the uninfected samples at day 0, using a pairwise multifactorial design with bird individual as blocking factor. Similar to the analyses in DESeq2, we only accepted genes as significant if they passed the following criteria: Mean counts per million &#8805; 0.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and FDR &lt; 0.1. Subsequent filtering of significant genes with higher PC2 scores ensured we were only using genes responding to the malaria infection, with the same underlying reasoning as in the DESeq2 analyses. edgeR discovered slightly fewer differentially expressed genes responding to malaria than DESeq2; 603 genes during peak parasitemia and 939 during decreasing parasitemia. However, most of the significant genes (88.7%) were shared by both methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv016/-/DC1">supplementary fig.
