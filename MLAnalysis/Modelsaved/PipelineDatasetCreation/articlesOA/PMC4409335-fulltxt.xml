The biosynthesis of most of these SMs strictly depends on nitrogen availability and of the activity of permeases of nitrogen sources, e.g. the ammonium and amino acid permeases. One of the three ammonium permeases, MepB, was recently shown to act not only as a transporter but also as a nitrogen sensor affecting the production of nitrogen-repressed SMs. Here we describe the identification of a general amino acid permease, FfGap1, among the 99 putative amino acid permeases (AAPs) in the genome of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>. FfGap1 is able to fully restore growth of the yeast <italic>gap1&#8710;</italic> mutant on several amino acids including citrulline and tryptophane. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, Gap1 activity is regulated by shuttling between the plasma membrane (nitrogen limiting conditions) and the vacuole (nitrogen sufficiency), which we also show for FfGap1. In yeast, the Npr1 serine/threonine kinase stabilizes the Gap1 position at the plasma membrane. Here, we identified and characterized three <italic>NPR1</italic>-homologous genes, encoding the putative protein kinases FfNpr1-1, FfNpr1-2 and FfNpr1-3 with significant similarity to yeast Npr1. Complementation of the yeast <italic>npr1&#916; </italic>mutant with each of the three <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi NPR1 </italic>homologues, resulted in partial restoration of ammonium, arginine and proline uptake by <italic>FfNPR1-1</italic> while none of the three kinases affect growth on different nitrogen sources and nitrogen-dependent sorting of FfGap1 in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>. However, exchange of the putative ubiquitin-target lysine 9 (K9A) and 15 (K15A) residues of FfGap1 resulted in extended localization to the plasma membrane and increased protein stability independently of nitrogen availability. These data suggest a similar regulation of FfGap1 by nitrogen-dependent ubiquitination, but differences regarding the role of <italic>Fusarium </italic>Npr1 homologues compared to yeast.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by DFG Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), TU101-7, TU101-12, by F.R.S.M.

Therefore, mechanisms of nitrogen sensing and nitrogen-mediated regulation of gene expression are in the focus of our research.</p><p>Uptake and eventually sensing of nitrogen by specific permeases play key roles in nitrogen metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Processes of nitrogen sensing and subsequent transduction of the signal to a nitrogen regulation network have been intensively studied in yeast. Beside the three ammonium permeases Mep1 to Mep3, yeast have about 20 amino acid permeases (AAPs) [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The expression of nitrogen permease-encoding genes such as <italic>GAP1</italic> and the <italic>MEP</italic> genes is negatively influenced by the availability of favored nitrogen sources like glutamine, while poor nitrogen sources such as urea or proline support their transcription in a Gln3 and Gat1-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some of the AAPs have been proposed to play a role as nitrogen sensors, e.g. the non-transporting amino acid carrier homologue Ssy1 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the general amino acid permease Gap1 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yeast Mep2, and its orthologue from <italic>Candida albicans</italic> for instance, are proposed to play a signaling role as they are required for the filamentation process occurring upon nitrogen limitation [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>We have characterized all three ammonium permease-encoding genes in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>, <italic>MEPA</italic>, <italic>MEPB</italic>, and <italic>MEPC</italic>, regarding their participation in ammonium uptake and their potential involvement in signal transduction. The expression of all three genes is strictly regulated by the general nitrogen regulator AreA, the homologue of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> GATA transcription factors Gln3 and Gat1 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Severe growth defects of &#916;<italic>MEPB</italic> mutants on low ammonium medium and deregulation of several nitrogen-repressed genes, such as the GA and bikaverin biosynthetic genes, suggested that MepB could function as an ammonium sensor in addition to its important role in ammonium transport in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic>. However, the mechanism of ammonium sensing by MepB is not yet understood.</p><p>Plasma membrane permease activity can be modulated by transcriptional regulation, control of cell surface protein level and fine-tuning of the inherent transport activity via post-translational modification. In yeast, the serine/threonine protein kinase Npr1 (nitrogen permease reactivator) is a regulator of the activity of permeases of nitrogenous compounds, being required for optimal uptake of nitrogen sources in cells grown on a non-preferred nitrogen source [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Npr1 is thus required for the activity of several permeases including the general amino acid permease Gap1 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the latter case, Npr1 is required to maintain Gap1 at the cytoplasmic membrane by preventing ubiquitination-dependent endocytosis under non-preferred nitrogen supply. In the <italic>npr1</italic> mutant, newly synthesized Gap1 is further directly sorted to the vacuole and never reaches the plasma membrane whatever the quality of the nitrogen supply [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a consequence, the uptake of citrulline, ornithine and tryptophan, all depending on the activity of Gap1, is affected in the <italic>npr1</italic> mutant. Beside the stabilization/destabilization of nitrogen permeases, there seem to be other ways for Npr1 to affect the activity of specific permeases. Npr1 is required for the inherent activity of ammonium transport by Mep1, Mep2 and Mep3, <italic>the</italic> npr1 mutant exhibiting a growth defect on low-ammonium medium similar to that of a mutant lacking the three ammonium permeases [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, contrary to Gap1, plasma membrane localization of the ammonium permease Mep2 is not altered in the &#916;<italic>NPR1</italic> mutant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Under poor nitrogen supply, the Npr1 kinase mediates phosphorylation of the serine residue S457 in the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain of Mep2 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This phosphorylation relieves auto-inhibition and allows Mep2 to adopt an active conformation that enables high ammonium transport capacity. Due to the impairment of uptake of repressing nitrogen sources, a number of genes sensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) are indirectly derepressed in Npr1-lacking cells growing in the presence of sufficient ammonium or glutamine [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The level of Npr1 phosphorylation, and presumably of its activity, is controlled by TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex1) according to the quality of the nitrogen supply [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Treatment of yeast cells with the TORC1-inhibiting drug rapamycin as well as nitrogen starvation promote rapid though not complete dephosphorylation of Npr1, while the protein is hyperphosphorylated in a nitrogen-rich medium [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Not much is known about mechanisms for regulating subcellular localization of nitrogen permeases in filamentous fungi. So far no Npr1-like regulators have been characterized, and therefore, their putative involvement in regulating the activity of any nitrogen permease has not been studied in any filamentous fungus.</p><p>In this work, we identified a homolog of the yeast Gap1, FfGap1, among the 99 annotated putative amino acid permeases in the genome of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> by complementing the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae gap1&#916;</italic> mutant. We show that <italic>FfGAP1</italic> is not expressed in media containing glutamine, and that its transcription strictly depends on the presence of the GATA transcription factor AreA. The FfGap1 protein is localized to the plasma membrane when internal amino acid levels are low. Upon addition of glutamine, the FfGap1-Gfp fusion protein is endocytosed and delivered to the vacuole. To test whether Npr1-like protein kinases are required for stabilization of FfGap1 at the plasma membrane as in yeast, we cloned three homologous genes of <italic>ScNpr1</italic>, <italic>FfNPR1-1</italic>, <italic>FfNPR1-2</italic> and <italic>FfNPR 1&#8211;3</italic>, and studied their role in regulating FfGap1 activity. We show that complementation of the yeast <italic>npr1&#916;</italic> mutant with the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi NPR1-1</italic>, <italic>NPR1-2</italic> and <italic>NPR1-3</italic> genes, respectively, resulted in partial restoration of growth on ammonium, arginine and proline by <italic>FfNPR1-1</italic>. However, the putative serine/threonine kinases had no impact on sorting of FfGap1. Instead, we demonstrate that two conserved lysine residues at the N-terminus of FfGap1 are involved in regulating FfGap1 protein abundance and its sorting to the vacuoles. Point mutations of these lysine residues, K7 and K15, of FfGap1 resulted in prolonged maintenance at the cytoplasmic membrane under high glutamine conditions, probably by preventing ubiquitination-dependent endocytosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of a <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> Gap1 homologue</title><p>In order to identify a potential orthologue of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Gap1, we retrieved 99 predicted amino acid permeases (AAPs) of the recently sequenced genome of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>fujikuroi</italic> IMI 58289 [<xref rid="pone.0125487.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0125487.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).
