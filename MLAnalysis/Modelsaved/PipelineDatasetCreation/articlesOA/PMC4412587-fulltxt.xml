However, current approaches for chondrogenic differentiation of hiPSCs are complicated and inefficient primarily due to intermediate embryoid body formation, which is required to generate endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal cell lineages. We report a new, straightforward and highly efficient approach for chondrogenic differentiation of hiPSCs, which avoids embryoid body formation. We differentiated hiPSCs directly into mesenchymal stem /stromal cells (MSC) and chondrocytes. hiPSC-MSC-derived chondrocytes showed significantly increased Col2A1, GAG, and SOX9 gene expression compared to hiPSC-MSCs. Following transplantation of hiPSC-MSC and hiPSC-MSC-derived chondrocytes into osteochondral defects of arthritic joints of athymic rats, magnetic resonance imaging studies showed gradual engraftment, and histological correlations demonstrated hyaline cartilage matrix production. Results present an efficient and clinically translatable approach for cartilage tissue regeneration via patient-derived hiPSCs, which could improve cartilage regeneration outcomes in arthritic joints.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell</kwd><kwd>Cartilage tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability, affecting about 43 million individuals in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and resulting in significant medical costs and lost wages reaching up to $95 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Permanent articular cartilage defects, characterized by deterioration of the collagen matrix and depletion of aggrecan and type 2 collagen, represent the primary cause of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and are difficult to treat because cartilage cannot self-regenerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To address this problem, chondrocyte and bone marrow derived stem cell transplants have been explored as a therapeutic option for cartilage regeneration. However, both cell types are limited by several drawbacks, including an insufficient number of collectable donor cells, invasiveness of the harvesting procedure, and tendency of these cell types to form undesired fibrocartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Pluripotent stem cells have demonstrated great potential for restoration of desired hyaline cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently, autologous human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), generated from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] using virus independent reprogramming techniques, have been introduced as a clinically applicable source for creation of patient-specific cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unlike allogeneic cells, autologous hiPSCs do not engender immune reactions, and unlike embryonic stem cells, they do not raise ethical concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, hiPSCs overcome limitations associated with autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells, such as invasive harvesting procedures, variable yields, and restricted cartilage regeneration potential of cells obtained from older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>While hiPSCs have shown promise for cartilage defect repair, the complex and inefficient process used to differentiate hiPSCs to cartilage limits the clinical translation of this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The most frequently used technique requires three main steps: (1) formation of suspension embryoid bodies; (2) mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) outgrowth from embryoid bodies; and (3) selection of MSC via cell sorting and induction of chondrogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This approach is highly inefficient, as it leads to a variable number and size of embryoid bodies, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations, and results in unpredictable differentiation to undesired cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We hypothesized that eliminating embryoid body formation as an intermediate step in the differentiation process could reduce generation of unwanted cell lines and improve the yield of chondrocytes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chondrogenic differentiation of hiPSC.

In this method hiPS cells were detached from matrigel coated dish and moved to ultra low attachment culture dish for 5&#160;days to induce the EB formation, then EBs moved to plastic culture dish to select the hMSCs by collecting the outgrowing cells from EB (from day 5 to day 14) after collecting the attached fibroblast-like cells. These cells were cultured for 3&#160;weeks in media containing FBS to prepare the hiPSC-MSCs (day 35 of differentiation).

In contrast to prior work on chondrocyte differentiation, our approach involves direct induction of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) under specific cell culture conditions, followed by classic chondrogenic differentiation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our approach is superior over its predecessors because it bypasses differentiation into undesired cell types. This could be exploited as a framework for more efficient and better controlled design of new cellular therapeutics for cartilage regeneration. Our technique could be also widely applied to other pluripotent stem cells (e.g., ESCs) and other differentiation pathways, beyond our own focus of cartilage regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>hiPSC Culture and Pluripotency Evaluation</title><p>The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research and the Stem Cell Research Oversight (SCRO) Committee at our institution.

After the last MR scan, animals were sacrificed and specimens were processed for postmortem histopathology correlations, which included H&amp;E stains, immunohistochemistry for collagen type II, and Alcian blue stains. ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) visual histological assessment scale was used as a standard histological grading to quantify the extent of cartilage repair (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>ICRS visual histological assessment scale</p></caption></table-wrap></p><p>Engraftment and long term viability of the implanted cells evaluated by human anti-nuclear specific immunofluorescent stain (MAB1281 | Anti-Nuclei Antibody, EmdMillipore) that was performed on the rat knee samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Gene expression levels of original hiPSCs, intermediate hiPSC-derived MSCs as well as chondrogenic pellets at days 0 and 14 of chondrogenic differentiation were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Therefore, we generated hiPS cell lines from human adipose derived stem cells, using the minicircle reprogramming technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For generation of hiPS cell lines from adult human fibroblasts, we used a codon-optimized minicircle plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (Diecke et al. 2014). The pluripotency of the generated hiPSCs was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence staining for NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and TRA-1-60 (pluripotency markers) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In addition, H&amp;E stains of hiPSC-derived teratomas showed differentiation into all three germ layers, including ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).</p><p>To initiate hMSC-induction, undifferentiated hiPSCs were cultured in DMEM high-glucose medium for 5&#160;days, followed by transfer to uncoated polysterene culture flasks, continued culture until 90&#160;% confluency and sub-culture at a ratio of 1:3 until passage 4 (P4).</p><p>The change of mTeSR1<sup>&#8482;</sup>/E8 medium to hMSC medium resulted in a change in cell morphology from dome-shaped hiPSC colonies to elongated and spindle-shaped cells, which spread out from their original colonies. Although the cells demonstrated a heterogeneous morphology on the first and second day of MSC-induction, more than 90&#160;% of the total cell population acquired a fibroblast-like morphology by passage 4, matching the typical morphology of hMSCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). To determine phenotypes and genotypes of hiPSC-derived MSCs, we performed standard microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. The flow cytometry analysis showed that more than 90&#160;% of the cells were positive for the hMSC markers: CD105 (&gt;91&#160;%), CD73 (&gt;96&#160;%), and CD90 (&gt;95&#160;%), and negative for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules (&gt;95&#160;%) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The results showed that hiPSCs are positive for CD90 which is in accordance to other researcher that suggested CD90 as one of the pluripotency markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The cell transplants showed significantly decreasing T2 relaxation times over time (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). This signal effect is an indication for decreasing water content and increasing matrix formation over time and has been associated with successful engraftment as described by Trattnig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. T2-relaxation times of cell implants at 6&#160;weeks post implantation were significantly lower compared to controls with scaffold only implants (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.013) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This corresponded on histopathology to higher cellularity and degradation of the scaffold in the cell transplants compared to scaffold only (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). H&amp;E staining confirmed the engraftment of hiPSC-derived MSC cells and hiPSC-derived chondrogenic differentiated cell pellets in osteochondral defects. hiPSC-derived MSC implants had started to remodel the defect and to produce a chondrogenic matrix, as evidenced by positive Alcian blue stains and positive immunostains for collagen type II (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Our procedure yielded 90&#160;% chondrocytes and successfully repaired osteochondral defects in vivo.</p><p>hiPSCs offer several advantages for cartilage repair over bone marrow-derived MSCs and chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Whereas chondrocytes and most adult stem cells such as hMSC and adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) show decreasing proliferation and differentiation potential after 4 passages in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], while undifferentiated hiPSCs can be expanded indefinitely. This allows for the generation of a high quantity of differentiated progeny for high-throughput analysis before their transplantation into patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Embryonic stem cells are the only other cell type with a similar capacity for proliferation. However, the allogeneic nature of embryonic stem cells may generate immune reactions, which limits their potential for clinical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By contrast, hiPSCs from minimally invasive sources such as skin fibroblasts or fat cells allow for generation of autologous engineered tissues, even from elderly patients typically suffering from OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Despite their potential advantages, the use of hiPSCs for cartilage repair has been limited because of the inefficiency and complexity of standard chondrogenic differentiation processes. Standard protocols require co-culture of hiPSCs with chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which requires a surgery for chondrocyte harvest, as well as culture of hiPSCs in complex differentiation media, which contain multiple growth factors with unclear in vivo effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, the standard hiPSC differentiation approach via embryoid body formation gives rise to heterogeneous cell populations and unpredictable differentiation outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Mesenchymal lineage selection from embryoid bodies is laborious and costly, providing comparatively low yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Other investigators explored approaches for hiPSC differentiation without embryoid body formation by culturing hiPSCs as micromass formation (Saitta et al., 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], under pellet culture conditions (Phillips et al., 2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and using specific media on modified/coated culture flasks and/or on feeder-layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These methods may impede clinical translations by interfering with biomechanical properties of the substrate, suppressing cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], negatively affecting related signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], using viral vectors to produce iPS cells, risk of mixing feeder layer cells with final cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], or increasing costs compared to standard techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Chen et al. reported that hiPSC incubation with SB431542 (a specific inhibitor of TGF-&#946; receptor kinase) in two-dimensional cultures enabled MSC conversion without embryoid body formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, their method required an intermediate step of epithelial differentiation and the clinical safety and efficacy of SB431542 are not yet established. By comparison, our method does not require the use of a feeder-layer or coating, does not involve either embryoid body formation or an endothelial conversion step, and requires no additional chemicals to differentiate the cells towards mesenchymal lineage.</p><p>We recognize several limitations of our study. Firstly, we observed some components of fibrocartilage and hypertrophic cartilage in our in vitro differentiation samples, which needs to be improved for future use by optimizing the in vitro chondrogenic differentiation induction method (e.g. by using different combination of growth factors).. We also used fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a supplement for cell culture, which may increase the risk of cell transformation and prion diseases. Substitution with fully defined serum-free media as described by Yamasaki et al. will increase the safety of our method for clinical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although we did not observe teratoma formations in our cell transplants, hiPSCs and hiPSC-derived progenies may have tumor potency in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In a clinical setting, careful phenotyping of hiPSC-derived transplants will be necessary before implantation. To reduce the potential for tumorigenic outgrow of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes, we used the integration- and viral-free minicircle reprogramming technique. Although the reprogramming efficiency of this technique is relatively low, it prevents the potential reactivation of the pluripotency factors described for viral-derived hiPSCs and therefore lowers the risk of subsequent tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have developed a novel and clinically applicable approach for cartilage tissue regeneration via direct differentiation of patient-specific hiPSCs to hMSCs, without embryoid body formation. This approach could be widely used for more efficient and better controlled design of new cellular therapeutics for cartilage regeneration, thereby ultimately restoring articular cartilage function in patients with OA and decreasing associated morbidities. In the future, this technique could be applied for many other tissue regeneration applications, beyond our own focus on cartilage regeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases NIH R21AR059861-01 and 2R01AR054458-05 (HEDL) and NIH R01 HL113006 and NIH U01 HL099776 (JCW).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors indicate no potential conflicts of interest.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Egloff</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hugle</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Valderrabano</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biomechanics and pathomechanisms of osteoarthritis</article-title><source>Swiss Medical Weekly</source><year>2012</year><volume>142</volume><fpage>w13583</fpage><?supplied-pmid 22815119?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22815119</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elders</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The increasing impact of arthritis on public health</article-title><source>The Journal of Rheumatology.
