This enzyme has not been well studied in the Indian water buffalo, an important species known for disease resistance and high milk production. In this study, the primary coding sequence (5,778 bp) of bubaline dicer (GenBank: AB969677.1) was determined and the bubaline Dicer1 biocomputationally characterized to determine the phylogenetic signature among higher eukaryotes. The evolutionary tree revealed that all the transcript variants of Dicer1 belonging to a specific species were within the same node and the sequences belonging to primates, rodents and lagomorphs, avians and reptiles formed independent clusters. The bubaline dicer1 is closely related to that of cattle and other ruminants and significantly divergent from dicer of lower species such as tapeworm, sea urchin and fruit fly. Evolutionary divergence analysis conducted using MEGA6 software indicated that dicer has undergone purifying selection over the time. Seventeen divergent sequences, representing each of the families/taxa were selected to study the specific regions of positive vis-&#224;-vis negative selection using different models like single likelihood ancestor counting, fixed effects likelihood, and random effects likelihood of Datamonkey server. Comparative analysis of the domain structure revealed that Dicer1 is conserved across mammalian species while variation both in terms of length of Dicer enzyme and presence or absence of domain is evident in the lower organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bubaline</kwd><kwd>Dicer</kwd><kwd>Phylogeny</kwd><kwd>Selection Pressure</kwd><kwd>Ribonuclease III Domain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dicer belongs to family of ribonuclease type III (RNase III) enzyme that plays an important role in the biosynthesis of miRNA by cleaving the pre-miRNA into mature double-stranded miRNA (ds-miRNA) of ~21 nucleotide length. Structurally, Dicer1 has mainly two RNase III domains along with helicase and Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ) domains. However, the complexity of the domains varies among divergent organisms. Dicer protein is present in most of the eukaryotes with the exception of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (brewer&#8217;s yeast). Single copy of Dicer gene occurs in nematodes (<italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> sp.), mammals and poikilothermic vertebrates. Fungi (e.g. <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>), insects (e.g., Drosophila and mosquito; <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), and possibly all arthropods encode two Dicer genes, Dicer-1 (<italic>Dcr1</italic>) and Dicer-2 (<italic>Dcr2</italic>), which are involved in processing pre-miRNA for association with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and siRNA production in the RNAi pathway, respectively (<xref rid="b12-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Plants (e.g. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, poplar, rice etc.) encode four Dicer homologues (Dcl-1 to 4), each having specialized functions. Dcl-1 (processes mature miRNA), Dcl-3 (generates siRNA), and Dcl-4 (trans-acting siRNA biogenesis), each contains two double stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs), while Dcl-2 (produces siRNA against viral infection) contains only one dsRBD (<xref rid="b10-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Kurihara and Watanabe, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b4-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Gasciolli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b25-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although Dicer enzyme have been well characterized in human and plants but reports on bovine Dicer1 sequence and expression as well as its evolutionary studies are in vogue.

Besides, no report is available on biocomputational analysis of bubaline Dicer1 coding sequence with regard to its evolutionary perspectives.

The evolutionary tree demonstrated that all the transcript variants of Dicer1 belonging to a specific species were coming within the same node. It was observed that sequences belonging to same family or order were forming a cluster; therefore, these sequences were merged and represented by same leaf (terminal OTU) for better resolution of the phylogeny. The bubaline Dicer1 sequence (including the transcript variants) formed one clad with that of cattle and yak (bootstrap value 92). Higher bootstrap value (100) is observed among the ruminants (viz. buffaloes, cattle, yak and sheep, goat, antelope), indicating higher consistency of the given data for taxonomical bipartitioning (Hedges, 1992). Bootstrap values do not indicate how accurate the tree is, however, it indicates the stability of the branching pattern. In the present study, the higher bootstrap values of the branches of avian with reptiles (bootstrap value 96); and the mammals, avians, reptiles with that of other species like, <italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic> (Tasmanian devil, a carnivorous marsupial ), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (African clawed frog), Western clawed frog, <italic>Latimeria chalumnae</italic> (West Indian Ocean coelacanth), <italic>Ctenopharyn godonidella</italic> (Grass carp), zebra fish, <italic>Hymenolepis microstoma</italic> (Rodent tapeworm)) (bootstrap value 98) clearly signify the stability of branching pattern.</p><p>Another phylogenetic tree was constructed using the seventeen divergent sequences, each representing a class/order, for comprehensible interpretation (<xref rid="f4-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) of the previous result.

The prawn and shrimp formed a clad separate from that of insects (mosquito and plant hopper). Fruit fly Dicer2 is the most distantly related from all the species as depicted by a separate node.

The heat map color bar ranged from white-black, indicating lowest to highest rate of evolutionary divergence. It was observed that evolutionary divergence was lower (indicated by white color) among all mammalian species and also between prawn and shrimp, while species belonging to lower class showed intermediatary divergence (grey color) with other species. Maximum divergence (dark grey-blak color) was observed between fruitfly and other species. Among the ruminant species, evolutionary divergence of Dicer1 enzyme is very less as evident by the maximum value of 0.022 for camel (i.e. a pseudo-ruminant) and cattle.

Thicker branches have been classified as undergoing episodic diversifying selection by the sequential likelihood ratio test at corrected p&#8804;0.05.</p><p>Previous studies have found that antiviral Dicer2 is under intense positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster and across the Drosophila phylogeny (<xref rid="b19-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Obbard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b6-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Heger and Ponting, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b9-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Kolaczkowski et al., 2011</xref>). A study conducted by <xref rid="b15-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al. (2012)</xref> established that Dicer2 DEAD (Aspartate-Glutamate-Alanine-Aspartate) box protein/Helicase and PAZ domains have experienced positive selection in flies using branch-sites analyses to identify adaptive protein-coding changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Domain architecture of dicer enzyme</title><p>The important domains and their location in dicer enzyme among the divergent animal species have been compared (<xref rid="f9-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). For the graphical representation, the longer domain of DEAD-like helicases superfamily (DEXDc) have been considered among all the species and for rest of the domains the limits mentioned in the flat-file has been considered as the respective domain length ignoring the possible larger length. The two domains RIBOc 2 and Double-stranded RNA binding motif are located within the dsRNA-specific ribonuclease (RNC). The domains i.e. PAZ and two ribonuclease (RIBOc1 and RIBOc2) are present is all the species. The DEXDc domain is present in most of the species expect Japanese tiger prawn and Black tiger shrimp. It is clearly seen that the domain architecture, i.e. length and position of the various domains, is same in mammalian dicer enzyme. Whereas, in lower organisms there is more variation both in terms of size (amino acid count) of dicer enzyme as well as organization of the domains. It may be concluded that dicer enzyme have gradually evolved from lower organism with more variation to a much stable form in mammalian species.</p><p>Variation in the domain architecture of Dicer-like proteins in species belonging to five eukaryotic supergroups have been demonstrated by <xref rid="b2-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Cerutti and Casas-Mollano (2006)</xref>, with only two RNase III catalytic motifs of Dicer domains being predominantly conserved as a fusion across the eukaryotic spectrum. <xref rid="b15-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al. (2012)</xref> also identified key changes in Dicer domain architecture and sequence leading to specialization in either gene-regulatory or protective functions in animal and plant paralogs. The organization of the functional domains of the Dicer family has been studied by <xref rid="b3-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. (2014)</xref>, among the invertebrate organisms. The study found significant variability in domain organization with <italic>Taenia solium</italic> Dicer2 processing only one RNase III domain; the loss of the DEAD domain in Dicer1 of mollusks, annelids, platyhelminths and most arthropods; and the absence of the PAZ domain in Dicer2 sequences of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (platyhelminth) and <italic>T. adhaerens</italic> (metazoa) species.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid composition</title><p>The frequency of the amino acids in Dicer enzyme across the 17 divergent sequences has been graphically represented as Heatmap (<xref rid="f10-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). Glutamine and Leucine showed maximum proportion in Dicer enzyme across all the sequence while tryptophan was present in lowest proportion. The t-test between the bubaline dicer composition and other 16 species revealed no difference (p = 1.00). It suggests that the Dicer enzyme can be considered one of the most conserved enzyme among animals, however, some difference in amino acid composition is evident from the heatmap (<xref rid="f10-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>) of amino acid composition.</p><p><xref rid="b5-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Graur (1985)</xref> found high correlation between the rate of amino acid substitution of a protein and its amino acid composition, by analysing mammalian genes, and proposed that composition is the main factor in determining the rate of evolution of proteins, whereas functional constraints have only a minor effect. However, <xref rid="b23-ajas-28-6-876" ref-type="bibr">Tourasse and Li (2000)</xref> showed that rate of protein evolution is only weakly affected by amino acid composition but is mostly determined by the strength of functional requirements or selective constraints. Therefore, regions or individual sites critical for the function within a given protein, such as catalytic sites or binding domains, are generally better conserved than the rest of the molecule. In the present study also the various domains of bubaline Dicer are found to be highly conserved among the divergent animal species.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>IMPLICATIONS</title><p>Evolutionary studies provided the evidence of purifying selection in the Dicer enzyme among the animal species. The primary coding sequences of bubaline Dicer would further be useful to carryout expression studies in the buffaloes and domains architecture of bubaline Dicer revealed in this study may be used for its biochemical and functional characterization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thankfully acknowledge the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, for providing the funds (SR/FT/LS-22/2011) to conduct the research work.
