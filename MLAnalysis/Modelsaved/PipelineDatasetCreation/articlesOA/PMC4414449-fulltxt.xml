However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the responses to ozone of two rice (<italic>Oryza Sativa</italic> L.) cultivars, Sasanishiki and Habataki. Sasanishiki showed ozone-induced leaf injury, but no grain yield loss. By contrast, Habataki showed grain yield loss with minimal leaf injury. A QTL associated with grain yield loss caused by ozone was identified in Sasanishiki/Habataki chromosome segment substitution lines and included the <italic>ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1)</italic> gene. The Habataki allele of the <italic>APO1</italic> locus in a near-isogenic line also resulted in grain yield loss upon ozone exposure, suggesting <italic>APO1</italic> involvement in ozone-induced yield loss. Only a few differences in the APO1 amino acid sequences were detected between the cultivars, but the <italic>APO1</italic> transcript level was oppositely regulated by ozone exposure: i.e., it increased in Sasanishiki and decreased in Habataki. Interestingly, the levels of some phytohormones (jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, and abscisic acid) known to be involved in attenuation of ozone-induced leaf injury tended to decrease in Sasanishiki but to increase in Habataki upon ozone exposure. These data indicate that ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki is caused by a reduction in the <italic>APO1</italic> transcript level through an increase in the levels of phytohormones that reduce leaf damage.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Global Environment Research Fund (A-0806) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan to YK and MT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.env.go.jp/policy/kenkyu/suishin/english/index.html">http://www.env.go.jp/policy/kenkyu/suishin/english/index.html</ext-link>), and by the Japan Advanced Plant Science Network.

Its concentration has increased markedly since the turn of the past century [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is predicted that the concentration will continue to increase in Eastern Asia until 2020, where it may trigger up to 40% crop yield loss [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Acute exposure to ozone results in foliar lesions such as chlorosis and necrosis and induces a variety of biochemical and physiological responses in plants [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ozone enters the leaves through the stomata, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through an oxidative burst [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ROS induce programmed cell death with a result that resembles the hypersensitive response provoked by pathogen infection [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Yield loss in ozone-exposed crops is thought to be triggered by a reduction in photosynthetic activity and by growth inhibition caused by leaf injury [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123308.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The latter has been assessed in this context in many rice cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the mechanism of leaf damage induction has been clarified: for instance, two QTLs associated with leaf bronzing identified using two rice cultivars Nipponbare (ozone-sensitive <italic>japonica</italic> cultivar) and Kasalath (ozone-tolerant <italic>indica</italic> cultivar) differed significantly in leaf ascorbic acid content when exposed to ozone, suggesting ascorbic acid as a principal antioxidant counteracting ozone-induced oxidative damage [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the degree of visible ozone-induced leaf injury does not correlate with grain yield reduction in 20 rice cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting that ozone-induced grain yield loss in rice may not be accounted for by the reduction in photosynthetic activity caused by leaf damage. Several genes involved in rice grain yield have been identified by quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, the transcript level of the cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase gene (<italic>Gn1a/OsCKX2</italic>) in inflorescence meristems regulates the number of reproductive organs and grain yield [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>GW2</italic>, encoding a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, controls rice grain width and weight; GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) for proteasomal degradation [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yet despite the identification of several such genes, genes involved in ozone-induced grain yield loss in rice have not been identified, although the QTL associated with relative dry weight was found using two cultivars Nipponbare and Kasalath, which this QTL exhibited a less reduced net photosynthetic rate under ozone exposure compared with Nipponbare [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The objectives of this study were to identify QTLs associated with rice grain yield loss under elevated ozone by using Sasanishiki/Habataki chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). One year QTL analysis showed that a QTL associated with rice grain yield loss by ozone-exposure was located on chromosome 6 [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we carried out further experiments and show that the <italic>ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1</italic> (<italic>APO1</italic>) gene, known to control panicle branching in rice, has important role for ozone-induced grain yield loss. Ozone induces suppression of <italic>APO1</italic> expression during panicle formation, resulting in a reduction in the number of panicle branches and eventually in grain yield. We also carried out further and to clarify how ozone stress-induced signaling regulates grain yield by affecting early morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>To detect QTLs associated with ozone-induced grain yield loss, we used a mapping population consisting of 39 CSSLs developed from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) cultivars Sasanishiki (<italic>japonica</italic> cultivar, recurrent parent) and Habataki (<italic>indica</italic> cultivar, donor parent) [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Seeds were sown in plastic boxes (28 cm &#215; 21 cm &#215; 9 cm; 80 plants per box) filled with seedbed soil, and the seedlings were grown in a glasshouse under ambient air at the Akagi Testing Center of the Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry (Gunma Prefecture, Japan, 36&#176;28&#8242; N, 139&#176;11&#8242; E, 540 m above sea level). Six weeks after sowing, the seedlings were transplanted into pots (0.05 m<sup>2</sup> surface area and 0.015 m<sup>3</sup> volume; four plants per pot) and grown in glasshouses (five pots of each line per glasshouse) under ambient air or elevated ozone. For the latter treatment, artificially generated ozone was added to ambient air via a mass flow controller. Plants were grown until harvest from 10 April to 25 September 2009 and from 28 April to 28 September 2010. The mean ozone concentrations during the daytime (6:00 to 18:00) were 32.0 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2009 and 43.7 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2010 in ambient air, and 76.5 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2009 and 85.7 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2010 in ozone-supplemented air (Fig A in <xref rid="pone.0123308.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Average of air temperature, relative humidity and light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation) in both glasshouses were not significantly difference throughout growing period in 2009 and 2010 (data not shown). For total RNA isolation, plants were pulled from the pots at 23 and 10 days before heading, and leaves, roots, young panicles (~5 cm long) and inflorescence meristems (~1 cm long) enclosed by the leaf sheath were frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C. Further research on Habataki-genotype <italic>APO1</italic> gene were carried out using the progenies of 04SHA422-12-8.8&#8211;18.31 [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Of these, SHA422-1.1 contains Habataki-genotype of <italic>APO1</italic> gene, and SHA422-1.3 has Sasanishiki-genotype of <italic>APO1</italic> gene. The SHA422-1.1, SHA422-1.3, Sasanishiki and Habataki were grown in an open-top chamber (five pots of each line per chamber) under charcoal-filtered air or elevated ozone from 13 May until harvest on 30 September 2011. The mean ozone concentration during the daytime (6:00 to 18:00) was 6.0 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in charcoal-filtered and 67.0 nL L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in ozone-supplemented air (data not shown). Mean temperature and relative humidity in the open-top chamber were 22.8&#8211;24.2&#176;C and 80&#8211;84.7%, respectively.

Twenty-six, 650, 480, and 275 genes were identified by above criteria from subset 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and these were classified into 137, 617, 582 and 279 attributions by their gene ontology (GO).

No GO was identified in subset 1 by this criterion. Genes responsive to oxidative stress were mainly detected in subset 2 (data not shown).

The QTL had a positive effect on grain yield under ambient air in Habataki; this positive effect was not detected under elevated ozone [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the QTL on chromosome 6 appears to be involved in ozone-induced grain yield loss. While narrowing down the position of the QTL for grain yield loss caused by ozone, we found a locus near RM3430 on chromosome 6 which may be involved in the decrease in the number of primary rachis branches under elevated ozone. RM3430 was located close to <italic>APO1</italic>, which is known to affect rice grain yield through regulation of primary rachis branch formation [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, SHA422-1.1, in which <italic>APO1</italic> is the only gene substituted with a Habataki allele in the Sasanishiki background [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], showed a reduction in grain yield and in the number of primary rachis branches under elevated ozone (Fig <xref rid="pone.0123308.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123308.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). In addition, contribution of <italic>APO1</italic> locus in decrease of grain yield and number of primary rachis branches under elevated ozone were calculated as 57.8% and 66.7%, respectively (data not shown). These data indicate that ozone-induced reduction in grain yield and in primary rachis branch number is mainly controlled by the <italic>APO1</italic> locus of Habataki, although entire of ozone-induced grain yield loss is not explained with a locus.</p><p>APO1 amino acid sequences and homology modeling of the functional domain (F-box domain; Fig B in <xref rid="pone.0123308.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) suggested that no differences for primary structure of the protein were between Sasanishiki and Habataki. The <italic>APO1</italic> transcript level in inflorescence meristems was suppressed by elevated ozone in Habataki but not in Sasanishiki. Such reduction was also observed in young panicles of Habataki [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that in Habataki, ozone-induced reduction of <italic>APO1</italic> expression in inflorescence meristems (rather than the differences in the APO1 primary structures) might reduce the number of primary rachis branches, resulting in low grain yield. Ozone-induced reduction of <italic>APO1</italic> expression (Fig C in <xref rid="pone.0123308.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), grain yield and number of primary rachis branches in SHA422.1.1 (Fig <xref rid="pone.0123308.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123308.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), which has Habataki-genotype of <italic>APO1</italic> locus, may support the suggestion. The absence of such reduction in <italic>APO1</italic> expression in Sasanishiki is consistent with the absence of any effect of ozone on grain yield or on the number of primary rachis branches in this cultivar.</p><p>The F-box domain is often found in phytohormone receptors such as TIR1, COI1, SLY1, and EBF1/2 (receptors for auxin, JA, GA, and ethylene, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

However, in this study we found that ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the number of primary rachis branches. Treatment with methyl jasmonate decreases grain yield and the number of primary rachis branches in rice [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is likely that the increase in JA or JA-Ile in ozone-exposed Habataki may suppress <italic>APO1</italic> expression in inflorescence meristems, resulting in grain yield loss in this cultivar. Although the role of JA in regulating rice spikelet development has been investigated [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of <italic>APO1</italic> regulation by the JA pathway under elevated ozone.</p><p>JAs generated upon ozone exposure in leaves attenuate ozone-induced leaf injury [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is consistent with our findings that ozone-induced leaf damage was suppressed in Habataki, which had high levels of leaf JAs (<xref rid="pone.0123308.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the content of JA, JA-Ile, and ABA in flag leaves was 2&#8211;10 times that in inflorescence meristems (<xref rid="pone.0123308.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These data indicate that JAs generated in Habataki leaves reduce ozone-induced leaf injury, and may also suppress <italic>APO1</italic> expression in inflorescence meristems. By contrast, the effect of <italic>APO1</italic> suppression alone is not completely explains ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki. According to our result shown here, two hypothetical pathways of grain yield loss in ozone-exposed rice are considered; (1) ozone suppresses <italic>APO1</italic> expression directly or through JAs and ABA signaling, and (2) JAs (and ABA) signaling suppress phase transition of rachis meristem to primary and secondary branch meristems that is independently occurred to <italic>APO1</italic> suppression. As described, contribution of <italic>APO1</italic> in ozone-induced reduction of grain yield in Habataki was estimated as 58%, suggesting JAs and ABA have the potential of substantial portion of residual 42% impacts for ozone-induced grain yield reduction. Taken together, our findings suggest the following model of ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki (<xref rid="pone.0123308.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Upon plant exposure to elevated ozone during the panicle formation stage, JAs and ABA are generated in leaves to attenuate leaf injury: unfortunately the ABA-mediated mechanism remain unclearly, ABA may (indirectly) attenuate ROS production [<xref rid="pone.0123308.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Ozone signal(s) suppress <italic>APO1</italic> expression directly, or these phytohormones translocate to inflorescence meristems and suppress <italic>APO1</italic> expression presumably, resulting in a reduction in the number of primary rachis branches and eventually in grain yield.</p><fig id="pone.0123308.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0123308.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>A hypothetical model of ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki.</title><p>(A) Panicle formation flow under ambient air condition.

The transcript level is higher in Habataki than Sasanishiki, this is the reason Habataki is high-yielding cultivar. (B) Ozone enters leaves through stomata and generates ROS, which triggers generation of JAs and ABA in leaves to attenuate leaf damage. ROS signaling suppress the <italic>APO1</italic> transcript level directly or indirectly in Habataki. In parallel, phytohormones generated in leaves might be translocated to inflorescence meristems through the phloem. These impacts suppress differentiation of the RM into the PBM and SBM.
