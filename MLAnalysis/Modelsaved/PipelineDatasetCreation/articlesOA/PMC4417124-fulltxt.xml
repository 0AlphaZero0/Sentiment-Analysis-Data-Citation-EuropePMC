Anti-PD-1 antibodies have now been approved for the treatment of melanoma, and are being clinically tested in a number of other tumor types as both a monotherapy and as part of combination regimens. Here, we report the development of DNA aptamers as synthetic, nonimmunogenic antibody mimics, which bind specifically to the murine extracellular domain of PD-1 and block the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction. One such aptamer, MP7, functionally inhibits the PD-L1-mediated suppression of IL-2 secretion in primary T-cells. A PEGylated form of MP7 retains the ability to block the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction, and significantly suppresses the growth of PD-L1+ colon carcinoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic> with a potency equivalent to an antagonistic anti-PD-1 antibody. Importantly, the anti-PD-1 DNA aptamer treatment was not associated with off-target TLR-9-related immune responses. Due to the inherent advantages of aptamers including their lack of immunogenicity, low cost, long shelf life, and ease of synthesis, PD-1 antagonistic aptamers may represent an attractive alternative over antibody-based anti PD-1 therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>DNA aptamer</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>PD-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer cells evade immune surveillance through multiple mechanisms including increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (<italic>i.e.</italic>, interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor growth factor (TGF)-&#946;), reduced expression of major histocompatibility antigens on their cell surface, the enhanced differentiation of immune effector cells to a regulatory phenotype, as well as an influx of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor associated macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Importantly, tumors also limit immune responses by activating immune inhibitory checkpoint pathways by the cell surface expression of coinhibitory ligands (<italic>i.e.</italic>, PD-L1, B7-H4, VISTA) within the tumor microenviroment which bind to paired coinhibitory receptors on infiltrating effector T-cells and limit antitumor immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The combined action of all these mechanisms results in the creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that explains in part the lack of clinical effectiveness of present-day cancer vaccines aimed at generating tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p><p>One key immune inhibitory pathway involves PD-1 interacting with either PD-L1 or PD-L2 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>).

Five rounds of enrichment were performed consisting of a selection step towards mPD-1.FcHIS and a counter selection step toward an irrelevant isotype matched hIgG. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed on the enriched sublibrary of DNA oligonucleotides, revealing a significant enrichment of aptamer families harboring sequences with high sequence identity to a parental highly enriched sequence. Specifically, the two highest enriched sequence families called MP5 and MP7 (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>) were observed to be present at 11.7 and 13% respectively of the total sequences before a substantial decrease in enrichment (&lt;1%) was observed for another family MP23. A pull down experiment was performed where biotinylated versions of these aptamers immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin beads was used to immunoprecipitate mPD-1.FcHIS, confirming that these sequences were enriched from the bulk library during selection due to their ability to bind mPD-1.FcHIS (<bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Anti-PD-1 DNA aptamers MP5 and MP7 bind to mPD-1.FcHIS with nanomolar affinity</title><p>The highest enriched parental sequences MP5 and MP7 were chosen for further evaluation.

Additionally, fluorescently labeled versions of MP5 and MP7 as well as two anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, but not cSeq or isotype control antibodies, bound to PD-1 expressed on the surface of P815 mouse mastocytoma cells (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>). Apparent avidity constants for the aptamer-mPD-1 interaction were determined by SPR to be &lt;1 nmol/l for both MP5 and MP7 as they reflect the nonphysiological, bivalent binding of the mPD-1.FcHIS chimera to the aptamers immobilized on the solid surface (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Aptamer MP7 functionally antagonizes PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression</title><p>An IL-2-based enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was performed to determine if aptamers MP5 or MP7 functionally antagonize PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in primary cells.

Addition of aptamer MP7 (250 nmol/l) or a known blocking anti-PD-1 antibody (RMPI-14 mAb) to the culture, but not a control aptamer sequence (cSeq) nor MP5, significantly restored IL-2 secretion in the presence of PD-L1.Fc (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref></bold>). Importantly, addition of MP7 to splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 in the absence of PD-L1 did not increase the amount of IL-2 secretion above that of anti-CD3 stimulus alone (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold>) suggesting that the increase in IL-2 in the presence of PD-L1 is due to the specific blocking of the PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitory signal.

Consistent with the IL-2 ELISPOT experiments, both PEG-MP7 and RMPI-14 mAb were able to significantly block &gt;75% of PD-1/PD-L1 binding in this assay confirming that aptamer MP7 functions as a PD-1 antagonist (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref></bold>). In contrast, neither an isotype matched antibody nor PEG-MP5 inhibited PD-1 binding to PD-L1 while the cSeq weakly blocks ~20% of the interaction, a value that is not statistically significant in comparison to wells where no aptamer was added.

Consistent with previous studies using MC38 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> we found that MC38.CEA cells express low basal levels of PD-L1, which is upregulated 10-fold by stimulation with IFN&#947; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref></bold>).

The CpG ODN significantly increased serum levels of TNF&#945; and IL-6, meanwhile PEG-MP7 did not induce cytokine production to levels that are detectable by these assays, excluding the possibility of this aptamer behaving as a strong TLR9 agonist (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref></bold>,<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">c</xref></bold>).

In contrast to aptamer MP5 which did not block PD-L1 induced signal despite its ability to bind PD-1, aptamer MP7 was found to inhibit PD-L1 mediated immunosuppression (<italic>i.e.</italic>, suppression of IL2 secretion in response to polyclonal anti-CD3 stimulus) on primary T-cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>), and was also able to antagonize direct PD-1/PD-L1 binding in a competitive ELISA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure S5</bold>). A major disadvantage of aptamers as therapeutic entities is their poor pharmacokinetic profiles, as these short DNA strands are rapidly removed from circulation due to renal filtration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> However, the conjugation of aptamers to high molecular weight polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been reported to dramatically increase their half-life up to 24&#8211;48 hours in some cases. Thus, a 40&#8201;kDa PEG moiety was attached to the 5' amino end of MP7, the most effective PD-1 antagonistic aptamer in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, with a view to evaluate its therapeutic potential <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure S4</bold>). Finally, the ability of PEG-MP7 to restore antitumor immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic> and slow growth of disseminated tumors was illustrated in a syngeneic mouse model using immunocompetent animals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></bold>). In this model, we monitored the growth of murine MC38 colon carcinoma cells in syngeneic mice, a model in which tumor growth has been previously reported to be susceptible to PD-1 blockade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> However, to improve antigenic immune responses provoked by PD-1 blockade as a monotherapy, we used MC38 cells transfected to stably express human carcinoembryonic antigen (MC38.CEA cells) as a heterologous tumor antigen. Similar to MC38 cells, the MC38.CEA cells retained low basal levels of PD-L1 expression which is upregulated by inflammatory stimuli (<italic>i.e.</italic>, IFN&#947;). Notably, treatment of animals with PEG-MP7 reduced tumor burden to a similar extent as a known antagonistic antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref></bold>,<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">e</xref></bold>). Lastly, aptamer MP7 did not reduce tumor burden due to a direct cytotoxic effect toward tumor cells, nor through an off-target TLR9 innate immune triggering (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that DNA aptamers directed at PD-1 are capable of antagonizing PD-L1 signaling, and similar to antibodies, can provoke strong antitumor immune responses to eradicate aggressive disseminated tumors. In addition to PD-1, we and others have developed functional aptamers (acting as agonists or as antagonists) to other immune regulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), 4-1BB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>, CD28 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), TNF&#945;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>, and CD200R1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Importantly, we have demonstrated for CD200R1 agonistic aptamers that PEGylation can readily improve the therapeutic potential by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of aptamers, readily addressing a past limitation associated with their <italic>in vivo</italic> use. Future studies are ongoing to identify human-specific anti-PD-1 aptamers and to determine and optimize the <italic>in vivo</italic> biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of these reagents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>Mice and tumor cell line.</italic> C57BL/6 mice (6&#8211;12 weeks old) were kept under pathogen-free conditions at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center Comparative Research Animal facility.

Subsequently, the counter-selected library was incubated with recombinant mPD-1.FcHIS immobilized on the Ni-Particles for 1 hour at 37 &#176;C in binding buffer. After three washes, bound aptamers were eluted by denaturation at 95 &#176;C for 5 minutes.

Five rounds of SELEX were carried forward as described above, each round consisting of counter selection to both the MagneHIS particles and human IgG followed by selection to mPD-1.FcHIS. Selection stringency was increased by halving the concentration of mPD-1.FcHIS from 10 &#181;g/cycle during rounds 1&#8211;3 to 5 &#181;g/cycle in the remaining rounds, and by increasing wash time from 10 to 15 minutes after cycle 2.</p><p><italic>NGS.</italic> To identify sequences after five rounds of selection, adaptor sequences were ligated to the enriched library using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies) and NGS performed using Ion Torrent PGM (SRI Genomics Core Facility) with the Ion 314 chip (Life Technologies) and data processed using Galaxy and FASTAaptamer software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Nitrocellulose filter binding assay.</italic> The binding affinity of selected aptamers toward mPD-1.FcHIS was determined using a double membrane filter binding assay as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Briefly, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled aptamers were incubated with a serial dilutions of mPD-1.FcHIS prepared in selection buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 &#176;C for 1 hour before being filtered through a double membrane system.

C57BL/6 splenocytes (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were cultured in microtiter wells precoated with anti-IL2 capture antibody, anti-CD3 antibody (1 &#181;g/ml) and either mPD-L1.Fc (15 &#181;g/ml) or an irrelevant hIgG-Fc isotype control (15 &#181;g/ml).

Recombinant mPD-L1.Fc (3 &#181;g/ml) precoated onto wells of a 96-well microtiter plate was incubated with recombinant mPD-1.FcHIS (3 &#181;g/ml, 130 nmol/l) in competition with aptamer (2.5 &#181;mol/l) or antibody (1 &#181;mol/l) and bound mPD-1.FcHis detected using an anti-HIS HRP antibody followed by color development with TMB as substrate.
