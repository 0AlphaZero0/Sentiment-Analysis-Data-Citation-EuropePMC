druggability targets such as protein-protein interactions, has been widely discussed.
There is little information, however, to guide the design of macrocycles for good target
protein-binding activity or bioavailability. To address this knowledge gap we analyze the
binding modes of a representative set of macrocycle-protein complexes. The results,
combined with consideration of the physicochemical properties of approved macrocyclic
drugs, allow us to propose specific guidelines for the design of synthetic macrocycles
libraries possessing structural and physicochemical features likely to favor strong
binding to protein targets and also good bioavailability. We additionally provide evidence
that large, natural product derived macrocycles can bind to targets that are not druggable
by conventional, drug-like compounds, supporting the notion that natural product inspired
synthetic macrocycles can expand the number of proteins that are druggable by synthetic
small molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>druglikeness</kwd><kwd>druggability</kwd><kwd>ligand efficiency</kwd><kwd>binding mode</kwd><kwd>macrocyclic drugs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">It has been estimated that, of the ~3000 human proteins with potential
utility as drug targets, only a minority are addressable using current approaches for small
molecule drug discovery<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. There is
consequently great interest in developing approaches for identifying therapeutically useful
inhibitors for the large number of targets that are not conventionally
&#8220;druggable&#8221;, such as protein-protein interfaces (PPI)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.
Two decades of experience applying fragment-based lead identification methods has shown that
the difficulty with PPI targets is not simply that drug-like compounds that can bind them
are rare and require more powerful screening strategies, but rather reflects an
intrinsically low propensity to bind small druglike molecules with high affinity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Thus, although a number of druglike inhibitors
of PPI targets have been reported<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
attention is increasingly turning to exploration of compound classes that fall outside
conventional definitions of druglikeness<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The search for
suitable new chemotypes is complicated by the need to consider not only their potential to
bind strongly and specifically to their intended target, but also whether they are likely to
possess the properties required for pharmacological activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, such
as good solubility, the ability to penetrate cell membranes to access intracellular targets,
and resistance to metabolic degradation.</p><p id="P4">Synthetic macrocycles have received growing attention for their potential as drugs,
due in large part to their proposed utility against low druggability targets<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This interest was initially sparked by the observation that natural
product-derived drugs often violate conventional definitions of druglikeness, suggesting
that they identify distinct regions of chemical space that represent alternative solutions
to the challenge of achieving both potent target modulation and good pharmaceutical
properties<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The high prevalence of
macrocycles among these drugs strongly suggests that a macrocyclic structure helps confer
these favorable properties. The notion that cyclization of a ligand can increase its binding
affinity by eliminating unproductive conformations is well established<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, but how a macrocyclic structure might help
confer drug-like pharmaceutical properties is less clear. Lipinski<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>
have speculated that natural products might be substrates for transporter proteins that
mediate their active uptake through cell membranes. Moreover, there is evidence that the
constrained flexibility of macrocycles also contributes to increased passive permeation
through biological membranes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and thus to improved oral
bioavailability<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The ability of
macrocycles to display &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; properties by adopting conformations
that partially bury hydrophilic or hydrophobic functionality from the solvent environment,
for example by formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds to bury polar groups during
permeation through biological membranes, has also been invoked as a potential contributor to
solubility and membrane permeability<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. It is also proposed that some cyclic peptides might permeate membranes
by pore formation, chelation of divalent metals, or direct binding to specific
phospholipids<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The term &#8220;macrocycle&#8221; encompasses an enormous range of chemical
structures, only a tiny fraction of which are likely to have the characteristics required
for good pharmacological activity. To aid in the design of MC compound libraries for drug
discovery it would be helpful to know what structural and physicochemical features render
MCs most likely to bind strongly and specifically to a targeted protein, and to have good
solubility, good cell permeability and high metabolic stability. For example, it would be
useful to know whether protein binding is better achieved by considering the MC ring merely
as a scaffold that presents a set of substituents that engage the protein, or whether a
better approach is to design compounds with the expectation that some ring atoms will
directly participate in binding. The physicochemical balance of the compounds is also an
important question. Conventional metrics for druglikeness are of limited value in addressing
this question, as generally these have been constructed by empirically evaluating
conventional drug candidates, which are dominated by non-macrocyclic compounds. New,
MC-specific design guidelines are thus needed.</p><p id="P6">One approach to filling this information gap is to analyze how proteins bind
pharmacologically active MC natural products, with the goal of identifying common features
that might inform the design of synthetic MCs intended to target proteins. Surprisingly, no
systematic structural survey of MC binding modes has previously been reported. Here we
identify a representative set of MC-protein complexes for which co-crystal structures have
been reported, and examine these structures to establish the key characteristics of their
binding modes in comparison to complexes with conventional, drug-like ligands. We also
develop a refinement to the FTMap algorithm for computational fragment mapping<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and use this method to evaluate the number, strength and spatial
distribution of druggable subsites (a.k.a. binding energy &#8220;hot spots&#8221;)
within each MC binding site, to assess how MC binding sites differ from sites that bind
conventional drugs. Based on our analysis we propose specific guidelines for the design of
synthetic MC libraries that possess structural and physicochemical features likely to be
favorable for binding to protein targets and also for good bioavailability. We additionally
provide evidence that large, natural product derived MCs can bind targets that are not
druggable by conventional, drug-like compounds, giving concrete support to the notion that
natural product inspired MCs can expand the range of proteins that can be targeted with
pharmaceutically relevant synthetic small molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P8">To identify a representative, non-redundant set of protein-MC X-ray co-crystal
structures for analysis, we began by identifying all entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
that contained natural products or natural product-derived MC ligands with ring sizes of 14
or more atoms. We filtered the structures in this set using several additional criteria,
detailed in Methods, to exclude low quality structures and also certain chemotypes, such as
cyclic nucleotides, that we considered of low relevance for drug discovery. Most
importantly, where the database contained complexes of the same protein bound to close
structural analogues of a given MC, or complexes of a given MC bound to paralogs or
orthologs of the same protein target, we selected one representative example to avoid
biasing our data set with multiple copies of essentially the same complex. This selection
process resulted in the surprisingly small number of 22 distinct MC-protein complexes,
encompassing 19 distinct MCs and 13 distinct proteins (<bold>Supplementary Results</bold>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Although
this set represents a relatively small number of complexes, it contains all non-redundant
examples we could find that met our quality criteria, and thus represents the most complete
data set available on which to base such an analysis.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Characteristics of the Test Set</title><p id="P10">The MCs in the test set range in size from 14&#8211;35 ring atoms, with
molecular weights ranging from 365&#8211;1291 Da. For the subsequent analysis we found
it useful to divide these compounds into two size categories: &#8220;small
macrocycles&#8221;, which include the six MCs in the test set with molecular weights
&lt;600 Da. &#8211; i.e. within or close to the accepted upper limit for
conventional drugs<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> &#8211; and
&#8220;large macrocycles&#8221;, which comprise the 13 MCs with m.w. &gt;600 Da,
which thus substantially violate this key descriptor of conventional druglikeness. To
determine whether the limited number of non-redundant MCs for which complex structures
exist are representative of natural product MCs in general, and of MC drugs in particular,
we compared our test set against 3747 natural product MCs<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and also against 44 MC compounds identified as approved
drugs, primarily taken from the CHEMBL database<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Table 1</xref>). In terms of ring size, our test set is fairly representative of all
natural product MCs, and closely mirrors the size distribution found for approved MC drugs
even though only three compounds are common to both sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In terms of
lipophilicity (clogP), polar surface area (PSA), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and
acceptors (HBA), and number of rotatable bonds (NRB), the large MCs in the test set
closely match the oral MC drugs, with an average MW that is ~3-fold higher than
that for conventional oral drugs, and a substantially higher number of hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors, but with comparable lipophilicity as measured by clogP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a&#8211;d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Both the large MCs in the test set and the oral
MC drugs additionally have a greater number of rotatable bonds compared to the set of all
oral drugs. In contrast, the small MCs in the test set possess structural and
physicochemical properties that fall within the ranges observed for conventional oral
drugs, aside from having a slightly higher average molecular weight. From these results it
is clear that (i) approved MC drugs occupy a region of chemical space that is quite
distinct from that defined by conventional druglike ligands, and (ii) the MCs in our test
set appear to resemble the subset of MC drugs that can be taken orally.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protein-MC binding geometry and extent of interface</title><p id="P12">The MC-protein binding modes observed among the test set can be described in
terms of three broadly distinct interaction geometries. Slightly more than half of the
large MCs bind with the MC ring roughly perpendicular to the protein surface, such that
one edge of the ring binds along the bottom of an extended groove or cleft on the protein,
with substituents interacting with adjacent binding pockets, and the outer edge of the
ring exposed to solvent. An example of this &#8220;edge-on&#8221; binding mode is
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>. The remaining large MCs adopt a
different binding geometry in which the MC ring lies face-on to the protein surface,
making contacts across a large area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). The
MCs that display this face-on binding mode invariably have 1&#8211;2 large substituents
that interact with substantial adjacent clefts or pockets on the protein. In contrast,
most of the small MCs adopt a compact, roughly globular conformation and bind in a cleft
or pronounced depression on the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The small MCs tended to be almost fully enveloped within their protein binding
sites, burying a quite uniform 82 &#177; 4 % of their total solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) upon binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), as
exemplified by Macbecin in its complex with hsp90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2c</xref>). In contrast, the large MCs appeared to bury a fairly uniform 630 &#177;
120 &#197;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of surface upon binding,
corresponding to an average of 57 &#177; 8 % of the compounds&#8217; total
SASA, with at most a modest dependence on MC size. This value is roughly twice the 300
&#177; 130 &#197;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of SASA buried by a typical
drug<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, and approaches the 800
&#177; 200 &#197;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of SASA buried on average
by each binding partner at a protein-protein interface<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Physicochemical Characteristics of Binding Regions of MCs</title><p id="P15">It has been proposed that the advantageous pharmacological properties seen for
certain large natural product MCs arises because these compounds possess distinct
structural domains whereby, for example, a predominantly hydrophobic target binding region
is physicochemically balanced by the presence of polar functionality on other parts of the
molecule<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. To test this proposal we analyzed the polar/non-polar balance of the
MC atoms that make contact with their protein targets, as defined by their burial of
&gt;5 &#197;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of SASA in the complex. For
the large MCs in our test set, on average 73 &#177; 9 % of the MC atoms that
make contact with the protein are nonpolar (i.e. C, S or Cl) and 27 % are polar (N
or O) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This non-polar/polar ratio is
essentially identical to the 71%/29% (&#177;7%) ratio we found
for the MC atoms as a whole. Similar results are obtained if the ratio of non-polar/polar
contacts is instead quantified in terms of MC atoms within 4.5 &#197; of the protein,
or total buried surface area. Thus, for the complexes with large MCs for which X-ray
structures exist, the physicochemical nature of the regions that participate directly in
binding is similar to that for the compound as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Participation of Different MC Regions in Target Binding</title><p id="P17">To gain insight into the roles that different regions within the MC structure
play in protein binding, we categorized MC heavy atoms into three different regional types
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These are; (i) &#8220;ring
atoms&#8221;, that comprise the contiguous, sigma-bonded ring by which the MC size is
defined; (ii) &#8220;peripheral atoms&#8221;, which are small groups such as methyl,
carbonyl, hydroxyl, and halogens that consist of a single heavy atom directly appended to
the ring; and (iii) &#8220;substituent atoms&#8221;, comprising larger (i.e. two or
more heavy atoms) structures connected to the ring. The large MCs in our test set, and
also the oral MC drugs, contain an average of 4&#8211;5 of these larger substituents,
together encompassing roughly half of the heavy atoms in the MC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Approximately
38% of the structure is made up of ring atoms, on average, while peripheral groups
make up the remaining ~15%. Analyzing the extent to which different
regions of MC structure participate in binding we found that, for the large MCs,
~60% of MC atoms that make direct contact with the protein are contributed
by substituents, with ring atoms contributing only 15% and peripheral atoms
&#8211; which are the least numerous regional atom type &#8211; contributing a
surprisingly high 22% of the total contact atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Normalizing for the different abundances of the regional atom types
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>) shows that, although peripheral atoms
make up only a small fraction of the structure of a given MC, where present they are
highly likely to directly participate in binding to the target. Specifically, among the
large MCs 72 &#177; 17 % of peripheral atoms make direct contact with the
protein, whereas only about half of substituent atoms do so, and about one quarter of ring
atoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table
4</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Examining the physicochemical composition of contact atoms from different sites
on the MC ligands revealed the surprising finding that, although the physicochemical
composition of contact atoms overall matched that of the whole MC molecule, significant
biases exist for atoms in certain regions of the MC structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref> shows the percentage of polar versus nonpolar contact atoms,
enumerated separately for substituent, peripheral and ring atoms. It can be seen that the
balance of polar versus nonpolar contact atoms in the substituents tends to match the
composition of the compound as a whole. Contacts involving ring atoms are largely
nonpolar, however. Peripheral atoms, in contrast, are much more likely to be polar
compared to other regions of MC structure, and those peripheral atoms that directly
contact the protein similarly are predominantly polar.</p><p id="P19">We additionally evaluated the occurrence and locations of intramolecular
hydrogen bonds in the bound MCs. We found that in 12 of the 22 protein-MC complexes the
bound MC showed no intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and all but one of the remaining
complexes showed only one or two such interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The exception
was argadin bound to chitinase, for which the 10 HBD and 11 HBA present on the MC engage
in 5 intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The overall picture, however, is that among MCs in our
test set only a small minority of HBD or HBA are internally complemented in the bound
conformations. This finding suggests that if these compounds passively permeate cell
membranes they likely adopt alternative conformations to do so.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Characteristics of MC binding sites on proteins</title><p id="P21">In addition to understanding how natural product MCs bind to their targets, it
is also of interest to know whether the sites on proteins that bind MCs differ in
measurable ways from sites that bind conventional drug-like small ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Identifying distinctive properties of MC binding
sites might give insights into how to design synthetic MCs to be complementary to such
sites, and might additionally provide a basis for identifying which proteins are most
suitable to target with natural product-inspired MCs. In addition to global binding site
characteristics such as size, shape and physicochemical composition<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, it has been shown that the ligand-binding
properties of protein surfaces are governed by the number, strength and spatial
distribution of binding energy &#8220;hot spots&#8221;<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Hot spots
are local surface regions whose shape and physicochemical character gives them the
potential to develop substantial binding energy through interaction with atoms from a
binding partner.</p><p id="P22">To analyze the MC binding sites in the test set we developed a modification to
the well-validated FTMap method for computational fragment mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Validation of the FTMap algorithm across a large number of
different systems has shown that the method can reliably identify the locations of binding
energy hot spots that are exploited by known ligands<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. It has
also been shown that the number of probe clusters in a given CC provides a relative
measure of the energetic importance of the hot spot for binding to small molecule
ligands<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> or to other
proteins<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. For the current work we constrained the initial mapping to a sphere
of radius 10 &#197; centered on the ligand binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). This constraint restricted the analysis to a more or less uniform
area of the protein surface, large enough to encompass the regions that accommodate even
the largest MCs in our set, so that the number and strengths of the CCs could be compared
between different proteins. For comparison to the MC-protein complexes, we assembled a
diverse &#8220;comparator drug set&#8221; of 24 X-ray co-crystal structures of
conventional drugs or drug-like ligands bound to their protein targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). When
computationally mapping the comparator drug set the initial probe map was restricted to
the same 10 &#197; sphere used for the MC complexes, so that the number of binding
energy hot spots identified and the density of probes at each hot spot could be directly
compared. The FTMap analysis was done using the protein from each complex structure after
removing the ligand atoms, to characterize the binding site without reference to which
portions of it are occupied by a particular ligand.</p><p id="P23"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> shows a typical result from FTMap
analysis of a MC binding site, for the Pectenotoxin-2 binding site on actin. Multiple
binding energy hot spots were identified. A subset of these &#8211; including the top
ranking CCs that are predicted to be energetically most significant &#8211; trace out
the regions of the protein surface that accommodate the MC ligand. Other CCs occur in
nearby regions of the protein surface, indicating that these regions have the potential to
interact favorably with ligands, but are not exploited by the particular ligand present in
the complex. The results of analysis of all the MC binding sites, together with the
comparator set of druglike ligand binding sites, are collected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. They show that the binding sites that accommodate the large MCs
are about 15% larger than those for conventional drug-like ligands (p &lt;
0.05), as measured by the distance between the two CCs that define the furthest extent of
the site. This difference is derived from the locations of the binding energy hot spots
alone, without regard to whether these hot spots are occupied by the ligand in the
experimentally observed complex, and thus reflect the intrinsic properties of the binding
sites. The MC binding sites and conventional drug binding sites on average contained the
same number of hot spots, but in the large MC binding sites these are spaced significantly
further apart (P &lt; 0.01). In particular, the two top ranking hot spots, which are
most important for binding<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, are on average separated by 10.2 &#197;
for the large MC binding sites versus only 7.5 &#197; for the drug-like comparator set
(p &lt; 0.01). The top two binding hot spots were not always widely separated in the
large MC binding sites, but in most instances were &gt;10 &#197; apart and in some
cases were separated by as much as 18 &#197;. In contrast, for the binding sites for
the drug-like ligands, in over 80% of cases the two most important CCs were within
9 &#197; of each other. In all of the above measures, the binding sites for the small
MCs were essentially indistinguishable from sites that bind conventional drug-like
ligands.</p><p id="P24">In addition to differences in the binding sites themselves, the MC and non-MC
ligands also differed in how they exploited binding energy hot spots within their binding
sites. Hot spots were designated as being occupied if both (i) the center of mass of the
probes in a given CC fell within 2 &#197; of any non-hydrogen atom of the ligand, and
(ii) at least 25% of the CC probe atoms were within 1.25 &#197; of the MC
atoms. On average, the drug-like ligands in our comparator set occupied 3.6 CCs,
representing 45% of the hot spots present at the binding site. In contrast, the
large MCs utilized an average of 5.2 distinct hot spots, comprising some 66% of
those available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This difference in hot
spot utilization was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, in addition to being somewhat larger than sites
that bind conventional druglike ligands, the MC binding sites were also more fully
occupied by their ligands. These two factors together lead to the very large
protein-ligand contact area for the large MCs that was described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Analyzing the degree to which different regions
of the MC structure engage with hot spots in the binding site we found that ring,
peripheral and substituent atoms that make contact with the protein were equally likely to
interact at a hot spot versus a non hot spot region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This result
suggests that contacts involving any portion of the MC structure can contribute to the
generation of binding energy. Interestingly, the finding that MCs interact with a greater
number of hot spots than conventional drug-like ligands was also seen for the small MCs,
emphasizing the different binding modes of small MCs and drug-like ligands despite their
rather similar dimensions and physicochemical properties.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Role of Target Site in Determining MC Interaction Mode</title><p id="P26">Comparing the binding of structurally different MCs that bind at the same site
provides insight into the extent to which binding site structure dictates binding mode.
The binding of small MC ligands such as geldanamycin and radicicol to the nucleotide
binding site of HSP90 has been described<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. The commonalities in the binding modes of Rapamycin and FK506 for FKBP
have also been extensively discussed<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>,
though this ligand pair represents a special case in that the chemical structures of the
regions that make contact with the protein are essentially identical. Among the complexes
in the test set, however, are several examples of MC pairs with quite distinct structures
that bind at the same site on a common target protein.</p><p id="P27">Reidispongiolide A (RspA) and Kabiramide C (KabC) each bind to the same surface
site on actin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref> shows that the macrocyclic
portions of these two natural products employ different strategies to achieve binding to
the target, finding alternative ways to position their large and structurally homologous
substituents so they can exploit key binding hot spots in an adjacent cleft. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref> shows that the 15-member MC argadin and the
17-member MC argifin bind to a common surface site on chitinase, but again exploit this
site in different ways. The two ligands occupy roughly the same space and exploit many of
the same hot spots, but the geometries with which the ring and substituent portions of
these ligands interact with the site are quite different. The MC rings of the compounds do
not significantly overlap, and the largest substituents project in opposite directions,
leading to an almost &#8220;head to tail&#8221; relationship between the binding
geometries. As a third example, Cyclosporin (Csp) and Sanglifehrin A (SfA) display an
&#8220;edge on&#8221; binding mode with cyclophilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>), with the MC rings themselves occupying largely the same region of
space and interacting with mostly the same binding hot spots. However, the two ligands
exploit different hot spots with some of their substituents. Overall, these examples show
that a given binding site can interact with different MC structures by employing quite
distinct binding mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Druggability of MC binding sites</title><p id="P29">Finally, we addressed the question of whether the MC binding sites in the test
set can be considered druggable with respect to conventional small molecule ligands, or
whether they represent conventionally undruggable sites that are uniquely targeted by MCs.
The latter result would provide concrete support for the hypothesis that using natural
product-inspired MCs might expand the range of proteins that can be targeted with
pharmaceutically relevant synthetic molecules. It is well established that the hit rate
achieved in an experimental fragment screen is a good predictor of druggability<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, and
that application of the same principle computationally using FTMap can distinguish
druggable from non druggable targets with high reliability<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Specifically,
published studies show that when a protein is globally mapped (i.e. with no constraints on
where probes can lie on the protein surface) using the standard FTMap 16 probe library,
druggable binding sites are characterized by the presence of a strong (&gt;16 probe
clusters) CC plus at least one other CC containing 5 or more probe clusters, located
within 7 &#197; of the first<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We therefore used FTMap to globally map the
16 distinct MC binding proteins represented in the test set, to evaluate which sites would
be rated as druggable using these previously established criteria. As was the case in the
published FTMap druggability analyses, the protein targets were mapped using separate
crystal structures of the unbound proteins, rather than using the protein structures from
the bound complexes. The analysis showed that six of the MC binding sites were rated as
druggable and ten as not druggable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Thus, a substantial proportion of the MC binding sites
in the test set appear to be poor prospects to bind conventional drug-like ligands with
high affinity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P31">The notion that MCs might provide a means to achieve pharmaceutically useful
inhibitors of PPIs and other traditionally difficult targets rests principally upon two
ideas: (i) being larger than conventional drugs, and also conformationally constrained, MCs
can potentially make more extensive contact with the protein target, and can do so without
excessive entropic penalty<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; and (ii) a
macrocyclic structure can promote good pharmaceutical properties despite a high compound
molecular weight and other significant deviations from conventional definitions of
druglikeness<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. The validity of these ideas is supported by the existence of
a modest number of PPI-targeting MC drugs that violate conventional druglikeness
guidelines<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, we currently lack
any framework for assessing the utility of MCs as a general approach to inhibiting low
druggability targets, or for predicting which types of macrocyclic molecular structures
might be good for this purpose.</p><p id="P32">The premise that the larger size of MCs renders them good prospects to bind and
inhibit PPI targets can be quantitatively framed in terms of Ligand Efficiency (LE), a
concept in which the binding affinity of a ligand is normalized for differences in ligand
size to provide a measure of how efficiently the ligand generates binding energy per heavy
atom (HA) of its structure<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. To achieve a
pharmacologically relevant binding affinity of K<sub>D</sub> &#8804;10 nM, a ligand with a
molecular weight within the Rule of Five threshold of 500 Da. &#8211; which on average
corresponds to ~38 HA &#8211; must generate at least
&#8211;RTln10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>/38 = ~0.3 kcal.mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of
binding energy per HA of ligand structure<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> shows that oral
MC drugs have an average MW of 920 Da., and range up to well over 1000 Da., corresponding to
75 or more heavy atoms, and that some non-oral MC drugs are even larger. Thus, for a MC to
achieve a binding affinity of 10 nM would require only &#8722;RTln
(10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>)/75 = 0.15 kcal.mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup>/HA, or even less for
larger MCs. Thus, MCs of a size that demonstrably can have good pharmaceutical properties
are potentially able to target proteins that are less than half as druggable as conventional
drug targets, where druggability is defined as the potential of a site to generate binding
energy with a small molecule ligand. Indeed, developing an earlier suggestion<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> we propose that <italic>Potential Ligand
Efficiency</italic> (PLE) represents a quantitative way to think about the druggability of
PPI interfaces and other challenging targets that can give insight into the level of
difficulty presented, and also into the prospects for compounds of a given size to achieve
strong binding.</p><p id="P33">The above analysis suggests that natural product inspired MCs do indeed have broad
potential to bind strongly to low druggability targets, provided that they can interact with
a geometry that results in a substantially increased contact area compared to conventional
drug-like ligands. Our analysis shows that this condition is invariably satisfied by the
large MCs in the test set, whose average contact area is more than twice that seen for
conventional drug-like ligands. Consistent with this idea, our analysis of the druggability
of the MC binding sites in the test set revealed that the majority do not appear to be
druggable as assessed by the FTMap benchmarks previously established for other target
classes<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. This result suggests that MCs can bind to target sites capable of
generating as little as 0.1&#8211;0.15 kcal.mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of binding energy per
HA of ligand structure, which would be very far from druggable by conventional compounds.
Overall, our results suggest that use of appropriately designed MCs can substantially expand
the range of druggable targets, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
4d</xref>. The historical success of macrocyclic natural products and their derivatives as
drugs<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> suggests that such targets present a significant opportunity for drug
discovery.</p><p id="P34">Exploiting the opportunity provided by natural product-inspired MCs would be
greatly enabled by knowledge of what structural features of such compounds are likely to
promote strong binding to protein targets and, separately, good pharmaceutical properties.
To meet the latter need, we might envision a set of guidelines analogous to
Lipinski&#8217;s Rule of Five<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>,
Veber&#8217;s Rules<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, or similar
druglikeness guidelines<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, but based on the
behavior of macrocyclic chemotypes. Based on the value ranges observed for the molecular
properties encompassed in the Rule of Five and Veber&#8217;s Rules for the 18 orally
available MC drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table
2</xref>), we tentatively propose a modified set of property ranges that we believe is
more appropriate for the design of synthetic MC libraries for use in the discovery of oral
drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The set of compounds on which these
ranges are based is necessarily very small, though it includes all known examples of orally
available macrocyclic drugs. Nonetheless, the results show that the oral MC drugs display
quite consistent properties that in many cases are clearly distinct from those observed for
conventional drugs.</p><p id="P35">An enormous variety of MC structures might be envisioned that conform to the
guidelines in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. We therefore attempted to use
our analysis of MC binding modes to devise more specific design guidelines for the kinds of
MC structures likely to bind to proteins, and therefore likely to have useful
pharmacological as well as pharmaceutical properties. The properties of the large MCs
contained in our test set of protein-MC complexes coincide closely with the oral MC drugs,
supporting the notion that analysis of the binding modes of the test set might return
information relevant to the design of orally available MC compounds. This analysis led us to
identify a number of structural features in the MCs that are common to these
pharmacologically active MCs. <list list-type="roman-lower" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P36">The oral MC drugs and the large MCs in our test set typically contain
1&#8211;2 large substituents, often totaling 20&#8211;30 heavy atoms or more, plus
several much smaller substituents such as acetyl, methoxy or isobutyl groups. In
natural product MCs the vast majority of substituent atoms, including small peripheral
groups attached to ring atoms, participate directly in contact with the protein. Thus,
structural diversity in these regions is an important consideration when designing MC
libraries for drug discovery. Although only about one in three ring atoms contacts the
protein, collectively these contribute ~25% of the contact area.
Moreover, ring, peripheral and substituent atoms that contact the protein are equally
likely to bind at a hot spot. Therefore, all regions of the MC must be considered
potentially important for achieving good binding complementarity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P37">The disproportionate role in binding played by single HA substituents
attached to the ring suggests that achieving an appropriate number and diversity of
such peripheral groups is particularly important for good protein binding activity.
Mimicking natural product MCs by including multiple polar atoms in these peripheral
positions also provides a means to ensure adequate PSA, which is critical for good
aqueous solubility and thus for pharmaceutical utility<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P38">The regions of the MC that interact with the protein target, and the MC
structure as a whole, have a drug-like physicochemical balance of one polar (O or N)
atom per 2&#8211;3 nonpolar (C, S, Cl) atoms. Consequently, the clogP for oral MC
drugs is similar to that for conventional drugs, while absolute PSA scales with
molecular weight and is much higher.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P39">Whether a large MC adopts an edge-on or a face-on binding mode appears to be
dictated by the topology of the protein surface. However, different MC structures can
interact at a given binding site in otherwise quite distinct ways, by exploiting
different sub-sets of the available binding energy hot spots. The face-on binders
often bind such that a large &#8211; in some cases almost drug-sized &#8211;
substituent can access a substantial neighboring pocket or cleft. The edge-on binders
typically display a bound conformation in which the ring is flattened and elongated,
such that even substituents attached to the solvent-exposed edge of the ring can reach
to make extensive contact with the protein (see, for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Thus, even for edge-on binders the substituents are
typically not restricted to a single edge of the MC ring. These findings argue that a
diverse, general purpose MC library with large and small substituents distributed
around the ring might have utility across a wide range of different protein binding
site topologies.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P40">A common feature among the oral MC drugs and the MC test set is a
significant degree of unsaturation in the ring, due to alkene or amide bonds or to
cross-links or externally fused small rings. Unlike rotatable bonds in general, single
bonds within an MC ring do not substantially mitigate against oral
availability<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Nevertheless,
the relatively high degree of unsaturation observed for these MCs suggests that
substantial rigidification of the MC ring is a feature of pharmaceutically relevant MC
chemotypes.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P41">The MC structural features described above are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, which, together with the property ranges in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, we tentatively propose as a set of design
guidelines for synthetic MCs intended as pharmaceutically useful binders or inhibitors of
protein drug targets. These guidelines must be considered as provisional, requiring
validation and further refinement based on prospective experimental tests. Nonetheless, the
available evidence supports the notion that compounds conforming to these properties
represent a useful class for the discovery of pharmacologically active synthetic MCs</p><p id="P42">Finally, our analysis also provides clues as to what features on a protein target
might make it suitable for inhibition by a macrocyclic ligand. Specifically, the results of
the FTMap analysis of the MC binding sites in our test set suggests that such sites
typically contain at least 5 relatively strong binding energy hot spots, 1&#8211;2 more
than is required for binding a conventional drug. These hot spots can be substantially
further apart than is acceptable for a conventionally druggable binding site. In particular,
the two strongest hot spots &#8211; which for conventional drug binding must be close
together &#8211; for MCs can be separated by as much as 18 &#197;. These criteria
potentially provide a means to identify protein targets that are particularly well suited to
bind MC ligands, based only on computational analysis of the structures of the unbound
proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>Selection of the MC-binding protein set</title><p id="P45">Selection began by identifying Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries containing
natural product MC compounds (or a close derivative), excluding compounds that were
discovered via linking or tethering of acyclic leads. This search was done over a period
of several months, and included PDB entries deposited up to December 2012. The resulting
complexes were then subject to a series of selection criteria in order to ensure set
consistency and remove redundancies. MC were included only if they contained a minimum of
14 atoms in the main ring and were documented to function as a protein inhibitor (no
substrates or coordinated metal cofactors). &#8220;Ring atoms&#8221; were defined as
atoms in the continuous, sigma-bonded chain of atoms that defines the macrocyclic
scaffold. In cases of fused ring or multi-cyclic systems, where two or more sigma bonds
are shared between the rings, the system was regarded as a fused ring &#8211; i.e. the
macrocyclic chain encompass both rings, and thus comprises the longest continuous cyclic
sigma-bonded chain of atoms. Exceptions to this latter rule were if the smaller fused ring
was aromatic, in which case it was counted along the shorter continuous side of
sigma-bonded atoms. Also, where the fused rings share only a single sigma bond, then the
macrocyclic chain was considered to include only the larger of the two rings, with the
smaller fused ring considered as a substituent.</p><p id="P46">To minimize redundancy, if a compound had a series of closely related analogs
bound to the same protein, only one was selected. For cases where identical MCs bound
orthologs of a protein, one was selected, prioritizing human when possible. Structures of
the same MC complexed to distinct proteins, or the same protein bound to different MC
ligands, were not considered to be duplicates, because a different binding partner
requires a distinct binding mode. Complexes with a mutation in the binding site were
excluded, as well as those with a binding site conformation known to be dependent on
crystal contacts. The PDB codes for the 22 complexes in the final test set are as follows:

The modification constrained the initial placement of the probes to a 10 &#197; radius
sphere around the center of mass of the ligand, so that mapping of each protein involved
distribution of the probes across a similar extent of protein surface. The 10 &#197;
distance constraint restricted only the starting positions for the probes, which through
subsequent energy minimization could relax to locations slightly outside the initial
placement perimeter.</p><p id="P51">The comparator set of complexes containing conventional druglike ligands was

significantly differ.</p><p id="P56"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>. Here the
statistical problem is to compare macrocycle properties to the same properties observed
for all oral drugs. Since the latter sample is much larger than the others, non-parametric
(rank-based) tests are not effective, and hence we had to use classical non-paired t-tests
based on the sample estimates of mean and standard deviation. The test assumes that each
of the two populations being compared follows a normal distribution. We used the
Anderson-Darling test<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> to check the
normality based on the samples. Since the test requires at least 7 samples, no test was
applied to the small macrocycles. We found that each property of the large macrocycles
followed a normal distribution, as the hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected at the
P=0.01 level. Similarly, the properties of the not orally available MC drugs followed
normal distributions. For all oral drugs we had only the statistics and not the detailed
data. However, this sample is so large that significant deviations from normality are very
unlikely. The only data where deviations from normality occurs are the orally available MC
drugs, although in most cases the hypothesis of normality still cannot be rejected at the
P=0.001 level. In spite of this result, the P values shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>, comparing macrocycle
properties to the properties of all oral drugs, are based on the t-test, since we do not
have other viable options, and the t-test results are generally not very sensitive to
deviations from normality. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the
two-tailed P values obtained by unpaired t-tests assuming unequal sample sizes and unequal
variance s. In most cases the differences are significant at very low P, thus it is
unlikely the deviations from normality would change the outcome.</p><p id="P57"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>. Since we
