The <italic>Luteovirus</italic> and <italic>Polerovirus</italic> genera include all but one virus in the <italic>Luteoviridae</italic>. They share a common gene block, which encodes the coat protein (ORF3), a movement protein (ORF4), and a carboxy-terminal extension to the coat protein (ORF5). These three proteins all have been reported to participate in the phloem-specific movement of the virus in plants. All three are translated from one subgenomic RNA, sgRNA1. Here, we report the discovery of a novel short ORF, termed ORF3a, encoded near the 5&#8217; end of sgRNA1. Initially, this ORF was predicted by statistical analysis of sequence variation in large sets of aligned viral sequences. ORF3a is positioned upstream of ORF3 and its translation initiates at a non-AUG codon. Functional analysis of the ORF3a protein, P3a, was conducted with <italic>Turnip yellows virus</italic> (TuYV), a polerovirus, for which translation of ORF3a begins at an ACG codon. ORF3a was translated from a transcript corresponding to sgRNA1 in vitro, and immunodetection assays confirmed expression of P3a in infected protoplasts and in agroinoculated plants. Mutations that prevent expression of P3a, or which overexpress P3a, did not affect TuYV replication in protoplasts or inoculated <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves, but prevented virus systemic infection (long-distance movement) in plants. Expression of P3a from a separate viral or plasmid vector complemented movement of a TuYV mutant lacking ORF3a. Subcellular localization studies with fluorescent protein fusions revealed that P3a is targeted to the Golgi apparatus and plasmodesmata, supporting an essential role for P3a in viral movement.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In order to maximize coding capacity, RNA viruses often encode overlapping genes and use unusual translational control mechanisms. Plant viruses express proteins required for movement of the virus through the plant, often from non-canonically translated open reading frames (ORFs). Viruses in the economically important Luteoviridae family are confined to the phloem (vascular) tissue, probably due to their specialized phloem-specific movement proteins. These proteins are translated from one viral mRNA, sgRNA1, via initiation at more than one AUG codon to express overlapping genes, and by ribosomal read-through of a stop codon. Here, we describe yet another gene translated from sgRNA1, ORF3a. Translation of ORF3a initiates at a non-standard (not AUG) start codon. We found that ORF3a is not required for viral genome replication, but is required for long-distance movement of the virus in the plant. The movement function could be restored <italic>in trans</italic> by providing the ORF3a product, P3a, from another viral or plasmid vector. P3a localizes in the Golgi apparatus and adjacent to the plasmodesmata, supporting a role in intercellular movement. In summary, we used a powerful bioinformatic tool to discover a cryptic gene whose product is required for movement of a phloem-specific plant virus, revealing multiple levels of translational control that regulate expression of four proteins from a single mRNA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>ES and WAM were financed through a Gutenberg Chair (R&#233;gion Alsace) grant awarded to WAM.

To do this, RNA viruses often employ noncanonical translation mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, many viruses encode genes in overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), some of which can be very short. Also, the arrangement of the ORFs themselves can regulate their expression. To decipher a virus life cycle, it is imperative to identify all the coding regions and to understand their function and how they are regulated. However, small functional ORFs, often lacking conventional initiation sites, can be very difficult to detect. Thus, specialized bioinformatic tools are often required to detect key viral genes. Here we use such tools to identify an essential ORF conserved in the two main genera in the <italic>Luteoviridae</italic> family, and provide evidence of its role in infection.</p><p>Viruses in the economically important <italic>Luteoviridae</italic> family are paragons of translational control. They employ leaky scanning to initiate translation at separate start codons, ribosomal frameshifting, and stop codon readthrough to express various genes, some of which overlap (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The <italic>Luteoviridae</italic> family comprises over 33 viruses distributed among three genera, including the wide-spread <italic>Barley yellow dwarf virus</italic> (BYDV) in genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic>, and <italic>Potato leafroll virus</italic> (PLRV), <italic>Turnip yellows virus</italic> (TuYV) and <italic>Cereal yellow dwarf virus</italic> (CYDV) in genus <italic>Polerovirus</italic>, and <italic>Pea enation mosaic virus 1</italic> (PEMV1), the sole member of genus <italic>Enamovirus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All <italic>Luteoviridae</italic> species are transmitted in a persistent and circulative manner by aphids, but they do not replicate in the aphid, and all but PEMV are confined to the phloem in the plant [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic> differs from the others in that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the translational and replication control signals throughout the genome resemble those of the <italic>Tombusviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, like the <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>, the genome of the <italic>Luteovirus</italic> genus members has no 5&#8217; modification [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whereas the genomes of poleroviruses and the enamovirus have a genome-linked protein (VPg) covalently attached to the 5&#8217; end [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat.1004868.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004868.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Coding potential analyses of barley yellow dwarf luteoviruses and poleroviruses.</title><p>
<bold>A.</bold> Map of the ~5.7 kb <italic>Barley yellow dwarf virus</italic> (BYDV) genome, including the newly identified ORF3a (pink). Subgenomic RNA start sites are from Kelly et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ORF1 and (via ribosomal frameshifting) ORF2 are translated from the genomic RNA. ORFs 3a, 3, 4 and 5 are expressed from sgRNA1, with translation of ORF3a predicted to be dependent on non-AUG initiation, translation of ORFs 3 and 4 being dependent on leaky scanning, and ORF5 translated by readthrough of the ORF3 stop codon. ORF6 may be translated from sgRNA2. <bold>B.</bold> MLOGD analysis, using a 40-codon sliding window, of the coding potential (lines) and positions of stop codons in each aligned sequence (points) in each of the three forward reading frames. The analysis is based on 76 aligned BYDV sequences, including serotypes PAV, PAS, MAV, GAV and Ker-II. Positive MLOGD scores indicate that the sequence is likely to be coding in that reading frame [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A conserved absence of stop codons provides independent support for a coding assignment. The pale pink rectangle in the panel corresponding to the +0 frame (blue) indicates the newly discovered ORF3a. To map the analysis onto the coordinates (and reading frames) of a specific sequence, all alignment columns with gaps in a chosen reference sequence, NC_004750.1 (BYDV-PAV), were removed. Remaining alignment gaps in non-reference sequences are indicated with grey rectangles in the stop codon plots. <bold>C.</bold> Map of the ~5.6 kb <italic>Turnip yellows virus</italic> (TuYV) genome, including the newly identified ORF3a (pink). ORFs 0, 1 and 2 are translated from the genomic RNA with expression of ORF1 being dependent on leaky scanning and translation of ORF2 via a -1 ribosomal frameshift. ORFs 3a, 3, 4 and 5 are translated from sgRNA1, with expression of ORF3a being dependent on non-AUG initiation, translation of ORFs 3 and 4 via leaky scanning, and of ORF5 via stop codon readthrough. <bold>D.</bold> MLOGD analysis was performed and displayed as in panel B. The analysis is based on 97 polerovirus sequences aligned separately within the 5' and 3' gene blocks. NC_003743.1 (TuYV) was used as the reference sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1004868.g001"/></fig><p>Viruses in all three genera have a 5.2 to 6.3 kb positive-sense RNA genome from which a subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA1) is generated in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. sgRNA1 consists of the 3&#8217;-terminal half of the genome in genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic>, or the 3&#8217;-terminal third of the genome in the <italic>Polerovirus</italic> and <italic>Enamovirus</italic> genera (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). sgRNA1 serves as the mRNA for translation of ORFs 3, 4, and 5. ORF3 encodes the coat protein (CP), ORF4 codes for P4 and is embedded within the CP ORF but in a different reading frame. ORF5 is translated by in-frame readthrough of the CP ORF stop codon, a process stimulated by sequences adjacent to, and far downstream of, the leaky stop codon [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, the translation product of ORF5 (RTD; readthrough domain) does not exist on its own, but is present only as a C-terminal extension of the CP in the CP-RTD protein. The icosahedral (T = 3) virion contains 180 copies of the CP, of which, in the case of BYDV, an estimated 10 to 25% are present in the form of CP-RTD [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The RTD is required for aphid transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and in some viruses also for virus movement in certain plant hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. P4 is likely a cell-to-cell movement protein [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The sole official enamovirus, PEMV1, lacks ORF4, has a truncated RTD and depends on a helper virus, PEMV2 (genus <italic>Umbravirus</italic>), for efficient movement in the plant [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Translation of ORF4 depends on a leaky scanning mechanism whereby some scanning 40S ribosomal subunits fail to initiate at the ORF3 AUG initiation codon and instead continue scanning to the downstream ORF4 AUG initiation codon [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This mechanism is facilitated by the generally poor context of the ORF3 initiation codon. In mammals, potential initiation codons with an A at -3, or a G at -3 and a G at +4, (where the A of the AUG is nucleotide +1) may be regarded as being in a &#8216;strong&#8217; context for initiation [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while other contexts facilitate leaky scanning. Similar context rules appear to apply in plants [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Leaky scanning may also be facilitated by the use of non-AUG initiation codons. The near-cognate codons CUG, GUG, ACG, AUU, AUA, UUG and AUC are, under certain circumstances, able to support a significant level of initiation (typically 2&#8211;15% of the level of initiation at an AUG codon in a similar context), with CUG being the most efficient non-AUG initiation codon in many systems [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Initiation at non-AUG codons normally requires a strong initiation context, but may also be enhanced in less predictable ways by RNA structure within the message [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In several plant viruses, a combination of non-AUG and poor-context AUG initiation codons allows production of three or even four functional proteins from a single transcript [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The 5&#8217; end of sgRNA1 of luteoviruses and poleroviruses, where known, varies between 188 and 302 nt upstream of the ORF3 AUG [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], usually including sequence that encodes the 3&#8217; end of ORF2. This is an unusually long leader sequence for a viral sgRNA because, as mentioned above, RNA viruses tend to minimize sequence length wherever possible. A long 5&#8217; untranslated region (UTR) often implies the presence of a translational enhancer such as an internal ribosome entry site [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but the cap-independent translation element for genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic>, called a BYDV-like translation enhancer (BTE), is located in the 3&#8217; UTR [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and only a small stem-loop at the 5&#8217; end of sgRNA1 is needed for cap-independent translation [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Instead of being a long 5&#8217; UTR, we report here that the 5&#8217; end of sgRNA1 of poleroviruses and luteoviruses (but not of the enamovirus) encodes a small ORF, termed ORF3a, that initiates at a non-AUG codon. The encoded protein P3a of TuYV is not required for replication in protoplasts but is required for systemic infection in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Computational analysis reveals a conserved ORF within the sgRNA1 leader</title><p>The coding potential of ORF3a was detected initially by applying the gene-finding program MLOGD to luteovirus and polerovirus sequence alignments. MLOGD uses nucleotide and amino acid substitution matrices to model sequence evolution in dual-coding, single-coding and non-coding regions [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It can be used to predict novel coding sequences via an approximate likelihood-ratio test. Although originally developed to analyze overlapping genes, MLOGD can also be used to analyze the coding potential in each of the three reading frames relative to a 'null' model in which the sequence is presumed to be non-coding in that reading frame.</p><p>
<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> illustrates the application of MLOGD to an alignment of 76 <italic>Barley yellow dwarf virus</italic> (BYDV) sequences (including serotypes PAV, PAS, MAV, GAV and the highly divergent Ker-II) with full or near-full genome coverage, using a 40-codon sliding window separately in each reading frame. A positive coding signature was observed in the correct reading frame throughout the ORF1, ORF2 and ORF5 regions. As expected, due to the lower number of substitutions in dual-coding regions, the coding signature was weaker in the ORF3/ORF4 overlap region, but still mainly positive. Furthermore, a positive coding signature was observed in the ORF6 region, supporting earlier evidence that it may encode a functional product [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Unexpectedly, a short region of positive coding potential was observed upstream of ORF3, in a region hitherto presumed to be part of the sgRNA1 non-coding leader (pink band, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, the region of positive coding potential coincided with a conserved absence of stop codons in the corresponding reading frame (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We named this open reading frame ORF3a. We observed that ORF3a is conserved in the three clades identified in the genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic>, (i) the BYDVs, (ii) <italic>Bean leafroll virus</italic>, <italic>Soybean dwarf virus</italic> and relatives, and (iii) <italic>Rose spring dwarf-associated virus</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed 97 full- or nearly full-length genome sequences of viruses in genus <italic>Polerovirus</italic>. Recombination, particularly between the 5' replication and 3' capsid/movement gene blocks, is a common feature of polerovirus and luteovirus evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In view of this, the 5' ORF0-ORF1-ORF2 and 3' ORF3-ORF4-ORF5 gene blocks were extracted from polerovirus sequences and aligned separately. 178 nucleotides of 5' flanking sequence were included in the ORF3-ORF4-ORF5 alignment in order to include the potential ORF3a region and some upstream flanking sequence in the analysis. MLOGD revealed a positive coding signature in the correct reading frame throughout most of the ORF0, ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 regions (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Again, a short but clear region of positive coding potential was observed just upstream of ORF3 and, once again, this coincided with a conserved absence of stop codons in the corresponding reading frame (pink band, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).

With few exceptions (see below), all available sequences with coverage of the ORF3a region contain a near-cognate non-AUG potential initiation codon, in a strong initiation context, near the 5' end of the maximal open reading frame (which is determined by the next upstream in-frame stop codon). Representative sequences (NCBI species RefSeqs) are shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>; additional sequences are shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>.

The presence of ORF3a-frame stop codons (amber shading, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) in many sequences shortly upstream of this site further suggests that this is the site of initiation. As only a fraction of scanning 40S ribosomal subunits initiate translation at any given non-AUG initiation codon, it is possible that in some species multiple non-AUG initiation sites are utilized (e.g. closely spaced ACG and AUU codons, both with an A at -3, in BYDV sequences NC_002160, NC_003680, NC_004750 and NC_004666; <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

Uniquely, in one luteovirus (NC_006265, <italic>Carrot red leaf virus</italic>) the ORF3a stop codon is upstream of the ORF3 AUG codon. This is due to replacement of the canonical ORF3 AUG codon with ACG (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The single nucleotide deletion that disrupts the ORF3a reading frame in NC_004756 (<italic>Beet western yellows virus</italic>; pink '-' in <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) is not present (i.e. is replaced with a nucleotide) in all other available <italic>Beet western yellows virus</italic> sequences in NCBI (&gt;30 sequences) suggesting that the RefSeq may have a sequencing error or represent a defective genome. In NC_003491 (<italic>Beet mild yellowing virus</italic>, BMYV) and NC_002766 (<italic>Beet chlorosis virus</italic>), ORF3a is shorter and initiates with an AUG codon in a weak context instead of a non-AUG initiation codon in a strong context (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). However, in other sequences of these two species the AUG is replaced with AUUG giving rise to the full-length canonical ORF3a (see <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>). Whether these RefSeqs represent defective sequences or functional variants remains to be determined. However, an infectious clone of BMYV contains an intact ORF3a with AUUG rather than the AUG sequence present in the RefSeq [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>We suggest that these exceptions are due to sequencing errors or sequences of nonviable viral RNAs. It should be noted that NCBI RefSeqs are often derived from older sequences (typically the first full-length sequence obtained for a species) and are sometimes prone to sequencing errors that are not supported by later sequencing (e.g. see <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>). While insertion/deletion errors that occur in known coding ORFs are generally corrected, errors elsewhere often escape notice. The long standing confusion regarding the genome organization of sobemoviruses, which arose as a result of insertion/deletion errors in a number of early sequences, is a case in point [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When we analyzed all 459 sequences available in GenBank with coverage of the ORF3/3a region, only 10 were found to be defective or potentially defective with respect to ORF3a as a result of insertions, deletions or premature termination codons, while only one sequence lacked a strong initiation context at the canonical ORF3a initiation site (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>).</p><p>The protein product of ORF3a, P3a, has a predicted molecular mass normally in the range 4.8 to 5.3 kDa. Its amino acid sequence is generally highly conserved between divergent virus species (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Moreover, all sequences, except the two which are N-terminally truncated (AUG initiation; see above), contain a predicted transmembrane region towards the N-terminus of P3a (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>ORF3a is translated <italic>in vitro</italic>
</title><p>In order to experimentally evaluate the expression of ORF3a, we selected the polerovirus <italic>Turnip yellows virus</italic> (TuYV), and performed <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments in wheat germ extracts using T7-derived transcripts starting at nt 3259 which corresponds to the 5&#8217; end of TuYV sgRNA1. This places ORF3a in its natural context in the TuYV sgRNA1, beginning upstream of ORFs 3 and 4. Based on alignments, translation of ORF3a is suspected to start with an ACG (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, NC_003743.1, nt 3365) and to stop with a UAG (nt 3502), producing a theoretical protein of 45 amino acids (MW 5.1 kDa). This ACG displays a favorable translation initiation context (A at -3 and G at +4) at a position that is conserved among most poleroviruses and luteoviruses (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>; <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>).</p><p>To monitor ORF3a expression and function, several mutants were constructed (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). As a positive control, the putative ORF3a start codon (ACG) was mutated to AUG (mutant &#8220;AUG&#8221;). As a negative control, the ACG was mutated to AGC, a codon that should not function as a translation initiation site [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Capped <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts of the corresponding subgenomic RNAs (WT, AUG and AGC) were translated in wheat germ extracts and a band migrating at about 6.8 kDa was generated from the WT and AUG constructs (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Although migrating more slowly than the predicted size of 5.1 kDa, evidence below supports the notion that this is the product of ORF3a, initiating at the predicted ACG codon. For example, as predicted, translation of this protein increased when the ACG was changed to AUG (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, no band of similar size was observed from the construct in which ACG was mutated to AGC (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, lane 4), but two minor bands (migrating at 4.6 and 7.3 kDa), also present with the WT construct, were observed. These bands could result from alternative translation initiation events, with the 7.3 kDa-migrating product potentially arising via initiation at an in-frame AUU codon four triplets upstream of the ACG (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The lower mass product of 4.6 kDa could result from initiation at one of several in-frame downstream alternative initiation codons (AUA, GUG and AUC), the first one being located 16 codons downstream of the ACG (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). To verify that the higher mass proteins arose from ORF3a, tandem stop codons (UAA UAG) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of two internal codons (UCA UCG, 14 codons downstream of the proposed ACG initiation codon) in order to prematurely interrupt translation of ORF3a (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, 2stop construct, and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Translation of the corresponding sgRNA1 yielded neither the main 6.8 kDa protein nor the minor 7.3 kDa band (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, lane 5).

The WT-specific primer indeed detected only WT RNA in the WT-inoculated plants (four plants tested #22&#8211;25) and gave no amplification of RNA in the eight systemically infected plants co-inoculated with TuYV-3aAGC and TuYV-3aAUG (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>, plants #28&#8211;37). Moreover, the TuYV-3aAGC and TuYV-3aAUG primers detected viral RNA only in plants inoculated with those mutants and not in the WT-infected plants. These quantifications were first normalized with a reference gene (GAPDH) whose expression was shown to remain stable upon various viral infections [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] before being normalized with the sample&#8217;s value obtained with the common set of primers and finally normalized with a positive sample (taken arbitrarily). Therefore the relative values shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref> reflect only presence or absence of the corresponding virus and do not allow comparison of levels of one mutant versus another. The ratio of the two mutant viruses present in the systemic leaves of the co-inoculated plants could be estimated by comparing the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the samples to a calibration curve generated with the corresponding plasmid. A mean value of 2.4 was obtained for the ratio TuYV-3aAGC/TuYV-3aAUG (extreme values: 1.7&#8211;3.1). The RT-PCR results revealed that the mutations were maintained, and that the mutants did not revert to wild type. Recombination was not an issue as the mutations changed the same nucleotides (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). Thus, both mutant viruses, each individually incapable of systemic infection, can complement each other to move systemically as efficiently as WT virus.</p><p>To determine whether the above complementation of TuYV-3aAGC by TuYV-3aAUG is due to the provision of P3a by the latter virus, we tested whether expression of P3a alone is capable of complementing TuYV-3aAGC. Indeed, co-infiltration of leaves with agrobacteria expressing TuYV-3aAGC and agrobacteria containing a plasmid that expresses only P3a driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, yielded significant levels of TuYV-3aAGC RNA in systemic leaves of 10 out of 10 plants at 21 d.p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The RNA levels were generally less than those in the plants complemented with TuYV-3aAUG, but consistently and significantly above levels in systemic leaves of plants inoculated with TuYV-3aAGC alone (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, plants #38&#8211;44). Plasmid expressing P3a with a C-terminally fused green fluorescent protein (P3a-GFP) did not efficiently complement TuYV-3aAGC, except for one plant out of 10 (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, plant #62). Nevertheless most plants were positive by qRT-PCR, albeit at very low levels (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> see insert; compare plants #58&#8211;67 with mock-inoculated plant #96), suggesting that the GFP fusion reduced function or expression of P3a to levels that did not permit efficient complementation. Transient expression of P3a and P3a-GFP in presence or absence of the viral mutant TuYV-3aAGC was confirmed in infiltrated leaves by western blotting using specific antibodies (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Curiously, as observed by northern blot analysis in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> plants inoculated with TuYV-3aAGC (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), one plant infiltrated with TuYV-3aAGC alone and one infiltrated with TuYV-3aAGC plus GFP gave positive but weak signals by qRT-PCR analysis in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, plants # 8 and 81), suggesting the potential for rare escape events.

Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) performed on purified viral preparations from leaves agroinfiltrated with TuYV-3aAGC, TuYV-3a2stop and TuYV-3aFLAG mutants revealed typical virus particles which did not differ in conformation from WT virions (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). A few particles were detected on grids from the TuYV-3aAUG mutant. Interestingly, in protoplast infections where only one replication cycle occurs, no particles were observed for this mutant while particles were easily detected for the other mutants (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). This suggests that the particles found in TuYV-3aAUG-inoculated leaves may be due to rare reversion events as described earlier (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>); Therefore, the inability of both TuYV-3a knockout mutants to move efficiently to non-inoculated leaves of agroinfected plants cannot be attributed to the absence of capsid formation but rather to the inhibition of another step required for viral long-distance spread. This conclusion is reinforced by the ability of P3a to complement movement of the TuYV-3aAGC mutant. Taken together, these results show that the P3a protein plays a crucial role in systemic infection.</p><fig id="ppat.1004868.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004868.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Viral particles produced by TuYV-3a mutants.</title><p>Negatively stained viral particles in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> inoculated with TuYV-WT, TuYV-3aAUG, TuYV-3aAGC, TuYV-3a2stop and TuYV-3aFLAG.

Translation of ORF3a depends on non-AUG initiation on the sgRNA. Thus, via additional leaky scanning and stop codon readthrough, four distinct proteins (P3a, CP, P4 and CP-RTD) are expressed from a single sgRNA species. This work adds to the increasing known prevalence of non-AUG codons as start codons. While the use of ACG, AUA, AUU and CUG as weak start codons has been known for some time, including in plants [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], this was thought to be a rarity, until many more were revealed by ribosome profiling and bioinformatics approaches [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

These viruses contain a BYDV-like cap-independent translation element (BTE) in the 3&#8217; UTR which must base pair to a stem-loop at the 5&#8217; end of the mRNA [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (upstream of ORF3a in sgRNA1) to facilitate translation initiation. In competitive conditions, sgRNA1 of BYDV translates more efficiently than the full-length genomic RNA, and this efficiency is conferred by what was thought to be the 5&#8217; UTR, including ORF3a [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This differential translation efficiency was proposed to be due to the relative lack of secondary structure in the sgRNA1 5&#8217; end, but the role of ORF3a in this preferential translation is unknown. This role for the 5&#8217;-terminal sequence of sgRNA1 in translation may apply only to genus <italic>Luteovirus</italic>, because poleroviruses are not known to harbor a 3&#8217; cap-independent translation element. Truncation of the 5&#8217;UTR of the PLRV sgRNA1 was reported to increase translation efficiency of CP and P4 [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], an effect that is likely due to the absence of ORF3a and not solely to the shorter 5&#8217; end <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>Knock-out of ORF3a did not evidently alter the expression level of CP, P4 and CP-RTD in protoplast infections.

TuYV particle formation is a prerequisite for long distance trafficking [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However viral particles were easily observed in leaves inoculated with these mutants (TuYV-3aAGC and TuYV-3a2stop, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). This indicates that P3a is not required for the encapsidation process and that the lack of systemic movement is not due to packaging deficiency, thus reinforcing a direct role for P3a in viral systemic spread. The P3a-overexpressing mutant TuYV-3aAUG showed a drastically reduced expression of CP, CP-RTD and P4 that correlates with its incapacity to form virions as shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> and explains its deficiency in systemic movement.</p><p>Importantly, the P3a-defective mutant TuYV-3aAGC was capable of long distance trafficking when P3a was supplied <italic>in trans</italic> by either replicating virus (TuYV-3aAUG) or from a non-replicating plasmid (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). These results demonstrate unequivocally that the P3a protein is a key factor in long distance movement that functions <italic>in trans</italic>. This raises the issue of the mode of action of P3a. One hypothesis could be that P3a functions only in the cell where it is expressed and assists the virus in its exit from the infected phloem cells and loading into the phloem. This could be achieved by increasing the size exclusion limit of the specialized plasmodesmata that connect phloem companion cells and the sieve tube, the so-called pore plasmodesmal unit (PPU) [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Polerovirus particles have indeed been detected in these PD [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this case, virus accumulation in systemic leaves would result exclusively from replication at primary infection sites. A second hypothesis could be that P3a either facilitates its own movement far beyond the agroinfiltrated cells, and/or that the complemented virus (TuYV-3aAGC) brings the plasmid-expressed P3a protein along with it to the phloem to permit unloading from the sieve element into phloem cells of neighboring leaves.</p><p>Bioinformatic predictions highlighted a putative trans-membrane domain which seems in contradiction with this hypothesis, except if during the infection cycle P3a could associate with another factor (i.e. CP or CP-RTD) to move long distance in the phloem. The structural proteins CP and CP-RT* (the encapsidated truncated form of the CP-RTD), and also CP-RTD possibly in its free form, were detected in phloem exudates of CABYV-infected cucumber plants [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These proteins might interact with P3a and move in the phloem until they reach, with or without virions, new sites in upper leaves.</p><p>Wild-type TuYV generates only minute amounts of P3a from a non-AUG initiation codon (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) suggesting that only low amounts of P3a are required. The P3a-defective AGC mutant should therefore not be limited in P3a supply when complemented with the AUG mutant which overproduces P3a (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In contrast, the AUG mutant&#8212;defective in CP, CP-RTD and P4 production&#8212;requires much larger amounts of these proteins from the complementing AGC mutant.

Both subcellular locations are in accordance with a role in viral movement. Thus, we speculate that the inability of P3a-GFP to significantly complement the P3a-deficient mutant TuYV-3aAGC was due to the GFP domain interfering with interactions of P3a with viral components (RNA or protein) necessary for movement, rather than being due to impaired subcellular localization. The specific targeting of P3a-GFP indicates a close association with the host endomembrane network likely through the transmembrane domain predicted in P3a. The ER and the Golgi apparatus constitute the core components of the secretory pathway, suggesting movement processes similar to thoses of other viruses. Small movement proteins of carmoviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and potyviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] also usurp the secretory pathway, and the TGB3 protein of potexviruses drives TGB2 protein-induced vesicles via the ER to form punctate caps on the cytoplasmic orifices of PD, similarly to the P3a protein [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>Although we have shown function and localization only for TuYV P3a, it is highly likely that P3a of the other poleroviruses and luteoviruses has the same function, given (i) that P3a is required for TuYV movement in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>, (ii) the amino acid sequence conservation of P3a among diverse luteovirids (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), and (iii) the functional conservation of all the neighboring ORFs on sgRNA1. It is noteworthy that, in addition to P3a, the P4 movement protein of PLRV also localizes to PD [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], facilitated by actin- and ER-Golgi-dependent transport [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Ectopically expressed TuYV P4 similarly targets PD but the trafficking pathway has not been studied yet (Julia De Cillia and V.Z-G. personal communication). Like conventional movement proteins MPs, P4 binds single-stranded RNA, dimerizes, is subject to phosphorylation, and increases the PD size exclusion limit [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Remarkably P4 was found to be a host-specific movement protein. PLRV and TuYV P4-deficient mutants were reported to spread systemically in some, but not all, hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This raises questions such as whether P3a and P4 of TuYV act cooperatively on the same viral entity (virions or ribonucleoprotein complexes, RNP), or whether one protein promotes movement of RNP and the other virions. Another alternative mode of action of both P3a and P4 proteins could be that they function on specific PD of certain phloem cells, at certain development stages or even in specific hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Are P3a and P4 proteins specialized for a specific virus transport through &#8220;conventional&#8221; PD or through PPU? Since we have shown that in the absence of P3a TuYV long-distance transport is impaired, it seems more likely that P3a could play a role in the viral movement across PPUs.</p><p>In addition to P4 and P3a, CP and CP-RTD also participate in polerovirus and luteovirus movement. The CP is essential for TuYV long-distance movement through its ability to form particles [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. CP-RTD occurs <italic>in planta</italic> in two forms, the full-length protein (the non-structural form) and CP-RT*, which is a C-terminally truncated form incorporated into virions [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The N-terminal part of the CP-RTD is required for TuYV to move between nucleated vascular cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both CP-RTD and CP-RT* were shown to be required for efficient long distance movement of CABYV [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The discovery that the P3a protein is involved in systemic trafficking adds more complexity to this process.</p><p>Interestingly, assigned (PEMV1) and putative (<italic>Citrus vein enation virus</italic>) members of the third <italic>Luteoviridae</italic> genus, <italic>Enamovirus</italic>, lack ORF3a. They also lack P4, and the carboxy-terminal half of the readthrough domain, both of which have been implicated in cell-to-cell and systemic movement [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Instead, PEMV1 relies on a protein or proteins encoded by an associated umbravirus (PEMV2) for systemic movement in the plant beyond the phloem cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which renders both viruses mechanically transmissible. Apparently, because PEMV has a movement mechanism different from the other <italic>Luteoviridae</italic>, it does not require P4, the C-terminus of RTD, or P3a, which suggests that P3a may act in concert with P4 and the C-terminus of RTD for virus movement. Further understanding of luteo/poleroviral movement will require us to decipher the precise function and interplay of these multiple viral proteins involved in movement.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Computational analyses</title><p>Sequences were processed and analyzed using EMBOSS [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], BLAST [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], CLUSTALW [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and MLOGD [<xref rid="ppat.1004868.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Sequences with coverage of the ORF3/3a region were identified by applying TBLASTN to the NC_004750 (BYDV) P3 amino acid sequence and retaining sequences with &#8805;75% coverage and &#8805;30% identity (parameters sufficient to retrieve all luteovirus and polerovirus sequences with ORF3 coverage, as well as enamovirus sequences which were subsequently excluded), and then retaining sequences with sufficient flanking sequence 5' of the ORF3 AUG in order to cover the ORF3a region. In total, 459 luteovirid ORF3a-region sequences were retrieved (see <xref rid="ppat.1004868.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Datafile</xref>).</p><p>Sequences with complete or near-complete genome coverage were initially selected by taking a length cut-off limit of 5000 nt, followed by semi-automated inspection of ORF lengths and alignments. Sequences which were defective due to obvious disruptions (e.g. premature termination codons or insertions/deletions that disrupted the reading frame) in ORFs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 were removed. Sequences were easily clustered into poleroviruses, luteoviruses and enamoviruses based on genome organization and ORF lengths. BYDV sequences (serotypes PAV, MAV, GAV, PAS and KerII) were separated from other luteovirus clades using a P1 phylogenetic tree (CLUSTALW amino acid alignment; CLUSTALX tree).</p><p>The full-length BYDV nucleotide sequences were aligned initially with CLUSTALW. For the MLOGD analysis and stop codon plots, to produce meaningful results it is important that sequences are aligned in-frame within coding ORFs. To ensure this, the ORF1-ORF2 and ORF3-ORF5 coding blocks were extracted from the BYDV nucleotide alignment; ORFs 1 and 2 were fused in-frame through the artificial insertion of 'N' at the frameshift site; then each of the two regions was translated, re-aligned as amino acid sequences, back-translated to a nucleotide alignment, the previously inserted 'N's in the ORF1-ORF2 alignment were removed, and the re-aligned regions were reinserted into the full-genome alignment. For the pan-polerovirus alignment, nucleotide sequences were too divergent for an initial full-genome nucleotide alignment to provide a suitable scaffold. Thus, for the polerovirus alignment, untranslated regions were not included in the alignment, except for 178 nt of sequence 5' of ORF3 in order to encompass the ORF3a region. For each genome sequence, the ORF0-ORF1-ORF2 and ORF3a-ORF3-ORF5 regions were extracted and the ORFs in each region were fused in-frame through the artificial insertion of 'NN' before the start of ORF1, 'N' at the ORF1/ORF2 frameshift site, and 'NN' before the start of ORF3 (except for NC_006265 where ORFs 3a and 3 do not overlap). Then each of the two regions was translated, aligned as amino acid sequences, back-translated to a nucleotide alignment, and the previously inserted 'N's were removed.</p><p>For the MLOGD analysis and stop codon plots (<xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>), reading frames were defined by mapping sequences onto a specific reference sequence (NC_004750.1 for <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and NC_003743.1 for <xref rid="ppat.1004868.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This is important since reading frames are often not preserved in intergenic regions.
