It is intuitive that natural selection might maintain AP to allow organisms phenotypic flexibility in different environments. However, despite several attempts, little evidence exists for its role in adaptation. We performed a meta-analysis in yeast to identify the genetic basis of AP in bi-parental segregants, natural isolates, and a laboratory strain genome-wide deletion collection, by comparing growth in favorable and stress conditions. We found that whereas AP was abundant in the synthetic populations, it was absent in the natural isolates. This finding indicated resolution of trade-offs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, mitigation of trade-offs over evolutionary history, probably through accumulation of compensatory mutations. In the deletion collection, organizational genes showed AP, suggesting ancient resolutions of trade-offs in the basic cellular pathways. We find abundant AP in the segregants, greater than estimated in the deletion collection or observed in previous studies, with <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005441">IRA2</ext-link></italic>, a negative regulator of the Ras/PKA signaling pathway, showing trade-offs across diverse environments. Additionally, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005441">IRA2</ext-link></italic> and several other Ras/PKA pathway genes showed balancing selection in isolates of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, indicating that multiple alleles maintain AP in this pathway in natural populations. We propose that during AP resolution, retaining the ability to vary signaling pathways such as Ras/PKA, may provide organisms with phenotypic flexibility. However, with increasing organismal complexity AP resolution may become difficult. A partial resolution of AP could manifest as complex human diseases, and the inability to resolve AP may play a role in speciation. Our findings suggest that testing a universal phenomenon like AP across multiple experimental systems may elucidate mechanisms underlying its regulation and evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antagonistic pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>gene&#8722;environment interaction</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>Ras/PKA pathway</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name> DJS Export </meta-name><meta-value>v1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) is the ability of a gene to affect two or more phenotypes in opposite directions. First proposed with reference to reproduction and lifespan (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Williams 1957</xref>), antagonism has now been identified across various traits such as cancer (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Nguyen 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), senescence (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Ungewitter and Scrable 2009</xref>), immunity (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Vincent and Sharp 2014</xref>), metabolic disorders, and sexual antagonism (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Rice 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Foerster <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). One of the principal roles of AP is balancing active growth and cellular robustness (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Holzenberger <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lehtinen <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dowling and Simmons 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Finch 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Campisi <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Oxidative and DNA damage, which accumulate as a consequence of proliferation or from a defense response against pathogens (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lambeth 2007</xref>), eventually compromises regenerative ability, resulting in reduced fitness (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Apel and Hirt 2004</xref>). However, although enhanced stress resistance is associated with increased robustness, it leads to compromised growth (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Honda and Honda 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Holzenberger <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Longo and Finch 2003</xref>), requiring the genome to play a balancing act, which results in AP.</p><p>The existence of such trade-offs in multiple phenotypes results in a paradigm where no single mutation can be advantageous for all phenotypes in all environments (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fisher 1930</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Levins 1968</xref>) and has major implications on rates and limits of adaptation (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Orr 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This has been one of the central components of evolutionary theories, especially those concerning life history traits (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Stearns 1989</xref>). Although genes with antagonistic effects on diverse phenotypes have been identified (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Longo and Finch 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez 2010</xref>), the contribution of these trade-offs in shaping adaptation, and thus modulating phenotypic variance is unclear (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Roff 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Leroi <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wit <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). This is primarily due to limited evidence for the abundance of trade-offs in natural populations (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Leroi <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). This could be either because mutations with detrimental effects are not tolerated and hence selected out of the evolving population or because they show small effect trade-offs and hence are not identifiable in mapping studies. Alternately, it is possible that alleles showing high trade-offs exist but, over the course of evolution, are compensated by other mutations, mitigating (resolving) the trade-offs by reducing the associated fitness cost and compromising their identification. This would then imply that in natural populations, variation is regulated by sets of genes, which balance conditional antagonism and general fitness (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Olson-Manning <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>We used budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as a system to study such trade-offs in growth, in favorable, oxidizing, and DNA-damaging environments. It is well known that different genetic loci regulate traits such as growth and sporulation for strains adapted to laboratory conditions compared with natural strains (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Nogami <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fraser <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In addition, different genetic variants can regulate variation in the same phenotype in different strains (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cubillos <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), emphasizing the importance of the evolutionary history of a strain. Hence, to understand the role of AP in adaptation and its genetic regulation, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate trade-offs in three different experimental paradigms: a genome-wide deletion collection (constructed in a long-established laboratory strain, BY), natural strains (diverse natural isolates of the SGRP collection, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Liti <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in a synthetic recombinant population derived by crossing the laboratory strain (BY) and a wine isolate (RM), which represents an intermediate between the other two experimental populations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Although both the deletion collection and the synthetic population showed trade-offs, very little AP was observed in the natural isolates. Among the synthetic datasets, a greater prevalence of environment dependent trade-offs was observed in the allelic variants than the deletion collection. These observations emphasize the importance of the role of mutations over the role of genes, in regulating AP (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Paaby and Rockman 2014</xref>). Using two-QTL mapping, we demonstrated a possible resolution of this AP in parental combinations, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the parental combinations had less AP compared with each allele independently, suggesting that although a particular allele was capable of showing AP across environments, its effect was mitigated by other variants present in the parental background. In the deletion collection analysis, the highest trade-offs were observed in genes involved in mitochondrial and cellular organization. However, in the recombinant population, we found that <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005441">IRA2</ext-link></italic>, a negative regulator of the Ras/PKA signaling pathway, showed significant AP. Moreover, we found that several other genes of the Ras pathway showed balancing selection in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. These results suggest that in unicellular organisms, AP in key growth pathways such as the Ras/PKA pathway (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Olson-Manning <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) may be resolved over time by spreading the fitness cost to downstream genes, allowing phenotypic flexibility in changing environments. Such a mechanism for resolving AP would allow organisms to retain the ability for rapid phenotypic switching, and may provide a rationale for the formation of regulatory hubs. Partially resolved AP (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dettman <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) or &#8220;frozen in&#8221; resolutions involving multiple genes may also play a key role in speciation. Our results exemplify how investigating a universal phenotype like AP across different strains and experimental systems can help provide insights into its regulation and evolution.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Calculating AP in deletion data</title><p>Growth data and associated microarray files for a genome-wide yeast homozygous deletion collection (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hillenmeyer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) for rich (YPD) and stress [hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, hydroxyurea, and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)] conditions were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chemogenomics.stanford.edu/supplements/global/download.html">http://chemogenomics.stanford.edu/supplements/global/download.html</ext-link>.

In R/qtl GEI mapping, the environment is considered a covariate, and a locus is significant if the phenotype of the two alleles varies with the environment. In contrast, in Slope QTL mapping, a new phenotype, namely an estimate of the slope of the mean of the phenotype measure between pairs of environments, was used for each allele. Such a representation is called &#8220;reaction norms&#8221; (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Pigliucci 2005</xref>). Mapping was then carried out using &#8220;slope&#8221; as a novel phenotype, and a locus was considered significant if the slopes for the two alleles had significantly different values. The majority (81.2%) of the slope QTL overlapped with the GEI QTL; and all the GEI QTL were significant in the slope QTL mapping (permutation cut-off p-value &lt; 0.05). These GEI loci were then categorized as: environment specific (a locus with an effect in only one environment), scale (a similar effect but varying in magnitude in both environments), or antagonistic (with opposite effects in the two environments with the RM allele performing better in one and the BY allele performing better in the other environment, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/TableS5.xls">Table S5</ext-link>, see the section <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>).

The greatest proportion of loci were found in GEI mapping (about 39%), which can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of GEI mapping. 51.6% QTL showed antagonism across at least one environment (p-value &lt; 0.05, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/FigureS2.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/FigureS3.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, A&#8722;C shows examples of loci exhibiting AP across various environments.

Consequently, our results did not support a model, which posits comparatively small effect trade-offs in natural populations. In addition, although both the deletion collection and the recombinant population are synthetic datasets, there is a fundamental difference in the scale of pleiotropy between them. Pleiotropy seems to act at the gene-level for the deletion collection and at a mutation-level for the recombinant population. Because mutation-level pleiotropy is more relevant for evolutionary history (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Paaby and Rockman 2014</xref>), a greater prevalence of AP in recombinant population compared with the deletion collection indicates that AP plays a role in adaptation.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect plots of representative loci across 12 environments.

Environments considered in the study included rich conditions (YPD, YNB), poorly fermentable/nonfermentable carbon sources, and various oxidizing and DNA-damaging agents. Although each condition is known to invoke a unique response, from previous studies we know that similar stresses, such as two nonfermentable carbon sources, have a similar response, which is different from the response to two oxidizing agents (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Broach 2012</xref>). We defined &#8220;Within module&#8221; environments as those that have pairwise similar GEIs, for example, YPD-YNB, xylose-lactose, diamide-hydrogen peroxide, <italic>etc</italic>. We defined &#8220;Across module&#8221; environments as those that are dissimilar with respect to GEIs, for example, YPD <italic>vs.</italic> different kinds of stress environments, such as nutritional or oxidizing stress, <italic>etc</italic>. Two different kinds of stresses also were included in the &#8220;Across module&#8221; category, namely lactose&#8722;hydrogen peroxide. The amount of antagonism observed was significantly greater in the &#8220;Across module&#8221; than the &#8220;Within module&#8221; environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). High antagonism throughout the &#8220;Across module&#8221; environment suggested that AP results not just from adaptation in favorable <italic>vs.</italic> nonfavorable conditions but also when the organism is adapting to a variety of nonfavorable conditions. Although previous studies have shown how mutations acquired during adaptation in a particular environment could show trade-offs in functionally diverse environments (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kvitek and Sherlock 2013</xref>), our results exhibit a high abundance of such trade-offs and how they could be identified with the use of a synthetic recombinant population. In addition, our result suggested that mutations, which show trade-offs, often are retained in parental strains.</p><p>Because our analysis did mapping in a diverse spectrum of environments, we were able to study the effect of each putative locus in different conditions. For example, we found that a large effect locus at chrXIV(469,226) containing <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005029">MKT1</ext-link></italic> performed poorly with the BY allele than with the RM allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but exhibited very little GEI, <italic>i.e.</italic>, it had a similar effect in almost all environments. In contrast, a chrXV locus containing <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005441">IRA2</ext-link></italic> (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Kruglyak 2008</xref>) exhibited a trade-off between nonstress and oxidative and DNA-damaging stress.

In our study, a large sample size and the use of the slope as a phenotype enabled the detection of such epistatic effects (see the section <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). Twenty-five environment-dependent, two-QTL interactions were identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/TableS6.xls">Table S6</ext-link>). A majority of these interactions (20/25) were not significant within either environment but showed an effect on the slope when different environmental pairs were compared. Similar to single QTL mapping where GEI identified QTL that were not significant in either environments, this finding suggests that, genetic interactions, which are insignificant in a single environment, might play a role in adaptation across environments. In other words, small, undetectable effects in each environment might play a significant role in the variation of phenotypes in a different environment.</p><p>The greater antagonism of allelic variants identified in our study (see previous section) implied that there may be a negative association between growth and stress resistance in natural strains. To study this further, we compared the growth for 38 diverse SGRP strains (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Liti <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) in rich growth and DNA-damaging conditions (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Warringer <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Only four strains showed antagonistic growth across at least one environmental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/TableS7.xls">Table S7</ext-link>, see the section <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). This lack of AP in natural populations suggested compensation or resolution of trade-offs over the course of evolution in natural isolates. Because a large number of alleles showed antagonism in the recombinant population, the lack of trade-offs observed in natural isolates suggests that different evolutionary trajectories were taken by the strains while adapting to the same stresses, which resulted in the accumulation of mutations with antagonistic effects detectable in crosses, but without a net difference in adaptation for the natural isolates.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Lack of trade-offs in natural populations.

Although difficult to study and predict in natural strains, such mitigation of trade-offs through various genetic interactions can be explored in a recombinant population where these compensatory interactions become uncoupled. We analyzed environment dependent two-QTL interactions to detect such resolutions. The means of segregants containing various marker combinations were compared, and the difference between the means was used to estimate trade-offs. We found that the occurrence of trade-offs was lower for homozygous parental combinations of the two markers <italic>i.e.</italic>, BY-BY and RM-RM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/TableS6.xls">Table S6</ext-link>).

Using a meta-analytical approach, we studied AP in three diverse experimental systems, which was possible because of the genetic accessibility of yeast as a model system. We showed that, despite the presence of a large number of alleles showing antagonistic effects in the segregating population, there was little evidence of trade-offs in natural isolates. This is probably because strains had evolved compensatory genetic changes over time to reduce the fitness cost associated with AP. Although adaptation to an environment can be brought about by varying multiple regulatory and metabolic processes, signaling pathways can provide greater phenotypic flexibility, allowing both plasticity of response in a new environment and resolution of the associated loss in fitness by cost-sharing it among many genes. Our study suggested that although a variety of cellular processes could regulate fitness traits under selection, passing AP fitness costs to downstream genes, and thereby retaining variation in signaling pathways (such as the Ras/PKA pathway) seems to be a preferred approach used by adapting populations over the course of evolution (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kvitek and Sherlock 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz and Cohen 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although both the deletion collection and the segregant populations showed AP, it was more prevalent in the latter, implying that genes showing trade-off tended to be polymorphic in natural populations. However, the poor overlap between genes showing trade-offs and functional allelic variants in natural populations (9 of 93, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/02/23/g3.115.017020.DC1/TableS9.xls">Table S9</ext-link>), and the presence of purifying selection on deletion collection genes which showed trade-off (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Qian <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) indicated that trade-offs and adaptation in natural populations is regulated by genes distinct from those identified by deletion analysis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Nogami <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fraser <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). This observation suggested that conclusions about the evolutionary role of genetic variants identified by gene deletion studies should be treated with caution.</p><p>As shown by various laboratory-based evolution studies (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kvitek and Sherlock 2013</xref>), a high prevalence of AP in the segregant population suggested that as strains evolve, they accumulate beneficial mutations to adapt to the immediate environment, independent of the antagonistic effects in other environments. However, how populations showing AP escape its effects in detrimental environments is not known (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kvitek and Sherlock 2013</xref>). By comparing QTL and two-QTL mapping, we propose that a common mechanism to reduce this cost could be to accumulate new mutations to mitigate the effect of AP and allow the organism to adapt to the environment where it was previously deleterious. This mechanism explains why, despite a lack of overall trade-offs between divergent strains, antagonistic alleles from both parents can be identified in a recombinant population. The reason for this is that in the natural strains, trade-off was mitigated over time by passing on fitness costs to many loci, which become visible when they become unlinked in the cross. This unlinking of resolved trade-offs can also explain the high transgressive variation observed in such segregating populations (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Tanksley 1993</xref>). In a novel environment, a meiotic event between two such strains would disperse multiple adaptive alleles (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 2012</xref>). Hence, this process may also be a mechanism adopted by populations to maintain genetic memory of trade-offs, allowing the organism to remain poised to adapt to unfavorable conditions without a detrimental effect. Conversely, if antagonistic epistasis mitigates large effect trade-offs, then a hybrid would have a lower overall fitness than either parent (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dobzhansky 1970</xref>). Such heterozygote inferiority could then encourage reproductive isolation of the two strains, ultimately leading to strain or species diversification (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dettman <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p><p>The Ras/PKA pathway regulates multiple phenotypes across taxa, including reproduction, development, longevity and metabolism. Activation of the Ras pathway results in active growth, and consequently, it is down-regulated when proliferation is not preferred or required, such as when cells are under stress or are differentiated. However, although the Ras pathway antagonistically regulates cellular growth and robustness, it provides scope for compensation of defects associated with these phenotypes. We show that some natural yeast isolates employ the Ras pathway during adaptation to achieve higher stress resistance without the associated growth defect. In humans, ~20% of all tumors have Ras mutations (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Downward 2003</xref>). Although overproliferation would make a (malignant) cell vulnerable to stresses resulting in programmed cell death and eventual tumor regression, mutations in this pathway (EGFR pathway) can bypass this by developing survival adaptation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Rajput <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Similarly, although mutations in various signaling pathways (Ras, TOR, and their downstream transcription factors) increase longevity at the cost of reduced growth, yeast lacking <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005042">RAS2</ext-link></italic> and worms with <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation overcome this growth defect (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Longo and Finch 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Longo 2004</xref>). This consistent ability to balance various antagonistic phenotypes could explain the &#8220;conserved yet polymorphic&#8221; nature of such a central pathway, not just in yeast but also across taxa (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Ponce <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Jovelin and Phillips 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Luisi <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). This ability to fine-tune various fitness traits, most likely through different epistatic interactions, may be the result of the high connectivity of this pathway (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Olson-Manning <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Similar effects also are seen on other pathways that are hubs in the cellular machinery, such as the p53 pathway (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Atwal <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Ungewitter and Scrable 2009</xref>). Indeed, as organisms became complex, the requirement to balance multiple antagonistic phenotypes might be the reason that gene and protein networks developed regulatory hubs controlling basic cellular pathways, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy and anoikis. One may also speculate that partially resolved AP in such key pathways may be the reason for rapid speciation following an extinction event, as organisms scramble to adapt to novel niches and environmental conditions which open up as recombinants suddenly find themselves adapted to the new situation.</p><p>Our results show how the effect of a QTL on regulating a phenotype is heavily dependent on both the environment considered (pleiotropy and trade-off) and the genetic background (accumulated mutations). This results in a high environment and strain dependence of effect of QTL observed both in yeast and other model systems like <italic>Drosophila</italic> resulting in a lack of reproducibility of QTL identified across experiments (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Macdonald and Long 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">&gt;Cubillos <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Abundant environmental AP and its resolution in different natural isolates provide an explanation for identification of different QTL across various studies. Although difficult in other model systems, accessibility to gene level resolution and genetic manipulation techniques like reciprocal hemizygosity analysis, RHA (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), in yeast can help predict and test the reproducibility of QTL regulating various phenotypes. For example: <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005029">MKT1</ext-link></italic> is a regulator of stress response with pleiotropic effects on growth, and is non-functional in the laboratory strain BY. As a result, it is identified in all synthetic crosses which have BY as one of the two parents (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), which includes a recombinant population derived from a cross between BY and a clinical isolate YJM789. Other such examples include <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000003520">MAL13</ext-link></italic> and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000000911">FLO8</ext-link></italic>, both of which are nonfunctional in the laboratory strain, probably resulting from decades (many million generations) of domestication on a rich medium, which make them identifiable in various recombinant populations. In contrast, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000004022">RAD5</ext-link></italic> is a DNA helicase involved in DNA damage tolerance and is nonfunctional in RM making it more susceptible to DNA damaging stress. It is therefore, not identified in a cross between BY and a clinical isolate (YJM789) or an oak strain (SK1) (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Gerke <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Although our analysis of a cross between BY and RM has identified <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/locus.fpl?dbid=S000005441">IRA2</ext-link></italic>, and hence the Ras/PKA pathway, as a key player in the regulation of growth related AP, analyzing recombinant populations derived from other diverse parental strains, and using a larger natural population may identify other pathways contributing to AP regulations and provide a deeper understanding of the role of trade-offs in determining adaptation and evolution.</p><p>In conclusion, our study exemplifies the power of using the diverse sets of experimental systems available to study yeast to address a fundamental question, which is to understand the mechanisms underlying maintenance or resolution of AP. In our approach, the use of three different experimental systems was key to our ability to interpret and elucidate possible mechanisms responsible for the observed inconsistency in AP abundance seen in different studies. Our results suggest that over the course of evolution, mutations accumulate to mitigate trade-offs, preventing the detection of AP in natural populations. However, such resolutions can be identified using methods presented here by studying recombinant populations, where these resolutions become visible due to uncoupling of genetic interactions. Our findings suggest that studying various complex disorders using an evolutionary and adaptive perspective may be a fruitful way to understand mechanisms underlying their regulation and origins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Professors Arnold J.
