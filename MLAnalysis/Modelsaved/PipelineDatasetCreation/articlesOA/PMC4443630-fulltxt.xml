Toxicity was reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 111 patients with 114 centrally located lung tumors (48&#160;T1-T2,N0,M0 NSCLC and 66 lung metastases) were treated with SBRT at 19 academic and community-based radiotherapy centers in the US and Germany. Median follow-up was 17&#160;months (range, 1&#8211;72). Median age was 74&#160;years for primary NSCLC patients and 65&#160;years for lung metastases patients (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). SBRT dose varied from 16 &#8211; 60&#160;Gy (median 48&#160;Gy) delivered in 1&#8211;5 fractions (median 4 fractions). Median dose to centrally located primary NSCLC was 48&#160;Gy compared to 37.5&#160;Gy for lung metastases (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0001) and median BED<sub>10</sub> was 105.6&#160;Gy for primary NSCLC and 93.6&#160;Gy for lung metastases (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0005). Two-year OS for T1N0M0 and T2N0M0 NSCLC was 79 and 32.1&#160;%, respectively (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.009) and 2-year OS for lung metastases was 49.6&#160;%.

SBRT has achieved LC and OS rates comparable to lobectomy in non-randomized studies in medically inoperable or elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. SBRT can also achieve high LC and low toxicity in patients with peripheral lung metastases and limited oligometastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is increasing interest in SBRT for the treatment of centrally located lung lesions and identifying an optimal efficacious SBRT dose that is safe to deliver. Early reports of SBRT for the treatment of centrally located lung tumors indicated high rates of treatment-related toxicities and treatment-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a Phase II study, Timmerman <italic>et al.</italic> reported excessive Grade 3&#8211;5 toxicity in patients with centrally located NSCLC treated with 60 &#8211; 66&#160;Gy delivered in 3 fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Two-year freedom from severe toxicity was only 54&#160;% in patients with central tumors compared to 83&#160;% for patients with peripheral tumors. Song <italic>et al.</italic> reported 33&#160;% Grade 3&#8211;5 toxicity in patients with centrally located Stage I NSCLC treated with 40 &#8211; 60&#160;Gy in 3&#8211;4 fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Eight of nine patients with tumors adjacent to the bronchus resulted in bronchial strictures and secondary loss of lung volume. The close proximity of normal critical organs including the heart, bronchus, esophagus and trachea to centrally located lung tumors, create a challenge of achieving an efficacious SBRT dose while limiting dose to normal tissues.</p><p>In more recent studies, SBRT treatment of centrally located lung tumors has shown promising results in a subset of patients. In these studies, SBRT doses of 23 &#8211; 70&#160;Gy delivered over 1&#8211;10 fractions to central lung tumors resulted in LC rates of 60 &#8211; 100&#160;% and OS rates of 12 &#8211; 74&#160;% at 2&#8211;3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Acceptable toxicity profiles were achieved when strict normal tissue dose constraints were adhered to, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] however, some authors report Grade 3 and higher pulmonary toxicities with some Grade 5 toxicity related to the SBRT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0813 study was initiated to assess five-fraction SBRT regimens for early-stage, centrally located NSCLC in medically inoperable patients. The results of this study, however, will not be available for several more years. In the meantime, community-based practices and academic centers are treating patients with centrally located lung tumors with large variations in SBRT dose and fractionation regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Until the optimal SBRT dose/fractionation regimens and doses to normal tissues for central tumors are determined, it will be critical for treating centers to combine data collection efforts to gain clinical evidence to support or redefine SBRT for centrally located tumors.</p><p>The RSSearch&#174; Patient Registry is an international database designed to standardize the collection of screening, treatment and outcome data for patients treated with radiosurgery and SBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. RSSearch&#174; currently includes over 15,000 enrolled patients treated with radiosurgery/SBRT. Initial analysis of RSSearch&#174; reported lung tumors as the most common extra-cranial treatment location, with over 5,500 patients with thoracic lesions treated with SBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to report on treatment management practices, toxicity, OS and LC of centrally located early-stage NSCLC and lung metastases from patients enrolled in RSSearch&#174; Patient Registry, thus representing a real-world setting. Patients with recurrent lung lesions or prior radiation therapy in the SBRT-treated area were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A retrospective analysis of patients with centrally located, early stage T1-T2N0M0 NSCLC or lung metastases and enrolled in the RSSearch&#174; Patient Registry (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01885299">NCT01885299</ext-link>) was performed. The RSSearch&#174; Patient Registry is managed by the Radiosurgery Society&#174;, a non-profit professional medical society. A description of the methodology, database design and initial patient and treatment characteristics of patients enrolled in RSSearch&#174; has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The database is housed by an independent third-party, Advertek<sup>SM</sup>, Inc. (Louisville, KY) and meets all requirements to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Safe Harbor Policy to maintain system security, transmission of data and patient confidentiality. All centers treating patients with SBRT clinically are offered and encouraged to participate in RSSearch&#174;. Participation is voluntary and no compensation is provided either to patients or participating centers. Each principal investigator is provided a copy of the RSSearch&#174; Registry protocol, case report forms, sample patient informed consent, and web-based training for data entry and database navigation. Local Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) approval is required at all participating centers. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, as required by individual IRB/ECs, prior to the patient&#8217;s data entered into the RSSearch&#174; Registry. The selection of centers for this study included RSSearch&#174; participating centers that treated patients with centrally located T1-T2,N0,M0 NSCLC or lung metastasis with SBRT between November 2004 to January 2014, with complete data entry fields for screening, treatment and follow-up (minimum survival data) for their respective patients. Central lesions were defined as lesions within 2&#160;cm of the bronchial tree, trachea, major vessels, esophagus, heart, pericardium, or brachial plexus. Patients with recurrent lung lesions or prior radiation therapy in the SBRT-treated area were excluded from the analysis. Patients were treated at 18 institutions located in the US and one center located in Munich, Germany.</p><p>Because this is a registry, there were no pre-defined treatment planning criteria and treatment planning was done per institutional guidelines. All patients were simulated supine, in the treatment position. Planning computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained above and below the region of interest in expiration, inspiration and free breathing. One mm slice thickness reconstructions in the axial plane were transferred to the treatment planning station. Diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) scan images were routinely used for image fusion to aid target volume delineation. Target volumes were delineated by the treating physician (radiation oncologist, pulmonologist, or surgeon) using all available imaging studies, typically including at least CT and PET scanning. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was generally used as the clinical target volume (CTV), and a margin of 3&#8211;10&#160;mm was used to delineate the planning target volume (PTV). All planning was performed using inverse planning on the MultiPlan&#174; System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA) allowing non-isocentric, and non-coplanar radiation delivery using either a ray tracing algorithm or Monte Carlo calculations. All patients were treated using CyberKnife&#174; Stereotactic Radiosurgery System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA). Real time tumor tracking was accomplished using Synchrony&#174; Respiratory Motion Tracking System, which synchronizes the beam delivery with the motion of the target resulting from respiration, without the need to interrupt the treatment or move the patient. All patients were treated according to the respective institutional guidelines. To compare the effects of various treatment protocols with different treatment fraction sizes and doses, the biologically effective dose (BED) was calculated using the linear quadratic model; as BED&#8201;=&#8201;<italic>D</italic><sub>*</sub>(1&#8201;+&#8201;<italic>d</italic>/&#945;/&#946;) where <italic>D</italic> is the total dose, <italic>d</italic> is the dose per fraction and the &#945;/&#946; ratio for the tumor was 10&#160;Gy. Normal tissue dose restraints were reported by the treating institutions and captured in RSSearch&#174; as the maximum point dose and interquartile range for each structure.</p><p>Patient follow-up was performed per institutional guidelines. All participating centers reported follow-up clinical and imaging data. Local control was evaluated independently for each lesion at the participating institution following a modified RECIST (Response Evaluation and Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Local progression was defined as at least a 20&#160;% increase in the size of lesions and/or appearance of one or more lesions in target treatment location, LC defined as disappearance of, decrease in, or no increase in size of the treated lesions. An independent audit by a contracted third party was conducted on 10&#160;% of patients to assess accuracy and completeness of RSSearch&#174; data. De-identified medical records, including consultation reports, diagnostic imaging reports, pathology reports, treatment planning and delivery records, follow-up consultation reports and imaging reports were reviewed and compared to data recorded in RSSearch&#174;. Any missing information or deviations were immediately reported to the participating center and corrections were made prior to data analysis.</p><p>Analyses of LC, and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. LC was analyzed for each treated tumor whereas analysis of OS was calculated for every patient. Specific cause of death was not reported for all patients in RSSearch&#174; and therefore not evaluated in this study. Subgroups were compared using <italic>X</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> and log-rank statistics. Values of p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 were considered statistically significant. For primary central lung tumors significant factors including age, T Stage and BED, were included in a multivariate Cox regression model. Statistical calculations were conducted using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) and STATA (StatCorp LP, TX). Toxicity was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3 (CTCAEv3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient and treatment characteristics</title><p>From November 2005 to January 2014, 111 patients with centrally located early-stage T1-T2N0M0 NSCLC (47 patients) or lung metastases (64 patients) were treated with SBRT.

The median Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) was 80&#160;% (range 60&#8211;100) in both cohorts. Sixty-four percent of primary NSCLC patients were considered to be surgically/medically inoperable and 37&#160;% of patients with lung metastases; the remaining patients refused other treatment options. The majority of patients with primary NSCLC (77&#160;%) had no prior treatment, whereas the majority of patients with lung metastases had received prior treatments including chemotherapy (68&#160;%), surgery (26&#160;%), immunotherapy (9&#160;%) and radiofrequency ablation (4&#160;%). Patients that received previous radiation therapy in the SBRT-treated area were excluded from this study. Histological confirmation was available for all primary NSCLC cases, of which 46&#160;% were squamous cell carcinoma, 48&#160;% NSCLC not otherwise specified, and 6&#160;% adenocarcinoma. Fifty-six percent were staged T1N0M0 and 44&#160;% staged T2N0M0.

Overall, patients with primary NSCLC were older and received greater prescribed dose, Dmax and BED<sub>10</sub> compared to lung metastases. Despite this heterogeneous cohort, we observed OS rates comparable to other published reports of SBRT for the treatment of centrally located lung tumors (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Overall survival rates range from 12 to 74&#160;%, with patients with advanced disease or lung metastases having worse OS compared to those with Stage I disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Milano <italic>et al.</italic> reported 2-year OS for centrally located lung cancer patients with Stage I, Stage II-III and lung metastases treated with SBRT of 72, 12 and 49&#160;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In our study, two-year OS rates for T1, T2 and lung metastases were 79, 32.1 and 49.6&#160;%, respectively, which is in line with published reports.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Summary of published studies of SBRT-treated centrally located lung tumors</p></caption></table-wrap></p><p>For centrally located lung tumors, LC at 2-years after SBRT ranges from 60 &#8211; 100&#160;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We observed a 2-year LC rate of 76.4 and 69.8&#160;% for primary NSCLC and lung metastases, respectively, which is comparable to results in the literature for this heterogeneous population. Multiple factors including T stage, tumor size, and BED<sub>10</sub> have been reported as predictors for LC in other studies of SBRT for central and peripheral lung tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A perplexing finding in our study however, is that age, T stage and BED<sub>10</sub> were not prognostic factors for LC on univariate or multivariate analysis within our cohort. One potential explanation is that there were few patients in our study that received BED<sub>10</sub>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;100&#160;Gy and which may impact statistical power. Other factors that may contribute include the heterogeneity of the patients and participating centers. Our study included 19 centers with patients treated with SBRT from 2004 to 2014. The experience of the treating centers and technological advancements have most likely improved over time and may contribute to factors that affect statistical considerations.</p><p>There are a limited number of multi-center studies that have reported on clinical outcomes for SBRT treatment for central lung lesions and to our knowledge, this is one of the largest to date. Schanne <italic>et al.</italic> recently reported a multi-center study from Germany and Austria, which included 90 patients with centrally located Stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT doses of 24&#8211;60&#160;Gy over 1&#8211;18 fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There was substantial variability in the prescribed dose across centers, which is similar to what we observed in our study. In the German/Austrian study, the median BED<sub>10</sub> was 72&#160;Gy, and the 1- and 3-year freedom from local progression was 76 and 52&#160;%, respectively. As a comparison, RSSearch&#174; patients with primary NSCLC received a median BED<sub>10</sub> of 105.2&#160;Gy and 1- and 2-year LC rates were 89.2 and 72.4&#160;%, respectively. The overall higher BED<sub>10</sub> in our study may be a contributing factor to improved LC compared to results in Schanne <italic>et al.</italic></p><p>Escalating SBRT dose can result in improvements in LC for central lung tumors, however pulmonary toxicities and treatment-related deaths have been reported in patients where high doses per fractions were given and/or critical organs at risk (esophagus, heart, great vessels, brachial plexus) were in the high dose volume region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Unger <italic>et al.</italic> reported on 20 patients with hilar lung tumors located next to the mainstem bronchus treated with 30&#8211;40&#160;Gy in 5 fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this report, one patient with a large GTV (182&#160;cm<sup>3</sup>) had an acute Grade 2 esophagitis, where the Dmax to the esophagus approached 40&#160;Gy. In our study, we also observed a patient with a para-tracheal metastasis with Grade 1 esophagitis that received Dmax of 40.8&#160;Gy to the esophagus. The MDACC group has recently revised its recommendation of dose constraints for normal tissues and recommend a Dmax of&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;35&#160;Gy to the esophagus to limit Grade 2 or higher esophagitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients with central tumors are at higher risk of Grade 3 and higher toxicities compared to patients with peripheral tumors treated with SBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The type and severity of toxicities vary for each individual study. Rowe <italic>et al.</italic> reported on 47 patients with central lung lesions treated mainly with 50&#160;Gy in 4 fractions. In this study, toxicity was minimal with four patients (9&#160;%) experiencing Grade 3dyspnea. There were no Grade 4 toxicities, however, one patient with a 5.7&#160;cm pulmonary metastasis abutting the left mainstem bronchus suffered a Grade 5 toxicity and died of respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Chang <italic>et al.</italic> reported on 100 patients with primary or recurrent NSCLC treated with SBRT with 13&#160;% of patients with Grade 2 chest-wall pain and 1&#160;% of patients with Grade 3 pneumonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There were no Grade 4 or higher toxicities. Overall, reported toxicities in our study were low compared to other published reports, with no Grade 3 or higher toxicities. A limitation of our study, as with retrospective studies, is the potential for underreporting. To address this issue, we did conduct an independent audit of 10&#160;% of patients to verify data completeness and accuracy prior to data analysis, however to completely address the concern of under-reported toxicities, multi-center prospective studies designed to address toxicity are needed.</p><p>Another unique feature of this study is that all patients were treated with the CyberKnife&#174; Stereotactic Radiosurgery System with Synchrony&#174; Respiratory Tracking System. The CyberKnife with Synchrony Tracking System uses image-guidance and real-time motion management to accurately deliver high doses of radiation to tumors that move with respiration. Studies reporting SBRT treatment of centrally located tumors using the CyberKnife System have resulted in excellent clinical outcomes with low incidence of toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A potential advantage of the CyberKnife System using Synchrony is the capability to track tumor motion, leading to a reduced margin (typically 3&#8211;10&#160;mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], in comparison with linac-based systems that use breath-hold techniques or respiratory gating, where the tumor position is generated from different phases of respiration and typically include an 5&#8211;10&#160;mm margin to compensate for tumor motion with an addition small margin for set-up uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This reduction in margin may spare adjacent normal tissues from receiving high doses of radiation, thereby resulting in low toxicities. Future studies need to be done to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes. In principle SBRT treatments maximize the delivery of prescribed dose to the tumor with a rapid fall off of dose to the surrounding normal tissue. A potential advantage of the CyberKnife System is it&#8217;s intrinsic ability to create a treatment plan which includes hundreds of non-isocentric beams cumulating the dose in target volume and minimizing the dose fall off, thereby sparing organs at risk. Studies have shown improvements in treatment plan quality when using non-coplanar beams with sufficient quality and quantity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Rossi <italic>et al.</italic> showed that CyberKnife treatment plans generated with non-coplanar beams were superior in regards to sparing organs at risk compared to plans generated with only coplanar beams and that plan quality improved with increasing number of involved beams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is important to note that treatment plan generation is highly operator dependent and studies assessing clinical outcomes as a result of CyberKnife treatment plan optimization for central lung patients have not been reported. There is also scarcity of literature on the comparative efficacy and toxicity of various SBRT techniques. Furthermore, future studies need to be done to assess the effects of SBRT on long-term outcomes on centrally-located lung tumors.</p><p>Patient registries, like RSSearch&#174;, have the ability to accumulate data from a large number of patients in a relatively short time and thus, outcomes from patient registries can be reported years before outcomes of prospective clinical trials. Studies from patient registries will not replace randomized clinical trials, however outcomes from patient registries can complement cooperative group studies as well as generate hypotheses for future studies. In summary, this observational study it is one of the largest patient registries to report treatment management practices of SBRT for centrally located tumors in a real world setting. It adds to the increasing body of evidence for SBRT for centrally located lung tumors and provides support for future prospective studies to define the optimal SBRT dose for centrally located lung tumors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, patients with centrally located primary NSCLC and lung metastases were treated with SBRT doses ranging from 16 &#8211; 60&#160;Gy (median 48&#160;Gy) and delivered in 1&#8211;5 fractions. Overall, patients with primary NSCLC were older and received higher SBRT doses as compared to patients with lung metastases. Despite these differences, we observed excellent LC and OS rates. Toxicities were low, however, low grade toxicities were observed in patients with large tumors or where normal tissues where included in the high dose volume region. This study contributes to the growing evidence to support SBRT for the treatment of centrally located lung tumors, however, prospective studies are needed to define the optimal SBRT dose/regimens while respecting normal tissue dose constraints to minimize toxicities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Frank Kimsey has stock ownership in CyberKnife of Chattanooga, LLC.
