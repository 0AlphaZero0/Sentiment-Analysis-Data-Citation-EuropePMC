Metabolism in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> has a limited complexity thus making metabolic enzymes ideal targets for drug development. However, only few metabolic pathways (i.e., carbohydrates) have been described so far. Recently, the parasite homolog of the mitochondrial-like glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gG3PD) has been identified among the interactors of the g14-3-3 protein. G3PD is involved in glycolysis, electron transport, glycerophospholipids metabolism, and hyperosmotic stress response, and is emerging as promising target in tumor treatment. In this work, we demonstrate that gG3PD is a functional flavoenzyme able to convert glycerol-3-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and that its activity and the intracellular glycerol level increase during encystation. Taking advantage of co-immunoprecipitation assays and deletion mutants, we provide evidence that gG3PD and g14-3-3 interact at the trophozoite stage, the intracellular localization of gG3PD is stage dependent and it partially co-localizes with mitosomes during cyst development. Finally, we demonstrate that the gG3PD activity is affected by the antitumoral compound 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol, that results more effective <italic>in vitro</italic> at killing <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites than the reference drug metronidazole. Overall, our results highlight the involvement of gG3PD in processes crucial for the parasite survival thus proposing this enzyme as target for novel antigiardial interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic></kwd><kwd>FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phoshate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>14-3-3 protein</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitosome</kwd><kwd>encystation</kwd><kwd>NBDHEX</kwd><kwd>nitroreduction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="72"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The flagellated protozoan <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> (syn. <italic>lamblia</italic>, <italic>intestinalis</italic>) is a parasite of the upper part of small intestine of mammals, including humans. Infection with <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> causes giardiasis, one of the most common foodborne and waterborne gastroenteric diseases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Halliez and Buret, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ryan and Cacci&#242;, 2013</xref>). The parasite has a simple two-stages life cycle consisting of the trophozoite, that replicates and colonizes the host intestine causing symptoms, and the cyst, the environmentally resistant stage that is spread with feces and is responsible for transmission of the infection. Generally, infection is acquired by ingestion of cysts in contaminated water and food or by the fecal&#8211;oral route (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ryan and Cacci&#242;, 2013</xref>). Clinical symptoms of giardiasis can vary from asymptomatic infection to acute and chronic diarrhea, ultimately leading to chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal complications, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Halliez and Buret, 2013</xref>). Up to date, no human vaccine for giardiasis is available and treatment relies only on a limited panel of effective approved drugs. Nitroheterocyclics, such as metronidazole (MTZ) and nitazoxanide (NTZ), are the antigiardial drugs of choice. Unfortunately, treatment failure has been reported in 10&#8211;20% of cases and strains resistant to different compounds have been either clinically isolated or induced <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lalle, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Watkins and Eckmann, 2014</xref>). In this scenario, alternative, safe, and effective therapies are required.</p><p><italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> has a peculiar energy metabolism. It is a microaerophilic organism that, instead of mitochondria, contains mitosomes, highly reduced mitochondria-derived organelles which sole function seems to be restricted to Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tovar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jedelsk&#253; et al., 2011</xref>). Energy is then generated by substrate level phosphorylation and fermentation occurring in the cytoplasm or at the inner side of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adam, 2001</xref>). In terms of sequence similarity, these metabolic pathways of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> consist of a mixture of eukaryote-like and bacteria-like enzymes. Therefore, energy and intermediate metabolism of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> have been shown to provide opportunities to identify novel and effective compounds, as well as potentially interesting targets by means of high-throughput drug screening and target-based drug design (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">M&#252;ller and Hemphill, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Watkins and Eckmann, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We recently detected a putative glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/flavin-dependent oxidoreductase (gG3PD, GL50803_16125) of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> among proteins interacting with the parasite 14-3-3 isoform, g14-3-3 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lalle et al., 2012</xref>). The 14-3-3s are a family of highly conserved eukaryotic phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding proteins which participate to the regulation of key cellular processes by direct interaction with 100s of target proteins (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gardino and Yaffe, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kleppe et al., 2011</xref>). The characterized g14-3-3 interactome provides evidences that g14-3-3 can be involved in parasite energy metabolism, as supported by the identification and confirmation of components of both the glycolytic/gluconeogenetic pathway and pyruvate metabolism (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lalle et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD, EC 1.1.5.3) is a key enzyme at the crossroad of glycolysis, redox, and fatty acid metabolism, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. G3PD catalyzes the oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) to dihydroxyaceton phosphate (DHAP) with simultaneous reduction of FAD to FADH<sub>2</sub> and transfer of electrons to quinones (e.g., ubiquinone; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Unden and Bongaerts, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>). In eukaryotes, a single subunit enzyme (mG3PD, 69&#8211;75 kDa) is strongly associated, as peripheral protein, with the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Janssen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>). The mG3PD has multiple functions: (i) it forms the glycerophosphate shuttle in combination with the cytosolic NADH-dependent G3PD (cG3PD, EC 1.1.1.8) to re-oxidize the cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis; (ii) it is part of the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain (ETC) channeling electron to quinone pool and bypassing Complex I; (iii) it regulates the cytosolic level of G3P (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bell and Coleman, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>). Prokaryotes harbor two distinct membrane-associated FAD-dependent G3PDs, both necessary for bacterial growth in presence of glycerol or G3P as sole carbon source, and represent key primary dehydrogenases transferring reducing equivalents to a short respiratory ETC with different terminal reductases and electron acceptor (O<sub>2</sub>, nitrate, or fumarate; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Unden and Bongaerts, 1997</xref>). The homodimeric GlpD is associated with the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane, shows 30&#8211;33% homology with eukaryotic mG3PD, and is expressed under aerobic conditions when O<sub>2</sub> is the terminal acceptor (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Walz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2008</xref>). The heterotrimeric GlpACB is induced under anaerobic conditions, with fumarate as terminal acceptor (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Varga and Weiner, 1995</xref>): it forms a functional-associated complex with fumarate reductase and contributes to generate a proton gradient across the membrane via an associated ETC (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Miki and Wilson, 1978</xref>). The GlpAC heterodimer (62 and 41 kDa, respectively) is the soluble catalytic subunit, containing the FAD and FMN binding sites (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1988</xref>). The GlpB (44 kDa) subunit, that contains a ferredoxin-type (4Fe-4S) cluster binding motif, anchors the GlpAC dimer to the inner cytoplasmic membrane and mediate the transfer of reducing equivalent to the menaquinone pool and finally to the fumarate reductase (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Varga and Weiner, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The G3PDs are also involved in pathogenicity as a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mG3PD has been implied in the establishment of a pro-oxidative environment that promotes the fast growth of undifferentiated tumors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chowdhury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the oxidase activity of GlpD of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp. seems to be crucial for the pathogenicity, leading to high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and host cell damage (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gro&#223;hennig et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we investigated gG3PD expression, activity, and cellular localization in the <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoite stage and during the encystation process. Moreover, we demonstrated that the antitumoral compound [NBDHEX, 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol] is an effective antigiardial compound that negatively affected gG3PD activity. Overall, our results pointed out the role of gG3PD in biological processes crucial for the parasite survival, thus suggesting that this enzyme could represent a good candidate for targeted antigiardial interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>The NBDHEX was synthetized as previously described (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al., 2005</xref>).

The plates were sealed with an air-tight adhesive tape (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Austria) and incubated for 48 h at 37&#176;C. After the incubation period, culture medium was removed. Adherent trophozoites were immediately fixed with 300 &#956;l of methanol for 2 min and then stained with a solution of 0.1% methylene blue in PBS for 10 min at RT. Wells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 200 &#956;l of ethanol and 0.1 M HCI [1:1 (v/v) in H<sub>2</sub>O], to elute the dye. Absorbance was determined at 655 nm by Multiskan Spectrum (Thermo Scientific) microplate spectrophotometer. Growth inhibition was calculated as the percentage of treated parasite in comparison with untreated parasite. Three independent experiments were performed and each drug dilution was assayed in triplicate. Alternatively, for drug efficacy tests with resazurin (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">B&#233;n&#233;r&#233; et al., 2007</xref>), trophozoites were grown in the presence of serial dilutions of the drugs, or DMSO as control, in an anaerobic growth chamber (100% N<sub>2</sub>, 37&#176;C).

Nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS) analysis of peptide mixtures was performed using an HPLC Ultimate 3000 (DIONEX, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) coupled with a linear ion trap (LTQ, Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer. Peptides were desalted in a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, LC Packings, DIONEX) and separated in the analytical column, a 10 cm long fused silica capillary (Silica Tips FS 360-75-8, New Objective) in house slurry-packed with a 5 &#956;m, 200 &#197; pore size C18 resin (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA, USA). Peptides were eluted using a 40 min linear gradient from 96% aqueous buffer containing 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid to 60% organic buffer constituted by acetonitrile with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.1% formic acid, at 300 nL/min flow rate.

Tandem mass spectra were matched against the <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> protein database (Giardia DB version 1.2) downloaded from the Web site http://www.giardiadb.org/giardiadb and through the SEQUEST algorithm incorporated in the Bioworks software (version 3.3, Thermo Electron). The following match parameters were considered: fully tryptic cleavage constraints (one miscleavage allowed), static cysteine carbamidomethylation, and variable methionine oxidation. Precursor and fragment ions were searched with 1.5 and 1 Da tolerance, respectively. Possible NBDHEX adducts on cysteine or lysine residues were searched. The mass increments considered were +296, +281, +265 Da, for the intact, partially or completely nitro-reduced NBDHEX adducts, respectively.

A combined search for conserved regions in the gG3PD protein sequence retrieved three principal domains (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1A</xref>). The region encompassing residues 31&#8211;510 contains the multidomain TIGR03377 corresponding to the protein family of the subunit A (GlpA) of anaerobic GlpACB. A second domain, residues 587&#8211;910, corresponds to a small NADH binding domain within a larger FAD binding domain (Pyr_redox_2, PF07992) which is common to flavoproteins of the pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases family [e.g., thioredoxin reductases (TRxR), NADH oxidases, and peroxidases]. The last domain (DUF 1667), encompassing residues 1039&#8211;1103, was previously found in archaeal and bacterial hypothetical proteins, some of which are annotated as being potential metal-binding proteins. As for other G3PDs, no TM regions could be detected. Due to its unusual domain organization, the full-length or three portions (residues 1&#8211;510, 511&#8211;950, and 951&#8211;111) of the gG3PD protein sequence were used as query against a large non-redundant set of high quality reference genomes obtained from EggNog. Despite an homologous sequence present in the genome of the closely related diplomonad <italic>Spironucleus salmonicida</italic>, only protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Entamoeba</italic> encode for a single sequence orthologous to the full length gG3PD and also annotated as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. One orthologue of the first two portions of the gG3PD was found in the genomes of <italic>Eggerthella</italic> sp., a non-sporulating medically important anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus, and annotated as FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. On the contrary several hundred orthologues of the first portion of gG3PD (residues 1&#8211;510), all annotated as glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenases, were found in the genome of human and animal pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>Treponema</italic> sp. (Spirochaetes) and <italic>Clostridium</italic> sp. (Firmicutes), or to halophilic archaea, e.g., <italic>Halorhabdus utahensis</italic>, (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B</xref>). More than 100 orthologues of the second portion (residues 501&#8211;950) were found in human and animal pathogenic bacteria, but also in soil and plant bacteria (data not shown). Although several of these proteins were annotated as oxidoreductases it was not possible to define, in terms of substrate or biochemical pathway, any specific enzymatic function. Finally, only 33 orthologues were found respect to the third portion of gG3PD (residues 951&#8211;111), which putative function could be that of metal-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>The Intracellular Localization and Stage Expression of gG3PD Protein</title><p>According to the data reported in GiardiaDB, the expression level of the <italic>gg3pd</italic> is downregulated during encystation. To investigate whether the gG3PD protein expression level was similarly regulated we used a mouse polyclonal antibody raised against a full-length HIS-tagged recombinant gG3PD expressed in bacteria. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, a band of approximately 120 kDa was immunodecorated with comparable intensity by the anti-gG3PD Ab, both in cellular lysates from trophozoites and from parasites harvested at different time points after encystation induction (at 6, 12, and 24 h). Encystation progress was checked by immunostaining with anti-phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (gPGN) Ab, a protein induced during cyst formation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2003</xref>). The anti-gG3PD Ab was also used to study the intracellular localization of the protein by CLSM. In the trophozoite (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ba</xref></bold>) the anti-gG3PD strongly stained the plasma membrane of the parasite ventral surface likely corresponding to the marginal groove and ventrolateral flanges (VLF), fingerlike projections of the plasma membrane involved in parasite attachment to the surface and to the host cell (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sousa et al., 2001</xref>). As previously reported, the g14-3-3 showed a spotty broad distribution in the parasite cell body, excluding the nuclei and the median body (smile-like microtubule aggregate in the middle of parasite body). The widespread g14-3-3 staining makes it difficult to claim for a discrete co-localization with the gG3PD, although a slight co-localization signal (pseudo color yellow) was visible at the posterior edge of the trophozoite (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ba</xref></bold>, merge). <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> encystation was monitored by the progressive appearance of specialized structures for the secretion of the cyst wall proteins (CWP), the encysting specific vesicles (ESVs), which were stained, together with the cyst wall, by the anti-CWP mAb. In encysting parasites, in addition to the ventral plasma membrane, the anti-gG3PD Ab (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bb,c</xref></bold>) labeled several structures, similar to aggregates/small vesicles, in the cytoplasm. These structures did not co-localize with the ESVs and no straightforward co-localization with g14-3-3 could be detected (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bb,c</xref></bold>). In cysts, the gG3PD was diffused in the cytoplasm, although a marked aggregation close to the plasma membrane, below the cyst wall was evident (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bd</xref></bold>). A faint co-localization with g14-3-3 (pseudo color yellow) was detected below the cyst wall.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression and localization of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gG3PD) during the differentiation stages of <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic>.

The purified full-length HIS-gG3PD, but not the deletion mutants, showed a distinctive yellow color (data not shown), compatible with the presence of a flavin cofactor. Indeed, the UV-visible spectra of the HIS-gG3PD showed two absorbance peaks with a maximum approximately at 350 and 440 nm (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>), very close to those of free flavin (either FAD or FMN or both), supporting that the gG3PD is a flavoprotein. No similar peaks could be observed in the spectra of any deletion mutants (data not shown). Since mG3PD/glpD are homodimeric proteins (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>), the dimeric nature of gG3PD was assayed using native PAGE. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>, the HIS-gG3PD_N was exclusively monomeric (60 kDa); whereas the HIS-gG3PD migrated in the gel both as a 120 kDa monomer and as a 240 kDa dimer, as confirmed by immunoblot assay with anti-HIS. Similarly, the HIS-gG3PD_C migrated as a monomer around 60 kDa, and as a dimer of 120 kDa, thus suggesting that at least one function of the gG3PD C-terminal half is to mediate protein dimerization.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p><bold>Evaluation of the gG3PD enzymatic activity.

Moreover, no activity could be observed either in the absence of g3p or PMS (data not shown), thus proving that g3p is indeed the substrate of the enzyme and that an electron carrier molecule, such as PMS, is required to reduce MTT. This is in agreement with the role of quinone described for other FAD-dependent G3PDs (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Unden and Bongaerts, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>), the HIS-gG3PD_N, containing the GlpA-like domain, also displayed a basal enzymatic activity (30.5 &#177; 1.0 nmol/min/mg), 2.8-fold lower in comparison with the full length protein, and it showed an increase of 17% in the activity (36.7 &#177; 3.0 nmol/min/mg) after stimulation with exogenous FAD. On the contrary, the HIS-gG3PD_C did not show any enzymatic activity in any condition (data not shown). These results support the homology data and confirm that the glycerol-3-phospate dehydrogenase activity is localized to the N-terminal half of the gG3PD.</p><p>To study the possible correlation between encystation-dependent intracellular re-localization of gG3PD and its function, the enzyme activity was measured in trophozoites and encysting parasites extracts. Indeed, compared to trophozoites, the gG3PD activity showed a 20% increase at 6 h of encystation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref></bold>), then it was reduced nearly down to the trophozoite level after 12 h of encystation. No variation in the expression level of the gG3PD protein could be observed at any time points (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref></bold>). The encystation process in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> has been proposed as a primitive response to cellular stress (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Arg&#252;ello-Garci&#225; et al., 2009</xref>). In unicellular organisms, as response to stress signals, the intracellular level of glycerol increases, as consequence of a massive conversion of DAPH to g3p, due to the greater activity of the NADPH-dependent G3PDs and in some cases also to that of FAD-dependent G3PDs (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). To test this hypothesis we measured the intracellular content of glycerol during encystation. The amount of glycerol increased up to 60% already at 6 h post-encystation induction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref></bold>) and then of an additional 15% in 12 h encysting parasites, thus suggesting a possible relationship between the enhanced gG3PD activity and the glycerol accumulation occurring during parasite differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In Vivo</italic> Effects of NBDHEX on <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> Survival and gG3PD Activity</title><p>Recently, a 7-nitro benzoxadiazole (NBD) derivative has been shown to impair the growth of PC-3 adenocarcinoma cell line by a significant inhibition of the glycerol-3-phosphate oxidoreductase activity of mG3PD (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2014</xref>). We wondered whether this class of molecules could be effective against <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites and the gG3PD.

As shown (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>), NBDHEX was effective against the parasite (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.3 &#177; 0.1 &#956;M) at a lower concentration (5.6-fold) than that of the reference drug MTZ (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1.5 &#177; 0.1 &#956;M). Moreover, under anaerobic growth conditions NBDHEX was also more effective than MTZ (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.6 &#177; 0.4 &#956;M for NBDHEX and IC<sub>50</sub>: 1.9 &#177; 0.2 &#956;M for MTZ; data not shown). To maximize in a short time period the possible NBDHEX effects, taking into account the parasite intracellular environment, trophozoites were treated <italic>in vivo</italic> with 50 &#956;M NBDHEX and then the gG3PD enzymatic activity was assayed in parasite extracts.

Only trophozoites treated with NBDHEX showed a spotted faint fluorescence in the cytoplasm. A more intense signal was observed around the nuclei, in the areas corresponding to the median body, in the intracellular portion of ventral flagella and, intriguingly, at the ventral plasma membrane. As shown, co-localization signal (pseudo color yellow) between gG3PD and NBDHEX was evident only at plasma membrane, without any relevant alteration in the intracellular localization of gG3PD (for comparison see <bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,Ca</xref></bold>). To further study the interaction between NBDHEX and gG3PD, <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing the HIS-gG3PD was incubated with NBDHEX, then the recombinant protein was purified and, finally, the enzymatic activity was assayed. Similar to the <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> with NBDHEX, incubation of bacteria with the compound resulted in a recombinant HIS-gG3PD having a 25% reduced enzymatic activity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). Next, we wondered whether NBDHEX could bind HIS-gG3PD. We take advantage of the property of NBD derivatives covalently bound to a protein to be visualized by fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light after SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bragg and Hou, 1999</xref>). Indeed, HIS-gG3PD, purified from NBDHEX treated bacteria, was fluorescent under UV-light (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>, right), even in the presence of a reducing agent (such as DTT). On the contrary, no fluorescence was associated with the HIS-gG3PD purified from untreated bacteria. These results suggest that NBDHEX strongly binds HIS-gG3PD. To confirm this hypothesis, purified HIS-gG3PD from bacteria, treated or not with NBDHEX, was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. MS/MS spectra were acquired matching two HIS-gG3PD peptides carrying NBDHEX derived adducts on cysteine residues: the detected mass shift was compatible with an NBDHEX form in which the nitro group was reduced to amine (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref></bold>). No adduct with the intact NBDHEX moiety could be found, probably because it was unstable or not detectable under the applied experimental conditions. The presence of nitro-reduced NBDHEX adducts was in favor of an electrochemical reduction of the drug, likely by gG3PD. Therefore, NBDHEX properties were evaluated by spectrophotometric and fluorimetric analyses after <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation with HIS-gG3PD. The UV-visible spectra of NBDHEX, incubated either with g3p or with HIS-gG3PD, showed the typical peak centered around 430 nm (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>), even after 80 min of incubation (data not shown). Incubation in the presence of both HIS-gG3PD and g3p led to the progressive decrease of the 430 nm absorption peak and to the appearance of a less intense new one around 450&#8211;455 nm (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). The reaction was also associated with a change in color, from bright yellow to brown (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>, insert) and the disappearance of the 525 nm emission peak of NBDHEX in the fluorescence spectra (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>). Since the amount of NBDHEX was in large excess compared to HIS-gG3PD, the observed spectral alterations were not imputable to binding of NBDHEX to the enzyme, but they argued on NBDHEX modification by the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity of HIS-gG3PD. Such modifications could be ascribable to a partial or complete reduction of the nitro group to hydroxylamine or amine. Chemical reduction of the NBDHEX nitro group to amine by sodium dithionite, proved by mass spectrometry analysis (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>), resulted in the decrease of the NBDHEX absorption peak at 430 nm, although with the appearance of a new peak at 405 nm (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>), and loss of fluorescence too (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref></bold>). The observed differences between UV-visible spectra of HIS-gG3PD and sodium dithionite treated NBDHEX suggest that the enzymatic activity produced an optical species, probably compatible with an incomplete reduced form of NBDHEX, carrying an hydroxylamine instead of an amine moiety. On the other side, looking to the NBDHEX-treated HIS-gG3PD, both in the presence or absence of g3p, the enzyme resulted fluorescent under UV light after SDS-PAGE (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref></bold>). This suggests that protein adducts with the unreduced NBDHEX occurred despite, enzyme activation. Products from <italic>in vitro</italic> reactions between HIS-gG3PD and NBDHEX were also analyzed by mass spectrometry. In the sample incubated in the presence of g3p, some HIS-gG3PD cysteine residues were modified by NBDHEX and MS/MS spectra analysis allowed to detect mass shifts compatible with NBDHEX adducts carrying the NO<sub>2</sub> moiety completely reduced to NH<sub>2</sub>, but also the semi-reduced hydroxylamine group (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). These adducts could not be detected when g3p was omitted.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of NBDHEX with gG3PD.

It is worth noting that the modest stimulatory effect exerted by additional FAD on the enzymatic activity of both the gG3PD and the gG3PD_N, could be explained by different reasons (i) the full length gG3PD is fully complexed with FAD; and/or (ii) the deletion mutant lacks the ability to properly bind FAD; and/or (iii) the enzyme needs FMN in addition to FAD. Indeed, the maximal activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> trimeric GlpACB <italic>in vitro</italic> requires both FMN and FAD (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1988</xref>), whereas glpD binds only FAD (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2008</xref>).

The dimerization properties of this gG3PD region, absent in bacterial GlpA, could be ascribable to its homology with members of the FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases, a family of generally dimeric proteins (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Argyrou and Blanchard, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Localization of the gG3PD to the ventral plasma membrane, likely in correspondence to the VLF, and the detection of the enzymatic activity in parasite extracts are in favor of the existence of functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway and of a role of the protein in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> energy metabolism. Similar to bacteria (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Unden and Bongaerts, 1997</xref>), metabolization of g3p by <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> could occur at plasma membrane via gG3PD thus providing an extra source of DHAP for glycolysis and reducing equivalents to putative ETCs. Experimental evidences indicate that <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> can proliferate <italic>in vitro</italic> even in absence of glucose, its main energy source (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adam, 2001</xref>), either in the presence of serum (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Schofield et al., 1991</xref>) or of a defined mixture of bile salts, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gillin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gault et al., 1987</xref>). Incorporation of free glycerol and g3p in trophozoites has been reported to be negligible (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jarroll et al., 1981</xref>). Nevertheless, mammalian bile and intestinal epithelium mucus are rich of PC, that is efficiently taken up by <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 1997</xref>). PC, in turns, can potentially be converted to g3p by the combined activity of a phospholipase PLB and a putative GPC-PDE, both encoded by <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> genome (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Yichoy et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We show that the gG3PD activity increases early at encystation, without up-regulation of protein expression. In this phase of encystation, energy metabolism and galactosamine synthesis require extra carbon sources as consequence of the highly reduced glucose uptake and decrease in oxygen consumption (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Paget et al., 1998</xref>). We may speculate that gG3PD could provide extra carbon to glycolysis, via an improved metabolization of g3p to DHAP. In parallel, we also observed an increase in intracellular glycerol levels. In response to stress conditions, including hyperosmotic stress, several microorganisms synthesized glycerol as stress protector via an increased DHAP to g3p conversion mediated by the NAD(P)H-dependent G3PD (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Albertyn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Suesc&#250;n-Bol&#237;var and Thom&#233;, 2015</xref>). The increase in the bile salt, together with a slight alkaline pH, is a key encystation signal eventually perceived by <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> as hyperosmotic stress. It is worth to note that, in <italic>E. histolytica</italic>, intracellular accumulation of both g3p and glycerol occurs in response to oxidative stress despite only the gG3PD orthologue is present and no NAD(P)H-dependent G3PD activity has been detected (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2012</xref>). The unusual domain architecture of FAD-dependent G3PDs from both <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> and <italic>E. histolytica</italic> may explained for a bi-directional activity of this enzymes A further characterization of the gG3PD and a detailed metabolomics analysis of the trophozoite and encystation stage of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> will be necessary to unravel any metabolic re-arrangement occurring during the parasite differentiation and its link with gG3PD activity.</p><p>The subcellular localization of gG3PD requires also other considerations. The presence, only in trophozoites but not in encysting parasites, of a fraction of the enzyme in the membrane preparation is in agreement with the immunolocalization data and suggests that gG3PD can associate with membranes in a stage dependent-manner. The structural/sequence determinant(s) responsible for the localization of the protein may reside in the N-terminal half of gG3PD, as supported by the partial localization of the gG3PD_N deletion mutant to the ventrolateral side of the trophozoite. In addition, we confirm that gG3PD and g14-3-3 co-precipitate (this work; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lalle et al., 2012</xref>) mainly at the trophozoite stage implying a role of the g14-3-3 in gG3PD localization to ventral plasma membrane. The presence of several putative mode-1 and mode-2 binding sites along the sequence of gG3PD (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lalle et al., 2012</xref>) can allow for a direct interaction between the two proteins. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the interaction between gG3PD and g14-3-3 is indirect and that both proteins are present in a multiprotein complex, and further studies with different deletion and point mutants will clarify this issue. However, beyond the exact interaction mechanism, a clear relationship between g14-3-3 and gG3PD localization and, possibly, its enzymatic activity, is indicated by the strongly reduced co-precipitation of g14-3-3 with gG3PD during encystation and the partial re-localization of gG3PD to mitosomes.</p><p>The re-localization of gG3PD to mitosomes, despite the absence of any predictable mitochondrial targeting sequence or cleavage site in the N-terminus, has been proved at least for another <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> protein, namely GiiscS (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>). In our case, the lost of mitosomal localization in both gG3PD deletion mutants suggests that targeting to these organelles at least requires the full-length protein. Although <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> mitosomes clearly miss the TCA cycle and the typical ATP-generating mitochondrial respiratory ETC (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Han and Collins, 2012</xref>), the encystation-dependent localization of gG3PD to mitosomes could be a reminiscence of mitochondrial function of mG3PDs, where they participate in the g3p shuttle and supply electrons to the mitochondria ETC. A homolog of FAD-dependent mG3PD has been identified also in the mitosomes of the microsporidia <italic>Antonospora locustae</italic>, a group of spore-forming fungus-related intracellular parasites (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dolgikh et al., 2011</xref>). The protein is expressed in the spore and localizes in the mitosomes, where it channels reducing equivalent to the so called alternative oxidase (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dolgikh et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the presence of alternative ETCs in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic>, as in the anaerobic bacteria respiration, cannot be excluded (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Unden and Bongaerts, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Han and Collins, 2012</xref>). GiOR-1, a di-flavoprotein able to reduce the gCYTb5-IV and having ferredoxin-independent and NADPH-dependent reductase activity, has been localized to the <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> mitosome, suggesting that a NAD(P)-dependent ETC exists in this organelle (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jedelsk&#253; et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Pyrih et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the presence of a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain and of a putative metal binding domain in gG3PD, both present in the flavoprotein reductase family (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Argyrou and Blanchard, 2004</xref>), may imply that the protein possesses a combined dehydrogenase and reductase activity, although the final acceptor, if any, is still to be identified. Our results disclose a new perspective on the role of mitosome in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> suggesting that mitosomal components and functions can change during the parasite life cycle. Indeed, gG3PD was not detected in the proteome of mitosomes isolated from trophozoites (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jedelsk&#253; et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Looking for compounds affecting the gG3PD activity, we demonstrate that the 7-NBD derivative NBDHEX, a patented anti-tumor drug (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Turella et al., 2005</xref>), exerts cytotoxic activity toward <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites and, when administered <italic>in vivo</italic>, hampers the g3p dehydrogenase activity of gG3PD. The IC<sub>50</sub> of NBDHEX is twofold to fivefold lower than MTZ, proving that the compound is more effective in killing <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> than the reference drug, even in microaerobic conditions. This indicates that the presence of O<sub>2</sub> does not produce opposite effects on NBDHEX, as on the contrary occurs for re-oxidation of MTZ nitroradical anions. <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> is a microaerophilic parasite that lives in the fairly aerobic (up to 60 &#956;M O<sub>2</sub>) environment of the upper intestine, so that a drug potentially effective also in presence of O<sub>2</sub> is more attractive for therapeutic use. We show that NBDHEX binds to gG3PD, when administered both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. NBDHEX is an excellent electrophile that can easily form &#963;-complexes, as occurs between glutathione and the C-4 position of the drug in the G-site of GST, leading to the inhibition of the detoxifying and anti-apoptotic activity of human GSTP1-1 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Federici et al., 2009</xref>). Since no gene coding for GST is present in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 2007</xref>), we can <italic>bona fide</italic> exclude that antigiardial activity of NBDHEX may be due to any GST inhibition, although a low level of GSH has been detected (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Krauth-Siegel and Leroux, 2012</xref>). The formation of &#963;-complexes likely occurs between NBDHEX and gG3PD, as suggested by in gel fluorescence of gG3PD after NBDHEX treatment, but, unfortunately, our attempts to identify these complexes by mass spectrometry were unsuccessful. Furthermore, we demonstrate the occurrence of NBDHEX covalent adducts at several gG3PD cysteine residues, with the 7-nitro group of the drug being reduced either completely to amine or partially to hydroxylamine. Different NBDHEX modified cysteine residues of His-gG3PD were found in different experimental conditions, i.e., NBDHEX treatment <italic>in E. coli</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, likely as the result of a differential accessibility of the drug to such residues. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and MS data indicate that the nitro reduced NBDHEX adducts derive from the gG3PD-mediated electrochemical reduction of the drug, possibly via the formation of highly reactive intermediates, such as nitroso or hydroxylamine radicals. It is well known that during the FAD-mG3PD-mediated oxidation of the 2-hydroxy group of g3p, to form DHAP, two electrons are transferred to FAD and then to the quinone pool (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mr&#225;&#269;ek et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, gG3PD activity can generate two electrons able to reduce the nitro group to a hydroxylamine intermediate. Enzymatic reduction has also been proposed as a mechanism for the activation of nitrocompounds, i.e., MTZ, leading to protein covalent adducts formation and cytotoxicity in several microaerophilic protozoan parasites. In particular, the flavoprotein TRxR can nitroreduce MTZ, by a process involving its flavin cofactor, thus forming covalent adducts with the drug (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Leitsch et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Remarkably, although gG3PD displays nitroreductase activity toward NBDHEX, no nitroreduction of MTZ could be observed in our experimental conditions. Nitroimidazoles and other nitrocompounds seem to be metabolized in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> in a different manner, also in comparison to <italic>E. histolytica</italic> and <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, and protein adducts can be formed only with some of these drugs (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Leitsch et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, gG3PD was not identified among the proteins forming adducts with MTZ or tinidazole neither in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> nor in <italic>E. histolytica</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Leitsch et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In particular, these differences in nitrocompound metabolization have been related to the adaptation of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> to rather high concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> in the upper small intestine. We can speculate that gG3PD-mediated NBDHEX nitroreduction may be influenced by a redox-cycling property of 7-NBD derivative in presence of O<sub>2</sub>. NBF-SPh, a compound related to NBDHEX, has a redox-cycling activity with nitro group cycling to nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates by reversible electron transfer to O<sub>2</sub> before becoming exhausted and finally reduced to amine (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Patridge et al., 2012</xref>). During redox-cycling, NBF-SPh rapidly converts O<sub>2</sub> to ROS at an higher rate than that of the most toxic redox-cycling quinones and the nitrocompound MTZ. Bio-reduction of the redox cycling naphthoquinone menadione by flavoprotein/iron&#8211;sulphur-mediated electron transfer in both <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites and cysts has been proven to be a potent generator of ROS, even in the presence of low levels of oxygen, thus leading to parasite killing (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Paget et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the cytotoxicity exerted by NBDHEX against <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> could be due to its nitroreduction and to ROS generation during the reductive process, likely involving gG3PD. Finally, it should be considered that nitroreduction of NBDHEX, at least in part mediated by gG3PD, could subtract electrons from their physiological acceptor(s) thus altering the <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> intracellular redox metabolism.</p><p>Although further studies are necessary to fully understand the metabolic pathways involving the gG3PD, as well as the mechanisms of the enzyme regulation in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic>, we have clearly proven, for the first time, that a functional FAD-dependent gG3PD works in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> and could be a valuable potential candidate for the design of novel antigiardial drugs having NBDHEX, a representative of novel class of antitumoral molecules, as leading compound.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Marialuisa Casella, Istituto Superiore di Sanit&#224;, Rome (IT), for the priceless technical assistance with mass spectrometry analyses; to Dr. Pavel Dolezal, Charles University, Prague (CZ), for the gift of the anti-Tom40 antibody; to Dr. Ed Jarroll, Lehman College, NY (USA); and Dr. Harry van Keulen, Cleveland State University (USA) for providing us with anti-gPGM antibody.
