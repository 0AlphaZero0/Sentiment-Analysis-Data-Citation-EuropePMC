Each sequencing platform is characterized by well-defined types of errors, resulting from different steps in the sequencing workflow. Here we describe a universal method to prepare amplicon libraries that can be used for sequencing on different high-throughput sequencing platforms. We have sequenced distinct exons of the CREB binding protein (CREBBP) gene and analysed the output resulting from three major deep-sequencing platforms. platform-specific errors were adjusted according to the result of sequence analysis from the remaining platforms. Additionally, bioinformatic methods are described to determine platform dependent errors.

The high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-platforms had their breakthrough in 2005 with the 454 pyrosequencing-based technology [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], followed by Illumina array-based sequencing-by-synthesis approach with reversible-terminator chemistry in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Life Technologies launched the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An informative overview about technical features and sequencing chemistry of these commercially available high-throughput sequencing platforms is reviewed by Metzker [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>All these technologies enable a fast and cost-effective alternative to Sanger sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which has been the gold standard over the last decades. Moreover high-throughput data are produced within a short period of time, while the sequencing costs have been markedly reduced. Recent studies validate the performance of these platforms by comparing whole-genome sequencing data, demonstrating platform specific limitations [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Different types of errors may appear during the whole amplification and sequencing process, with platform-specific error rates and dominant error types (e.g. substitution, insertion, deletion), corresponding to the sequencing chemistry used [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>We focused on the three major platforms, which are currently available on the market:. The 454 GS Junior/FLX instruments provide the longest reads (up to 1000 bp for GS FLX+) and high-quality sequences, but they are very expensive due to their emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing chemistry. In contrast the IonTorrent PGM has the highest throughput but the lowest base accuracy. Both platforms show specific problems in homopolymeric regions, where a long stretch of the identical nucleotides generates predominantly Indel errors [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, Illumina MiSeq produces the shortest reads (2 x 250 bp), but by using four labeled-reversible terminators, and due to a long run-time (27 h) the most accurate data are generated. Furthermore, PGM and Illumina technologies have been reported to be error prone to distinct sequence motifs [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Here we report a strategy to overcome the individual disadvantages of single high-throughput sequencing platforms, and to use the full potential of these technologies by obtaining high-accuracy data of the analysed amplicon sequences. We established a universal amplicon-sequencing strategy for amplification of targets in a two-step PCR approach, with the first PCR being gene-specific and platform-independent whereas the second-step PCR links the amplicons to the platform-specific adapters. Results of comparative analysis, deriving from this sequencing approach, were used to determine quality and error rates of the platforms tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Amplicon library preparation</title><p>Mutational analysis of five distinct exonic regions of the CREBBP gene (ENSEMBL Gene ID: ENSG00000005339; Chr 16:3775055&#8211;3930727) was performed from genomic DNA samples of unsorted mononuclear cells from ten patient samples by PCR amplification.

However, only rare information exists on platform-comparisons of amplicon-based library preparations, focusing on distinct genes. Here we demonstrate a stable two-step PCR approach to generate amplicon-libraries for the three major HTS platforms currently available. According to several sources of errors before and during the deep sequencing procedure, like DNA extraction, PCR amplification of target regions, library preparation and sequencing, we aimed to standardize these steps prior the sequencing reactions. We started with a unique first-round amplification and prepared the gene-specific amplicons with specific linker sequences using hybrid primers to provide a binding site for platform-specific PCR primers. A major advantage of our proposed method is to avoid several amplicon-library preparation methods (e.g. adapter ligation) that are specific for each sequencing platform, thereby requiring a large amount of genomic DNA, different primer sets and various library preparation protocols. In case of multiplexed/barcoded samples a large number of primers is necessary for each sample in complex sequencing assays with multiple reactions; whereas in the two-step PCR approach only the second-round PCR primers have to be barcoded independent of the number of reactions within the first-round PCR. Nevertheless, PCR amplification prior sequencing or during library preparation is susceptible to amplification bias/errors and thus could alter the right interpretation of sequencing results of the different platforms. An alternative way to overcome PCR bias is to avoid or limit amplification steps in sample preparation methods by using new single molecule sequencing technologies, like Oxford Nanopore GridION or Pacific Bioscience platform [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study we used a consistent experimental design and reduced the PCR bias by using a proofreading enzyme for amplification with a low overall error rate (0.23%) tested before in a 454 sequencing assay of TP53 plasmids [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Sequencing data revealed from all three platforms were analysed according to read number, predicted quality and length of reads. The results were similar to previous studies, demonstrating that MiSeq produces the highest throughput (3.7 Gb); PGM shows the shortest reads (248 bp), and the GS FLX has the lowest throughput (0.3 Gb) with the longest reads (337 bp) [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By analysing Phred quality distribution among the entire read lengths, we observed a dropdown of the Phred scores at base position 4&#8211;7 in 454 reads, according to a short homopolymeric G base stretch of 4 bp in the 5&#8217; linker sequence (<xref rid="pone.0129195.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This result indicates that 454 specific errors are induced even by short stretches of identical bases [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In GS FLX and MiSeq reads we also detected a minor reduction of Phred quality scores during the end of the runs, according to the sequencing chemistry used.</p><p>After alignment of the filtered reads we determined platform-specific error rates specific for our amplicon sequencing approach. Several studies focused on platform-specific errors for whole-genome sequencing data. For example for GS FLX error rates of 0.28% for Indels and 0.12% for substitutions (max. 1.07%) were reported [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In GS20 sequencer produced data error rates reached &lt;0.1&#8211;0.49%, and Margulies described error rates in range 0.6&#8211;4% [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lower error rates derived from Roche test-fragments that did not undergo library preparation or PCR amplification steps [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Also for PGM data error rates around 1.5% for Indels were reported, which was be confirmed by another study revealing errors of ~1.8% [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In both platforms Indel errors derived from homopolymers with a maximum local error rate in GS FLX up to 50% [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our data show low Indel and substitution error rates (subs 0.07%; Indel 0.18%), using GS FLX- comparable to the results of McElroy et al., whereas in PGM derived data Indel errors (0.6%) were 2.5-3-fold lower compared to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. analysis potential explanation for this discrepance is that in our study defined amplicon sequences with a small diversity were analysed whereas other published data focus on whole genome sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We observed higher Indel error rates for the amplicons E16 and E18.01 that correlate to 7 A and 13 T base stretches, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0129195.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p><p>MiSeq-specific errors were described as substitutions with a frequency of around 0.1%, and Indels reaching an insignificant rate &lt; 0.001% [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, depending on the sequence context (e.g. inverted repeats, GGC sequences) also higher Illumina error rates of 0.31 to 1.66% have been described [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with a maximum of up to 6% in GC-rich motifs [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here we report a higher mean substitution rate of 1.53% with amplicon-specific differences; (<xref rid="pone.0129195.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) in amplicon E30.02 error rate reached ~4.5%</p><p>To identify the source of substitution errors, we generated a substitution matrix for all three runs. Shao <italic>et al</italic>. describe that transitions were 5&#8211;10 fold more frequent than transversions in 454 derived data, whereas transitions ranged from 0.04&#8211;0.1% and transversions from 0&#8211;0.03%. The specific error rate followed the order A&#8805;T&gt;G&gt;C [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We found 454 base-specific error rates of 0.00&#8211;0.02%, with only transitions being detectable. This result clearly demonstrates that substitutions are only a minor source of error for the 454 platform. Analysing the PGM reads we found base-specific errors ranging from 0.00&#8211;0.03% comparable to the 454 results; also Indel errors are the dominant source of errors for the reads. Substitution error rate of PGM reads was reported between 0.04&#8211;0.1% depending on the kit used for sequencing reaction; also showing that A and T flows are more error-prone cycles. This is in agreement with our data with a total error of 0.03% each for A and T substitutions [<xref rid="pone.0129195.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The high substitution error rates in Illumina-derived data result mainly from A &lt;-&gt; C (0.15%) and T &lt;-&gt; G (0.15%) substitutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Summarizing our data, we demonstrate that each of the three sequencing platforms is characterized by its specific error rate and type of errors. The two step-amplification approach described here shows that amplicons deriving from a single source of DNA can be sequenced in parallel by different platforms. Specific errors occurring due to the amplicon preparation process can be minimized by combining the different results. In our study Illumina had the highest error rate for substitution errors, but the lowest number of Indel errors in single amplicons. Thus could be counterbalanced by data of the 454 run, which show the lowest number of substitutions but the highest Indel error rate. Here we propose a method avoiding expensive and time-consuming platform-specific library preparation kits (e. g. adapter ligation protocols), and reducing specific amplification errors during different library preparation procedures. Furthermore, this method can be easily adapted to emerging amplicon-based sequencing technologies in future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the technical staff of the involved laboratories for expert technical assistance.</p><p>The authors thank the Interlaboratory Robustness of Next-generation sequencing (IRON) Phase II Study Group members for helpful discussions on the CREBBP assay development.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0129195.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
