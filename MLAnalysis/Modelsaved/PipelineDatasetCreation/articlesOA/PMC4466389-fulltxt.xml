Using the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line which harbors an amplified <italic>MDM2</italic> gene and wild-type p53, we have investigated the acquired resistance mechanisms both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to SAR405838. Treatment of SJSA-1 cells with SAR405838 <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to dose-dependent cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and robust apoptosis. However, prolonged treatment of SJSA-1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with SAR405838 results in profound acquired resistance to the drug. Analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived resistant cell lines showed that p53 is mutated in the DNA binding domain and can no longer be activated by SAR405838. Treatment of the parental SJSA-1 xenograft tumors with SAR405838 in mice yields rapid tumor regression but the tumors eventually regrow. Culturing the regrown tumors established a number of sublines, which showed only modest (3&#8211;5 times) loss of sensitivity to SAR405838 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Sequencing of the p53 showed that it retains its wild-type status in these <italic>in vivo</italic> sublines, with the exception of one subline, which harbors a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation. Using xenograft models of two <italic>in vivo</italic> derived sublines, which has either wild-type p53 or p53 containing a single heterozygous C176F mutation, we showed that while SAR405838 effectively achieves partial tumor regression in these models, it no longer induces complete tumor regression and tumors resume growth once the treatment is stopped. Harvesting and culturing tumors obtained from a prolonged treatment with SAR405838 in mice established additional <italic>in vivo</italic> sublines, which all contain a single heterozygous C176F mutation with no additional p53 mutation detected. Interestingly, SAR405838 can still effectively activate p53 in all sublines containing a single heterozygous C176F mutation, with a moderately reduced potency as compared to that in the parental cell line. Consistently, SAR405838 is 3&#8211;5 times less effective in all the <italic>in vivo</italic> derived sublines containing a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation than in the SJSA-1 parental cell line in assays of cell growth and apoptosis. Computational modeling suggested that a p53 tetramer containing two wild-type p53 molecules and two C176F mutated molecules can maintain the structural stability and interactions with DNA by formation of additional hydrophobic and cation-&#960; interactions which compensate for the loss of sulphur-zinc coordination. Our data thus show that SJSA-1 tumor cells acquire very different levels of resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to the MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838. Our present study may have a significant implication for the investigation of resistant mechanisms for other classes of anticancer drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported with funding from the National Institutes of Health, US (R01CA121279 and P30CA046592) and internal funding from the University of Michigan.

The gene encoding the p53 protein, <italic>TP53</italic>, is mutated in approximately 50% of human cancers, resulting in inactivation of p53 as a transcriptional factor and a loss of its tumor suppressor function[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the remaining 50% of human cancers, the tumor suppressor function of p53 is inhibited by a number of mechanisms[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The oncogenic MDM2 protein is a major cellular inhibitor of wild-type p53[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In cells with wild-type p53, upon activation p53 transcribes MDM2, leading to increases in levels of both mRNA and MDM2 protein. The MDM2 protein in turn, binds to and inhibits p53 through several distinct mechanisms[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. First, MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and promotes p53 degradation. Second, MDM2 binds to the DNA binding domain in p53 and blocks its transcriptional activity[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Third, MDM2 is involved in the nuclear export of p53, rendering p53 inaccessible to its target DNAs[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Through these multiple mechanisms, MDM2 functions as an effective cellular antagonist of wild-type p53.</p><p>Because inhibition of p53 by MDM2 stems from their direct physical interaction, small-molecule inhibitors designed to bind to MDM2 and block the MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction (hereafter called MDM2 inhibitors), can lead to accumulation and activation of wild-type p53, thus releasing the tumor suppressor function of p53 [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent years have seen intense research efforts aimed at the design and development of MDM2 inhibitors as a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of human cancer. To date, several such inhibitors[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], including SAR405838 (also known as MI-77301) designed in our laboratory[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], have progressed into clinical development.</p><p>For successful clinical development of potent and specific MDM2 inhibitors as a new class of anticancer drugs, an understanding of both <italic>de novo</italic> and acquired resistance mechanisms is critical to select patients whose tumors are most likely to respond to the treatment and to develop rational strategies to overcome the resistance. Since potent and specific MDM2 inhibitors activate only wild-type p53, their cellular activity is restricted to tumor cells with wild-type p53, suggesting the possibility that tumor cells can develop acquired resistance to MDM2 inhibitors by inactivating p53 [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, previous investigations have demonstrated that when cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 status are treated <italic>in vitro</italic> for a prolonged period with nutlin-3, a potent and specific MDM2 inhibitor, tumor cells acquire inactivating p53 mutation(s), which renders p53 non-functional and results in profound acquired resistance to the drug[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We have recently shown that when acute leukemia RS4;11 and MV4;11 cell lines are treated with SAR405838 either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, they also became highly resistant to SAR405838, as a result of p53 mutation(s)[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the resistance mechanisms for our MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838 in the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line contains an amplified MDM2 gene and wild-type p53. Our previous study showed that SAR405838 effectively induces apoptosis in the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the xenograft tumor tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, SAR405838 yields rapid, complete and persistent tumor regression in the SJSA-1 xenograft model in mice,[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and consequently, this osteosarcoma cell line is an excellent model with which to investigate the resistance mechanisms of SAR405838.</p><p>Our data clearly show that the resistance acquired when the SJSA-1 cell line is treated in cell culture is very different from that when the SJSA-1 xenograft tumors are treated in animals.

Hence, we performed computational simulations to shed light on the structure for p53 with a heterozygous C176F p53 mutation.</p><p>For gene transcription, p53 function as a tetramer in which two p53 monomers form a dimer to interact with DNA and two p53 dimers interact loosely to form a functional tetramer.

In four of these six models, a wild-type p53 monomer molecule and a C176F p53 mutant monomer form a dimer which interacts with DNA. In the two other models, two p53 wild-type monomers form a dimer and two C176F p53 mutant monomers form another dimer to interact with DNA. We denote these arrangements as FCCF, FCFC, CFCF, CFFC, FFCC, and CCFF, with C representing the wild-type p53 (C176) monomer and F the C176F mutated p53 monomer (<xref rid="pone.0128807.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128807.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Fig). We used the motional fluctuations of the p53 backbone atoms in these models from the p53 wild-type tetramer crystal structure to assess the structural stability for these 6 models containing a C176F heterozygous mutation. Our data showed that the FFCC model appears to be least stable and the FCCF tetramer appears to be the most stable. In each of the dimers, we also calculated the salt-bridge interaction distances between R181 and E180 as another indicator of the structural stability of the dimer. The most stable FCCF tetramer also has a stronger R181&#8212;E180 interaction than the other five models but this interaction is slightly weaker than that in the wild-type p53 tetramer (<xref rid="pone.0128807.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Since the mutation of C176F results in a loss of zinc coordination, we analyzed the model structures of the FCCF tetramer from the simulations and compared them to those in the wild-type p53 tetramer to identify additional stabilizing interactions. We found that the mutated Phe residue gains additional hydrophobic interactions with the M243 residue in the same monomer, as well as the M243 residue from the other monomer (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Moreover the mutated Phe residue also engages in cation-aromatic interactions with the zinc ion (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Both interactions contribute to stabilization of the loop-sheet-helix motif structure between the mutant and the wild-type p53 dimer. Hence, our modeling suggests that the p53 FCCF tetramer has gained additional interactions through the mutated Phe residues and these additional interactions compensate, at least partially for the loss of the zinc coordination with the C176 residues in the wild-type p53 tetramer structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line, containing wild-type p53 and an amplified MDM2 gene, is sensitive to MDM2 inhibitors and has been used extensively as a model with which to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of action for different classes of MDM2 inhibitors. In our previous study[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we showed that SAR405838, a potent MDM2 inhibitor currently in clinical development, is highly effective in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> in the SJSA-1 cell line and induces rapid and complete tumor regression against SJSA-1 xenograft tumors in mice. In the present study, we have employed the SJSA-1 cell line to investigate the acquired resistance mechanisms for SAR405838 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The current study has revealed some marked differences in the development of acquired drug resistance of SJSA-1 cells treated with a potent, specific and highly efficacious MDM2 inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our data show that treatment of the SJSA-1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with either a fixed concentration of SAR405838 or with stepwise increments of concentration of SAR405838 yields highly resistant subline lines (CMIR, MIR1 and MIR2), which are 100-times less sensitive to the drug than the parental SJSA-1 cell line based upon IC<sub>50</sub> values. These resistant cell lines do not undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest when treated with SAR405838 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, SAR405838 is completely ineffective against the MIR2 xenograft tumors in mice, in contrast to the rapid and complete tumor regression achieved by SAR405838 in the xenograft tumors established <italic>in vitro</italic> using the SJSA-1 parental cell line. SAR405838 is unable to induce p53 activation in these three <italic>in vitro</italic> resistant cell lines, and this stands in contrast to the dose-dependent and robust activation of p53 by SAR405838 in the SJSA-1 parental cell line.</p><p>Since the activity of MDM2 inhibitors depends upon wild-type p53, we sequenced p53 in these resistant cell lines and found that each of them contains a heterozygous, but not a homozygous p53 mutation. While both the MIR1 and MIR2 sublines contain a single R273C p53 heterozygous mutation, the CMIR subline contains two heterozygous p53 mutations, L130R and C277F. The "hot spot" R273C mutation identified in both the MIR1 and MIR2 sublines and the C277F mutation identified in the CMIR subline are common DNA contact mutations [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While R273 plays a crucial role in docking p53 to the DNA backbone, C277 makes direct contacts with DNA bases [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and mutations at these positions dramatically reduce the DNA binding affinity [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our data also show that different inactivating mutations of p53 can occur when the same cell line is treated with an MDM2 inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic> using two different treatment protocols. These <italic>in vitro</italic> data are consistent with a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with the SJSA-1 cell line and nutlin-3, which showed that treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> of the SJSA-1 cell line with nutlin-3 generates several highly resistant sublines harboring inactivating, &#8220;hot-spot&#8221; p53 mutations.</p><p>In contrast to the profound resistance obtained by treatment of the SJSA-1 parental cell line <italic>in vitro</italic> with SAR405838 (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), treatment with SAR405838 of the SJSA-1 xenograft tumors in mice fails to generate highly resistant tumor sublines to the drug. When xenograft tumors established using the SJSA-1 parental cell line were treated with SAR405838 at 100 mg/kg, daily for two weeks, all of the tumors underwent rapid and complete regression (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), similar to what we have observed in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, we have shown that SAR405838 is highly effective in induction of strong and persistent apoptosis in the SJSA-1 tumor tissue with a single, oral dose at 100 mg/kg[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the strong apoptosis induction by SAR405838 in the SJSA-1 tumor tissue, all regressed tumors eventually returned (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Harvesting and culturing regrown tumors established 5 sublines (sublines 7.2&#8211;7.4, 7.6, and 7.7). Evaluation of these 5 sublines, together with one subline established from a vehicle-treated tumor and the parental cell line, demonstrated that these 5 sublines are still responsive to SAR405838 in assays of cell growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, albeit with 3&#8211;5 times reduced sensitivity as compared to the vehicle-treated subline or the parental cell line (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Consistently, SAR405838 effectively and dose-dependently activates p53 in these 5 sublines, also with reduced potency as compared to that in the parental cell line. Interestingly, p53 sequencing showed that while the 7.2 subline contains a heterozygous C176F p53 mutation, the other four sublines have no p53 mutation detected.</p><p>To assess if longer treatment of the SJSA-1 tumors in mice with SAR405838 can generate highly resistant sublines, we treated xenograft tumors established in mice using the 7.6 subline with SAR405838 daily at 100 mg/kg for 14 days (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). At the end of this treatment SAR405838 was found to induce partial regression of every single tumor by 72% on average but did not yield complete regression of any tumor, and the tumors resumed their growth after the treatment was stopped. Treatment of the regrown tumors with 200 mg/kg of SAR405838 daily for 8 days, effectively halted tumor growth but did not lead to regression; the tumors resumed growth again once the treatment was ended (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These data showed that while tumors established from the 7.6 subline are responsive to SAR405838, they are less sensitive to SAR405838 than tumors established using the SJSA-1 parental cell line. To determine if the additional treatments (14 days at 100 mg/kg, followed by 8 days at 200 mg/kg) generated highly resistant sublines, we harvested and cultured the SAR405838-treated tumors when their size reached 500 mm<sup>3</sup>, and established 7 sublines. In assays of cell growth, apoptosis and cell cycle progression, these 7 sublines are equally sensitive to SAR405838 as compared to the 7.6 subline and are only 3&#8211;5 times less sensitive than the parental SJSA-1 cell line. In these sublines SAR405838 was consistently able to induce dose-dependent and robust activation of p53 based upon upregulation of p53, p21 and MDM2 proteins. Sequencing of p53 showed that each of these 7 sublines now harbors a heterozygous C176F p53 mutation, the same as that identified in the 7.2 subline.</p><p>The 7.2 subline contains a heterozygous C176F p53 mutation but is only modestly less sensitive to SAR405838 than the parental cell line in assays of cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We tested if more profound resistance could be developed if xenograft tumors established using the 7.2 subline were further treated with SAR405838 in mice (<xref rid="pone.0128807.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). While SAR405838 at 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days induced regression of the same tumors by 50% on average, it failed to induce complete tumor regression on any tumor. In comparison, SAR405838 at 200 mg/kg daily for 14 days was able to achieve complete tumor regression in five out of eight tumors and more than 85% tumor regression in the remaining three tumors. These data showed that the xenograft tumors established using the 7.2 subline are still responsive to SAR405838, albeit with somewhat reduced sensitivity as compared to the xenograft tumors established using the parental SJSA-1 cell line. When those five completely regressed tumors regrew, we established 5 new sublines. Evaluation of these five sublines <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that SAR405838 is very effective in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in each of them, with a potency 3&#8211;5 times less than that in the parental SJSA-1 cell line and SAR405838 effectively induces dose-dependent p53 activation in these sublines. p53 sequencing showed that all the five sublines contain the same single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation, but no additional p53 mutation. Taken together, our investigation using both the 7.6 and 7.2 sublines demonstrates that prolonged treatment of the SJSA-1 tumors with SAR405838 <italic>in vivo</italic> fails to yield highly resistant tumor cell lines. Although a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation is detected in many of the sublines established after tumor regression in the treatment with SAR405838, p53 can be still effectively activated by SAR405838 in these sublines.</p><p>Based upon the crystal structure of the p53:DNA complex,[<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] the C176 residue of p53, together with H179, C238, and C242 residues, coordinates with a zinc ion. Hence, mutation of the C176 residue to phenylalanine in p53 eliminates the coordination of C176 with the zinc and could have a major negative impact on the structural stability of the p53 protein. Therefore, it was surprising to find that SAR405838 can effectively activate p53 in all sublines containing a single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation. We performed computational modeling to assess the impact of the single heterozygous C176F p53 mutation on the p53: DNA complex structure. Since each p53 functional unit is a tetramer with four p53 monomer components, a total of 6 structural tetramer models with 2 mutated p53 and 2 wild-type p53 molecules are possible and were investigated. Among the six possible structural models, the FCCF model was found to be the most stable. Our modeling further showed that in the FCCF tetramer model, the two mutated Phe residues gain additional hydrophobic and cation-&#960; interactions, compared to the wild-type p53 tetramer structure, which help to maintain the structural stability and transcriptional activity of the p53 tetramer containing a heterogamous C176F mutation.</p><p>The profound resistance developed by treating the SJSA-1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with SAR405838 and the modest resistance developed by treating the SJSA-1 xenograft tumors in mice with SAR405838 indicate that even using the same tumor cell line and the same drug, tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> may have a different response in the development of resistance to drug treatment. When the SJSA-1 tumor cells are treated with SAR405838 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the cells are under constant high pressure from the drug and p53 is continually activated. In order for the tumor cells to survive, there is a need to acquire an inactivating p53 mutation to render the drug completely ineffective. On the other hand, when the SJSA-1 tumors are treated with SAR405838 in mice, although the drug reaches sufficient exposure and duration to induce strong p53 transcriptional activation and robust apoptosis in the tumor tissue, p53 activation is not constant and fluctuates as a result of drug pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="pone.0128807.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Tumor cells do not, therefore, need to acquire inactivating p53 mutation(s) in order to survive. Instead, a structural mutation (C176F) of p53, which causes tumor cells to become 3&#8211;5 times less sensitive to the drug <italic>in vitro</italic>, appears to be sufficient for some tumor cells to survive and for tumors to regrow after the treatment is stopped.</p><p>The results of this study have an implication for investigation of acquired drug resistance mechanisms for other classes of anticancer drugs. In investigation of drug resistant mechanisms, it has been assumed that the findings obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture models may help to understand the drug resistant mechanisms in patients. Although it may be true in some cases, our present study suggests that there may be very different acquired resistant mechanisms for the same drug between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128807.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Body weight change of mice in <xref rid="pone.0128807.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> (A), <xref rid="pone.0128807.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> (B), <xref rid="pone.0128807.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> (C) and <xref rid="pone.0128807.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> (D).</title><p>Data shown are mean &#177; SEM for 6&#8211;8 mice. </p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128807.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128807.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The root-mean-square deviations of the p53 backbone atoms from the wild-type crystal structures in four different tetrameric arrangements from the 6 ns MD simulations.</title><p>The distances between R181 (C&#950;) of E180 (C&#948;) in the pair of demerit p53 proteins calculated from the MD simulations.
