Some forms of DNA modification are known to protect phage DNA from cleavage by restriction enzymes, but others are of unknown function. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas nuclease complexes were shown to mediate bacterial adaptive immunity by RNA-guided target recognition, raising the question of whether phage DNA modifications may also block attack by CRISPR-Cas9. We investigated phage T4 as a model system, where cytosine is replaced with glucosyl-hydroxymethylcytosine (glc-HMC). We first quantified the extent and distribution of covalent modifications in T4 DNA by single-molecule DNA sequencing and enzymatic probing. We then designed CRISPR spacer sequences targeting T4 and found that wild-type T4 containing glc-HMC was insensitive to attack by CRISPR-Cas9 but mutants with unmodified cytosine were sensitive. Phage with HMC showed only intermediate sensitivity. While this work was in progress, another group reported examples of heavily engineered CRISRP-Cas9 complexes that could, in fact, overcome the effects of T4 DNA modification, indicating that modifications can inhibit but do not always fully block attack.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Bacteria were recently found to have a form of adaptive immunity, the CRISPR-Cas systems, which use nucleic acid pairing to recognize and cleave genomic DNA of invaders such as bacteriophage.

In bacteriophage T4, genomic DNA contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC), which is further modified by the attachment of glucose to yield glucosyl HMC (glc-HMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Incorporation of HMC blocks DNA cleavage by many restriction endonucleases, and the glc-HMC modification further blocks attack by the HMC-specific McrABC (Rgl/MspJI) nuclease. Today, more than 10 different types of covalent modification in bacteriophage DNA are known, many of which are of unknown function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Eukaryotic DNA can also be modified to methylcytosine, hydroxymethylcytosine, and glucosylated hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;1&#160;</label><caption><p>DNA modification in phage T4 showing C-containing DNA (left), HMC-containing DNA (middle), and glc-HMC DNA (right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0031523540001"/></fig><p>Recently, striking studies have revealed a new class of nucleases in bacteria, the CRISPR-Cas systems, which provide bacteria with a form of adaptive immunity against infection with genomic parasites such as phages or plasmids (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Short sequences from genomic parasites are incorporated into CRISPR arrays in the bacterial chromosome; they consist of repeated sequences and unique spacers (typically ~30&#160;nucleotides) that are derived from invaders (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Transcription of the arrays and RNA processing produce spacer RNA sequences (crRNAs) that are bound by a nuclease (Cas9 for the type II CRISPR systems) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The crRNA is then used to recognize DNA of invaders by base pairing, allowing subsequent nucleic acid cleavage by Cas9 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; reviewed in references <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> to </xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

One previous paper analyzed the effects of a smaller DNA modification&#8212;adenine N6 methylation&#8212;and showed that phage DNA with this modification was still sensitive (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Another study demonstrated that genome engineering by Cas9 in eukaryotes is also unaffected by 5-methylcytosine (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Here we investigated the effects of the larger DNA modifications found in T4. We first characterized T4 DNA modification in detail by single-molecule sequencing and nuclease digestion. We went on to show that the bulkier HMC and glc-HMC modifications can, in fact, inhibit CRISPR-Cas9 attack. While this work was in progress, another group reported examples where T4 with glc-HMC modification could, in fact, be sensitive to attack by CRISPR-Cas9, which we further analyzed and attribute to the use of a heavily engineered and optimized CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>The extent of modification in T4 and mutant derivatives.</title><p>Prior to testing sensitivity to CRISPR-Cas9, wild-type bacteriophage T4 [termed T4(glc-HMC) here] and mutants altered in DNA modification were analyzed to characterize the nature and extent of genomic DNA modification. T4(147) is a mutant with changes in genes encoding the alpha and beta glucosyltransferases that attach glucose to HMC DNA so that genomes contain HMC only [termed T4(HMC) here]. T4(GT7) is a mutant with changes in genes required to substitute HMC for dCTP in nucleotide pools so that genomes contain only unmodified cytosines [termed T4(C) here]. For complete T4 genotypes, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#160;S1</xref>&#160;in the supplemental material.</p><p>Several studies were carried out to verify the presence of the expected DNA modifications in each phage and evaluate the extent of base substitution. First, genomic DNAs were purified from phage stocks and probed by exposure to DNA-modifying enzymes of known specificities. DNA from T4(C), but not T4(HMC) or T4(glc-HMC), was sensitive to digestion by the restriction enzyme AluI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2A</xref>, top), as expected for DNA containing unmodified cytosines. T4 genomic DNAs were next incubated with MspJI, which cleaves HMC-containing DNA selectively. T4(HMC) DNA was digested, but not T4(glc-HMC) or T4(C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2A</xref>, middle). The T4 DNAs were also exposed to a glucosyltransferase and a glucose donor, which resulted in reduced mobility of T4(HMC) DNA, consistent with glucose attachment to HMC, but no changes were observed in faster-migrating T4(C) or slower-migrating T4(glc-HMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2A</xref>, bottom). T4 DNA modification was further probed by infection of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains expressing the Rgl nuclease, which cleaves HMC-containing DNA selectively. Infection with T4(HMC) was undetectable in Rgl-containing strains, but infection with T4(glc-HMC) or T4(C) was not restricted. These data confirm the expected modification patterns in the T4 DNA stocks studied and indicate that the extents of HMC incorporation and subsequent glucosyl conjugation are great, consistent with an analysis of nucleotides generated after enzymatic degradation of T4(glc-HMC) DNA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;2&#160;</label><caption><p>Characterization of phage T4 DNA modification.

In this method, single DNA molecules are sequenced by synthesis on immobilized DNA polymerase enzymes. Sequence information is acquired by detection of fluorescently labeled nucleotides during each incorporation step. The presence of DNA modifications in the template can slow the kinetics of incorporation, allowing DNA modification to be quantified as an increase in interpulse duration (IPD). IPD values are calculated for each position in the template sequence and are compared to an <italic>in silico</italic> model of IPD values for an unmodified sequence (IPD ratio) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In favorable cases, different forms of DNA modification show distinguishable kinetic profiles (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure&#160;2B</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#160;S1A and B</xref> in the supplemental material) summarizes the SMRT sequencing results for T4(glc-HMC), T4(HMC), T4(C), and a T4 genome lacking all forms of modification made by copying wild-type T4 DNA with a DNA polymerase <italic>in vitro</italic> (whole-genome amplification [WGA]). Kinetic profiles of T4(glc-HMC) showed many increased IPD ratios associated with expected positions of glc-HMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2B</xref>, top). Particularly increased IPDs were seen for potential glc-HMC sites 3&#8242; of a G residue or 5&#8242; of a pyrimidine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#160;S2</xref> in the supplemental material). The mechanism of these sequence context effects is unknown&#8212;they could reflect either different extents of glucose attachment dependent on the local sequence or differential effects of the sequence on polymerase kinetics. Kinetic perturbations were also seen at additional base positions, commonly those near C residues in the sequence, suggesting that modifications may contact polymerase from nearby positions in the DNA chain. For T4(HMC), kinetic lags were also associated with sites of potential C modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2B</xref>, middle), but the magnitude of the effects was typically less than for T4(glc-HMC). For T4(HMC) modification, IPD ratios were particularly high for pairs of expected HMC residues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#160;S2</xref>). T4(C) and the WGA DNA showed no notable alterations in kinetics at C residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2B</xref>, bottom two panels).</p><p>T4 also encodes an (N6-adenine)-methyltransferase that methylates A residues at 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; sequences. The role of this modification is unknown, but it may help protect T4 DNA from the cellular methyl-directed mismatch repair system, which carries out double-strand cleavage when mismatches are detected near unmodified 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; sequences (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Methylation was evident as increased IPD values at A in 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; in all three T4 genomic DNAs but not in the WGA control. However, the extents of modification differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2C</xref>). The extent of 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; adenine methylation was higher in both T4(C) and T4(HMC) than in T4(glc-HMC) DNA, paralleling a previous report (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This is consistent with a steric interference model, which posits that glucosylation of HMC obstructs access of the adenine methyltransferase to T4 DNA and thereby reduces the extent of 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; adenine methylation.</p><p>Sequencing data for T4(C) showed a high proportion of reads that mapped to the <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> genome (56.7%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#160;S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Far fewer <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> reads were detected in the T4(glc-HMC) and T4(HMC) samples (1.5 and 0.8%, respectively).

T4(C) contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding the DenB nuclease, which normally degrades host cell DNA, thus allowing <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> DNA to compete for packaging in T4 particles, as well as mutations inactivating the T4-encoded dCTPase and dCMP hydroxymethylase enzymes. In T4(C), different segments of the <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> DNA were not packaged with uniform frequency (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#160;S3</xref>), suggesting the possible involvement of sequence-specific recognition during T4 packaging (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1.3"><title>Inhibition of CRISPR-Cas9 by T4 DNA modification.</title><p>Given that the densities of DNA modifications in T4(glc-HMC) and T4(HMC) are high, we sought to investigate whether the CRISPR-Cas system was blocked by T4 DNA modification.

Titration studies of strains containing Cas9 and CRISPR2, 3, and 4 showed the efficiency of plating to be reduced by &gt;10,000-fold. CRISPR1 was weaker, showing a reduction of only about 3-fold, paralleling many studies showing variation in the efficiency of CRISPR targeting.</p><p>T4(glc-HMC), in contrast, formed plaques on strains expressing T4 CRISPR1 to 4 and Cas9 efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4E</xref>). Infection of three of the four CRISPR-containing strains was as efficient as for the strains with control nonspecific spacers. The fourth (T4 CRISPR4) contained the spacer with the fewest modified C resides on both DNA strands and therefore the lowest modification density. Infection with T4(glc-HMC) was reduced 2- to 10-fold in repeated assays, and plaque size was reduced by about two-thirds, indicating some sensitivity. Note that two modified cytosines are present in the T4 CRISPR4 target in the DNA complementary to the 5&#8242;&#160;NGG&#160;3&#8242; PAM, and glucosylation of these likely exerted some inhibition. A previous study showed that both DNA strands of the PAM are important for target recognition in other CRISPR systems (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). T4(glc-HMC) infection was not inhibited in strains expressing T4 CRISPR3, which contains no cytosines on the target DNA strand but seven on the complementary strand, indicating that modifications on either strand can interfere with CRISPR attack. Thus, glucosylation of HMC mostly protects T4 from attack by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, but a region with few glc-HMC residues showed modest but detectable sensitivity.</p><p>For T4(HMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4F</xref>), the T4-targeting CRISPR1 to 3 constructs did not inhibit infection, indicating that substitution of cytosine with HMC was also sufficient to block CRISPR-Cas9 attack. However, for T4 CRISPR4, which has the fewest C residues on both the target and complementary strands, T4(HMC) was highly sensitive&#8212;efficiency of plating was reduced by at least 10,000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4F</xref>). This indicates that the HMC modification alone on the cytosines on the complementary strand of the 5&#8242;&#160;NGG&#160;3&#8242; PAM is not enough to inhibit CRISPR-Cas9 attack. Evidently, the HMC modification is a less effective blocker than the glc-HMC modification, though both suffice at a high enough density.</p></sec><sec id="s1.4"><title>Comparison to results of Yaung et al.</title><p>While this work was in progress, Yaung et al. reported three spacers in an engineered type II CRISPR system that were functional against wild-type T4(glc-HMC) phage and a T4 mutant containing HMC DNA (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We obtained their spacer plasmids and confirmed that they were able to restrict the growth of T4(HMC) and T4(glc-HMC) phage in plaque assays as reported (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#160;S4A and B</xref> in the supplemental material). These spacers differed from ours in that the crRNAs were engineered so that they were fused to tracrRNAs also known as single-guide RNAs (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The tracrRNA is a small RNA bound by Cas9 that is required for crRNA processing and as a cofactor for Cas9 nuclease activity (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Fusion of the two RNAs is convenient in some genome engineering applications (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>We cloned the spacers of Yaung et al. into the type II CRISPR system used in our studies, where crRNAs are not fused to tracrRNA, as in the natural <italic>S.&#160;pyogenes</italic> CRISPR-Cas9 system. We found that two of the three spacers were ineffective against the modified DNA of phage T4(glc-HMC) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#160;S4D</xref>), but all three spacers were effective against unmodified DNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#160;S5</xref>). Two of the spacers restricted the growth of T4(HMC), while the third showed partial activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#160;S4C</xref>). We confirmed that the Cas9 nucleases used here and by Yaung et al. functioned similarly in side-by-side tests, indicating that the CRISPR RNAs and not the Cas9 nuclease were responsible for the functional differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#160;S5E and F</xref>). Evidently, the spacers of Yaung et al., with the synthetic single-guide RNA fusion, show higher activity against modified T4 DNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#160;S4</xref>). These data indicate that DNA modifications can inhibit a biologically occurring type II CRISPR system but that particularly potent crRNAs can overcome this inhibition.</p><p>With the model system available to study CRISPR-Cas9 attack on T4, we were able to address further questions of T4 biology as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s1.5"><title>Testing the role of T4 IP proteins.</title><p>Three T4 proteins are injected into <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> along with T4 DNA early during infection (IPI to IPIII) and bind the T4 genome (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). IPI protects T4 from the GmrS/GmrD restriction enzyme, but the functions of IPII and IPIII are unknown (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)&#8212;we thus asked whether any of the IP proteins contribute to evasion of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This study was motivated in part by a previous report in which <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phages were shown to encode protein inhibitors of a CRISPR-Cas system (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). For T4, such proteins would hypothetically be required for DNA modifications to exert their protective effect. A T4(glc-HMC) mutant strain in which all three IP genes are altered was tested by infection of strains containing the T4-targeting CRISPRs. No difference in infectivity was observed, indicating that the IP proteins are not cofactors required to allow DNA modification to inhibit attack by CRISPR-Cas9 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig.&#160;S6</xref> in the supplemental material). However, we note that there are multiple types of CRISPR-Cas systems that are quite different from each other, and T4 can infect <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), so it would be of interest to test possible inhibition of additional CRISPR-Cas systems from these organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s1.6"><title>Characterization of a revertant of T4(C) with reduced sensitivity to CRISPR-Cas9.</title><p>We observed a T4(C) revertant that reduced sensitivity to CRISPR-Cas9, and so we characterized it further. Normally, T4(C) plaques are small and turbid. During growth, we observed the appearance of a new variant generating large clear plaques resembling T4(glc-HMC) plaques. Further tests showed reduced sensitivity to CRISPR-Cas9 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig.&#160;S7C</xref> in the supplemental material). We sequenced the revertant phage, named T4(C)<sup>R</sup>, and identified three mutations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig.&#160;S7A and B</xref>). One point mutation eliminated the stop codon in <italic>gp42</italic>, which encodes dCMP hydroxymethylase, an enzyme necessary to synthesize HMC. A second mutation introduced a single nucleotide deletion into the deoxycytidylate deaminase gene, yielding a stop codon that truncated the encoded protein. Deoxycytidylate deaminase converts dCMP (a precursor of HMC) to dUMP. Both of these mutations favor the synthesis of HMC, which can be incorporated into the T4(C)<sup>R</sup> genome and then further modified to glc-HMC with &#945;- and &#946;-glucosyltransferases. The third mutation was a nonsynonymous point mutation in the uncharacterized, hypothetical protein NrdC.5 and is of unknown significance.</p><p>T4(C)<sup>R</sup> was resistant to spacers 1, 2, and 3 in the CRISPR-Cas9 system but sensitive to spacer 4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig.&#160;S7C</xref>), thus showing slightly greater sensitivity than wild-type T4(glc-HMC). These and other results are consistent with the idea that T4(C)<sup>R</sup> contains HMC or glc-HMC, though potentially not at every position in the genome because of larger cellular dCTP pools competing for incorporation. These findings again support the idea that DNA modifications can block CRISPR-Cas9 activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="h2"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>These data show that modification of T4 DNA to HMC or glc-HMC reduces sensitivity to attack by CRISPR-Cas9. A previous study showed that adenine methylation at a 5&#8242;&#160;GATC&#160;3&#8242; sequence did not block CRISPR-Cas-mediated inhibition (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and data presented here show that low-density modification with HMC also was not protective. Evidently, protection against CRISPR-Cas9 attack can be achieved by either the addition of bulkier glucosyl-HMC modifications or the addition of a high density of less bulky HMC modifications.</p><p>While this work was in progress, and contrary to our developing data, Yaung et al. reported spacers that could, in fact, target glc-HMC-modified T4 DNA efficiently (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our own tests with the reagents of Yaung et al. confirmed their conclusions. The Cas9 enzymes used were identical in both studies, specifying the RNA component as the origin of the different potency. Yaung et al. used crRNAs fused to tracrRNAs, which could have potentially improved activity by favoring RNA loading onto Cas9 or increased specific activity of the loaded sgRNA/Cas9 complex. One of the crRNAs of Yaung et al. was notably potent even without the tracrRNA fusion, suggesting that for this spacer, fusion with the crRNA did not explain its potency. Another candidate explanation is that the positions of base modifications in the recognition site may be important and that the rules for this are not fully clarified. For all of the spacers studied here, we have not investigated whether cleavage mediating T4 inhibition is, in fact, due to on- or off-target cleavage, so increased off-target specificity is another possible explanation for the increased inhibition seen (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p>Classic studies of the tailed DNA phages have identified more than 10 different forms of covalent DNA modification, and modification is commonly found in the DNA of these viruses (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Recent metagenomic studies also emphasize the ubiquity of CRISPR systems targeting phage in natural environments such as the human microbiome (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). There are even examples of phage from the human gut that themselves encode CRISPR spacers targeting other phage from the same individual, indicating that phages may compete with each other by using the CRISPR-Cas system (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Given these observations and data shown here that modification of T4 DNA to HMC or glc-HMC can reduce sensitivity to attack by CRISPR-Cas9, it seems probable that many of the bulkier forms of DNA modification seen in tailed DNA phage have evolved, at least in part, to reduce sensitivity to cleavage by CRISPR-Cas systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Propagation of phage strains.</title><p>Manipulation of phage T4 was carried out as described in reference <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>.
