Several studies have shown DNA dependent ATPase activity in the region between exon 2 to exon 5 at aa 125 to132 of Rad51C [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rad51C N-terminus domain is known to form complexes with Rad51B, D and XRCC2 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], thus variant 1 maintains protein to protein interactive functions. We would hypothesize then that overexpression of variant 1 should stabilize the complex and facilitate DNA repair and replication. To evaluate the biological function of the variant 1, we performed <italic>In vitro</italic> transient overexpression of Rad51C variant 1 in HCT116 colorectal tumor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>). A 1.8 fold increase in the cell proliferation was recorded in the variant 1 expressing cells as comparing to empty vector transfected controls according to BrdU FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S3</xref>). In addition we evaluated the expression of Rad51C variant 1 in cell proliferation with immunofluorescence staining after labeling with BrdU. We found the cells expressing Rad51C variant 1 had more BrdU positive cells as comparing to cells transfected with empty vector and non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S4</xref>). These <italic>In vitro</italic> data suggest the Rad51C variant 1 may promote cell proliferation in colorectal tumors.</p><p>Promoter methylation of Rad51C has been shown in breast and ovarian cancer patients [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Here we show promoter methylation of Rad51C in colorectal tumor and LS-174T DNA samples. DNA methylation is known to exert multiple functions including regulation of gene expression, determining alternate poly A choice and tissue specific selection of alternate promoters [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It has been shown that Methyl CpG (MECP2) binding proteins are enriched in alternatively spliced exons and chemical or genetic disruption ablates the aberrant exon skipping events [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results show that the Rad51C variants expression was up regulated after treatment with 5-azacytidine, a classic demethylation agent. This indicates that Rad51C promoter methylation can regulate the expression of variants in colorectal tumors. Further investigation is needed to elucidate differential function of the Rad51C variant 1, given its association with the malignant phenotype, and its higher degree of response to demethylation agents. Experiments to evaluate its potential effect in drug resistance and DNA repair are under way in our laboratory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patient tumor tissue samples collection</title><p>The human tumor tissue samples were obtained from the tissue procurement shared resources of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, after institutional review board approval.
