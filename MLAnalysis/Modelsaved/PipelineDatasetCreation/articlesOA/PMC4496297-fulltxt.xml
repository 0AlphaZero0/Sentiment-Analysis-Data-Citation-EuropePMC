the assembly of virulence-associated organelles termed pili or fimbriae in
Gram-negative bacteria<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The type 1 and P pili expressed by
uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are prototypical structures
assembled by the CU pathway<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. CU pili are linear polymers
composed of multiple different subunit proteins (pilins). The assembled pilus adopts
a composite architecture, consisting of a rigid helical rod that is anchored to the
outer membrane (OM) and a flexible tip fiber that contains the adhesive subunit
(adhesin). The type 1 pilus rod contains more than 1,000 copies of the FimA major
pilin; the type 1 pilus tip contains the FimH adhesin at its distal end, followed by
single copies of the FimG and FimF adaptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. FimH binds to mannosylated proteins
present on the bladder epithelium, leading to bacterial invasion and the development
of cystitis<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The CU pathway assembles and secretes pili in a highly regulated manner
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Nascent pilins enter the
periplasm via the Sec translocon<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>,
and then form binary complexes with the periplasmic chaperone in a process termed
donor-strand complementation (DSC)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In DSC, the
chaperone donates a &#223;-strand to complete the incomplete immunoglobulin
(Ig)-like fold of the subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. For assembly of
subunits into a pilus fiber and secretion to the cell surface, chaperone-subunit
complexes must interact with the OM usher. The usher catalyzes the exchange of
chaperone-subunit for subunit-subunit interactions<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Subunit-subunit interactions form by a mechanism
termed donor strand exchange (DSE)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, in which the
N-terminal extension (Nte) of an incoming subunit replaces the donated chaperone
&#223;-strand from the preceding subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Type 1 pili are assembled starting with
the FimH adhesin, and the pilus extends by step-wise addition of new
chaperone-subunit complexes to the base of the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Each subunit specifically interacts with its appropriate
neighbor in the pilus, with the specificity of binding determined by the DSE
reaction<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In addition, the usher aids ordered pilus
assembly by differentially recognizing chaperone-subunit complexes<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Ushers are large, integral OM proteins composed of five domains<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>: a periplasmic N-terminal (N) domain, a transmembrane
&#223;-barrel channel domain, a plug domain located within the &#223;-barrel
region, and two periplasmic C-terminal domains (C1 and C2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The N domain provides the initial binding site
for chaperone-subunit complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1a</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. The C1 and C2 domains provide a second binding
site and anchor the growing pilus fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.
1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In the resting
<italic>apo</italic>-FimD usher, the plug domain occludes the lumen of the
&#223;-barrel channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The usher must be activated for pilus biogenesis
by binding of a FimC-FimH complex to the N domain<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Activation results in
displacement of the plug to the periplasm, insertion of the FimH adhesin into the
channel lumen, and transfer of FimC-FimH from the usher N domain to the C domains
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The mechanism and specific sequence of events
driving usher activation and handoff of chaperone-subunit complexes from the N to
the C domains is not understood. The usher N and C domains bind to the same surface
of the chaperone, and handoff requires rotation of the chaperone-subunit complex,
concomitant with translocation of the pilus fiber through the usher channel toward
the cell surface<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The usher exists in the OM as an
oligomer<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. However, the pilus fiber is
secreted through only one protomer of the usher oligomer, and the usher monomer
appears to be sufficient for pilus biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.
Therefore, whether and how the additional usher molecules contribute to the
catalysis of pilus assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> is a subject of debate.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we sought to understand how the usher controls and coordinates
protein-protein interactions during pilus biogenesis. We used site-directed
photocrosslinking to confirm the usher N, C1, and C2 domains as specific binding
sites during pilus assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a fluorescence-based
affinity assay to compare binding of FimC-FimH to wild-type (WT) and domain deleted
FimD ushers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), we show that the FimD C
domains provide the high-affinity binding site, suggesting that handoff of
chaperone-subunit complexes from the N to the C domains is driven by differential
affinity. We provide evidence that the C domains are masked in
<italic>apo</italic>-FimD through interaction with the plug domain, explaining why
FimC-FimH must first bind to the N domain to activate the usher. We show that the
plug domain is essential for fiber polymerization and acts as a switch controlling
usher activation. Finally, by using a plug deletion mutant to pre-activate the
usher, we demonstrate that the usher is functional as an oligomer <italic>in

mutants, obtaining crosslinks between the usher and the FimC chaperone or FimH
adhesin for each mutant except one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Each of these FimD
<italic>amber</italic> mutants formed a stable usher in the OM in the
presence of <italic>p</italic>Bpa, and each was functional for pilus assembly
(data not shown). We obtained the most efficient crosslinking when
<italic>p</italic>Bpa was located at FimD positions Phe4 in the N domain,
Tyr704 and Thr717 in the C1 domain, and Tyr788 in the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figs. 2 and
3</xref>). Crosslinked products that reacted with anti-FimC-FimH antibody
were visible for each of these FimD <italic>amber</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The anti-FimC-FimH antibody
cross-reacts with the His-tag epitope, and thus also detects the His-tagged FimD
usher. Immunoblotting with anti-His-tag antibody verified the presence of the
usher in the crosslinked products, and analysis of a strain expressing a
Strep-tagged FimD (which does not cross-react with the anti-FimC-FimH antibody)
confirmed the presence of the chaperone or adhesin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 2b and
c</xref>). In addition, the crosslinked bands for the FimD Phe4, Thr717, and
Tyr788 mutants, but not the Tyr704 mutant, reacted with anti-FimC-FimG antibody,
which recognizes the FimC chaperone but not the FimH adhesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Taken together, these results
confirm the predicted interactions of FimD residues Phe4, Thr717, and Tyr788
with FimC, and FimD residue Tyr704 with FimH. More broadly, these results
validate the N, C1, and C2 domains of the usher as specific binding sites for
chaperone-subunit complexes during pilus biogenesis <italic>in
vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P8">The bands obtained for the FimD Phe4 and Tyr788 <italic>amber</italic>
mutants migrated at the expected size for a crosslinked FimD-FimC product (114
kDa; mature FimD and FimC are 91 and 23 kDa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). A doublet was obtained for the FimD Phe4 mutant,
with the lower band reacting with both the anti-FimC-FimH and anti-FimC-FimG
antibodies, identifying it as the usher-chaperone complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence
of FimD and FimC in the lower FimD Phe4 band, as well as in the FimD Tyr788
crosslinked band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data Set 1</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of the upper
band of the FimD Phe4 doublet suggested that this was a crosslink with the
abundant OM protein OmpA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data Set 1</xref>). This is consistent with the usher having
a dynamic and flexible N domain, able to sample the periplasm for
chaperone-subunit complexes. An <italic>ompA</italic> mutant strain assembled
type 1 pili similarly to the parental WT strain, as determined by
hemagglutination (HA) assay (data not shown), indicating that that OmpA does not
have a direct role in pilus biogenesis. In contrast to the FimD Phe4 and Tyr788
crosslinked products, the bands obtained for the FimD Tyr704 and Thr717 mutants
migrated with slower relative mobility than expected for either a FimD-FimH
complex (120 kDa; mature FimH is 29 kDa) or a FimDFimC complex, respectively
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Mass spectrometry confirmed
the presence of FimH and FimC in the crosslinked bands, and did not identify
other crosslinked partners for the FimD Tyr704 and Thr717 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data Set
1</xref>). Therefore, although we do not know the basis for the altered
mobilities, the Tyr704 and Thr717 crosslinked products represent FimD
interactions with FimH or FimC, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>FimD C1 and C2 domains are the high-affinity binding site</title><p id="P9">Having validated the usher N and C domains as binding sites for
chaperone-subunit complexes, we next sought to determine the relative
contributions of each domain to affinity for FimC-FimH. Affinity
(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) was measured using a fluorescence-based
assay<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. We first measured binding
affinity of WT FimD for FimCFimH, where FimC was labeled with the thiol-reactive
probe coumarin maleimide (CPM) at Q19C, T51C, or N86C single cysteine
substitution mutations. These labeling sites were chosen because of their close
proximity to the usher when the chaperone-adhesin complex is bound at either the
N or C domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
4</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Each of the FimC substitution
mutants expressed stably and functioned similarly to WT FimC for pilus assembly
in bacteria (data not shown). Binding assays using these FimC constructs yielded
<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 9.50&#8211;12.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The measured affinities were not
significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18), indicating agreement among
the different labeling sites. Moreover, these values correspond well with a
previously reported <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 9.1 nM, determined by
surface plasmon resonance<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.
We chose the FimC<sub>Q19C</sub> CPM labeling site
(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 12.6 nM) for subsequent affinity
measurements.</p><p id="P10">To examine the contribution of the usher C domains to affinity for
chaperone-subunit complexes, we measured the binding of
FimD<sub>&#916;C2</sub> and FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> domain
deletion mutants to FimC-FimH. Both of these, and all other usher deletion
mutants used in this study, expressed stably and folded properly in the
bacterial OM (data not shown). We obtained <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values
of 213 and 389 nM for the FimD<sub>&#916;C2</sub> and
FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).
The decreased affinities obtained for these mutants compared to WT FimD identify
the C domains as the high-affinity binding site on the usher for
chaperone-subunit complexes.</p><p id="P11">These results also reveal that the usher N domain, which remains
available for binding in the FimD<sub>&#916;C2</sub> and
FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), has lower affinity for FimC-FimH. In the P pilus system,
the isolated usher plug domain was shown to interact with chaperone-subunit
complexes<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. To determine if the plug
contributes to affinity for FimC-FimH in the context of the full-length usher,
we examined a FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant. The affinity of
FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> for FimC-FimH (12.5 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) was similar to WT FimD. This
indicates no direct role for the plug domain, at least for binding to the
initiating chaperone-adhesin complex.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The plug domain masks the C domains in the inactive usher</title><p id="P12">Given that the C domains provide the high-affinity binding site, it is
not clear why the N domain is required for the initial binding of
chaperone-subunit complexes to the usher. To address this question, we measured
the affinity of a FimD<sub>&#916;N</sub> mutant for FimC-FimH. Despite the
presence of the C domains, there was no appreciable binding of FimC-FimH to
FimD<sub>&#916;N</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &gt; 1200 nM;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).
This suggests that the high-affinity C domains are unavailable for binding in
the absence of the N domain. In its <italic>apo</italic> state, the usher plug
domain resides within the lumen of the &#223;-barrel channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We reasoned that in this position, the plug could
interact with the C1 and C2 domains, keeping the C domains inaccessible until
activation of the usher by binding of a chaperone-adhesin complex to the N
domain and expulsion of the plug to the periplasm. To test this, we constructed
a FimD usher deleted for both the N and plug domains
(FimD<sub>&#916;N&#916;plug</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1b</xref>). The affinity of FimD<sub>&#916;N&#916;plug</sub> for
FimC-FimH was 40.8 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>),
which is dramatically increased compared to the FimD<sub>&#916;N</sub> mutant
and close to the affinity observed for WT FimD. This result indicates that the
high-affinity C1 and C2 domains become accessible to chaperone-subunit complexes
in the absence of the plug domain, supporting our hypothesis that the plug
functions to mask the C domains in the inactive usher.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The plug domain is required for higher-order pilus assembly</title><p id="P13">Previous studies demonstrated that the plug domain is essential for
pilus assembly by the usher<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that the plug functions to
maintain the usher in the inactive state by masking the C domains, but this does
not explain why the plug is necessary for pilus biogenesis. One possibility is
that, in the absence of the plug domain, chaperone-subunit complexes no longer
bind to the N domain. We used site-directed photocrosslinking to detect binding
of FimC-FimH to the N and C domains of the FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant.
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, we obtained a similar
pattern of crosslinks for the FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant as for WT FimD.
Note that the level of FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> in the OM is lower than for

&#916;plug mutant. Thus, chaperone-subunit complexes still interact with both
the N and C domains in the absence of the plug domain.</p><p id="P14">To further investigate the role of the plug in pilus assembly, we
expressed His-tagged WT FimD or the FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant in
bacteria together with the FimC chaperone and FimH and FimG pilus tip subunits.
These experimental conditions allow testing of the ability of the usher to
polymerize pilus fibers (consisting of FimH followed by multiple copies of
FimG), using a co-purification assay<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. FimC, FimG, and FimH co-purified with both WT FimD and
the FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant, as revealed by immunoblotting with
anti-FimC-FimG or anti-FimC-FimH antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.

stable to SDS at low temperatures<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Analysis of the WT FimD samples incubated at 25&#176;C
revealed a ladder of higher molecular mass species, indicating polymerization of
FimG into a pilus fiber with FimH at its tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig

samples incubated at 25&#176;C demonstrated that the mutant was greatly
impaired in its ability to promote fiber polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Consistent with this, bacteria expressing the
FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub> mutant were unable to assemble pilus fibers of
sufficient length on the bacterial surface to agglutinate red blood cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).
Taking these findings together, we conclude that the plug domain is dispensable
for the binding of chaperone-subunit complexes to the usher and initiation of
pilus assembly, but essential for efficient polymerization of the pilus
fiber.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Plug deletion reveals a functional usher oligomer</title><p id="P15">The usher exists as an oligomer in the OM; however, only one usher

possibility is that the N domains of the nontranslocating ushers recruit
chaperone-subunit complexes to the OM assembly platform, and these complexes are
then transferred to the C domains of the actively translocating usher. If true,
then co-expression of FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> and
FimD<sub>&#916;N&#916;plug</sub> usher mutants (N and C domains
available, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) should
allow reconstitution of pilus biogenesis. Indeed, co-expression of the

Pilus biogenesis on the bacterial surface by the strain co-expressing
FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> and FimD<sub>&#916;N&#916;plug</sub>
was confirmed by electron microscopy (EM), which revealed levels of pilus fibers
comparable to the strain expressing WT FimD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.

the C domains in the inactive usher, co-expression of a FimD<sub>&#916;N</sub>
mutant (plug domain intact) with FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> did not
result in pilus assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In

polymerization of the pilus fiber and provides the channel for secretion of the
fiber to the cell surface. The usher performs its functions in the absence of an
external energy source such as ATP, relying instead on harnessing protein-protein
interactions<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Our
findings reveal mechanisms by which the usher controls access to its domains and
show how these domains act in concert to ensure the assembly of adhesive organelles.
We also demonstrate that individual usher molecules can act <italic>in
trans</italic> for pilus biogenesis in bacteria, providing conclusive evidence
for a functional usher oligomer.</p><p id="P17">Using site-directed photocrosslinking, we confirmed that the usher N, C1,
and C2 domains function as binding sites for chaperone-subunit complexes during
pilus biogenesis in bacteria. The crosslinked products obtained for the FimD Tyr704
and Thr717 mutants, located in the C1 domain, migrated with slower-than-expected
relative mobility. Other potential binding partners were not identified by mass
spectrometry and only the usher is capable of forming a crosslink in our
experimental system. One possibility for the slower mobility is that these
crosslinked products migrate aberrantly during electrophoresis. A second possibility
is that these complexes represent higher-order assembly intermediates comprising
FimD-FimD as well as FimD-FimH or FimD-FimC contacts, consistent with the usher
oligomer forming an actively engaged assembly unit <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P18">Our comparison of full-length and domain-deleted FimD ushers revealed that
the C domains provide the high-affinity binding site for FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin
complexes. Based on our results, we conclude that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>
measured for WT FimD (12.6 nM) reflects the contribution of the C domains to
affinity for FimC-FimH, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> measured for
FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> (389 nM) reflects the contribution of the N
domain to affinity for FimC-FimH. In contrast to our results, Volkan <italic>et
al.</italic> found that the C2 domain of the P pilus usher PapC had lower
affinity for chaperone-subunit complexes compared to the N domain<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This difference likely reflects
the fact that the PapC C2 domain was studied in isolation, rather than in its native
orientation in the context of the C1 domain and the rest of the usher protein.
Chaperone-subunit complexes bind first to the usher N domain and then transfer to
the C domains, through an unknown mechanism<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that this
handoff is driven by differential affinity, with the high affinity C domains
outcompeting the lower affinity N domain for the common binding site on the
chaperone. Handoff may also be facilitated by allosteric destabilization of the N
domain-chaperone-subunit complex by the C2 domain or through interactions with the
plug, as suggested by studies in the P pilus system<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Our finding that the C domains have higher affinity compared to the N domain
for FimC-FimH raised the question as to why chaperone-subunit complexes first bind
to the N domain of the <italic>apo</italic> usher. We demonstrated that the C
domains are not available for binding in the absence of the N domain, but become
available in the absence of the plug. Based on these results, we propose that the
<italic>apo</italic> usher employs a domain masking strategy to keep the C
domains inaccessible, dependent on interaction of the C domains with the plug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Only
FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complexes are able to activate the FimD usher<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Therefore,
masking of the C domains would allow the usher to sample chaperone-subunit complexes
in the periplasm via its N domain, with only FimC-FimH initiating pilus assembly by
triggering release of the plug from the channel and freeing the C domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Domain
masking thus provides a mechanism to ensure assembly of a functional pilus fiber
with the adhesin at its tip, poised to bind host cell receptors.</p><p id="P20">The plug domain is essential for the function of the usher in pilus
biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. The plug occupies the channel of the <italic>apo</italic>
usher, and we show here that the plug masks the C domains. However, these functions
are related to maintenance of the usher in its inactive state. We found that the
plug domain is not needed for recruitment of chaperone-subunit complexes to the
usher or formation of stable pilus assembly intermediates <italic>in vivo</italic>.
Instead, we found that the plug is required for efficient polymerization of the
pilus fiber. The catalytic activity of the usher in fiber polymerization is
postulated to be due to optimal positioning of chaperone-subunit complexes to
promote the DSE reaction<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In the
activated usher, the plug resides in the periplasm, adjacent to the N domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
1d</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We propose that the plug
contributes to catalytic activity by fixing orientation of the N domain relative to
C domains. Thus, the location of the plug may act as a central switch that
determines the activation state of the usher. In the resting usher, the plug closes
the channel and masks the C domains. Expulsion of the plug to the periplasm then
activates the usher by (i) opening the channel, (ii) unmasking the C domains, and
(iii) ensuring optimal positioning of the N domain to promote subunit-subunit
interactions.</p><p id="P21">The usher exists as an oligomeric complex in the bacterial OM<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, but whether the oligomer makes a functional
contribution to pilus biogenesis has been a subject of debate. We show here that
co-expression of FimD<sub>&#916;N&#916;plug</sub> and
FimD<sub>&#916;C1&#916;C2</sub> ushers results in assembly of adhesive pili
on the bacterial surface. Pilus biogenesis by these ushers necessitates that the N
and C domains from different usher molecules cooperatively interact, providing a
mechanistic basis for the function of the usher oligomer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).
Analysis of various combinations of FimD deletion mutants revealed that a plug
domain is required for successful complementation, but the plug cannot be present on
the same usher as the C domains. The requirement for the plug together with the N
domain emphasizes the active role of the plug in the catalytic activity of the
usher. The finding that complementation does not work when the plug is present
together with the C domains reflects our finding that the plug masks the C domains
in the inactive usher.</p><p id="P22">In a prior study, we found that PapC C-terminal deletion mutants could
interact with FimD to drive assembly of P pili on the bacterial surface by the Fim
system<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This supports
the existence of cooperative interactions between different ushers in bacteria. The
FimH adhesin was also required for functional interaction between PapC and FimD in
the prior study, suggesting that FimD needed to be activated by binding to the
adhesin<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In light of the
results from the current study, we can now understand that the C domains of FimD
were masked and unavailable to participate in pilus assembly prior to usher
activation.</p><p id="P23">We propose that identical usher molecules act in an asymmetric manner during
pilus biogenesis, with multiple ushers serving to recruit chaperone-subunit
complexes to the OM, but only one usher providing the active translocation channel
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).
Such an arrangement may enhance the catalytic activity of the usher by increasing
the local concentration of chaperone-subunit complexes, and may allow for greater
regulatory control of fiber polymerization through usher-usher interactions or
changes in the oligomeric state of the usher. Other transporters found in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes also exist as oligomeric complexes<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Studies suggest that these complexes may also function in

exchanged solution. Labeling efficiency was calculated using Beer's Law, and was
typically &gt; 80%.</p><p id="P32">Fluorescence measurements were performed using a PC1 photon-counting
spectrofluorometer (ISS), as described<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Coumarin-labeled chaperone-subunit complexes were
diluted to 25 nM and 120 &#956;l was transferred to a 3 mm microcuvette.
Purified FimD was then titrated into the FimC-FimH solution. The fluorophore was
excited at 384 nM, and its emission spectrum was measured from 420-520 nm with a
step size of 2 nm. Variability in lamp intensity was accounted for using Vinci
(ISS) data acquisition software. The integral of the curve was calculated,
providing the total emission intensity. Buffer measurements were also performed,
and background emissions were subtracted. Data were normalized to account for
dilution during titration, and set to a scale of 0 (starting value) to 1 (the
final value). Apparent equilibrium bimolecular dissociation constants
(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) were obtained by fitting the data using a
sigmoidal curve function in Prism (GraphPad) and solving for the inflection
point. Each titration curve shown is the result of at least three independent
experiments with three replicates per experiment. All of our observed
<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s were independent of starting FimC-FimH
concentrations (below the dissociation constant), and thus were dependent only
on the mass action of the titrant, FimD. Statistical comparison of
<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s for FimD mutants with WT FimD was performed
using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test in Prism (GraphPad). Comparison of
the different FimC cysteine substitution mutants was performed using one-way
analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple-comparison post test.
<italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Analysis of usher expression and folding in the OM</title><p id="P33">The expression levels and folding of the FimD mutants in the OM were
compared to WT FimD, as described<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Briefly, OM fractions were isolated by French press
disruption and Sarkosyl extraction, and proper folding of the ushers was
determined by heat-modifiable mobility on SDS-PAGE. Strain SF100 was used as the
host strain for these studies.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Hemagglutination (HA) assay</title><p id="P34">HA assays were performed by serial dilution in microtiter plates, as
described<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. HA titers
were determined visually and are reported as the greatest fold dilution of
bacteria able to agglutinate guinea pig red blood cells (Colorado Serum
Company). For each HA assay, at least three independent experiments were
performed, with three replicates per experiment. Analysis of the FimC WT and
cysteine substitution mutants was performed in strain
MM294&#916;<italic>fimC</italic>, which contains a <italic>fimC</italic>
deletion in the chromosomal <italic>fim</italic> operon. Analysis of the FimD WT
and mutant ushers was performed in strain MM294&#916;<italic>fimD</italic>,
which contains a <italic>fimD</italic> deletion in the chromosomal
<italic>fim</italic> operon. The experiments in which FimD WT or domain
deletion mutant ushers were co-expressed were also done in strain
MM294&#916;<italic>fimD</italic>. Bacteria harboring appropriate FimD or
FimC plasmids were grown statically for 24&#8211;48 h to induce the chromosomal
<italic>fim</italic> genes, and then FimD or FimC expression was induced
with 50 &#956;M IPTG or 0.15% arabinose, respectively, for an additional 3 h
with shaking at 100 rpm. To test the role of OmpA in type 1 pilus biogenesis, HA
titers were determined for strain JF568 and its isogenic
<italic>ompA</italic><sup>&#8211;</sup> derivative JF699. The strains were
grown statically for 24&#8211;48 h to induce the chromosomal
<italic>fim</italic> genes. For analysis of assembly of FimG-FimH type 1
pilus tips, strain AAEC185/pNH222 (encoding FimC, FimG, and FimH) was
transformed with the FimD expression plasmids pNH213 (WT FimD) or pNH324
(FimD<sub>&#916;plug</sub>). HA titers were determined from strains grown
with aeration and induced at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6 with 50 &#956;M IPTG and
0.1% arabinose for 1 h.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Electron microscopy (EM)</title><p id="P35">Whole bacteria, negative-stain transmission EM was performed as
described<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Aliquots
(1 ml) of cultures grown for the HA assay were washed with PBS and resuspended
in 1.5 ml PBS. Bacteria were fixed with 1% gluteraldehyde in PBS, washed with
PBS followed by water, and then stained for 20 s with phosphotungstic acid.

HA assay. OM fractions were solubilized with the non-denaturing detergent DDM,
and the His-tagged FimD was purified by cobalt affinity chromatography.
FimD-containing fractions from the column were incubated for 10 min at 25 or
95&#176;C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted
with anti-FimC-FimH<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or

Pilus subunits
traverse the inner membrane (IM) via the Sec translocon. Upon entering the
periplasm, the subunits form binary complexes with the FimC chaperone (yellow).
The chaperone enables proper folding of pilus subunits via the DSC mechanism
(see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
1a</xref>). Chaperone-subunit complexes next interact with the FimD usher.
The usher is depicted as a monomer, with its &#223;-barrel channel domain in
the OM and its N, plug, C1, and C2 domains indicated. Binding of a
chaperone-adhesin complex (FimC-FimH) to the N domain activates the usher for
pilus biogenesis. The plug is expelled from the usher channel to accommodate the
FimH adhesin, and the FimC-FimH complex is handed off from the N to the C
domains. The N domain is now free to recruit additional chaperone-subunit
complexes, which undergo DSE with the last-incorporated subunit bound at the C
domains (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Repeated rounds of subunit recruitment and
DSE result in assembly of the pilus fiber in a top-down manner and secretion
through the usher channel to the bacterial surface. (<bold>b</bold>) Cartoon
