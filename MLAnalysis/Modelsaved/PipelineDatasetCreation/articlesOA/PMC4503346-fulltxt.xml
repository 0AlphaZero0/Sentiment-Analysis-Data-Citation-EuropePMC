The objective of this study was to determine the physiological roles of a CBF gene isolated from a cold-tolerant perennial grass species, Kentucky bluegrass (<italic>Poa pratensis L</italic>.), which designated as <italic>PpCBF3</italic>, in regulating plant tolerance to freezing stress. Transient transformation of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mesophyll protoplast with PpCBF3-eGFP fused protein showed that PpCBF3 was localized to the nucleus.

Plant adaptation to chilling or freezing stress involves various molecular changes, including the induction of many low-temperature response genes and transcription factors, such as dehydration-responsive-element-binding protein (DREB1)/C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

It is notable that the fold change of <italic>COR15a</italic> expression in transgenic plants was greater than that of other COR genes under normal and freezing stress, suggesting that <italic>COR15a</italic> could play a prominent role in freezing tolerance of transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>PpCBF3</italic>. It has been reported that in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, overexpressing <italic>COR15a</italic> improved freezing tolerance of chloroplasts frozen in situ (-4&#176;C and -5&#176;C) and of protoplasts frozen in vitro (between -5&#176;C and -8&#176;C) [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, <italic>COR15a</italic> expression in transgenic Arabidopsis has no significant effect on the survival of whole frozen plants. Several <italic>COR</italic> genes (i.e. COR6.6a and COR47) are cooperatively stimulated along with <italic>COR15a</italic> when subjected to low temperature [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which suggests that these <italic>COR</italic> genes might act in concert with each other to increase tolerance to freezing stress in plants. It is postulated that expression of the entire batch of <italic>COR</italic> genes activated by <italic>PpCBF3</italic> would have greater effects on freezing tolerance than <italic>COR15a</italic> expression alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Phenotypic alterations due to overexpression of <italic>PpCBF3</italic> in Arabidopsis</title><p>Previous studies have reported constitutive over-expression of DREB1/CBF genes resulted in stunted shoot growth, delayed flowering, and lower yields, all of which are considered negative characteristics for agronomic crop species [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Many attempts have been reported to minimize the negative effects of DREB1/CBF over-expression by using stress-inducible promoters [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>PpCBF3</italic> in Arabidopsis also slowed growth and delayed flowering in transgenic plants. Unlike agronomic crops, slower vertical growth and delayed flowering are desirable traits in perennial grasses used as turfgrass. Slow-growing turfgrasses require less-frequent mowing, irrigation, and fertility inputs while the presence of flowering reduces turf visual quality and uniformity [<xref rid="pone.0132928.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>PpCBF3</italic> could be potentially useful for genetic engineering of turfgrass improvement to freezing tolerance and developing other desirable traits, such as slowed growth and late flowering.</p><p>In summary, <italic>PpCBF3</italic> isolated from cold-tolerant Kentucky bluegrass was characterized as a DREB1/CBF transcriptional factor and was responsive specifically to cold stress. The physiological and gene expression analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <italic>PpCBF3</italic> confirmed <italic>PpCBF3</italic> serves roles in regulating plant tolerance to severe freezing stress and was associated with the up-regulation of downstream genes (<italic>COR15a</italic>, <italic>COR6</italic>.<italic>6</italic>, <italic>COR47</italic>, <italic>COR78</italic> and <italic>P5CS</italic>) involved in cold tolerance. The positive physiological effects of <italic>PpCBF3</italic> for freeing tolerance and the induction of desirable turfgrass phenotypic traits suggested that <italic>PpCBF3</italic> could be a useful candidate gene for genetic modification of perennial grasses for high turf quality and improved freezing tolerance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0132928.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Relative mRNA expression level of <italic>PpCBF3</italic> in leaves of <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> under 20% PEG and 150 mM NaCl treatment.</title><p>Values are means &#177; SD of three independent experiments.
