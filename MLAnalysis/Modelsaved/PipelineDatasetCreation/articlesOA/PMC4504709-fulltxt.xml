They are integral to the structural support of cells, in skin, hair and nails. In skin, keratin is thought to play a critical role in conferring the barrier properties and elasticity of skin. In general, the keratin dimer is broadly described by a tri-domain structure: a head, a central rod and a tail. As yet, no atomistic-scale picture of the entire dimer structure exists; this information is pivotal for establishing molecular-level connections between structure and function in intermediate filament proteins. The roles of the head and tail domains in facilitating keratin filament assembly and function remain as open questions. To address these, we report results of molecular dynamics simulations of the entire epithelial human K1/K10 keratin dimer. Our findings comprise: (1) the first three-dimensional structural models of the complete dimer unit, comprising of the head, rod and tail domains; (2) new insights into the chirality of the rod-domain twist gained from analysis of the full domain structure; (3) evidence for tri-subdomain partitioning in the head and tail domains; and, (4) identification of the residue characteristics that mediate non-covalent contact between the chains in the dimer. Our findings are immediately applicable to other epithelial keratins, such as K8/K18 and K5/K14, and to intermediate filament proteins in general.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Unilever R&amp;D.

Keratins are the most numerous IF and are found in skin (e.g. K1/K10, K5/K14, K8/K18), hair (e.g. K86/K36, K82/K80, K71/K25) and nails [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In skin, keratin responds to and redistributes mechanical stresses across the cell, contributing to the skin&#8217;s elastic properties [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IF fibers comprise hierarchical assemblies, starting with the fundamental dimer sub-unit that self-organizes into higher-order sub-units (such as the tetramer and so forth) ultimately leading to the formation of the filament (Fig Aa in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Molecular scale insights into the interactions that drive and stabilize assembly of the higher-order sub-units are not clearly established but are much needed.</p><p>Experimental evidence confirms that all IF protein dimers have the same tri-domain structure: a head, a central rod, and a tail domain [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0132706.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). However, there remain a number of questions on the exact details of the dimer structure. These questions remain, despite advances in experimental characterization techniques, because of the substantive experimental challenges involved in gaining detailed atomistic-scale models at any level of the sub-unit hierarchy. Much of this experimental progress has focused on resolving the rod domain structure, which has extensive regions of coiled-coil structure. One key question regards how the conformation(s) of the largely uncharacterized head and tail domains impact on both the assembly and functional properties of keratin as a whole. For example, the second stage of hierarchical filament formation is thought to be the anti-parallel arrangement of dimers into a tetramer, which then propagate into protofilaments [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Intuitively, the interfacing between the highly structured rod domains should be the predominant driving force of sub-unit association. However, experimental data suggest that without the presence of the head domain, fibers do not form [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Experimental evidence further shows that the presence of the tail domain influences the width of the resultant fiber [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and thus could play a role in fiber compaction. Additionally, experimental evidence indicates that head and tail domains play a critical role in water retention regarding the elasticity of the fiber [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, in the absence of full, experimentally-derived detailed structural models of the rod, head and tail domains, molecular simulation can play a complementary role in connecting keratin structure with function.</p><fig id="pone.0132706.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0132706.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Structural models of the keratin dimer.</title><p>(A) Schematic of the domain structure of the keratin dimer.

The sequence of the central rod domain is highly conserved amongst epidermal keratins and furthermore, shares a high similarity with other IF&#8217;s, such as the Type III homodimer vimentin. Some experimental data are available for keratin, however, there is relatively more experimental information available regarding the structure of the rod domain of vimentin. X-ray crystallographic techniques using a &#8216;divide and conquer&#8217; approach have suggested that the vimentin rod is principally a left-handed coiled-coil [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the compartmentalized nature of this structure-determination approach does not rule out that some details, apparent only <italic>via</italic> studies of the <italic>entire</italic> dimer structure, may not have been captured. Furthermore it has highlighted that the 2A subdomain of vimentin may contain parallel strands rather than the left handed coiled-coil seen elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The corresponding evidence for keratin is less complete, with crystal structure data available only for part of the 2B subdomain of K5/K14 [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the absence of conclusive data, molecular simulations may offer a route to further refining the rod structure from the experimental data to reveal the chirality of the coiled-coil arrangement along the rod-domain, and improve the interpretation of the impact of this chirality on the higher-order sub-unit assembly and structure.</p><p>In contrast to the rod domain, the sequence of the head and tail domains varies in length (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. the head domains of K1 and K18 comprise 180 and 80 residues, respectively) and identity between different keratins. These domains are generally longer for the type II keratins (e.g. K1, K5, K8 <italic>etc</italic>.) than the type I keratins (K10. K14, K18 <italic>etc</italic>.). Epithelial keratin sequences typically possess high numbers of glycine residues and few cysteine residues, while trichocyte keratins contain relatively greater numbers of cysteine residues. Current understanding on the head and tail domains indicates that these correspond with intrinsically-disordered regions of the keratin protein [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, the overall size of the dimers, which in mature fibers is 44 nm [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], is thought to be approximately the size of the rod domain (40&#8211;50 nm) [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may suggest that the head and tail domains are folded back onto the rod domain, as has been experimentally observed for the vimentin dimer head domain [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] while the corresponding tail domain was found to be flexible [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A sub-division of the head- and tail-domains of keratins has been proposed on the basis of sequence analysis alone [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but this analysis has never been verified <italic>via</italic> experiment or simulation. This analysis suggested that the head domain could be divided into three subdomains, denoted as the end subdomain, E1, a variable glycine-rich subdomain, V1, and, a region of sequence homology close to the rod domain, H1 (see Fig Ab in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). A second set of homologous residues was later identified in type II keratins [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], that correspond to the C-term residues of the proposed E1 subdomain. These conserved residues may thus be important in defining the boundaries of these proposed subdomains. On the same basis, the tail domain could be similarly sub-divided [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Presently, the tri-subdomain structure of the head and tail for keratin remains a hypothesis. The evidence base provided by molecular dynamics simulations of the keratin dimer may refine and characterize this tri-domain structure in the head and tail domains, giving vital clues into the dimer-level structural arrangement.</p><p>Previous work has reported the use of modeling to investigate the structure of IF proteins. Smith and Parry [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] visualized the three-dimensional arrangement of residues in the rod domain of the K1/K10, K5/K14 and K35/K85 keratin dimers by directly mapping the keratin residues onto the experimental structure of the vimentin rod. This analysis allowed a static assessment of the overall character of each face of the dimer rod, but could not accommodate for any structural changes due to the chemical differences in residues between keratin and vimentin. Neither could it provide any details on the head and tail domains. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation offers an approach to model chemical interactions and can potentially yield physically-reasonable full structure predictions of IF proteins. Results of such molecular simulations have been reported previously for both the vimentin homodimer system [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and recently, the trichocyte keratin heterodimer [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (found in hair). These previous studies chiefly focused on the mechanical properties of the IF sub-units, rather than the structural details, and did not report local structural properties of the dimer at the residue level, nor did they provide any specific details on the structure and behavior of the head or tail domains. Furthermore, the majority of keratins are epidermal keratins; these have relatively little cysteine/methionine content compared with the trichocyte keratins, and hence the structure of the epidermal keratins relies less on disulfide cross-linking. This makes the structure prediction of epidermal keratins more challenging; not only are there fewer clues regarding points of contact in the IF sub-units (as would be indicated by the disulfide bridges in trichocyte keratins), but also, the sub-unit assemblies are structurally less rigid, owing to the lack of covalent linkages. Use of MD simulation to predict full structural details of epidermal keratin, including a characterization of the head and tail domain structures, as well as the rod domain chirality, has yet to be reported.</p><p>Here we detail the use of MD simulations to generate multiple, full, molecular structures of the entire K1/K10 heterodimer, including an analysis of the disordered head and tail domains, and demonstrate that these results are consistent with the existing data on IF structure. These keratins are found in the upper epidermal cells in the stratum corneum of human skin. From our statistical analysis of several structural models, we have elucidated common features of the keratin dimer, yielding the most probable conformational motifs. Although our simulations consider the keratin dimer in isolation, our findings aid conceptualization of the arrangement of essential structural regions of the dimer needed for forming the keratin filament. Key to this is the prediction of the local helical character along the <italic>entire</italic> rod domain using these models. Our results further enable an estimation of the spatial extents of the intrinsically disordered head and tail domains, which has not yet been achievable experimentally. Also, our results indicate that the characteristics of the head and tail domains concurs with their being a tri-subdomain structure, as has been hypothesized solely from sequence analysis. The 3-D shape and characteristics of these subdomains may aid elucidation of how the head domain confers interaction between dimers in the fiber assembly process. The tail domain, in comparison, was found by our models to be less well defined in shape and more conformationally labile, in agreement with the recent experimental measurements performed on vimentin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>To generate complete structures for the K1/K10 dimer we performed a total of 25 all-atom MD simulations using a range of starting configurations. Because of the system complexity, we used a mixture of full dimer models (ten simulations), as well as truncated dimer models (fifteen simulations). The truncated system comprised only the first half of the dimer, spanning the head-1A-L1-1B domains. Atomistic-level experimental data, obtained for closely-related systems such as vimentin, provided a crucial basis for the construction our structural models (see below). While such data for the rod domain are relatively more mature than for the head and tail domains, very recent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements for vimentin have provided vital clues regarding the arrangement of the head domain[<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data help to justify our choice for the initial arrangement of the head and tail domains in our simulations (see below for more details). For the highly structured core rod domain, this central domain of the dimer was initially configured in a manner as has been observed for a similar IF (vimentin), and so necessitated only moderate restructuring during simulation. Given that few details on the head and tail domain structure are known, we considered a range of initial configurations for the head and tail domains, to better sample the available conformations; we simulated these until stable structures were obtained. We obtained equilibrated structures of keratin by simulating the dimer in an implicit solvent environment (see Section C in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for details). For further refinement, eight of the equilibrated dimer structures were then modeled in an explicit solvent.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Constructing the initial models of the dimer</title><p>To model the K1/K10 dimer we constructed several initial starting structures and used these as a basis for further refinement during equilibration of the MD simulation. Each dimer was built by first constructing the head, rod and tail domains and then linking these three domains together to form the dimer (additional details are given in Section A and B in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>Since detailed structures of key regions of the rod domain (i.e. the coiled-coil domains) exist for a related IF, vimentin, we used these as a starting point for our model of the K1/K10 dimer. Comparison between vimentin and K1/K10 rod domain sequence shows that there is a 30% and 90% sequence similarity in amino acid identity and residue type, respectively, and is suggestive of similar structure. The crystal structures of the vimentin 1A (3G1E.pdb [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), 1B (3UF1.pdb [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) and 2A-L2-2B (3KLT.pdb [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and 1GK4.pdb [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) coiled-coil subdomains were obtained from the RCSB protein databank (PDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/</ext-link>).</p><p>The initial configuration of the coiled-coil rod sub-domain of the K1/K10 dimer was generated by overlaying the K1/K10 sequence (obtained from the online IF database [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) onto the experimentally-determined structure of vimentin (see Section B in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for details) to build the corresponding K1/K10 1A, 1B and 2A-L2-2B coiled-coil subdomains (see Section B in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for exact procedure). To create the full rod domain structures these coiled-coil subdomains then needed to be spatially translated, reoriented and then linked in sequential order using the sequences of the L1 and L12 linker regions as bridges. Each of the L1 and L12 linkers was constructed in the form of loops (see Section B in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for exact procedure and Fig Ad in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).</p><p>The head and tail domains of the K1/K10 dimer comprise 365 and 275 residues, respectively, making these the second-longest head and tail domains of any keratin. There are little direct data available on the structure of the head and tail domains of keratin or any other closely related IFs. However, recent site-directed spin labeling and EPR measurements for vimentin [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggest that the head groups are folded back onto the rod domain such that residue 17 of vimentin (in the head domain) is close to residue 137 (in the 1A subdomain). In some of our initial structures we assumed that keratin had similarly folded head and tail domains.</p><p>To generate these folded initial configurations of the head domain, the primary sequence of each chain was built as a &#946;-strand, protruding from the N-term of the 1A coiled-coil subdomain in the direction of the long-axis of the rod domain (<italic>y</italic>-axis of the simulation cell). Each chain of the head domain was looped back onto the rod domain using a hairpin turn of nine residues (<italic>&#981;</italic> = &#8722;162.5&#176;, <italic>&#968;</italic> = 162.5&#176; and <italic>&#969;</italic> = 180&#176;, see Section D in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for definitions of these dihedral angles). The folded initial configurations of the tail domain, which protrudes from the C-term of the 2B coiled-coil subdomain, were generated in a similar way as the head domain to fold back on to the rod domain. Finally, the head and tail domains (details described below) were added to the rod domain to produce the full initial structure of the K1/K10 dimer, like that seen in Fig Af in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>.</p><p>In our models we have made no allowance for the existence of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues, but instead allowed the sidechains to interact purely via non-bonded interactions. The K1/K10 dimer has a total of seven cysteine residues (specifics are given in Section H in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) and are not highly conserved amongst keratins. In the rod and tail domains there are no suitable pairings for disulfide bonding, whereas the head domain contains a total of four cysteines. We did not explicitly include disulfide pairs in our models because there is currently a lack of atomistic-scale structural information to guide our selection of which pairs to link. Without such guidance, our selection of disulfide pairs might unduly bias the resulting structures generated from our simulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Initial model configurations of the head and tail domains</title><p>The most challenging parts of the dimer to model, due to the unavailability of detailed experimental data, are the intrinsically disordered head and tail domains. To better sample the range of folded conformations of these domains we considered 25 different models, varying the initial configuration of these domains. In ten of our models we simulated the full dimer; for these we built the tail domain in the same configuration as the head domain. In our remaining fifteen simulations, we considered a truncated model, where we cleaved the dimer at the C-terminal end of the 1B coiled-coil subdomain and terminated each chain with a COOH group. To ensure that this artificial termination of the dimer did not cause the 1B coiled-coil subdomain to unravel during the simulation, a harmonic restraint was applied between the between the C<sub><italic>&#945;</italic></sub> atoms of the C-terminal residues in each truncated keratin chain (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. residues K1:328 and K10:296). A force constant of 1000 kcal (&#197; mol)<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and an equilibrium distance of 14.37 &#197; (the distance measured in the initial model of the full dimer), were used for the restraint.</p><p>There are a multitude of possible ways that each head/tail chain can be folded back on to the rod domain. The construction of our initial models of each head and tail model was based on two key degrees of freedom: (1) the direction of the turn relative to the rod domain of the dimer, and (2) the position of the turn along the sequence of the head/tail domain of each chain. Five plausible folding directions were chosen for folding the head and tail chains back on to the rod domain which covered the entire range of possible orientations for the two chains. These were to fold: (A) both chains towards the K1 face of the rod domain; (B) both chains towards the K10 face of the rod domain; (C) each chain onto the opposite chain face of the rod (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. K1 onto K10 and <italic>vice versa</italic>); (D) each chain onto its own chain face of the rod; and, (E) fully extended away from the rod domain (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. not folded). A schematic of these different initial configurations is presented in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> for the example of the head domain.</p><p>Another possible variable in our set-up of the head and tail domains was the initial position of the hairpin turn as a function of location along the chain length. We explored up to six different positions of the hairpin turn for each of the orientations (A-E). Hypothesizing that the head domain of keratin may be folded as far back as vimentin, we started by placing the hairpin turn across the residues K1:103&#8211;111 and K10:86&#8211;94 (such that the equivalent keratin residues were next to each other as seen for vimentin from the EPR measurements [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) for the head domain, and across the residues K1:534&#8211;542 and K10:498&#8211;506 of the tail domain. We then shifted the position of the hairpin turn on all the chains by an additional <italic>n</italic> residues (denoted as <italic>n</italic>-shift) towards the rod domain (where <italic>n</italic> = &#8722;5, 0, 3, 5 or 10). The combinations of different orientation and <italic>n</italic>-shift values produced the 25 different models. An overview of the 25 combinations used for the dimer models is given in Fig Ae in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>. To limit the complexity, in our full dimer models we have configured the hairpin of both the head and tail domains such that they were folded in the same direction. It was assumed that since the head and tail domains are located a sufficient distance apart, they cannot influence one another, and can be treated independently.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Atomistic simulation of models using implicit solvent</title><p>We performed MD simulations using the NAMD simulation package [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The protein was modeled using the CHARMM27 all-atom protein forcefield with cmap terms included [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since we considered the keratin in liquid water at ~ pH = 7, histidine was left unprotonated. The long aspect ratio of the protein and the extended initial configurations meant it was not practical to equilibrate the structure using an explicit description of the solvent. Instead, the Generalized Born Implicit Solvent model [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was used. The solvent dielectric was set to 78 (that of water). No counter-ions were needed, as infinite boundary conditions were applied. The cutoff used for calculating the Born radii was 14 &#197;. The pair list distance was 17.5 &#197; and non-bonded interaction cutoff at 16 &#197;, with a switching function applied from 15 &#197;.</p><p>We took two approaches to initiating the implicit solvent simulations. In the first approach, the entire structure was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. The velocities were then initialized to the thermostat temperature of 305 K before proceeding to the MD. In the second approach, the backbone atoms were fixed during the energy minimization. A second minimization was then performed with only the backbone C<sub><italic>&#945;</italic></sub> atoms restrained. Next, with these restraints still present, MD was performed for 30000 steps from initially at-rest molecules, using the same Langevin thermostat. Finally, from this point, full unconstrained MD was carried out.</p><p>Each dimer model was simulated for 100 ns and was determined as equilibrated, with a stable structure, when the root mean square displacement (RMSD) in residue positions had plateaued (see Section C in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

Finally, all restraints were removed for the remainder of the simulation. Here a Langevin piston was used, with a target pressure of 1 bar, a time period of 100 fs and decay of 50 fs. Group pressure was used. The inter-particle forces were calculated using a switching distance of 10 &#197;, a cut-off distance of 12 &#197; and pair list distance of 14 &#197;. Particle mesh Ewald with a grid spacing of 1 &#197; was used to treat the long-ranged electrostatic interactions calculation.

Each specific side chain contact was classified depending on the pair of residue types present (as defined by the residue pairing matrix in Fig Fc in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). To avoid double counting, only one type of interaction was measured for each sidechain pairing, which potentially involved two or more types of interactions. At any sample time contacts were said to be present if the distance between a pair of sidechain reference atoms was less than contact-type-dependent cutoff distance (these values are given in Fig Fc in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) and added to a count. The probability of occurrence of a pairing was then determined by the total count divided by the total number of samples. For the pairings between the four polar residues, Ser, Thr, Gln and Asn, both potential side-chain sites for hydrogen bonding were checked. The average total number of contacts were calculated by summing up the probabilities over the K1-K1, K1-K10 and K10-K10 contacts. The values from these results were used to determine the coiled-coil side chain contact map.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><p>In general, the equilibrated dimer structures had high aspect ratios, with mean principal components of 43.6 nm &#215; 7.4 nm &#215; 11.8 nm (<xref rid="pone.0132706.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), which are consistent with experimental values.

The interface across the 2A, L2 and 2B subdomains has been challenging to experimentally characterize [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; our structures showed that this region exhibited considerable variability (e.g. flexibility) in coiled-coil pitch and radius (around K10:340&#8211;360) both between models, and at different times for the same model. We identified the 2A and L2 subdomains as right-handed and parallel-chained (indicated by the high pitch values), respectively. This arrangement appeared to be enforced by the presence of the first two cross-chain pairings of internally-faced aromatic residues located after the L12 linker, at K10:325 and 339&#8211;340, that helped kept the chains parallel in this region. The parallel-chained coiled-coil continued from the L2 subdomain into the first few residues of the 2B subdomain. At K10:354&#8211;356 our models exhibited a range of radii for the coiled-coil, and an uncertain pitch value. Visual inspection of the structure confirmed that this region corresponded to a kink in the coiled-coil (as seen in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), consistent with a similar feature observed experimentally in vimentin [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We identified the sequence stretches in the kink (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. K10:DNNI and K1:GRHG); the &#945;-helical propensities for these motifs are unfavorable [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the heptad repeat of the coiled-coil places a basic residue in the <italic>d</italic>-heptad position (acid residues in similar positions were also shown to lead to such a kink [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). These features may weaken the coiled-coil, causing the kink.</p><p>With good agreement between the model rod-domain profile and experimental data we next investigated the internal structure of the rod domains by quantifying the inter-chain side-chain contacts of the rod domain. Overall, coiled-coils were maintained by an inter-chain (K1-K10) interdigitation of hydrophobic residues. As a theoretical maximum, an ideal coiled-coil rod domain for keratin K1/K10 would involve 228 inter-chain side-chain interactions linking between the <italic>a</italic>- and <italic>d</italic>-heptad helical positions of the K1 and K10 chains. In practice, our simulations revealed on average 214 such contacts; of these, 80% (172 in total) were hydrophobic, with 12 of these due to aromatic ring contacts. Nine further contact pairs were found between acid and basic sidechains. This contrasts with the <italic>intra</italic>-chain sidechain interactions of the &#945;-helical chains, where each have twice the number of electrostatic attractions (compared with the <italic>inter</italic>-chain case), given there are 19 out of the 197 observed K1-K1 interactions and 19 out of the 192 observed K10-K10 interactions (see Section F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for details). We profiled these sidechain interactions across the rod domains and compared these against the vimentin and K5/K14 crystal structures (using the same methods). <xref rid="pone.0132706.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> shows a comparison between the 2A-L2-2B domain of the K1/K10 model and the K5/K14 experimental data. Here for the K1/K10 model we only show the side-chain contacts that occurred at least 50% of the time in our models. Despite some sequence differences between the two keratins, clear similarities in the internal structure can be seen.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Head domain structure</title><p>A key aim of our work was to obtain a comprehensive picture of the spatial extent and subdomain structure of the head and tail domains, generated via statistical analysis of their structure obtained from our 25 simulations.

The statistical characteristics of the contacts within the head domain suggested a tri-subdomain structure (labelled on <xref rid="pone.0132706.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> as E1, V1, and H1) that was consistent with the assignment implied from past sequence analyses of keratin [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To highlight these similarities we have taken the same sub-domain labeling of the head domain as has been previously proposed [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These subdomains were indicated by the less extensive contact seen between the V1 subdomain and the two other subdomains H1 and E1.</p><p>Our contact plots showed that residues K1:61&#8211;153 and K10:31&#8211;137 were typically in close contact and indicated these residues were part of a globular subdomain V1.

In particular, integral to the V1 subdomain is a highly-conserved set of residues in K1, noted and defined in the sequence analyses as perhaps part of the H1 domain of K1, which were found to contribute a large number of the hydrophobic interactions associated with the head domain (totals shown in Fig F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). The high levels of K1-K10 interactions within this region indicates that the V1 globule could be considered as one unified structure, rather than two separate co-located chain folds formed from K1 and K10 separately.</p><p>The dominant feature of the contact plots is the V1 globule, featuring a 36% (107 residues) glycine content, which has been hypothesized to confer a &#8216;glycine loop&#8217; structure [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Glycine loops are characterized by polyglycine repeats punctuated intermittently (every 3&#8211;6 residues in the head domain) by aromatic residues [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

In contrast to the notion of &#8216;<italic>neighbor-only</italic>&#8217; (in sequence) rings forming separate &#960;-stacks, the regions highlighted by rectangles in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> indicate a more complex hierarchical 3-D arrangement of loop structures.</p><p>We identified the types of sidechain interactions in the head domain (see Section F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and Fig F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>); on average each ring interacted with two of its aromatic neighbors, suggesting the aromatic residues are interlocked in loop-like structures. Furthermore, most hydrogen bonds in the head domain were found between backbone atoms, suggesting that the poly-glycine stretches were folded in close proximity (the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonds within the dimer are given in Fig G in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref> and Section G in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

We investigated the positional and orientational preferences of the head domain relative to the rod, and identified from the models three categories of head domain spatial position, depending on the statistical location of the head domain relative to the 1A subdomain of the rod (examples of each category are shown in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>): Category I&#8211;with the head domain projected out along the long axis of the dimer, beyond the N-terminal end of the 1A subdomain; Category II&#8211;with the head domain at right angles to the top corner of 1A; or Category III&#8211;with the head domain folded down onto 1A. To determine if the V1 globule showed any positional preference, we measured the axial displacement, <italic>d</italic>, and the radial orientation, <italic>&#952;</italic>

A positive value of <italic>d</italic> indicates the globule is positioned above the N-term of the 1A domain (Category I); similarly, a negative value of <italic>d</italic> indicates the globule is located at a point below the N-term of the 1A domain (Category III, <xref rid="pone.0132706.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).

This anchoring of the head domain followed the establishment of electrostatic sidechain interactions between N-term of 1A domain and charged residues in the H1 subdomains, shown in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>. In contrast, for instances when the axial displacement of V1 globule corresponded to Category I, no orientational preference was featured (a wide range of <italic>&#952;</italic>

Unlike V1, these residues showed no radial preference but did show a preference for the N-term of the head domain to be folded back towards the rod domain, suggesting a loose association. The contact between E1 and the rod (details given in Fig F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) showed a variety of contact types, with a large contribution from electrostatic interactions. This variety, and thus redundancy, of residue-contact types may be essential to maximize opportunities for establishing non-covalent contact between E1 and the rod.</p><p>The tail domain presented the same types of questions on its structure as the head domain and thus we conducted similar statistical analyses as was done (see above) for the head domain, which is shown in <xref rid="pone.0132706.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. Superficially, the visual appearance of the tail domain of K1/K10 appeared analogous to the tri-subdomain head domain. <xref rid="pone.0132706.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> shows the residue pair contact plots corresponding to the rod and tail domains 2B-H2-V2-E2. Black dashed-lines demarcate the 2B rod domain and tail domain structure. We divided the tail into three subdomains (H2, V2, E2) based on characteristics of the primary sequence (Figs A and E in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). Again, subdomain labeling was chosen to match previous sequence analyses studies of keratin. The contact plots of <xref rid="pone.0132706.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> and the measured absence of K1-K10 intra-chain contacts suggest that the final seven residues of each chain of the 2B rod subdomain rather belong in the tail domain. This is because there is less structural coherence here than for the rest of the rod, further indicated by the lower probabilities in contact pairing found in H2 than the coiled-coil 2B rod domain (see <xref rid="pone.0132706.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). At this point in the sequence there are multiple glycines, potentially increasing the backbone flexibility relative to elsewhere in the rod. Previously, this sequence stretch had been described as a 7&#8211;10 residue splay in the C-term of the 2B rod domain [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Analysis of the sidechain interactions within the tail showed that each aromatic residue is on average paired with one other (Fig F in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>), supporting fewer and much larger glycine loops in the tail, in contrast with the more complex arrangements in the V1. The hydrophobic patch of residues, K1:497&#8211;513, (previously described as the H2 domain in K1) appeared in the contact plot to be better described as part of the V2 subdomain. There are fewer interactions in the tail domain than in the head domain (see Sections F and G in <xref rid="pone.0132706.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). This may explain why the size and shape of the tail domain exhibited far more structural variability compared with the head domain.

Similar analysis for the C-termini of the E2 subdomain (<xref rid="pone.0132706.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>) showed that the C-termini had a preference to be positioned at or below the C-term of the 2B subdomain and on the K10 side (<italic>&#952;</italic>
<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 120&#176;), i.e. at the tip of the rod rather than folded back. The greater variability in this distribution, relative to E1, further supports the notion that the E2-termini are held more loosely to the rod compared with E1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that the K1/K10 dimer features a kinked central rod domain with a complex helical twist and is capped by a head domain that is folded back down the rod and a tail domain folded more loosely to the side. Based on our findings, we propose model structures for the head and tail domains of K1/K10. The head domain, <xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, comprises a conserved core surrounded by polar and aromatic residues, with a base-rich face projecting out of the lower surface towards the rod domain, and a charged face capping the rod. The tail domain, <xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, features less electrostatic attraction, fewer glycine loops, and is much less structured. At the base of these globules is a set of conserved residues that lead to the charged end of the rod. These contrasts in head and tail structure emphasizes their different roles in filament assembly, where the head domain may act as an anchor, through which two keratin dimers might co-locate in registry, while the tail may help align the rod domains of the two dimers.</p><fig id="pone.0132706.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0132706.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Proposed structural models.</title><p>(A and B) Models of the head (A) and tail (B) domains with annotations indicating the local electrostatic polarity.

Such behavior is also seen in available crystal structures of the tail domain fragments of the IF proteins lamin (1IFR.pdb) and in blood fibrin (3H32.pdb). Unique to the K1/K10 dimer is the large number of glycine residues present in the head and tail domains. These may be required to give keratin sufficient elastic properties that allow these domains to expand when under tension. Such sequences are also present to a lesser extent in the K5/K14 and K8/K18 keratins, which are also found in the skin, but not in trichocyte keratins (as found in hair) or other IF proteins which may not have such such high elasticity requirements. Another feature that is not conserved amongst the IF proteins, but is present in K1/K10, is the overall basic character of the head and tail domains. In other IF proteins the head and tail domains are highly charged, but their characters range between basic (including many of the keratin head domain), acidic and mixed charge, suggesting that these are specific for the IF.</p><p>Our models of the rod domain indicate several kinks and stutters in the coiled-coil structure. These occur when the internal structure is disrupted from the interdigitation of an ideal coiled-coil. For example, in the 1B domain there are several places where a pair of opposing IF conserved, charged sidechains occupy the a- or d-heptad position of each chain (located at K10: 266, 245, 290 and the equivalent in K1). These features may be necessary for providing areas of interfacial registry between two dimers, through interlocking of the dimer rod profiles, which then induces the correct staggering of dimers within the tetramer structure.</p><p>In a keratin fiber, several dimers must hierarchically associate such that the central rods of neighboring dimers align. Experimental evidence suggests four arrangements of dimer pairs [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], denoted A<sub>11</sub>, A<sub>22</sub>, A<sub>12</sub> and A<sub>CN</sub>. Filaments are thought to exhibit a right-handed supertwist in the protofilaments, which are formed from tetramers [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and thus suggest a rope-like hierarchical structure, like that proposed by Utiu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] Therefore, the dimer pairs could be right-hand twisted to maximize interfacial contact area, analogous to the coiled-coils in the dimer [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. If such a twisted structure was present, then participation by the parallel chains in the 2A subdomain would seem unlikely. Moreover, the bulky head and tail domains found adjacent to the 2A subdomain in the A<sub>CN</sub> tetramer and hexamer (combining A<sub>11</sub>, A<sub>22</sub> and A<sub>CN</sub>) structure would also seem unsuitable candidates for such twisting. Thus, for such a model to be plausible, we suggest that this region must feature a break from the twisting between dimers, allowing the head and tail to interface (<xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>), as seen in our models around the 2A-L2 domain. Such a stutter in the twisting may also necessitate a kink at the beginning of the 2B subdomain (as seen in our models), as the profile of the dimer would need to abruptly change from being non-helical in the 2A-L2 subdomains back to helical in the 2B subdomain (if the A<sub>22</sub> interface is also in a twisted profile). A similar kink is not required between either the 1B and 1A, or 1B and 2A subdomains (<xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>) as the more flexible L1 and L12 linkers can perform this role. Experiment shows that when flexibility is removed from the L1 linker, by modifying to an &#945;-helix, then fiber hierarchy cannot extend beyond the unit-length filament and A<sub>CN</sub> end-to-end dimer association is disrupted [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In the keratin filament, it was previously observed that the head lies adjacent to the L12 linker [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an acidic region of the sequence. At neutral pH, the head carries an overall charge +15e, mostly located in highly mobile E1 subdomain, but also in part of the V1 subdomain (see <xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). In the fiber, our dimer model would allow these regions of the head domain to support substantial electrostatic interactions with L12 of a neighboring dimer (see also Kreplak <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0132706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] regarding vimentin) while allowing the bulk globule of the head domain to align with the 2A domain. In our model the end-to-end distance of the head is largely determined by the few N-term residues in E1 that are not in the V1 globule; the head domain is found to extend up to 50 &#197; back along the rod domain, sufficient to align the lower segment of the 1A subdomain with L12. Thus, by forming a non-covalent anchor between the head domain of one dimer and the L12 linker of the second dimer, the 1B rod domains of both dimers are able to align in an anti-parallel fashion, as in the A<sub>11</sub> interface (see <xref rid="pone.0132706.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Full alignment of the rods may then be satisfied <italic>via</italic> mutual twisting.</p><p>In summary, our MD simulations provide the basis for a more detailed and complete atomistic structure of the K1/K10 dimer, and suggest details for the unstructured head and tail domains that have thus far remained elusive to direct experimental characterization. Our models provide a useful reference structure of the dimer, in particular a complete profile of the core rod domain, for future experimental studies, while agreeing well with existing studies in the literature. It is anticipated that the structural models provided in our study will provide a valuable foundation for future experimental investigations of keratin structure at the atomistic level. In particular, application of x-ray crystallographic techniques (along the lines of the &#8216;divide and conquer&#8217; strategy used previously for vimentin) would be extremely valuable for comparison with our predicted structures for the K1/K10 rod domain, while EPR measurements, alongside our predictions, would be enormously helpful in resolving likely structures of the head and tail domains. The good level of overall residue conservation found within all IFs means that our approach and findings will translate to give detailed insights into the dimer structures of IFs in general, particularly of the rod domain. Additionally for keratins, as several sections of the sequence of the head domain are conserved within keratins, our models suggest that these regions are key to defining the emergent sub-domain structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0132706.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting Additional Methodology.</title><p>
