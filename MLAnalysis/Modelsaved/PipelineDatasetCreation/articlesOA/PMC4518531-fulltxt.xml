There are no animal scleroderma esophagus models and esophageal smooth muscle cells dedifferentiate in culture prohibiting in vitro studies. Esophageal fibrosis is thought to disrupt smooth muscle function and lead to esophageal dilatation, but autopsy studies demonstrate esophageal smooth muscle atrophy and the absence of fibrosis in the majority of SSc cases. Herein, we perform a detailed characterization of SSc esophageal histopathology and molecular signatures at the level of gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Esophageal biopsies were prospectively obtained during esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 16 consecutive SSc patients and 7 subjects without SSc.

Similar to skin, inflammatory and proliferative gene expression signatures were identified suggesting that molecular subsets are a universal feature of SSc end-target organ pathology.

Molecular classification of esophageal biopsies was independent of SSc skin subtype, serum autoantibodies and esophagitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Proliferative and inflammatory molecular gene expression subsets in tissues from patients with SSc may be a conserved, reproducible component of SSc pathogenesis.

A scleroderma colonic fibrosis mouse model has been described, but no animal models of scleroderma esophageal disease have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Esophageal manometry reveals weak to absent peristaltic activity and loss of lower sphincter tone in SSc patients that predisposes to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Proton pump inhibition (PPI) effectively treats GER, but has little effect on esophageal dysmotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is an unmet need for biomarkers that predict development of SSc esophageal dysmotility, methods that will yield insights into pathogenesis, and novel strategies to prevent and treat SSc esophageal disease.</p><p>The replacement of smooth muscle with collagen in the esophageal mucosa (fibrosis) is thought to precipitate SSc esophageal dysmotility, but autopsy and functional studies demonstrate that smooth muscle atrophy is the predominant pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Subjects gave written informed consent to undergo esophageal biopsies. Sixteen patients who met 2013 American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc were studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Seven patients without SSc were enrolled as a comparator disease group. Subjects underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with esophageal biopsies for a clinical indication (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Esophagitis was diagnosed during EGD for patients that met Los Angeles classification criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For research purposes, one additional biopsy pair (upper and lower esophagus) was placed in RNAlater (Applied Biosystems, Ambion&#174;, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and used for DNA microarray analysis; another biopsy pair was placed in formalin for histological analyses.</p><p>Age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking history, presence of GER symptoms, use of PPI, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom duration (defined as interval between GI symptom onset and EGD) were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), SSc disease duration (defined as interval between first non-Raynaud symptom and EGD), SSc subset (lc or dc), and immune modulatory treatment including mycophenolate mofetil exposure (never, past or current) were abstracted for SSc patients. Serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-topoisomerase I, anticentromere, and anti-RNA polymerase III antibody titers were measured by indirect immunofluorescence at Specialty Laboratories (Valencia, CA, USA).</p><p>Pulmonary function tests (PFT) and lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) examinations were obtained when clinically indicated. A chest radiologist who was blinded to clinical data determined the presence or absence of a patulous esophagus and interstitial lung disease (ILD) on HRCT examinations. A patulous esophagus was reported if the luminal diameter of the air or fluid-filled esophagus measured &gt;10&#160;mm in the coronal plane between the level of the aortic arch and the cardiac ventricles, &gt;15&#160;mm in the coronal plane between the level of the cardiac ventricles and the lower esophageal sphincter, or if an air-fluid level was present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

First, the presence of a hiatal hernia and/or esophagitis on gross examination of the esophageal lumen at the time of EGD was considered evidence for esophagitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Second, a GI pathologist who was blinded to clinical data scored esophageal biopsies for degree of basal cell hyperplasia (0&#8201;=&#8201;basal cells restricted to basal layer, 1&#8201;=&#8201;basal cells above basal layer but penetrating &lt;1/3 thickness of squamous epithelium, 2&#8201;=&#8201;basal cells penetrating into 1/3&#8211;2/3 of thickness of squamous epithelium, 3&#8201;=&#8201;basal cells infiltrating cells &gt;2/3 into squamous epithelium). Third, the area with the greatest intraepithelial lymphocyte density on lower power (10&#215; magnification) was identified, and the number of lymphocytes per high-power field (HPF) was counted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

A pathologist also assessed H&amp;E-stained sections for yeast and pseudohyphae consistent with candida esophagitis. Esophageal biopsies were also scored for the degree of collagen deposition in the lamina propria (0&#8201;=&#8201;no, 1&#8201;=&#8201;mild, 2&#8201;=&#8201;moderate and 3&#8201;=&#8201;severe) to assess whether patients with SSc have more fibrosis than patients without SSc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microarray processing and analysis</title><p>RNA was prepared from esophageal biopsies as previously reported for SSc skin biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

In fact, 15 out of 16 (94&#160;%) paired upper and lower esophageal biopsies clustered together (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>A).

Because GER, fungal infections and hiatal hernias can cause esophageal inflammation, we assessed whether inflammatory patients demonstrated more GER- or candida-associated histopathological changes and/or hiatal hernias.

Based upon lymphocyte counts, no control or SSc patient had upper GERD: one control subject and one SSc patient had lower GERD. Importantly, there were SSc patients that had evidence for GERD in upper biopsies with normal lower biopsies. Based upon these data, histological evidence for GERD is definition-dependent; histological findings of upper and lower GERD may lack concordance in individuals; and upper GERD does not appear to be more prevalent in SSc patients compared to non-SSc patients, but the numbers of subjects was small.</p><p>Lastly, we scored lower esophageal biopsies for degree of collagen deposition in the lamina propria (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

Despite its prevalence, the pathogenesis is poorly understood in large part because smooth muscle cells dedifferentiate in culture. Moreover, no animal models of scleroderma esophageal disease, no biomarkers for disease progression, and no disease-modifying treatments have been identified. Patients with SSc routinely undergo EGD with esophageal biopsies for clinical indications. We performed a molecular characterization of gene expression combined with detailed histological analyses of esophageal biopsies to identify biomarkers of esophageal dysfunction and increase our understanding of SSc esophageal disease pathogenesis.</p><p>We identified robust molecular subsets of SSc esophageal disease that are distinct from clinically determined subtypes. A subset of patients with SSc esophageal disease had an inflammatory gene expression signature while another group had a proliferative/noninflammatory signature. We showed that these signatures appear to be independent of traditional clinical markers of SSc including disease subtype and duration, serum autoantibodies and skin score, but the sample size is small. A patulous esophagus on HRCT, esophagitis and/or hiatal hernia on EGD, PFT reductions and immune modulating medication use were not different between groups. With the exception of older age in the patients expressing esophageal inflammation, there were no significant clinical differences between patients in the inflammatory and the proliferative/noninflammatory groups. Importantly, all patients in both groups were taking stable doses of PPIs.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that SSc intrinsic gene expression subsets are present in esophagus as well as in skin. Three subsets (inflammatory, proliferative and noninflammatory) were identified in esophageal biopsies compared to four intrinsic subsets identified in skin biopsies. This observation suggests that we are witnessing inherent heterogeneity in the SSc patient population. The addition of more SSc esophageal samples into this dataset may reveal additional important subsets. For example, the noninflammatory group may be subdivided into two groups as indicated by consensus clustering.</p><p>Our findings are significant because they demonstrate that although end-target tissues in SSc display molecular heterogeneity, there are robust gene expression patterns and molecular pathways that are conserved across tissues. It has been observed that molecular signatures from the same disease in different tissues are more similar than gene expression from different diseases in the same tissue and may allow for the construction of multi-tissue models of pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our results suggest that the strong inflammatory signal, and possibly the proliferative signature, seen in skin and now in the esophagus reflect common pathogenic processes in SSc.</p><p>Importantly, there was no evidence that inflammation resulting from underlying hiatal hernia or GER and candida esophagitis drove the esophageal inflammatory gene expression signature. The prevalence of GER and candida esophagitis and hiatal hernia on EGD, increased basal cell hyperplasia and intraepithelial lymphocytes, and proton pump inhibitor use were not statistically different between SSc patients who did or did not express the inflammatory gene expression signature though the numbers are small. If the inflammatory signature was GER-dependent, we would expect the lower esophageal biopsies from patients in the inflammatory subset to cluster together and separately from the upper biopsies. However, this was not observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>): upper and lower biopsies from the same patient clustered side by side. Further, the nonsignificant difference in lymphocytes present between the two groups suggests that part of the observed inflammatory gene expression signature is due to lymphocyte activation and may also be driven by the infiltration of other cell types such as macrophages or eosinophils.</p><p>On a practical level, the feasibility of conducting molecular studies on esophageal tissue in patients with SSc was established. No subjects experienced any EGD complications, and patients were willing to undergo multiple esophageal biopsies for clinical and research purposes. Esophageal biopsies from healthy control subjects were not obtained, which is a limitation of our current study. Because collagen is a normal esophageal component and not necessarily indicative of fibrosis, future studies should include deeper biopsies to ensure lamina propria sampling. Lamina propria was sampled in 30&#160;% of esophageal biopsies included in the present study, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Esophageal functional studies were also not performed in the majority of patients. Prospective studies are underway to identify associations between gene expression, esophageal histology and changes and esophageal function in SSc patients and healthy control subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Biomarker identification and targeted treatment development for esophageal disease in SSc represent a large unmet clinical need. We are the first to employ whole-genome gene expression analyses of esophageal biopsies from patients with SSc to gain insights into their esophageal disease pathogenesis. We identified inflammatory and proliferative/noninflammatory gene expression signatures in SSc esophageal biopsies that appear to be independent of clinical markers of SSc disease as well as medication use though the sample size is small. Importantly, inflammatory and proliferative/noninflammatory gene expression signatures that were previously identified in SSc skin were recapitulated in SSc esophageal biopsies. This finding suggests that the overarching deregulated molecular programs responsible for SSc are similar in different end organs. Studies are underway to determine the concordance between skin and esophageal gene expression signatures for individual patients. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility and feasibility of genome-wide analyses of gene expression in esophageal biopsies from SSc patients. Efforts are underway to further analyze these data to identify new treatment targets as well as currently available medications that can be repurposed to treat SSc esophageal dysmotility. Results of gene expression analysis of tissues from patients with SSc hold promise for individualized patient care that permits treatment selection based upon knowledge of deregulated molecular pathways.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2015_695_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
