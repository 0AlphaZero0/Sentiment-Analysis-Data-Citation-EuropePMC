The actinobacterial isolates were screened for heavy metal resistance by qualitative, semiquantitative assays and Cr(VI) biosorption was determined by analytical techniques such as atomic absorption spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR).

They occur naturally in the environment, but their concentrations are frequently elevated as a result of pollution introduced into the environment through different human activities such as mining, smelting, sewage sludge disposal, application of pesticides, inorganic fertilizers and atmospheric emissions (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>). Heavy metal contamination is a serious problem not only from the environmental viewpoint, but also from human and animal health perspective because of its non-biodegradable, hazardous and toxic properties. All living organisms require varying amounts of some of these heavy metals for their life processes. Certain mineral elements like iron, manganese and zinc are essential dietary nutrients for poultry and livestock. However, all mineral elements, whether considered to be essential or potentially toxic, can have an adverse effect upon humans and animals if included in the diet at excessively high concentrations (Okoye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). Humans and animals have also been associated with anthropogenic heavy metal pollution in many other ways such as consumption of metal contaminated drinking water, exposure to contaminated soils or industrial waste, absorption through the skin and inhalation of air pollutants (Tataruch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1995</xref>).</p><p>Typically in livestock, the metal ions that enter by means of the above processes are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream and reach different parts of the body where they disturb essential metabolic functions. Animal health impacts due to heavy metals range from enzyme inhibition, immune system degradation, neuron signal interference, organ specific degradation, reduction in fitness, reproductive interference to carcinoma, and with many exposures being lethal (Merrill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>; Hogan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>). Moreover, heavy metals in high concentrations also affect the gut microflora of the animals by increasing intracellular concentration with the consequence of inhibition of enzymes or DNA damage by the production of reactive oxygen species or irreversible binding to the active centers of enzymes (Lopez-Maury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2002</xref>). A variety of conventional physical and chemical methods are available for the removal of heavy metals from the environment. However, they are expensive, not eco-friendly and usually dependent on the concentration of metal ions. As a result, the use of microbes has emerged as an option for developing economic and eco-friendly processes for the removal of hazardous heavy metals.</p><p>Extensive research has shown that different bacteria are tolerant to heavy metals and play important roles in mobilization of heavy metals (Idris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>). Different microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, yeast and actinobacteria, chiefly of the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, have been tested for their biosorption potential of hazardous heavy metals. Recently, application of favorable microorganisms as probiotic is a potentially emerging field for the welfare of humans and animals. Generally, the probiotic microbes such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> demonstrated positive health effects on humans and animals with respect to nutritional, growth, disease controlling and immunological aspects. Besides probiotic properties, LAB strains also have the ability to remove cyanotoxins from water, mycotoxins from food (Meriluoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>; Nybom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>) and to absorb aflatoxin B1 from the gastrointestinal tract of humans (Pierides et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>; El-Nezami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). But no attempt has been made so far to isolate the metal-removing actinobacterial probiont from the animal gut system through assessing the probiotic, metal-resistant and metal-removal characteristics. Thus, the present study was aimed to evaluate the heavy metal resistance and removal properties of actinobacterial probionts isolated from chicken and goat feces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Maintenance and culturing conditions of actinobacterial isolates</title><p>The actinobacterial isolates (<italic>n</italic>&#160;=&#160;20) used in this study were isolated from the fecal samples of chicken and goat collected from various locations in Pudukkottai and Tiruchirappalli Districts, Tamil Nadu, India (Latha and Dhanasekaran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>).

The percentages of Cr(VI) biosorption at various metal concentrations were 64.9&#160;% (50&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 82.3&#160;% (100&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 73.1&#160;% (150&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), 69.5&#160;% (200&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and 51.7&#160;% (250&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). The Cr(VI) biosorption ability was found to be maximum at 100&#160;mg L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> metal concentration. Besides, the biosorption ability of the isolate LD22 was significantly decreased with increase in metal concentration.</p><p>FT-IR analysis for Cr(VI)-treated and untreated biomass of LD22 was carried out to find the role of functional groups involved in absorption of chromium. The FT-IR spectrum of native culture biomass grown in minimal medium broth without Cr(VI) suggests the presence of a broad band at 3,385&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> which indicates the O&#8211;H or N&#8211;H stretching groups, most probably from glucose and proteins. The band at 2,925.4&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> can be assigned to C&#8211;H stretching. The absorption band at 1,584.5&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was due to the primary and secondary amides from the peptide bonds, which correspond to N&#8211;H bending. The absorption band in the region 1,300&#8211;1,050&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was due to the C&#8211;O bond, which is the characteristic peak for polysaccharides (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Absorption peaks were also observed in the region of 850&#8211;800&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> which showed the involvement of cell surface sulfonate group. In the FT-IR spectrum of Cr(VI)-treated biomass, the band at 1,602&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was slightly shifted from the native biomass absorption peak of 1,584.5&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Shift of the band at 1,104.5&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> from 1,117.3 and 1,078.8&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> from 1,084&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were also observed.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>Fourier transform infrared spectra of LD22 cells grown in <italic>a</italic> absence and <italic>b</italic> presence of Cr(VI)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2014_237_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Identification of the heavy metal-resistant probiont LD22</title><p>Microscopic observation revealed that the isolate LD22 was Gram positive and contained spore chains in the form of spirals. Thus, it was classified morphologically into section Spirales (S); mature spore chains generally contained 10&#8211;50 or more spores per chain. Conidial spores were spherical to ovoid in shape and had hairy surface (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Cultural characteristics study demonstrated that the isolate grew well on several media including ISP 1-7 and Bennett agar. In particular, aerial and vegetative hyphae were abundant in glycerol-asparagine agar (ISP5) and tyrosine agar (ISP7). The color of the aerial mycelium varied from gray, grayish white, white to yellow and the substrate mycelium ranged from gray, yellowish white, deep green to yellow. The size of the colony ranged from 5 to 10&#160;mm and the consistency of the isolate was almost same in all the media, i.e., powdery in nature. The isolate produced light brown color-soluble pigment only in Bennett agar among the eight tested culture media. Moreover, melanin production was also absent, which was revealed by the absence of greenish-brown or black pigment on ISP media 6 and 7 (Supplement Table&#160;2).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#160;3</label><caption><p>Micromorphology of isolate LD22 under light (<bold>a</bold>), phase contrast (<bold>b</bold>) and scanning electron (<bold>c</bold>) microscope</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13205_2014_237_Fig3_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>The nutritional characteristic study of the actinobacterial probiont LD22 showed that the isolate utilized all the sugars. In particular, good growth was observed in cellulose followed by xylose and galactose. The sugars sucrose, maltose and L-arabinose were less utilized by the isolate. Besides, growth of the isolate was significantly influenced by the amino acids arginine followed by tyrosine, valine, cysteine and glycine. However, the amino acids leucine and phenyl alanine less supported the growth of the isolate LD22. Excellent and moderate growth was observed in the pH range of 8&#8211;10 and 7, respectively, whereas poor growth was attained in the acidic pH range 5 and 6. In addition, the isolate tolerated up to 8&#160;% of NaCl concentration and no growth was noticed at 10&#160;% (Fig. S1).</p><p>The biochemical characteristics of LD22 displayed that the isolate was positive for catalase, oxidase, citrate and negative for indole, methyl red and voges&#8211;proskauer test. In the triple sugar iron agar slants, the formation of pink color in the butt and slant was observed which implies that the isolate did not metabolize all the three sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose. The absence of lifting up of medium and black precipitate specifies the negative result of gas and H<sub>2</sub>S production (Supplement Table&#160;3). The isolate was positive for casein, urea, starch, lipid and gelatin hydrolysis.</p><p>PCR amplification of the genomic DNA with universal primers resulted in 1,078&#160;bp amplicon. The 16S rRNA gene sequence thus obtained was subjected to BLAST similarity search with the NCBI database.

In recent decades, conventional physical and chemical methods have been replaced by biosorption techniques due to their high expense, ineffectiveness and non-environment friendly nature. A vast array of biological materials, especially bacteria, yeasts and actinobacteria, was employed for heavy metal removal and recovery due to their good performance, low cost, large available quantities, non-harmful and non-pathogenic nature (Wang and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2009</xref>). Besides, resident gut microflora that is symbiotic and helps the host in different ways also play a significant role in detoxification and elimination of harmful metals from humans and animals (Upreti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2004</xref>). Thus, here also an attempt has been made to search for novel actinobacterial probionts with metal-resistant and metal-removal characteristics.</p><p>In the present study, all the tested probiotic actinobacterial isolates showed resistance toward K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, PbNO<sub>3</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub> and sensitivity to HgCl<sub>2</sub> at 20&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> concentration in minimal agar medium. In addition, they exhibited multitolerance to heavy metals with the MTC values of <bold>&lt;</bold>50&#8211;250&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The results clearly revealed that the fecal actinobacterial isolates (gut actinobacteria) used in the present study had excellent heavy metal resistance properties, which might be due to adaptations developed during continuous exposure of heavy metals through metal-contaminated water and feed. Similarly, actinobacterial strains isolated from various sources also proved their ability to tolerate a variety of heavy metals at different concentrations (Abbas and Edwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1989</xref>; Amoroso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>), which suggested that they acquired resistant properties probably due to frequent heavy metal exposure in the investigated regions, because adapted microbial populations are prone to show higher resistance to heavy metals as compared to populations of non-contaminated sites (Koushalshahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>). Bhakta et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>) reported the isolation of probiotic lactic acid bacterial cultures (LAB) from the environmental samples using MRS agar supplemented with 50&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> concentration of Cd and Pb. Among the 255 cadmium (109) and lead (146)-resistant colonies, 26 LAB exhibited remarkable probiotic and metal-removal characteristics (Bhakta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). In the present study, minimal agar medium (MMA) was used for primary qualitative and semiquantitative metal resistance assays, because the supplemented metal does not form complexes with medium components and all the metals added were bioavailable (Amoroso et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>).</p><p>Chromium is one of the highly toxic pollutants of the environment (e.g., water and subsurface soils), present in trivalent Cr(III) and hexavalent forms Cr(VI). Cr(VI) poses a greater risk due to its carcinogenic properties to living organisms, while Cr(III) is generally toxic to plants at very high concentrations and is less toxic or non-toxic to animals. Cr(VI) induces acute and chronic toxicity, neurotoxicity, dermatotoxicity, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity and general environmental toxicity (Bagchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>). Moreover, in the current study almost all the tested isolates were highly tolerant to Cr(VI) at 250&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> concentration. Thus, the metal Cr(VI) was selected for the study of biosorption using the multimetal-tolerant isolate LD22.</p><p>The biosorption efficacy of the isolate LD22 for Cr(VI) was found to be maximum at 100&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> metal ion concentration (3&#160;g&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of biomass dosage and pH 7.0). The higher biosorption ability with increased metal ion concentration could be attributed to higher probability of interaction between metal ions and biosorbents. However, the biosorption percentage was considerably decreased with the increased concentration of Cr(VI) which might be due to the saturation of metals in biosorption. Thus, the results indicate that the initial metal concentration plays a significant role in metal biosorption. The results of this experiment were in agreement with the report of Saurav and Kannabiran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">b</xref>). Their study revealed that the optimum biosorption efficacy of Cr(VI) was obtained for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> VITSVK9 spp. at 100&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> metal ion concentration, pH 7.0 and biosorbent dosage of 3&#160;g&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Earlier studies have indicated that the initial metal ion concentration (Saurav and Kannabiran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011b</xref>) biosorbent dose (Yao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>; Acharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) and pH (Aksu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1991</xref>; Donmez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1999</xref>) were the important parameters affecting biosorption capacity as well as removal efficiency.</p><p>The determination of chromium uptake was further supported by FT-IR spectroscopy which analyzed the possible interactions between the functional groups of LD22 biomass with chromium. The FT-IR spectrum of native culture biomass revealed the chemical interactions between the hydroxyl (O&#8211;H), amine (N&#8211;H) and carboxyl (C&#8211;O) groups of the biomass and the metal ions. The FT-IR spectrum of Cr(VI)-treated biomass differed from the native biomass of LD22 in its absorption peaks, which might be due to the secretion of high molecular mass polymers that can either be released into the environment or remain attached to cell surfaces. Similar findings were reported for chromium-treated <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. B9 (Bhattacharya and Gupta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>), <italic>A. haemolyticus</italic> (Pei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>) and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. VITSVK9 (Saurav and Kannabiran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011b</xref>). The cell wall of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. VITSVK9 biomass likely contains several functional groups which can play an important role in the biosorption of metal ions. In general, microbial cell walls are known to be rich in polysaccharide and glycoproteins such as glucans, chitin, mannans and phospho-mannans. The metal-binding properties of Gram positive bacteria, such as actinomycetes (<italic>Streptomyces</italic>), are largely due to the existence of specific anionic polymers in the cell wall structures, which consist mainly of peptidoglycan, teichoic or teichuronic acids. It is particularly the cell wall structures of certain algae, fungi and bacteria, which have been found to be responsible for metal ion interaction (Volesky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1990</xref>).</p><p>The morphology of the isolate LD22 was similar to that described by Wallhausser et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1964</xref>) and Muharram et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>), which clearly indicates that the isolate under investigation belongs to the genus <italic>Streptomyces.</italic> In the present study, the isolate showed spiral spore morphology which agreed well with the descriptions of <italic>S. werraensis</italic> (Shirling and Gottlieb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1972</xref>; Wallhausser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1964</xref>). Inoue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1975</xref>) also reported the same organism with a different type of spore morphology manifested as Rectiflexibiles or Spirales. It did not show so much deviation from the description in the ISP. However, the cultural characteristic of our isolate was mostly similar to the report of Inoue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1975</xref>), particularly in powdery consistency, absence of soluble and melanin production, color of aerial and substrate mycelium. Although the isolate LD22 utilized all the tested carbon and nitrogen sources, growth was significantly high in cellulose and arginine which revealed that the isolate utilized them as sole carbon and nitrogen source for its growth. Excellent growth in high pH (8&#8211;10) demonstrated that the isolate was alkalophilic in nature. The growth in the presence of salt concentration displayed it was abundant in low (2&#160;%) NaCl concentration, but slowly reduced in high (10&#160;%) NaCl concentration. The isolate also showed various biochemical activities such as utilization of citrate, absence of carbohydrate fermentation and the ability to produce different enzymes such as amylase, urease, protease, lipase, gelatinase, catalase and cytochrome oxidase.</p><p>The phylogenetic relationship revealed that the isolate LD22 was strongly related with other <italic>S.</italic><italic>werraensis</italic>; thus the isolate LD22 was justifiably identified as <italic>S.</italic><italic>werraensis</italic> LD22. The 16S rRNA sequence of the same isolate was deposited in NCBI database with the accession number JX524481. Several researchers have reported the utility of 16S rRNA sequence comparison/evaluation as a tool to confirm the identity of actinomycetes (Dhanasekaran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Saha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the present investigation revealed that the probiotic actinobacterial isolates have the ability to resist hazardous heavy metals, such as K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, PbNO<sub>3</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, in humans and animals. Among the 20 probiotic actinobacterial cultures, the probiont LD22 demonstrated multiple heavy metal tolerance with the maximum Cr(VI) biosorption efficacy of 82.3&#160;% at 100&#160;mg&#160;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. On the basis of phenotypic, physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics, the potent probiotic Cr(VI) biosorbent LD22 was identified as <italic>S.</italic><italic>werraensis</italic> LD22 which could be used to protect livestock from the problems of heavy metal bioaccumulation and biomagnifications with other beneficial health effects.</p></sec><sec
