Mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic>, encoding a subunit of the AP-5 complex, have been reported to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), although their impact at the cellular level has not been assessed. Here we characterize three independent fibroblast lines derived from skin biopsies of patients harbouring nonsense mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic> and presenting with spastic paraplegia accompanied by neuropathy, parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment. In all three patient-derived lines, we show that there is complete loss of AP-5 &#950; protein and a reduction in the associated AP-5 &#181;5 protein. Using ultrastructural analysis, we show that these patient-derived lines consistently exhibit abundant multilamellar structures that are positive for markers of endolysosomes and are filled with aberrant storage material organized as exaggerated multilamellar whorls, striated belts and &#8216;fingerprint bodies&#8217;. This phenotype can be replicated in a HeLa cell culture model by siRNA knockdown of AP-5 &#950;. The cellular phenotype bears striking resemblance to features described in a number of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Collectively, these findings reveal an emerging picture of the role of AP-5 in endosomal and lysosomal homeostasis, illuminates a potential pathomechanism that is relevant to the role of AP-5 in neurons and expands the understanding of recessive HSPs. Moreover, the resulting accumulation of storage material in endolysosomes leads us to propose that AP-5 deficiency represents a new type of LSDs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>the Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>086598</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>Verum Foundation</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source>Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir</funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IAIHU-06</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source>ERC starting</funding-source><award-id>311149</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-5"><funding-source>the Intramural Research Program of the NINDS, National Institutes of Health</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-6"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NS083739</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-7"><funding-source>Healthcare Research of the Italian Ministry of Health</funding-source><award-id>NOVALS 2010</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-8"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptor proteins (AP 1&#8211;5) are ubiquitously expressed protein complexes that facilitate vesicle-mediated intracellular sorting and trafficking of selected transmembrane cargo proteins (<xref rid="DDV220C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). To date, mutations in components of all five AP complexes have been reported to impact human health [for which the term &#8216;adaptinopathies&#8217; has been proposed (<xref rid="DDV220C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)]. AP-5, similar to the other APs, comprises a core of four proteins, namely, &#950;, &#946;5, &#181;5 and &#963;5 subunits, which share structural similarity to corresponding subunits in other AP complexes. AP-5 is the most recently identified member of this protein family, and little is known about the cellular pathway(s) that AP-5 may play a role in, nor what the cargo specificity of AP-5 might be. However, some important clues are emerging from the integration of proteomics, cell biology and clinical genetics.</p><p>AP-5 has been shown to associate in a stable complex with two other proteins, spatacsin (SPG11) and spastizin [SPG15; FYVE-CENT; ZFYVE26 (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)], and to co-localize with markers of endosomes and lysosomes (<xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), suggesting a role of AP-5 along with spatacsin and spastizin in the endosomal pathway. Intriguingly, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SPG11</italic> (<xref rid="DDV220C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV220C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), <italic>ZFYVE26</italic> (SPG15) (<xref rid="DDV220C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and <italic>AP5Z1</italic> [SPG48 (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV220C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)] have all been described in patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). HSPs are a group of neurological disorders typified by the degeneration of the long corticospinal axons leading to progressive lower limb muscle weakness and spasticity and further classified into pure or complex forms on the basis of additional neurological signs (<xref rid="DDV220C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Mutations in SPG11 and SPG15 generally result in a complex form of HSP, which is distinguished by prominent thinning of the corpus callosum, but also includes other neurological complications such as retinal abnormalities, intellectual disability, mild ataxia and parkinsonism (<xref rid="DDV220C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). SPG48 patients have some clinical features similar to those of SPG11 or SPG15 patients, including spastic paraplegia, retinal abnormalities and parkinsonism, but the clinical spectrum of AP5Z1 patients is still being defined.</p><p>In this study, we investigate fibroblast lines from three patients harbouring distinct mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic>, which offers a unique framework to investigate where and how AP-5 may be functioning. We show that mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic> impair AP-5 complex formation and result in the accumulation of multilamellar structures containing aberrant storage material, revealing lysosomal dysfunction as the likely pathogenic mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effects of <italic>AP5Z1</italic> mutations on AP-5 protein abundance and localization</title><p>AP-5 (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F1">1</xref>A), similar to other AP complexes, is expressed in many tissues, including various regions of the brain and spinal cord, and at all stages of development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv220/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). This widespread expression pattern makes the use of fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies a relevant model system for the investigation of the cellular impact of mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic>. We analysed AP-5 protein levels in three SPG48 patient-derived fibroblast lines with mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic> : (i) c.1732C&gt;T (p.Q578*), (ii) c.[412C&gt;T];[1322G&gt;A] (p.[R138*];[W441*]) and (iii) c.[80_83del4; 79_84ins22] (p.R27Lfs*3) (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F1">1</xref>B), along with gender-matched and age-matched controls. The levels of AP-5 &#950; protein correlated well with the predicted nature of the mutations, and AP-5 &#950; protein was decreased to undetectable levels (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F1">1</xref>C). In addition, there was a concomitant reduction in levels of &#181;5 compared with controls, which is due to protein instability of AP subunits that occurs in the absence of complex assembly (<xref rid="DDV220C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV220C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These results suggest that in these patient lines there is a loss of functional AP-5 and supports the obligate nature of AP complexes.

The loss of AP-5 &#950; correlated with the consistent appearance of larger LAMP1-positive puncta. Using automated microscopy, we could quantify an increase in the area of LAMP1 fluorescence (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F2">2</xref>B and C), although this had no significant effect on total LAMP1 protein levels (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F2">2</xref>D).

Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, we observed large multilamellar structures surrounded by a single bilayer membrane (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F3">3</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv220/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). These multilamellar structures had morphological features of hybrid organelles (derived from the fusion of endosomes and lysosomes), but were filled with aberrant storage material typified by multiple exaggerated whorls, belts of striations, fingerprint bodies and some intraluminal vesicles. Quantification of all morphologically defined endocytic structures showed that although the average overall sizes of endocytic structures had not changed significantly (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F3">3</xref>B), there was a dramatic increase in the number of structures with features consistent with hybrid organelles (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F3">3</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv220/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). It was also noted that there was a striking clustering of these multilamellar structures (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F3">3</xref>D), and this likely accounts for the larger appearance of the LAMP1 immunolabelling in AP-5-deficient fibroblasts (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F2">2</xref>A) and the increase in the area of LAMP1 puncta quantified for the p.Q578* line on the automated microscope (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F2">2</xref>C). Generally, by EM, the control fibroblasts contained morphologically &#8216;normal&#8217; endosomes and lysosomes, and only occasionally contained some storage material that appeared as a belt of striations or as a single whorl, but much less exaggerated in appearance and far less common than in patient fibroblasts (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F3">3</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv220/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>).

In general, these effects were more striking than those in the patient fibroblasts (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV220F2">2</xref>C), which could be explained by the heterogeneity in the size and shape of patient fibroblasts that makes quantification of differences harder to measure and/or reflects the difference in acute versus chronic knockdown (i.e. patient cells may have had time to engage compensatory mechanisms).

Although two mutations have been reported previously (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the impact of these mutations on AP-5 and at the cellular level had not been determined. All the patients presented with spastic paraplegia that was accompanied by neuropathy, parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). At the cellular level, these lines show loss of AP-5 &#950; protein along with a reduction in levels of AP-5 &#181;5, consistent with these proteins existing as an obligate complex (<xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis of patient-derived lines and HeLa cells depleted of AP-5 &#950; demonstrate that the loss of AP-5 results in an accumulation of enlarged multilamellar structures that are filled with aberrant storage material. Age does not appear to be a significant contributor to this phenotype as these features were not observed in age-matched controls, nor is there a strong correlation with severity and age.</p><p>AP-5 &#950; and spastizin have been shown to associate in a stable complex, along with core members of AP-5 (&#946;5, &#181;5&#160;and &#963;5) and spatacsin (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In agreement with this observation, the subclinical loss of function of both spatacsin and spastizin was associated with abnormal motoneuron development in zebrafish (<xref rid="DDV220C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This provided a molecular explanation for the close similarity in the clinical presentation of SPG11 or SPG15 (<xref rid="DDV220C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and their overlap with SPG48 patient features (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). What can the cell biology characterization tell us about the relationship between AP-5 and spatacsin/spastizin? Here we show that abrogation of spatacsin and spastizin results in the decrease of AP-5, similar to results in SPG11 or SPG15 patient-derived fibroblasts (<xref rid="DDV220C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and HeLa knockdown studies (<xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that AP-5 is dependent on spatacsin and spastizin for either its assembly or its recruitment to membranes, but the converse is not true as spatacsin and spastizin are still recruited to membrane in the absence of AP-5 (see also <xref rid="DDV220C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The fact that spatacsin and spastizin may be able to function in the absence of AP-5 may help explain alternative functions attributed to SPG15, such as in dense core granule formation (<xref rid="DDV220C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), or its role in autophagosome fusion (<xref rid="DDV220C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>What is the nature of the aberrant multilamellar structures found in patients with mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic>? We find that they label for LAMP1 at the limiting membrane, and CD63 and LBPA are largely restricted to intraluminal membrane whorls; they are acidic and hydrolytically active, are not positive for the autophagy marker LC3 and are surrounded by a single bilayer membrane. In the context of current models, these features are consistent with endolysosomes, and we would suggest that the storage material results from the partial degradation of intraluminal vesicles that are CD63- and LBPA-positive (<xref rid="DDV220C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Notably, similar ultrastructural features have been described for several LSDs including metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, Niemann&#8211;Pick disease, GM2 gangliosidoses, I-cell disease [where EM features have been reported as lamellar lipids and &#8216;zebra bodies&#8217; (<xref rid="DDV220C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)], mucolipidosis (&#8216;concentric multilaminar membrane structures&#8217; (<xref rid="DDV220C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)] and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [&#8216;fingerprint bodies&#8217; (<xref rid="DDV220C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)].</p><p>Does AP-5 deficiency define a new type of LSD? Although LSDs were first classified on the basis of lysosomal enzyme deficiency that leads to inability to metabolize lipids, glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans, there are now many LSDs that include deficiencies in lysosomal transmembrane proteins, soluble non-enzymatic lysosomal proteins and proteins important for trafficking to or from lysosomes (<xref rid="DDV220C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV220C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The broader definition of LSDs therefore encompasses defects in the lysosomal structure and function (<xref rid="DDV220C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) that, for less well-defined reasons, result in the accumulation of undegradable material in the endosomal/lysosomal system. Two classes of LSDs have been proposed: primary LSDs that arise from defects in specific lysosomal enzymes and secondary LSDs that result from impaired membrane traffic (<xref rid="DDV220C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, although at this point it is not clear what causes the accumulation of storage material in AP-5-deficient fibroblasts, it seems likely to be a secondary LSD, and the exaggerated membrane whorls could point to a deficit in the ability to metabolize lipids (<xref rid="DDV220C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Interestingly, the clinical features of neuropathic LSDs are similar to those described in SPG48 patients (<xref rid="DDV220C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDV220C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), as well as SPG11 and SPG15, including cognitive impairment, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, parkinsonism and spasticity (<xref rid="DDV220C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Clinically, it can be challenging to distinguish classical LSDs and some forms of complex HSP, as evidenced by reports of patients originally suspected to have HSP but subsequently diagnosed with LSD [e.g. Krabbe's disease (<xref rid="DDV220C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and ceroid lipofuscinosis (<xref rid="DDV220C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)].</p><p>For many LSDs, it has been reported that the progressive accumulation of storage material leads to the build-up of enlarged (&gt;1 &#181;m) lysosomes that are dysfunctional (<xref rid="DDV220C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The parallels between loss of AP-5 and LSDs allow us to hypothesize a simple model for the pathogenesis of AP-5 deficiency related to lysosomal dysfunction. Here, we find that AP-5 is expressed in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as in non-neuronal tissues. Neurons are known to be particularly sensitive to aberrant lysosomal storage or dysfunction. The questions of what the increase in endolysosome frequency means, why aberrant storage material accumulates, how this impacts neuron survival and what this means for the role of AP-5 are complex. The increase in endolysosome frequency may arise by a number of scenarios that are not mutually exclusive. These include increased endosome and lysosome fusion events, increased biosynthetic delivery [for example, by LAMP carriers (<xref rid="DDV220C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)], decreased degradation of content or decreased lysosomal recovery. In addition, the accumulation of endolysosomes will likely impact upon upstream and downstream endosomal and lysosomal functions, as well as other organelle functions (<xref rid="DDV220C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Indeed, we have seen that in HeLa cells depleted of AP-5 &#950;, CIMPR accumulates in early endosomes, which may underlie a more general perturbation of membrane trafficking, and could be due to the displacement of fusion machinery (e.g. SNAREs).</p><p>In the context of current models, our data are consistent with the loss of AP-5 disturbing the equilibrium between endosomes, endolysosomes and lysosomes. We favour a model whereby AP-5 could act in the recovery of lysosomes from endolysosomes because of its association with spatacsin and spastizin and the mechanistic similarities with lysosome reformation from autolysosomes (<xref rid="DDV220C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This is in keeping with the role of other LSD proteins including TRPML1 [mucolipidosis type IV (<xref rid="DDV220C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>)] and NPC2 [Niemann&#8211;Pick type C (<xref rid="DDV220C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)] that are involved in the regulation of lysosome formation. Given the role of AP complexes in protein sorting, it seems plausible that the main role of AP-5 may be in the selection of cargos to/from these organelles, the loss of which impacts upon endosome/lysosome homeostasis. One of the challenges for the future will be to identify possible AP-5 cargo proteins (as well as accessory proteins) through the use of technologies such as CRISPR knockout and acute ablation techniques. This may help define not only the role of AP-5 in normal cell physiology but may clarify how loss of function of AP-5 may lead lysosomal dysfunction and to disease. This in turn may be relevant to other HSPs (particularly SPG11 and SPG15) and LSDs and expand our understanding of recessive HSPs. Furthermore, it will be interesting to determine whether there are mutations in the other subunits of AP-5 and to determine the full spectrum of clinical features. Although the number of HSP patients with mutations in <italic>AP5Z1</italic> is still low, their description reaffirms the important roles of all five AP complexes, which is encompassed by the broad definition of &#8216;adaptinopathy&#8217; that was coined to define this class of disorders of intracellular trafficking (<xref rid="DDV220C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients and patient-derived fibroblasts</title><p>Patient p.Q578* is a man in his early 70s (age of symptom onset about 60) with neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, ataxia, retinopathy and parkinsonism.

The cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or &#8722;20&#176;C methanol for 5 min and then blocked with PBS/0.5% BSA. Cells were labelled as indicated and imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope using a Zeiss Plan Achromat 63&#215; oil immersion objective (NA 1.4), a Hamamatsu OCRA-ER2 camera and Improvision Openlab software.</p><p>To quantify knockdown phenotypes, we used an automated ArrayScan VTI microscope (Cellomics/Thermo-Fisher) and the SpotDetector V4 assay algorithm. Cells were plated onto 96-well Perkin Elmer microplates, fixed then stained with antibodies against CD63 or LAMP1, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-donkey anti-mouse IgG, blue whole-cell stain (Invitrogen) and far red beads to assist in sample focusing (Flow-Check fluorospheres; Beckman Coulter). The cells were imaged with a modified Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope, a Zeiss 40&#215;/0.5 Achroplan objective and a Hamamatsu OCRA-ER camera. More than 1000 cells were quantified for each condition using ARRAYSCAN software.</p><p>LysoTracker<sup>&#174;</sup> Red DND-99 (Life Technologies) is a red-fluorescent dye that is membrane-permeable and specifically accumulates in acidified compartments. Cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes and incubated with 50 n<sc>m</sc> Lysotracker Red and imaged immediately live. Magic Red Cathepsin B substrate (AbD Serotec) is a membrane-permeable probe which becomes fluorescent upon cleavage by cathepsin B. Cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes and incubated in CO<sub>2</sub>-independent media for 45 min at 37&#176;C using Magic Red substrate, according to manufacturer's instructions, and then visualized live.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Conventional EM</title><p>Cells were grown on plastic dishes (fibroblasts were left to recover in culture for 7 days following trypsinization) and fixed using double-strength fixative [4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 <sc>m</sc> cacodylate buffer pH 7.2], added to an equal volume of culture media. After 2 min, double-strength fix was replaced by single-strength fix and cells were fixed for 1 h. Cells were then scraped and pelleted. Cells were then secondarily fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and incubated with 1% tannic acid to enhance contrast. Cells were dehydrated using increasing percentages of ethanol before being embedded in EPON in beam capsules. EPON was cured overnight at 65&#176;C.</p><p>Ultrathin (50&#8211;70 nm) conventional sections were cut using a diamond knife mounted to a Reichart Ultracut S ultramicrotome. Sections were collected onto copper grids. Grids were stained using lead citrate. Sections were viewed on an FEI Tecnai transmission electron microscope (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 80 kV.</p><p>The number and size of different endocytic structures per unit area of cytoplasm were quantified. For each cell line and respective age-matched control, complete cell montages from 10 cells were acquired. Total cytoplasmic volumes were calculated using ImageJ and the number of organelles scored on the basis of morphology; where endosomes were defined as having an electron lucent lumen, may contain intraluminal vesicles, but no membrane whorls, and endolysosomes as containing membrane whorls, may contain intraluminal vesicles and a lucent or dark lumen and lysosomes having an electron dark lumen and no membrane whorls or intraluminal vesicles. Organelle sizes were measured using ImageJ. Means and standard errors are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Cryo-immunoelectron microscopy</title><p>For immunogold labelling, fibroblasts were fixed by adding an equal volume of freshly prepared 4% PFA/0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 2 min, the solution was removed and cells were post-fixed in 2% PFA/0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature.
