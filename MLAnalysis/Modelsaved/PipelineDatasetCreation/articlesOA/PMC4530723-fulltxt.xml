Sepsis was recently reported to be responsible for 1 in 20 deaths in England [<xref rid="CIV378C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The frequency of hospitalizations with severe sepsis has increased relentlessly, more than doubling each year between 2000 and 2007, with sepsis complicated by organ failure accounting for one in 40 hospitalizations in 2007 [<xref rid="CIV378C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has long been apparent that host genetic factors can significantly influence mortality from infectious disease [<xref rid="CIV378C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but despite extensive research very few robust associations between genetic polymorphisms and sepsis phenotypes have been reported to date [<xref rid="CIV378C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Possible explanations for these inconsistent findings include inadequate sample sizes (and hence a lack of study power), unidentified population substructure, failure to correct for multiple testing, variations in phenotype definition, heterogeneous patient populations and unrecognized host-pathogen interactions. Nevertheless, we recently published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which we identified a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <italic>FER</italic> gene that protects against death from sepsis caused by severe pneumonia [<xref rid="CIV378C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p><italic>MBL2</italic> is one of the most extensively studied but still controversial candidate genes reported to be associated with sepsis and infectious disease phenotypes [<xref rid="CIV378C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More than 30 studies have reported the presence or absence of associations between polymorphisms in the <italic>MBL2</italic> gene, circulating MBL levels, and susceptibility and outcomes in sepsis phenotypes, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 848 patients [<xref rid="CIV378C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIV378C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>MBL2</italic> gene encodes mannose-binding lectin, which binds carbohydrates on the surface of a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, yeasts, fungi, and protozoa and subsequently triggers host innate immune responses through activation of the complement system, in addition to promoting opsono-phagocytosis by a complement-independent pathway [<xref rid="CIV378C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The function of MBL is known to be influenced by common SNPs found both in the promoter region and in exon 1 of this gene, which affect the level of gene expression and the structure of the MBL protein respectively [<xref rid="CIV378C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIV378C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Three functional SNPs (denoted B-rs1800450, C-rs1800451, and D-rs5030737) in exon 1 of <italic>MBL2</italic> affect the stability, ligand binding capacity, complement activating ability and half-life of the encoded protein [<xref rid="CIV378C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIV378C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because their effect on serum MBL levels is very similar, wild-type alleles for these SNPs are denoted A, whereas the B, C, and D variants are pooled and given the designation O (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ378/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). If an individual is heterozygous (A/O) for any one of these 3 variants, MBL levels are 10%&#8211;20% that of wild-type individuals, whereas in variant homozygotes or compound heterozygotes (O/O), serum MBL concentrations are virtually undetectable [<xref rid="CIV378C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>MBL2</italic> promoter polymorphisms have also been associated with MBL levels independent of these exonic SNPs. Allele X of the SNP denoted X/Y at position -221 (rs7096206) has the strongest down-regulating effect [<xref rid="CIV378C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is therefore the most important SNP to analyze, but some studies have also analyzed another promoter SNP, rs11003125 [<xref rid="CIV378C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to confirm or refute an association between common <italic>MBL2</italic> genetic variants and sepsis susceptibility or outcome. We performed an association study in 1839 patients with sepsis due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or peritonitis recruited from intensive care units (ICUs) across Europe as part of the GenOSept and GAinS collaborations and used 477 UK controls recruited within the GRACE consortium. To our knowledge, this is the largest study investigating the influence of <italic>MBL2</italic> polymorphisms on sepsis susceptibility and survival.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Samples</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Sepsis Patients (GenOSept and GAinS Consortia)</title><p>Patients admitted to critical care units with sepsis caused by CAP or peritonitis were recruited to the ESICM/ECCRN GenOSept (Genetics of Sepsis and Septic Shock in Europe) study between June 2006 and October 2009 from 143 centers in 16 European countries. Recruitment as part of the GAinS study (part of which was included in the GenOSept sample set) began in September 2005 and continued in UK centers, using the same protocol, after the GenOSept study was closed; UK samples from patients recruited to GAinS until October 2010 were also included in this study. Ethics approval was granted either nationally, for individual centers or both. In all cases written, informed consent was obtained from the patient or a legal representative. Diagnosis of sepsis was based on the International Consensus Criteria published in 2003 [<xref rid="CIV378C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (&#8805;18 years) admitted to an ICU or High Dependency Unit with CAP or peritonitis. The diagnosis of CAP was based on a febrile illness associated with cough, sputum production, breathlessness, leukocytosis, and radiological features of pneumonia acquired within the community or within less than 2 days of hospital admission [<xref rid="CIV378C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Exclusion criteria at recruitment were: pregnancy, an advanced directive to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment, admission for palliative care only, and immune-compromise. These collections are also described in more detail elsewhere [<xref rid="CIV378C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Microbiological investigations were performed according to local policies and practices. Investigators recorded microbiological findings for patients diagnosed with CAP, including the organism(s) isolated, the source of the organism and the use of serological methods. The local investigators recorded whether or not initial antibiotic therapy (within the first 24 hours) was considered to be appropriate. Death or survival was recorded at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, and 6 months from ICU admission. The date of death was also recorded.</p><p>DNA was extracted by GenOSept partners in London and Munich with a salting out method, in Paris with MagNA Pure Compact DNA Isolation Kits, and in Oxford with Qiagen Midi kits.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>UK Controls (GRACE Network)</title><p>Controls were recruited as part of the GRACE network study (<uri xlink:href="www.grace-lrti.org">www.grace-lrti.org</uri>) [<xref rid="CIV378C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and were previously used in the analysis of susceptibility to lower-respiratory tract infections (results submitted for publication). They were individuals attending general practice surgeries for reasons other than infection. All controls included in this analysis were of self-reported Caucasian ancestry from the United Kingdom.

Promoter polymorphism -221 genotypes for the sepsis samples were mainly generated with the Affymetrix 5.0 genotyping chip (N = 1477), as part of the genome-wide association study reported elsewhere [<xref rid="CIV378C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The rest of the sepsis samples (N = 369) were genotyped by HRMA as above. All the healthy controls (N = 477) were genotyped by HRMA. The genotypes of 19 samples were confirmed using direct sequencing.

Our large sample collection enabled us to also examine <italic>MBL2</italic> genotype associations with survival in a number of predefined homogeneous subgroups, including younger age groups, UK patients only, patients with CAP, those with pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with peritonitis. Our findings strongly suggest that there are no significant, clinically meaningful associations between MBL genotypes and either 28-day or 6-month survival from sepsis, or susceptibility to CAP or pneumococcal pneumonia in immune competent adults. The lowest <italic>P</italic>-value we observe across all tests for all subgroups is .017 (for the promoter polymorphism heterozygous test in the peritonitis 28-day survival subgroup). This cannot be considered a significant result after even a nonconservative correction for multiple testing. Moreover it is unlikely that population stratification would have confounded our results as we were able to remove population outliers from the analyses based on multidimensional-scaling using genome-wide genotypes.</p><p>The effect of <italic>MBL2</italic> functional genetic variants has been studied extensively in a number of sepsis related phenotypes. Garcia-Laorden et al [<xref rid="CIV378C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found, in one of the largest studies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="CIV378TB2">2</xref>), that <italic>MBL2</italic> genotypes do not associate with susceptibility to CAP in adults, which is consistent with our findings. They also concluded, as we did, that there was no association between 28-day mortality and <italic>MBL2</italic> deficient genotypes. They did, however, find an association with 90-day survival. Our 6-month survival analysis, however, does not support such an association with longer term survival, even though we have &gt;99% power to detect an association with the OR that they observed (OR = 2.34). Some members of our group [<xref rid="CIV378C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have previously reported a study with a phenotype similar to ours but recruited fewer samples (174 cases and 353 controls). These investigators found an association between A/O and O/O exonic polymorphisms and susceptibility to sepsis and also showed an even more significant association between the distribution of combined genotypes and susceptibility to sepsis. We did not replicate these findings in this larger sample set.</p><p>Eisen et al [<xref rid="CIV378C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] performed a meta-analysis of 6 studies of MBL polymorphisms in patients with severe bacterial infection. They found an association between low circulating levels of MBL and mortality and an increased risk of death from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection (OR = 5.62). We did not find an association between <italic>MBL2</italic> deficient genotypes and death from sepsis due to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection, despite having &gt;99% power to find an association of this strength. However, Eisen et al also showed that <italic>MBL2</italic> genotype is not a reliable predictor of MBL levels, with the proportion of MBL deficient individuals being underestimated when defined by genotype. It is therefore possible that we did not capture all MBL deficient individuals, and that low MBL levels, rather than genotype, might be associated with worse outcomes in our cohort. Nevertheless, our findings strongly suggest that a clinically relevant relationship between <italic>MBL2</italic> genotype and sepsis mortality in immune competent adults is highly unlikely.</p><p>A more recent meta-analysis [<xref rid="CIV378C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found no evidence of an association between exonic or promoter <italic>MBL2</italic> variants and susceptibility to sepsis in adults. On the other hand, an association was found between exonic polymorphisms and susceptibility to sepsis in paediatric cases. Variant forms of MBL are very common in certain populations among healthy individuals [<xref rid="CIV378C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and it is known that alternative immune mechanisms can replace the function of MBL [<xref rid="CIV378C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] thereby rendering deficient individuals immune competent. This redundancy could explain the lack of a significant association between <italic>MBL2</italic> functional polymorphisms and sepsis susceptibility and outcome in the present study of immune competent adults. MBL plays a particularly important role in host defense in individuals with a compromised or immature adaptive immune system [<xref rid="CIV378C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our findings do not exclude the possibility that <italic>MBL2</italic> functional polymorphisms significantly influence sepsis susceptibility and outcome in these patient groups.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study is that the causal organism was not identified in all cases. Without this information, we have been unable to perform a complete analysis of bacterial and viral subgroups. However, even with this information, subgroups defined by pathogens other than <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> are likely to be too small to have sufficient power to detect an association.</p><p>We identified 2 individuals with variant alleles X, B, and D, which were confirmed by sequencing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ378/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Previous reports have suggested that due to linkage disequilibrium between the exon and promoter SNP, only the Y allele in the promoter is present with exonic polymorphisms [<xref rid="CIV378C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIV378C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our study shows that other combinations are also possible, although they are very rare.</p><p>Although the influence of MBL levels and genotypes on sepsis susceptibility and outcome have been extensively investigated, most studies have been underpowered and therefore it is not surprising that findings have been inconsistent. Moreover, it is well recognized that performing meta-analyses using published data are often limited by publication bias and hence an overestimation of the importance of the SNP or SNPs of interest. In this study, we found no significant associations between <italic>MBL2</italic> genotypes and susceptibility to, or survival from sepsis in a sample set that has adequate statistical power to show associations with effect sizes previously reported in independent studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ378/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
