Human bocavirus was detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and real-time PCR. Of the 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples, 104 (5.7%) were positive for hBoV; a similar prevalence was observed in all three periods studied. Among hBoV-infected children, 53.8% were between 1&#8211;2 years old, and hBoV was detected alone in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. All of the detected hBoV strains belonged to genotype 1. The median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples containing strains with both the N546H and T590S mutations compared to other samples (p&lt;0.05). Children with a single hBoV-1 infection more frequently had upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than those who were co-infected (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization was longer among children with high viral loads than that observed among children with low viral loads (8.0 &#177;2.2 days vs 5.0 &#177;1.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and the use of aerosol therapy was more frequent among children with high viral loads than among those with low viral loads (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). This study shows that hBoV is a relatively uncommon but stable infectious agent in children and that hBoV1 seems to be the only strain detected in Italy in respiratory samples. From a clinical point of view, hBoV1 seems to have in the majority of healthy children relatively low clinical relevance. Moreover, the viral load influences only the duration of hospitalization and the use of aerosol therapy without any association with the site of the respiratory disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Health (Bando Giovani Ricercatori 2009).

This virus has been detected mainly in younger children, in nasopharyngeal secretions, in sera and blood samples of patients with upper (URTI) and lower (LRTI) respiratory tract infections and in faecal specimens of subjects with gastroenteritis [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, hBoVs are classified into species 1 through 4; hBoV1 is predominantly found in the respiratory tract, and hBoV2, hBoV3, and hBoV4 are found mainly in stool [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite there are studies suggesting that hBoV is able to infect the lower airways causing severe infections in both children and adults, the role of hBoV as a causative agent of respiratory disease is frequently questioned due to its common detection with other potential pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the evidence that in some studies co-infections can have a significantly greater clinical and socioeconomic impact on infected children and their households than hBoV infection alone [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the importance of the viral load in determining the type and severity of respiratory disease as well as the pathogenicity of the different hBoV species [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are not precisely defined. The main aim of this study was to contribute to resolving these problems. The circulation of hBoV during several winter seasons in Italy was investigated, and a phylogenetic analysis of detected strains was performed. In addition, correlations between different hBoV strains and the severity of disease in cases with infections due to hBoV alone or due to co-infections were studied. Finally, the role of the viral load was analysed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>To evaluate the circulation of the different hBoV types and the possible relationships between viral load, virus genetic characteristics, and the severity of infection, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from otherwise healthy children attending the emergency room of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca&#8217; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Italy, due to a respiratory tract infection arising between November 1 and March 31 during 3 winters (2009&#8211;2010, 2011&#8211;2012, and 2013&#8211;2014).

Each run included one synthetic template control and one no-template control for each target. Specimen extracts were also tested by real-time PCR for the human RNase-P gene to monitor specimen quality and the presence of PCR inhibitors. A positive test for both the NS1 and NP-1 targets or for a single target confirmed from a second extraction from a new sample aliquot was considered definitive evidence of hBoV infection.</p><p>The viral load was obtained using real-time PCR with the NS1 primers and probe previously described and a DNA plasmid used as the standard calibrator.

The dN/dS ratios were calculated using the SLAC and FEL codon-based maximum likelihood approaches. The SLAC approach counts the number of non-synonymous changes per non-synonymous site (dN) and tests whether it is significantly different from the number of synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS). The FEL approach estimates the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes for each site in an alignment. The IFEL method is similar to the FEL, but tests site-by-site selection along only the internal branches of the phylogeny. In order to avoid an excessive false-positive rate, sites with SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME p-values of &lt;0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability of &gt;0.90 were accepted as candidates for selection.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics of the responses were generated.

Overall, these two strains had 13 and 14 amino acid changes compared to the hBoV st1 strain, and almost all these changes were included in the region described below.

Overall, the site-specific analyses identified three sites (411, 536, and 546) as under positive selection by at least two methods used (SLAC, FEL, FUBAR, and MEME). The IFEL model was used to determine the selection pressure acting on the VP1/VP2 codons along the internal branches of the tree. Two positively selected codons (411 and 546) were identified. The selected sites, highlighted with arrows in <xref rid="pone.0135640.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, were presumably located in the external loop of the VP1 or VP2 protein. In detail, the Ala (A) to Ser (S) mutation was observed at codon 411 and occurred in 7 hBoV strains circulating in January 2012, the Ala (A) to Thr (T) mutation was observed in one strain circulating in December 2013, and the Ala (A) to Lys (K) mutation was observed in two strains circulating in January 2014. The Val (V) to Asp (D) mutation at codon 536 was observed in 8 hBoV strains circulating in the 2009&#8211;11 and 2013 seasons which were associated with N534K and Q535P mutations. Finally, the Asn (N) to His (H) mutation at codon 546 occurred in 13 hBoV strains circulating in the 2009&#8211;2012 seasons. Of these strains, 6/13 (46.1%) were also characterized by the N534K, Q535P, and Q535D mutations.

In <xref rid="pone.0135640.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> (right side), the viral load of each Italian hBoV strain is reported near the aligned mutations. In the group of strains (n = 70; 66.6%) harbouring at least 2 mutations in addition to A149T, the values of the hBoV load greater than 1x10<sup>8</sup> DNA copies/ml are reported in grey. A total of 16 strains had a very high viral load, and 13/16 (81.3%) harboured the T590S mutation. This percentage is nearly significantly different than the overall frequency (42/70; 53.8%) of T590S in the group of strains described below (p = 0.08). Seven of the 13 strains with the T590S mutation had an additional mutation in one of the sites under positive selection (reported in <xref rid="pone.0135640.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> with an asterisk). In detail, 4/13 (30.8%) had the N546H change, 2/13 (15.4%) had the A411D change, and 1/13 (7.7%) had the A411T change. Based on the observed data, we hypothesize that the double mutation of N546H with T590S may positively affect viral replication and specific immune response. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0135640.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples of strains with the N546H and T590S changes than that in samples of wild type T590 strains, strains with only the T590S mutation, and strains with only the N546H mutation (p-values of 0.0078, 0.016 and 0.018, respectively). Finally, the two divergent strains (MI-267-Jan2014 and MI272-Jan2014) with unusual amino acid changes were observed with viral loads lower than 10<sup>6</sup> DNA copies/mL.

[<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This was expected because this genotype is the most common among hBoVs associated with respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Most of the patients in whom hBoV1 was identified were younger than 3 years of age, further highlighting that younger children are the individuals most frequently infected by this viral agent [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Serological studies have shown evidence that the number of subjects positive for anti-hBoV1 antibodies continuously increases with increasing age group from the ages of 6 months to 6 years, and by the age of 2 years approximately 80% of children have been infected with hBoV1 [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More than 50% of the children infected by hBoV1 in this study were co-infected with at least one other respiratory virus. Moreover, co-infected patients had LRTI more frequently than those infected by hBoV alone. These findings are not surprising because simultaneous detection of hBoV1 and other viruses in children with respiratory disease and greater severity in co-infected cases have been already reported in studies in which it was also demonstrated that hBoV1 can frequently be identified in the respiratory secretions of asymptomatic subjects [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that hBoV1 can be shed for several days or months after a previous infection [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which could explain the simultaneous identification of hBoV1 and other respiratory viruses, the frequency of asymptomatic infections and the generally greater severity of infections in co-infected individuals compared to those with hBoV1 alone. In most of the co-infected cases, detection of hBoV in the respiratory secretions with the new sensitive molecular methods able to identify very low viral loads might be a consequence of a previous clinically resolved disease, and a virus other than hBoV was therefore the real cause of the disease. However, reports of severe clinical manifestations in patients infected with only hBoV have been published [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], highlighting that the assessment of the real importance of hBoV infection in a single patient remains very difficult. Studies on children with severe pneumonia, acute wheezing, asthma and/or bronchiolitis suggested that hBoV1 is able to infect the lower airways down to the bronchioles [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, hBoV1 has been found as the only infectious agent in adult lung transplant recipients with severe LRTI, whereas it was not detected in respiratory secretions of asymptomatic transplanted subjects [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This would indicate that hBoV1 is not always a bystander or the cause of mild respiratory problems but rather a real, although relatively rare, causative agent of severe disease in both children and adults, particularly when they are immunocompromised. On the other hand, hBoV can cause serious neurological infections [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and contribute to chronic disease in adult patients mainly because it can persist after childhood infection and reactivate [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Evaluation of the viral load has been considered a possible method to define when this virus is the real cause of a respiratory disease and when it is only a secondary infection. Unfortunately, this approach has had no success because although some studies have shown evidence for a strict correlation between high viral load and severe LRTI in children with a single hBoV infection [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], others, including the present study, did not show a clear relationship between these two variables [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>However, the evolution of virulence appears to involve a variety of mechanisms in different viral systems, including mutations in regulatory regions and viral adaptation for utilization of alternative or expanded repertoires of cellular receptors. An alternative hypothesis to evaluate the importance of hBoV1 concerns the correlation between viral load levels and the presence of specific mutations. However, mutations associated with increased or reduced replication are rarely reported for hBoV. Recently, Hao et al. have reported that few nucleotide changes were correlated with a lower viral load [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the present study, a double mutant (N546H and T590S) was observed in samples with a significantly higher viral load. However, further phenotypic validation studies are required to draw major conclusions regarding the impact of these mutations on viral replication. Furthermore, as reported by Qu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it seems that nucleotide changes in the VP1U region could affect the replication efficiency of hBoV. Likewise, in our strains all the amino acids of the catalytic site were conserved, and no mutations that affect sPLA<sub>2</sub> activity were identified.</p><p>In agreement with others [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the phylogenetic analysis of this study confirmed the very low degree of variability in the hBoV genomic region encoding proteins that are exposed to the virus surface and are therefore under immunologic pressure. Only 9% (62 codons) of amino acids were found to have at least one change in the VP1/VP2 gene, a finding not substantially different from that reported by Hao et al. in a different geographic area [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, several amino acid changes were observed in strains circulating in almost all the respiratory seasons. This finding provides evidence that the selection of those variants best adapted to each particular environment might select for variants with an evolutionary advantage. Seven of these mutations were located in a genomic region (i.e., VP1U) previously reported to be involved in the mechanisms of virus replication. For instance, the VP1U amino acid variations R17K and L40S have been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], whereas the remaining variations have not yet been described. Interestingly, two hBoV strains identified in respiratory samples collected in January 2014 had unusual amino acid sequences in a somewhat conserved genomic region. The reason for this genetic diversity is still undefined. However, as described for hBoV, other parvoviruses [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and enteroviruses, a series of &#945;-helices and &#946;-barrels in the VP2 protein were intercalated by an external loop, in which the majority of the genetic variability accumulated. Nevertheless, these two divergent strains were found in samples with low viral loads, and we might hypothesize a loss of replication advantage for these strains.</p><p>In the present study, the dN/dS ratios for all pairwise comparisons were &lt;1, which is in line with previous results showing that positive selection was extremely limited in parvoviruses [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In fact, selective pressure analyses have identified 3 codons under positive selection. In a previous paper, a different codon (L40) was identified as being under positive selection [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Nevertheless, the great majority of codons were under negative or neutral selection, which has also been confirmed by others [<xref rid="pone.0135640.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This finding suggests that only a few amino acids of the VP1/VP2 proteins present on the surface of the virion are potentially subjected to a strong selective pressure by the host immune response.</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirms that hBoV is less common than other respiratory viruses but that the frequency of its detection in children with respiratory disease is in time stable. It was detected with a prevalence of about 5% in several consecutive seasons and no unusual clustering was observed among identified strains, with strains circulating in 2009 being closely related to those circulating in 2014. Moreover, only a minority of virus sites were found to be under positive selective pressure, and all the strains detected in respiratory tract infections of this Italian study belonged to genotype 1. From a clinical point of view, this study highlights that in otherwise healthy children, hBoV1 seems to have relatively low clinical relevance, because patients infected with hBoV alone mainly suffered from an URTI. The viral load was not associated with clinical characteristics of the infection, and viral mutations, despite affecting viral replication, did not affect the conditions or severity of the clinical presentation. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical relevance of hBoV in children, particularly in those at risk for severe chronic underlying disease, and to evaluate the role of viral modification in conditioning the degree of viral virulence and the specific immune response.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135640.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
