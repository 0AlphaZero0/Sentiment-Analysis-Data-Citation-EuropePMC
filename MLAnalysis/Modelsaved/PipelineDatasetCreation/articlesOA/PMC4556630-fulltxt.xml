Plants develop various biochemical and physiological mechanisms to respond and adapt to drought and salt stresses. One of these mechanism is the expression of some stress-inducible genes (e.g. enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of various osmoprotectants) to counteract the detrimental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) are a well-characterized detoxification enzyme family involved in stress tolerance, which catalyze the conjugation of reduced tripeptide glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic substrates. GSTs were first discovered because these enzymes can metabolize various toxic exogenous compounds (xenobiotics) by GSH conjugation [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Plant GSTs are commonly known for their role in herbicide detoxification. Besides, plant GSTs are also considered as glutathione peroxidases that directly detoxify electrophiles. Furthermore, GSTs function as non-enzymatic carriers (ligandins) in intracellular transport and catalyze anthocyanin-GSH conjugates, thereby allowing transport into vacuoles via a glutathione pump [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, several plant GSTs exhibit peroxidase activity and may play roles in enhancing tolerance to chilling, osmotic dehydration, and herbicide-induced damage [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Plants GSTs are classified into eight classes: phi, tau, theta, zeta, lambda, glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs), tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase (TCHQD) and membrane associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG). Among these eight classes, phi and tau are the largest plant-specific and often highly stress-inducible GSTs [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The role of GSTs in stress has been demonstrated in several transgenic studies, and over-expression of GSTs in tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and rice [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] increased transgenic plant capability to endure harsh treatments such as high and low temperatures and salt concentration. Kumar et al. showed that over-expressing of <italic>OsGSTL2</italic> enhanced the tolerance to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses like cold, osmotic and salt in GST transgenic plants [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

GST can be induced by diverse environmental stimuli. For instance, increased GST levels are used to maintain cell redox homeostasis and protect organisms against oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although many GST genes have been cloned and analyzed, the role of a GST gene from tomato has been rarely investigated. In this study, <italic>LeGSTU2</italic>, a GST gene from tomato, was cloned and introduced to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to evaluation gene function during abiotic stress. Our results revealed that transgenic plant lines over-expressing the <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> gene improved drought and salinity tolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Expression pattern analysis results revealed that <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> was highly expressed in roots and flowers; the transcript expression levels of <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> were induced by salt, osmotic and heat stress. A similar pattern was previously observed in <italic>AtGSTU19</italic>, (also named <italic>AtGST8</italic>, [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), <italic>OsGSTU3</italic> and <italic>OsGSTU4</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The accumulation of <italic>AtGSTU19</italic> was induced by drought-associated oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and its role in drought/oxidative tolerance was demonstrated in our recent findings. <italic>OsGSTU3</italic> and <italic>OsGSTU4</italic> are polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced tau class GSTs, which were identified in rice roots. Salt stress, phytohormones, antioxidants and hydrogen peroxide (a strong oxidant) can rapidly induce <italic>OsGSTU3</italic> and <italic>OsGSTU4</italic> expression in rice roots. However, the roles of these two genes in stress tolerance have not been reported.</p><p>
<italic>LeGSTU2</italic> in stress tolerance was functionally analyzed using the transgenic lines of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Under normal conditions, transgenic plants showed no superiority in terms of germination and root growth to WT. However, when treated with NaCl or mannitol, transgenic plants showed higher germination rate and longer root growth than the WT, which suggests that <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> may play a role in the tolerance phenotype. Previous studies have shown that transgenic <italic>parB</italic> (<italic>GST</italic>) lines showed higher levels of root growth and relative biomass than Ler-0 when exposed to 100mM Na stress, which indicates that such phenotypes are derived from the expression of <italic>parB</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A recent study on the characterization of <italic>ThGSTZ1</italic> from <italic>Tamarix hispida</italic> showed similar results to those described above [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, transgenic plants displayed the tolerance to salt/drought stress and conserved water to a higher extent than WT plants (Figs <xref rid="pone.0136960.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0136960.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>); these results suggest that <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> may play a positive role in the tolerance to salt/drought stress.</p><p>ROS homeostasis is important in protecting the normal metabolism. Plants can regulate ROS levels through ROS scavenging enzymes, such as SOD, POD and GST [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, over-expression of some GST genes has been shown to improve oxidative stress tolerance levels in transgenic plants [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, over-expression of <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> showed increased activities of SOD and POD under stress conditions. It has been reported that over-expression of a specific antioxidant gene could influence the expression of other antioxidant genes; indeed transgenic GST expressing seedlings were shown to have a higher APX activity and MDHAR activity compared to nontransformed seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Tobacco plants expressing the GST gene showed an increase in GR avtivity [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results suggested that LeGSTU2 may act as a stress regulator through increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes to strengthen the ROS scavenging ability or maintain ROS homeostasis.</p><p>Proline, as a compatible solute, functions in defense to maintain turgor pressure against osmotic challenge caused by water deprivation or extreme salinity. Proline also protects plant cells against oxidative damage by quenching <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and directly scavenging HO<sup>.</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Proline accumulation is also positively correlated with drought/salinity tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our experiments showed that transgenic plants accumulated more proline contents under salt and drought stress than WT (<xref rid="pone.0136960.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), thus, stress tolerance of transgenic plants was enhanced. Water deficit and salinity often cause rapid and excessive accumulation of ROS in plant cells, subsequently resulting in lipid peroxidation and accumulation of MDA [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, MDA accumulation occurred in transgenic plants under salt stress to a less extent than in WT plants, this result suggested that lipid peroxidation was decreased in <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> transgenic plants. Relatively stable chlorophyll content was also observed in transgenic plants, this result indicated that these plants can maintain photosynthesis better than WT under stress conditions. Photosynthesis, photorespiration and light signaling in defense responses are correlated with ROS regulation [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Far-red insensitive 219 (FIN219)-interacting protein 1 (FIP1), a tau class GST gene from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, can interact with FIN219 to regulate cell elongation and flowering in response to light [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic>AtGSTU17</italic>, anther tau class GST gene, is also regulated by multiple photoreceptors, particularly phytochrome A under all light conditions, <italic>AtGSTU17</italic> also participates in various aspects of seedling development [<xref rid="pone.0136960.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In conclusion, <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> possibly plays a positive role in the tolerance to salt/drought stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Further analyses, particularlly on the role of phytohormones, are awaited to elucidate the function and the regulatory mechanism of <italic>LeGSTU2</italic> in plant stress responses.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0136960.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
