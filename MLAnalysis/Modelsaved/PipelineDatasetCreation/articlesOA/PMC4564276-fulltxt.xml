The fungus <italic>Microcyclus ulei</italic> infects this tree, causing South American leaf blight (SALB) disease. This disease causes developmental delays and significant crop losses, thereby decreasing the production of latex. Currently several groups are working on obtaining clones of rubber tree with durable resistance to SALB through the use of extensive molecular biology techniques. In this study, we used a secondary clone that was resistant to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> isolate GCL012. This clone, FX 3864 was obtained by crossing between clones PB 86 and B 38 (<italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> x <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>). RNA-Seq high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the differential expression of the FX 3864 clone transcriptome at 0 and 48 h post infection (hpi) with the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> isolate GCL012. A total of 158,134,220 reads were assembled using the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly strategy to generate 90,775 contigs with an N50 of 1672. Using a reference-based assembly, 76,278 contigs were generated with an N50 of 1324. We identified 86 differentially expressed genes associated with the defense response of FX 3864 to GCL012. Seven putative genes members of the AP2/ERF ethylene (ET)-dependent superfamily were found to be down-regulated. An increase in salicylic acid (SA) was associated with the up-regulation of three genes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodeling, as well as in the down-regulation of the putative gene <italic>CPR5</italic>. The defense response of FX 3864 against the GCL012 isolate was associated with the antagonistic SA, ET and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. These responses are characteristic of plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by Administratice Department of Science, Technology and Innovation&#8212;Colciencias, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.colciencias.gov.co">www.colciencias.gov.co</ext-link>, grant number: 110152128525, DMC received the funding.

Countries such as Brazil and Guatemala are the main producers, yielding 178,500 tons/year and 93,600 tons/year, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Colombia has also increased its planting area by 86.4%. In 2002, Colombia had 6,000 ha of available planting area and now counts 44,100 ha, of which 4,000 ha are currently being used for production [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This increase is due in large part to the support of the state, which seeks to replace illegal crops and position the country as the third largest producer of raw materials in Latin America [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the continent accounts for only 3% of the global natural rubber production compared with Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which together produce 92% of the natural rubber in the world [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This difference is mainly due to South American leaf rubber blight (SALB) caused by the ascomycete fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic>, which only infects some species of the genus <italic>Hevea</italic>. This disease is endemic in countries that cultivate rubber in Latin America and has restricted cultivation to areas known as &#8220;climate escape areas&#8221;. These areas are characterized by long periods of drought and low relative humidity during the refoliation period of the tree, which limits the development of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Following the devastation caused by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> in natural rubber plantations established in the state of Para, Brazil, in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the presence of some disease-resistant <italic>Hevea</italic> species were observed. These clones were used to start new plantations, as well as breeding programs in which some of the resistant progenies (F, FA, FB and FX) were crossed with highly productive clones of Asian origin (PB 86 and Tjir 1) [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some of these resistant clones, such as the IAN and FX series, were planted commercially. Unfortunately, the resistance of these clones was broken by one of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> isolates [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The FX 3864 clone from the FX Series in the Vale do Ribeira area of Sao Paulo, Brazil, still shows good productivity and tolerance to SALB, unlike clones such as RRIM 600, PB 235, PB 86 and GT1. FX 3864 is the most widely grown clone in Colombia due to its productivity and tolerance to SALB. However, there are reports of increased susceptibility to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> in the field [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in some areas of the Colombian Orinoco region.</p><p>Our knowledge of the genes involved in the interaction of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> is very limited. Studies of differential gene expression during this interaction were reported by Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], who studied the transcriptome of the MDF 180 clone, which is partially resistant to SALB, both in the field and in controlled conditions. Compared with the clone PB 314, which is considered highly susceptible to all <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> isolates, the resistance of the MDF 180 clone does not allow the formation of stroma and therefore impedes the completion of the fungal life cycle. The study was conducted by constructing subtractive libraries (SSH) at three different time points (6&#8211;72 hpi, 4&#8211;28 dpi, and 34&#8211;58 dpi) associated with the asexual and sexual development of the fungus after inoculation. Differentially expressed genes varied at different times. The identified Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) had an average size of 346 bp. The differentially expressed genes involved in the defense response of MDF 180 to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> included pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, R genes, proteins involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenol metabolism.</p><p>Studying the global transcriptome is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with plant responses to pathogen attack, especially in non-model organisms [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is now possible to sequence the entire transcriptome of an organism under a given condition using next-generation RNA sequencing technologies. This technology has increased the speed of gene, metabolic pathway and polymorphism discovery at a relatively low cost compared with earlier technologies such as SAGE, cDNA-AFLP, SSH and microarrays [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

A total of 48,024 transcripts (93%) matched the assembled transcriptome. Short cDNA sequences have a low quality due to their length, which varies between 500 and 800 nucleotides.

This entails an accelerated pace of transcript discovery compared with previous technologies. Many transcriptional events are moment-specific or condition-specific. Thus, not all the genes are present in a specific transcriptome. Furthermore, sequences with assembly errors may appear. Therefore, some of the sequences of the transcriptome obtained in this study are not present in the TSA of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The alignment of the transcripts assembled using the genome of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> with the GenBank accession number AJJZ00000000 showed that 89.44% of the 90,755 transcripts were found in the genome.

From a total of 90,755 transcripts aligned, 9,591 sequences equivalent to 10.56%, did not generate any hits. This result can be due to gene isoforms or to the fact that the genome is separated into scaffolds. Only 1.1 of the 2.15 Gb of reads were assembled, and 78% correspond to repetitive regions that can create assembly errors [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>One of the advantages of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly is that no reference genome is necessary to obtain results from the original transcription. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that within these type of assemblies, the reads are not influenced by splicing, unlike reference-based assemblies, which may require prediction models [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The quality of the assembly also depends on the correct selection of the <italic>K-mer</italic>.

The <italic>K-mer</italic> selection for assembly was tested for different sizes ranging from K-19 to K-33. The K-25 default parameter of the Trinity software was finally selected, as it showed the best assembly statistics. The disadvantages of these types of assemblies are that they are very sensitive to sequencing errors and the presence of chimeric molecules in the data set. There is no effective way of distinguishing chimeric reads, from artifacts generated by the preparation of the library, from true reads [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of repetitive sequences can hinder assembly. However, these regions are more common in introns than exons, and their presence can result in paired-end reads. These reads facilitate the reconstruction of original fragments encompassing the repeated fragments due to the way in which the adapters are placed.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Reference based assembly of the transcriptome (mapping)</title><p>The software TopHat [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to align 158,134,220 paired-end reads to the 18,026 scaffolds of the genome of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>.

The gene expression data were normalized with FPKM between different RNA-Seq samples and used to compare the expression levels at 0 and 48 hpi. After the transcript abundance was quantified and normalized with the RSEM software, the EdgeR software was used to take into account the biological variability between replicates.

The remaining genes were down-regulated.</p><p>Eleven transcripts corresponded to hypothetical proteins. Among the up-regulated genes, three were associated with the synthesis and remodeling of the plant cell wall, two glycosyl hydrolases from families 3 and 9 (Hb36621 and Hb44430) and a polygalacturonase (Hb42274). Glycosyl hydrolases family 3 (GH3) enzymes are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, where they perform different activities such as exo-&#946;-D-glucosidase, &#945;-L-arabinofuranosidase, &#946;-D-xylopyranosidase and N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase (<xref rid="pone.0134837.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase activity is associated with chitin degradation and has been widely described in bacterial GH3 enzymes but had not yet been described in plants [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Proteins involved in plant cell wall metabolism, such as glycosyl hydrolases from family 9, are associated with susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens. Tomatoes with mutations in the genes endo-1,4-&#946;-glucanase cel1 and cel2 showed resistance to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> but were highly susceptible to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv., which is considered a biotrophic pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, the production of polygalacturonases has been described as a strategy to trigger plant defense responses through homogalacturonan fragments (HG) derived from the degradation of the cell wall. These fragments have also been found to induce the accumulation of SA [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Histidine kinase (Hb31968) up-regulation is associated with signal transduction triggered by the detection of the pathogen. This kinase has a CHASE (Cyclases/Histidine kinases Associated Sensory Extracellular) transmembrane domain and a receptor with a kinase domain according to predictions made with HMMER [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and it is considered to be an independent ethylene receptor. These types of proteins have been found to be up-regulated during biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The transcript Hb320124, which is similar to a sensor domain of the histidine kinase signal transduction pathway, was also up-regulated. These two proteins are associated with the widely described bacterial two-component signaling systems, which are also found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Transcript Hb5539, with homology to CPR-5, was identified among the underexpressed transcripts. This transmembrane protein is constitutive, related to pathogenicity and associated with the down-regulation of different transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis cpr5</italic> mutants have demonstrated increased SA production, which confers resistance to the <italic>Peronospora parasitica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The down-regulation of this protein could be linked to the increase of SA as a defense mechanism in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic>.</p><p>Six transcripts were found to be associated with the JA/ET pathway. These transcripts contained apetala2/AP2 domains (Hb12462, Hb23559, Hb5424, Hb17330, Hb20167 and Hb34468), and the transcript Hb43251 contains additional RAV1 domain. All of these transcripts are classified within subgroup B, which is involved in plant defense responses. Group B is also sensitive to the concentration of different hormones such as ET, JA and SA. This suggests that the transcriptional regulation of the JA/ET pathway is mediated by the production of high levels of SA, which are characteristic of plant responses to attack by biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogens (<xref rid="pone.0134837.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The AP2 domain superfamily is also called ERF (<italic>Ethylene Response Factor</italic>) due to the ET dependence of the response of these transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>The expression analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic <italic>35s</italic>:<italic>ERF1</italic>, in which ERF1 is constitutively expressed, showed that genes associated with cell wall reinforcement, such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, were up-regulated [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This protein and ERF were down-regulated in the present study. However, the response regulators RR were found to be down-regulated in <italic>35s</italic>:<italic>ERF1</italic>. In this present study, histidine kinases with regulatory domains associated with two-component signaling were up-regulated. This observation corroborates the behavior observed with the other genes for which there are antagonistic behaviors between the JA/ET and SA pathways.</p><p>According to the expression profiles obtained at 48 hpi, this work suggests that the resistance of FX 3864 to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> is mediated by the induction of SA-dependent defense genes. This result is inferred based on the suppression of the JA/ET pathways due to an increase in SA. In the ESTs recovered from the subtractive libraries of a study by Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], five proteins associated with pathogenicity (PR1a, NtPRp27-like protein, Bet v I allergen, Beta1,3-glucanase and hevamine), four protease inhibitors and one pectinesterase inhibitor were found in clone MDF 180 compared with the susceptible clone PB 314. These proteins were associated with the inhibition of mycelium growth and were not present in the libraries of clone PB 314. A transcriptional study using cDNA-AFLP in clones FX 3864, FX 2261 and RRIM 600 inoculated with the GCL009 isolate showed 49 differentially expressed genes that were associated with R genes, transcription factors, protein degradation, sphingolipids and cell wall synthesis, together with a transcript may be associated with the virulence of the fungus [<xref rid="pone.0134837.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The findings of these studies differ from ours most likely due to the <italic>Hevea</italic> clones, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> isolate and the techniques used. These reasons could explain the differences in the differentially expressed genes found in our study. However, all these studies help in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The similarity in both the statistical metrics of the assembly and the results of the functional annotation of transcripts obtained from the <italic>de novo</italic> and reference-based assembly strategies allows the implementation of either strategy to generate global transcriptomes from short reads. The use of the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> reference genome for assembly provided longer transcripts than those obtained by the <italic>de novo</italic> approach. This approach generates more complete gene sequences that facilitate further studies of the identified genes.</p><p>The ontological terms found in the differential expression analyses were mainly associated with signal transduction, responses to hormonal stimuli and responses to biotic stress. The results suggest that the modulation of the plant transcriptional responses was related to the stress caused by the interaction with the fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> within the first 48 hpi.

Additionally, the up-regulation of genes associated with cell wall metabolism, such as Hb42704 with homology to a polygalacturonase, and the down-regulation of Hb5539, which is a homologue of CPR-5, suggests an increase in SA within the first 48 hpi of interaction between the resistant clone FX 3864 and the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>ulei</italic> GCL012 isolate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134837.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Electrophoretic profiles for varietal identification of clones FX3864 and RRIM-600.</title><p>Example profiles were obtained from some individuals of each clone.
