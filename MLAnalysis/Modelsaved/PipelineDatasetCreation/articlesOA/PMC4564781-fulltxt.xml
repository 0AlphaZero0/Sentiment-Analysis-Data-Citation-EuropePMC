Of the 155 patients who completed the survey, 21 had undergone further joint replacement surgery during the follow-up and were excluded, leaving 134 patients for analysis.

Persistent pain is defined as pain that develops after surgery and that has been present for over 3 months (International Association for the Study of Pain 1986) and its prevalence is underestimated (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Visser 2006</xref>). According to <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Beswick et al. (2012)</xref>, at least 5&#8211;21% of hip replacement recipients and 8&#8211;27% of knee replacement recipients suffer from persistent pain postoperatively.</p><p>Persistent pain is generally thought to be of neuropathic origin and caused by perioperative nerve damage (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kehlet et al. 2006</xref>). However, neuropathic pain appears to be rare in joint replacement patients (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Wylde et al. 2011</xref>). Instead, these patients often describe their pain in a way that indicates the presence of an inflammatory factor (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Wylde et al. 2011</xref>). The degree of the inflammatory state is associated with the severity of preoperative pain in patients with osteoarthritis (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">St&#252;rmer et al. 2004</xref>). In addition, the intensity and duration of preoperative pain correlates with persistent postoperative pain in knee replacement surgery (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Lundblad et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Puolakka et al. 2010</xref>). Other established risk factors for persistent pain include genetic factors, history of preoperative pain, depression, existence of other chronic pain sites, and psychosocial factors (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kehlet et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Nikolajsen et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Rolfson et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Low-grade systemic inflammation is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS; a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alberti et al. 2009</xref>)), and obesity.

Obesity is associated with slower recovery, especially in knee patients (Workgroup of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons Evidence Based Committee 2013). It has been hypothesized that the systemic proinfammatory state in MetS negatively affects patients&#8217; function and recovery after joint replacement (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al. 2010</xref>).

Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed diabetes is a risk factor for persistent pain whereas severe obesity is a risk factor for a painful joint 1&#8211;2 years after the operation. Other disorders of glucose metabolism and MetS were not associated with the prevalence of a painful joint or persistent pain. The prevalence of neuropathic pain was very low in our material. This supports the former findings that although neuropathic pain is common in other types of surgeries (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kehlet et al. 2006</xref>), the reason for persistent pain in joint replacement patients is something else&#8212;perhaps a low-grade inflammatory process with sensitization in the mechanisms of pain perception (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">St&#252;rmer et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Wylde et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our main finding is that previously diagnosed diabetes is predictive of persistent pain in joint replacement patients with osteoarthritis. The difference appeared to be more pronounced in the hip replacement group, in which postoperative pain was otherwise less common than in the knee replacement group; but we acknowledge that this conclusion is based on relatively few patients. To our knowledge, there have been no earlier studies on the association between diabetes and persistent pain after joint replacement. Earlier, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al. (2010)</xref> reported that diabetes was not an independent predictor of poor functional outcome or improvement in pain, measured at 1 year using WOMAC, although a trend could also be seen in that study. <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al. (2012)</xref> observed that recovery in terms of pain and function after total knee replacement was slower after 3 months to 3 years in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes. In both of these studies, the diagnoses of diabetes were based only on patients&#8217; self-reported information or medical charts, whereas in our study patients without previously diagnosed diabetes had an oral glucose tolerance test in order to identify underlying disorders of glucose metabolism. Studies both in the general population and in joint replacement recipients have indicated that diabetes is underdiagnosed and that the real number of patients with diabetes is twice as much as originally believed (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Meding et al. 2007</xref>). Because of the careful diagnosis of diabetes in our study, we believe that the results reflect the actual situation more precisely and our findings that newly diagnosed diabetes, IFG, and IGT are not associated with a painful joint or persistent pain are reliable. Furthermore, unlike the earlier studies, we used the international classification of persistent pain as primary outcome.</p><p>Patients with diabetes are in a chronic systemic proinflammatory state (van <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Greevenbroek et al. 2013</xref>). It has been shown that in patients with osteoarthritis, the degree of the patient&#8217;s inflammatory state is associated with the severity of preoperative pain (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">St&#252;rmer et al. 2004</xref>). There is also a correlation between the severity of preoperative pain and the severity of postoperative pain (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kehlet et al. 2006</xref>), which is a risk factor for persistent pain (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Puolakka et al. 2010</xref>). Contradicting our expectations based on these earlier results, patients with diabetes had least pain, as measured using visual analog scale (VAS), preoperatively but still increased risk for persistent pain after surgery.</p><p>Other factors that could explain persistent pain in patients with diabetes are glucose control and diabetes-related complications, such as neuropathy. In the present study, we categorized diabetes into only 2 subgroups depending on whether it was diagnosed during the study or previously. This categorization did not allow us to examine the influence of poor long-term blood glucose equilibrium, or how long the previously diagnosed diabetic patient had suffered from diabetes. It is generally thought that blood HbA1c represents the long-term equilibrium of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. However, a single HbA1c measurement represents a patient&#8217;s blood glucose equilibrium from the previous 3 months only. Recent studies have shown that complications related to high blood glucose, such as neuropathy, need more time to develop and are rather related to long-term mean HbA1c or HbA1c variability (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick 2012</xref>). No statistically significant associations between HbA1c and the pain outcomes were found in the present study either.</p><p>Interestingly, none of the patients had persistent pain after a follow-up time of 21 months. It may be that in joint replacement patients, the improvement in pain continues even after 1 year or more. Alternatively, it may be that patients with diabetes in particular require more time to reach full recovery. As there were only 2 patients with previously diagnosed diabetes in the group with the longest follow-up (which was also the smallest group), our study does not allow us to draw any conclusions on this issue. The definition of persistent pain (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">International Association for the Study of Pain 1986</xref>) does not preclude the possibility that patients may recover from persistent postoperative pain. The prognosis of persistent pain is unknown, but it appears that the prevalence of pain decreases as time goes by. <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brander et al. (2003)</xref> found that the prevalence of substantial pain decreased from 23% after 3 months to 19% after 6 months, and 13% after 12 months following total knee replacement.</p><p>A higher proportion of severely obese patients had a painful joint than in the group of normal or overweight patients, whereas obesity was not associated with persistent pain. There is conflicting literature concerning the influence of obesity on the outcomes of joint replacement. According to some studies, obesity does not affect the outcomes while in others a negative effect could be seen (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Workgroup of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons Evidence Based Committee 2013</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Lewallen (2010)</xref> reported that severe and morbid obesity are significant predictors of moderate-to-severe pain after total hip replacement at 2-year follow-up and 5-year follow-up. Investigations of satisfaction with joint replacement have not shown any statistically significant differences between obese and non-obese patients, yet morbid obesity (BMI &gt; 40) appears to be a threshold for worse outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Workgroup of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons Evidence Based Committee 2013</xref>). However, in our study BMI was statistically significantly associated with a painful joint even as a continuous variable.</p><p>Regarding the effect of MetS, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al. (2010)</xref> reported that patient function and pain following joint replacement were negatively affected by the increasing number of metabolic abnormalities related to MetS. We did not find any associations between MetS and the prevalence of a painful joint, or persistent pain. The small sample size in our study may have biased our results, since closer examination of the number of individual components of MetS was not reasonable. On the other hand, in the study by Gandhi et al., no clinical examination was made and the diagnosis of MetS was based only on patients&#8217; self-reported information about metabolic abnormalities. In earlier studies, poorly controlled MetS has been associated with perioperative surgical and medical complications after total joint replacement (Gonzales Della <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Valle et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Zmistowski et al. 2013</xref>). We excluded patients with later joint replacements, but we did not analyze the other complications; nor did <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al. (2010)</xref>, so we cannot preclude the possibility that complications could explain the conflicting results regarding pain.</p><p>The main strengths of the present study were its prospective nature and careful preoperative evaluation, with accurate detection of disturbances in glucose metabolism and other metabolic abnormalities. Persistent pain, our primary outcome measure, was defined in accordance with an international, generally accepted definition (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">International Association for the Study of Pain 1986</xref>). A more recent definition has also been published (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Macrae and Davies 1999</xref>), in which the borderline for persistent pain is defined to be at least 2 months&#8212;instead of the 3 months used in the older definition. We decided to use the more strict definition with a 3-month limit, because it is reasonable to assume that 2 months is not enough in joint replacement patients. It has also been recommended by the IMMPACT consensus meeting (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Dworkin et al. 2010</xref>) that a longer borderline should be used, at least in randomized trials. In previous studies, different definitions have been used for persistent pain (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Macrae 2008</xref>). Our institution is a high-volume center for joint replacement surgery, and the interventions and perioperative care were highly standardized and remained essentially unchanged during the study period. Most of the operations were performed by experienced joint replacement surgeons with high numbers of surgeries annually. Thus, variation in the treatment hardly biases our results. The response rate was rather good (82%). Patients who had revision surgery or another primary joint replacement in the study period were excluded, so the shortened recovery time of these patients would not bias our findings.</p><p>The study also had some weaknesses. Since its design was based on a research project on perioperative hyperglycemia, the number of patients was small from the point of view of analyzing the prevalence of and predictors of persistent pain. Exclusion of patients who had had later surgeries further reduced the number of patients available. Because of the small study population, we could not run a multifactorial analysis to examine whether diabetes was an independent risk factor for persistent pain. Furthermore, post-hoc power analysis indicated that our sample size was insufficient for appropriate joint-specific analysis. Such an analysis would have been important, because the etiology of persistent pain in joint replacement patients is not well known and it may be different after hip and knee replacement. The conclusions are based on a small absolute number of cases. In addition, we did not have information about the complications of diabetes, such as peripheral neuropathy, which might have been a relevant factor in explaining the results. Patients with diabetes may have more comorbidities such as depression and anxiety, and it cannot be ruled out that these comorbidities would explain the high prevalence of persistent pain in these patients. Acute postoperative pain is another factor that could have biased our results, since it is a risk factor for persistent pain, and we had no data on this. Because the study was started after the first surgeries in our series, there was some variation in follow-up times. However, even the patients with the shortest follow-up times should have had enough time to recover from surgery and early postoperative pain. Our materials do not represent a consecutive series of patients scheduled for surgery, but the patients were instead recruited in several (irregular) phases between 2009 and 2011.</p><p>Since pain in the operated joint was assessed with a postal questionnaire, we cannot be entirely sure that the patient&#8217;s answer concerned only the joint operated in this study. Selection bias is possible with patients who are planned for staged bilateral surgeries&#8212;and who were excluded from the present analysis&#8212;since they may have been older or have had more comorbidities than the patients included. Comorbidities of the patients may have also biased our results, since we were unable to take either individual comorbidities or the number of them into account. The ASA scores of the patients were, however, included in multifactorial linear regression models and they did not affect the results. Anxiety and depression are additional confounding factors (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Vissers et al. 2012</xref>), the effects of which could not be taken into account retrospectively.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that previously diagnosed diabetes is a risk factor for persistent pain, and that severe obesity is a risk factor for a painful joint 1&#8211;2 years after primary hip or knee replacement. Patients and surgeons should know that these risk factors may reduce the benefits of joint replacement. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between disorders of glucose metabolism and postoperative pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>EJ, TM, PN, and PP designed the study.
