Negative predictive value (NPV), overall accuracy of SLNB, and the impact of radiopharmaceutical injection timing relative to surgery were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>This multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00911326) enrolled 101 patients with T1&#8211;T4, N0, and M0 HNSCC.

All excised tissues were evaluated for tissue type and tumor presence. [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tilmanocept identified one or more SLNs in 81 of 83 patients (97.6&#160;%). Of 39 patients identified with any tumor-positive nodes (SLN or non-SLN), one patient had a single tumor-positive non-SLN in whom all SLNs were tumor-negative, yielding an FNR of 2.56&#160;%; NPV was 97.8&#160;% and overall accuracy was 98.8&#160;%.

Timing of injection (i.e. day of surgery vs. day before surgery) was at the surgeon&#8217;s discretion, except in patients with floor-of-mouth tumors. In such patients, day-before-surgery injection was required to allow for significantly reduced shine-through, whereby radioactivity at the primary site may obscure relevant SLNs. Following injection, all patients underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy imaging per institutional protocol, which involved planar imaging (&#177;dynamic) and/or fused single-photon emission computed tomography/CT (SPECT/CT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Surgery/Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/Elective Neck Dissection</title><p>Surgery was required either within 1&#8211;15&#160;h (same day) or 15&#8211;30&#160;h (next day) following injection. At surgery, excision of the primary tumor was performed prior to SLNB/END. Using a handheld gamma detector, the surgeon conducted an initial survey of the entire cervical lymph node basin at risk to identify the areas of increased radioactivity.

In this group, the NPV of SLNB was 96&#160;%, with an observed FNR of 9.8&#160;%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></p><p>Despite the difference between studies in the number of subjects in the ITT population (ACOSOG Z-0360 study: 140 subjects; NEO3-06 study: 83 subjects), there was a similar number of node pathology-positive subjects (ACOSOG Z-0360: 41 subjects; NEO3-06: 39 subjects), which serves as the basis for the comparison of these studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> In the current study, the FNR of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept (2.56&#160;%) was statistically significantly lower than the upper limit of the FNR of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]sulfur colloid noted in the ACOSOG Z-0360 study (observed FNR of 9.8&#160;%, 95&#160;% CI 2.7&#8211;23.1; <italic>p</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.0005). The accuracy of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept was also statistically significantly greater than the lower limit of the accuracy of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]sulfur colloid as used in the Z-0360 study (<italic>p</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.0151).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></p><p>Several contributing factors have been noted regarding the observed variable FNR for SLNB using radiolabeled colloid for HNSCC, including tumor location (floor-of-mouth tumors with higher FNR) and larger tumors (i.e. T2 vs. T1).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> Due to its particulate nature and non-standardized preparation, radiolabeled colloids (100&#8211;1,000&#160;nm particle diameter) are retained for prolonged periods within the injection site, which in turn contributes to the phenomenon of shine-through effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> This is particularly problematic for floor-of-mouth tumors which, in previous studies, have been associated with significantly lower rates of SLN identification (88&#160;%) and higher FNRs (20&#160;%) compared with other oral sites.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref> In comparison, the current trial included 20 patients with floor-of-mouth tumors, of whom [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept identified at least one SLN in all patients (100&#160;%). Twelve of these patients were identified with metastatic nodal disease and, in all 12, at least one SLN was identified with metastatic disease. As such, the observed NPV and overall accuracy of SLNB using [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept in this group of patients was 100&#160;%.</p><p>Criticism of the current study could focus on the inclusion of patients with larger tumors (higher expected nodal metastatic rate), as well as those with cutaneous HNSCC (lower expected nodal metastatic rate). Patients with larger tumors (T3, T4) comprised a relatively small group overall (13 patients, 15&#160;%), but these patients were included as all patients were planned to undergo standard-of-care END. Given the high rate of occult nodal disease observed in these patients (8 of 13 patients, 61.5&#160;%), one might reasonably forgo SLNB in favor of planned (i.e. therapeutic) END; however, in this study, the FNR for this subpopulation was 0&#160;%. While the use of SLNB alone in patients with larger tumors is certainly controversial, lymphatic mapping procedures in such patients undergoing planned END (i.e. &#8216;SLN-assisted END&#8217;) might identify additional neck regions at risk, including the contralateral neck, not routinely encompassed during END alone. As such, the concept of SLNB procedures in this population may warrant further investigation. Patients with cutaneous HNSCC were a relatively small cohort (five patients, 6&#160;%). None were found to have nodal disease following SLNB and END. The lack of observed nodal metastases in these patients limits the assessment of predictive utility of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept for SLNB (i.e. FNR, NPV) as related to cutaneous HNSCC, and also indicates the need for further study.</p><p>Of note, the specificity of tilmanocept for lymphatic tissues assessed via in vivo imaging and in vitro analysis of its receptor binding properties suggest that tilmanocept does not move downstream to distal lymph nodes, permitting high confidence that a hot node found during next-day procedures is in fact an SLN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> The present study supports that the SLN detection rate and FNR for nodal metastases were not significantly affected by the day of surgery relative to timing of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept injection. This attribute portends that the use of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept provides substantial leeway and scheduling flexibility with regard to time of injection and subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB procedures (i.e. next-day surgery) without compromising the reliability of results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current trial supports the use of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept in the setting of SLNB for HNSCC with a high rate of SLN identification. When used in conjunction with serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry, SLNB with [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept accurately predicts the nodal pathology status of the neck in patients with oral HNSCC with low FNR, high NPV, and high overall accuracy. Given these results, the use of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]tilmanocept in this setting may help surgeons avoid the need to perform more extensive procedures, including END.
