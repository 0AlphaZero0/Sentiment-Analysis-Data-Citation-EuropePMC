However, the RAG proteins bind widely to open chromatin suggesting that additional mechanisms must restrict RAG-mediated DNA cleavage. Here, we demonstrate developmental downregulation of interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor signaling in small pre-B cells induced expression of the bromodomain family member BRWD1, which was recruited to a specific epigenetic landscape at <italic>Igk</italic> dictated by pre-BCR-dependent Erk activation. BRWD1 enhanced RAG recruitment<italic>,</italic> increased gene accessibility and positioned nucleosomes 5&#8242; to each J<sub>&#954;</sub> recombination signal sequence. BRWD1 thus targets recombination to <italic>Igk</italic> and places recombination within the context of signaling cascades that control B cell development.

Subsequent targeting of BRWD1 is mediated by a very specific and relatively genome-wide restricted, epigenetic code that is dependent upon pre-BCR signaling.
