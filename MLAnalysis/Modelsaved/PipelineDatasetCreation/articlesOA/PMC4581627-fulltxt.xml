Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treatment of at-risk populations; however, evolution of resistant worms under repeated treatment is of great concern. Combining praziquantel with another drug could not only increase efficacy of praziquantel, but also eventually hamper development of drug resistance. Our study reports the global praziquantel-induced transcriptional changes of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> adult worms <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the context of the mature female mating status (paired or unpaired). We identified sets of genes that were differentially affected in paired or unpaired mature females; we also identified genes that were similarly affected in males and females. Aiming to find possible new candidates to be tested as synergistic drugs, we used functional analysis of gene interaction networks to identify parasite genes whose expression was affected by praziquantel, and encode proteins whose human homologs are targets of different drugs already used to treat other diseases. This analysis suggested omeprazole, a widely prescribed drug, as a potential partner for praziquantel in a combination treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that this praziquantel-omeprazole combination resulted in increased worm lethality <italic>in vitro</italic> when compared with praziquantel or omeprazole alone.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo (FAPESP) to SVA.

The disease is endemic in 76 countries distributed throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, with more than 230 million infected people. <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is the most widespread causative species and the only one that constitutes a health problem in the Americas [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Until now, there is no effective vaccine available for schistosomiasis, and praziquantel (PZQ) is the only drug of choice for large-scale treatment of at-risk populations. PZQ is highly effective against all <italic>Schistosoma</italic> species that infect humans, having a high cure rate, low toxicity, and low cost [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, PZQ treatment does not prevent reinfection, and infected animal models have shown resistance to PZQ upon repeated treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The mechanisms of action of PZQ that result in the disruption of Ca<sup>++</sup> homeostasis in the parasite, with paralysis and tegumental disruption, as well as the mechanism involved with parasite resistance to PZQ, have been reviewed [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The susceptibility of schistosomes to PZQ is dependent on the stage of worm maturation, young parasites being sensitivity only after 3&#8211;4 weeks of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In mixed-sex infection, when male worms only are considered, they are more sensitive to PZQ than the whole (male + female) population [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus creating the possibility that paired mature females could be left unpaired after the death of their male partners [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, in single-sex infection the unpaired females cannot fully mature [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and are less sensitive to PZQ than the mature female from mixed-sex infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given that pairing regulates the female-specific gene expression [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there is a possibility that unpaired mature females could be more resistant to PZQ than paired mature females. The consequences of such possible differential susceptibility on the pattern of gene expression changes induced by PZQ have never been evaluated.</p><p>In this work, we analyzed the global PZQ-driven transcriptional changes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> mature female and male worms in the context of the female mating status (paired or unpaired). Using our custom-designed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> microarray [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we identified sets of genes that were affected in both paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that the transcriptional changes induced by PZQ in mature females are heavily influenced by the mating status. With functional analysis of gene interaction networks it was possible to identify a Na/K-ATPase gene differentially expressed in the presence of PZQ, whose human homolog gene product is a target of omeprazole (OMP), a drug used in humans for treating gastric ulcer, thus suggesting that OMP could be tested as a synergic drug against schistosomes. Indeed, we found that PZQ and OMP combinations were synergistic in <italic>a</italic>dult worms when tested <italic>in vitro</italic>, with OMP enhancing the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Parasite materials</title><p>

Alternatively, mature females were separated from males by incubation at room temperature for 20 min and subsequently identified as &#8220;unpaired mature females&#8221;. Unpaired mature females and paired males-females were placed in separate plastic dishes containing RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 1% Hepes (Gibco) pH 7.4, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 &#956;g/mL Penicillin/ Streptomycin and 0.5 &#956;g/mL Amphotericin B (Sigma).

In parallel, controls were incubated overnight under the same conditions, and in the following morning the vehicle (1% DMSO) was added and further incubation proceeded for 16 h. After the 16 hours, treated and control worms were washed in a RPMI 1640 medium without a pH indicator; after a 30-minute waiting period, parasites were observed and the few worms that were contracted or had acquired an opaque appearance were considered dead and discarded. The remaining treated or control worms were separately collected into RNA&#8212;later solution (Ambion), separated by gender (in the case of paired worms) and placed at 4&#176;C overnight until RNA extraction.

For each of two biological replicates, six different sets of twenty adult worm pairs each (120 worm pairs) were incubated in 24-well culture plates; each well contained a worm pair in 1 ml of the above medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum at 37&#176;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

Although the microarray expression analysis of males treated with PZQ did not show ATP1A2 as a differentially expressed gene (with the significance cut off that we selected for the array data), RT-qPCR has clearly detected ATP1A2 as significantly up-regulated in male worms (Fig C (upper panel) in <xref rid="pntd.0004086.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>In addition, OMP has already been shown to be synergistic with the first-line treatment drug quinine against the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> protozoan parasite [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

In fact, Jiang et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] have shown that in <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> the antiparasitic action of OMP is due to its inhibition of the P-type K/H-ATPase on the surface membrane. Here, the PZQ+OMP synergistic effect against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> was obtained with a dose of 72 &#956;M OMP (25 &#956;g/ml) that is similar to the EC50 of 76 &#956;M OMP against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It seems that the synergistic action of OMP+PZQ against PZQ-stressed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> could be dependent on the increased expression of the ATP1A2 Na/K-ATPase caused by PZQ. This would suggest that OMP is counteracting the increased Na/K-ATPase activity in PZQ-stressed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> parasites. On the other hand, it is known that OMP also targets the ATP-dependent efflux transporter P-glycoprotein [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], a member of the ABC multidrug transporter family. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> one member of this group was identified as SMDR2 (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>mansoni</italic> Multidrug Resistance 2) encoding a Pgp-like protein [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. We detected the SMDR2 gene as up-regulated in paired females treated with PZQ, while in unpaired mature females the opposite expression change was observed. It has been shown that SMDR2 activity is inhibited by PZQ in a recombinant protein assay [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and that inhibition by the specific drug tariquidar or knockdown of SMDR2 P-glycoprotein enhances PZQ activity [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] by a mechanism that involves an increased retention of labeled-PZQ inside the worms [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, there is a possibility that OMP would similarly act through inhibition of the P-glycoprotein in PZQ-stressed parasites, to increase the retention of PZQ and parasite susceptibility. Further studies are warranted, such as those for measuring the retention of labeled-PZQ in the presence of OMP, or for measuring the effect of OMP upon knockdown of ATP1A2 Na/K-ATPase or SMDR2 P-glycoprotein, to determine whether OMP is acting through either or both possible mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Effect of OMP on schistosomula treated with PZQ</title><p>We also investigated the effects of OMP or OMP+PZQ for the ability to affect schistosome larvae maintained in culture; 3-hour-old schistosomula were cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of the same concentrations of OMP or OMP+PZQ used for the adult worm couples test, mobility and death were monitored, and a typical experiment is shown in Fig D in <xref rid="pntd.0004086.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>.

In adult worms, ATP1A2 expression was increased upon exposure of the worms to PZQ, and it is conceivable that an increase in ATP1A2 activity is part of the survival response in these adult worms under PZQ stress. Hence, inhibition of ATP1A2 by OMP in the presence of PZQ would increase the mortality of adult worms. Once no change in expression of ATP1A2 was observed in schistosomula in the presence of PZQ, a synergistic effect of OMP+PZQ would not be expected in schistosomula.</p><p>In this respect, it is worth mentioning that juvenile schistosomes (3&#8211;4 weeks post-infection), which are normally refractory to 2 &#956;M PZQ, became paralyzed when ABC multidrug transporter inhibitors were added in combination with PZQ [<xref rid="pntd.0004086.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].
