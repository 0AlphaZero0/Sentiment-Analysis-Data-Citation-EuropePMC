It exhibits 37.5% homology with the entire sushi-ichi retrotransposon Gag, consisting of 371 amino acids, except for the N-terminus. <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> is located on the X chromosome between <italic>Trpc5</italic> and <italic>Lhfpl1</italic>.

The absence of <italic>SIRH11/ZCCHC16</italic> from marsupials, monotremes and birds was also confirmed, because there is no orthologous gene between <italic>TRPC5</italic> and <italic>LHFPL1</italic> in the opossum and Tasmanian devil, or between <italic>TRPC5</italic> and <italic>AMOT</italic> in the chicken and platypus, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005521.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).

It is considered that alternating search behavior reflects a primitive working memory capacity because it is based on the tendency of normal animals to enter the arm of the Y-maze which was least recently explored [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The Y-maze test also allows the simultaneous assessment of hyperactivity independently of spatial working memory. Hyperactivity may interfere with learning and memory, therefore, its assessment is crucial for the interpretation of memory test results [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, KO mice exhibited a lower level of alternation (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.032), although the total number of arm entry events was the same (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.358) as the WT controls, suggesting that they have a poor working memory (<xref rid="pgen.1005521.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Some of the KO mice jumped out of the Y-maze stage before the test started, while none of the control mice exhibited such behavior. Although we excluded this data from the results, this also appears to indicate that these KO mice tend to exhibit extreme behavior when transferred to a new environment. From these results, we reasoned that <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice have some abnormality in cognition, possibly related to monoamine function in the brain, that impacts impulsivity, attention and/or memory.</p><p>We used null KO male mice for behavioral tests. Although <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> is also expressed in the kidney, testis and ovary, there was no evidently unusual phenotype in these organs and also no viability or growth effects observed, as mentioned. Therefore, we think that the abnormal behaviors observed in the KO mice mainly reflect an impairment of brain function. In addition, we used mice generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) between KO males and hetero KO females for these behavioral tests, as described in Materials and Methods. The fertilized eggs were transferred to the pseudopregnant ICR females, after which the pups were born naturally and taken care of by the ICR mothers. Thus, harmful effects on the pups from the potentially abnormal KO mothers in terms of their nursing behavior were completely excluded. Therefore, we believe that these results reflect a difference in genotype.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Change of the NA level in the prefrontal cortex of <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice</title><p>We carried out microdialysis analysis in the prefrontal cortex of the cerebrum to directly examine the monoamine levels in the KO brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] because it is well documented that prefrontal cortical NA as well as dopamine (DA) plays an important role in spatial working memory [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The levels of various monoamines were measured, mainly at 11~13 w of age, including DA, NA, adrenaline (AD), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), serotonin (5-HT), 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methyl-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) and normetanephrine (NM) using isoproterenol (ISO) as the control. During overnight experiments for long-term recording, we found that these levels varied suddenly and unexpectedly, presumably because of abrupt changes in sound and vibration in the experiment room. The levels were also greatly dependent on the initial condition of the mice. As it was difficult to obtain reproducible data in the normal experimental setting, we adopted the perfusion method to overcome this difficulty. Perfusion by high-K solution intensively stimulates the release of neurotransmitters and hence enables an evaluation of the sum of neurotransmitter content at the synapse and in the neuron. High K solution was applied twice, with a 120-min interval. The release of neurotransmitter in response to the second perfusion of the high K solution is dependent upon the catabolic activity during a 120 min period. It was demonstrated that the recovery of the NA level was significantly delayed compared with the DA level (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0159), while the levels of two other DA metabolites, DOPAC and 3-MT (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.532 and 0.310, respectively), were unchanged in the KO mice (<xref rid="pgen.1005521.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005521.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005521.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Abnormality in brain of <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice.</title><p>(A) Microdialysis analysis in the prefrontal cortex in the cerebrum.

In the phasic mode, LC cells exhibit selective phasic activation for target stimuli, but only a moderate level of tonic discharge, leading to excellent performance on the specific task with few errors and focused, selective attention. In the tonic mode, the LC cells fail to respond phasically to any task stimuli, but rather, exhibit higher levels of ongoing tonic activity, leading to poor performance with many errors and a form of scanning, labile attention. In their overarching theory, Bouret and Sara proposed that phasic activation of the NA neurons of the LC takes place in time with the cognitive shifts that facilitate dynamic reorganization of target neural networks, permitting rapid behavioral adaptation to the demands of changing environmental imperatives [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In this work, <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice exhibited certain clearly evident behavioral abnormalities, such as increased activity during the light/dark transition test, higher daily activities in the period just after dark as well as just before light and a lower score in alternating search behavior in the Y-maze test, indicating that <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> plays a role in cognition. Together with certain other sudden and unexpected movement activity that was observed, it is likely that <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice tend to exhibit behaviors related to the classic tonic LC mode. In support of this idea, a significantly lower recovery rate of NA compared to DA in the prefrontal cortex was observed in a microdialysis analysis of the KO mice after perfusion with high potassium solution.</p><p>Importantly, activation of the LC-NA system is also associated with an increased accuracy of the response to task-relevant stimuli [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using microdialysis analysis, Rossetti and Carboni demonstrated that both prefrontal cortical DA and NA are involved in the modulation of working memory [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. From an application of the T-maze test using rats that analyzes such function along with memory and spatial learning via an application of various stimuli, they demonstrated that the prefrontal cortical DA and NA dialysate levels are both phasically increased when rats perform correctly in a delayed alternation task in a T-maze. Together with the findings from other experiments, they ultimately concluded that DA is primarily associated with reward expectancy, whereas NA is involved in the active maintenance of goal-related information as well as the rules for realizing the goal [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is in good accord with the results of our Y-maze test, indicating that <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> KO mice with a lower NA recovery rate in the neurons of the prefrontal cortex have impaired spatial working memory.</p><p>It has also been proposed that the phasic as opposed to tonic LC activity participates in certain critically important normal behavioral functions as well as severe mental problems, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a variety of emotional and affective disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, the behavioral abnormalities observed suggest a possible role for <italic>SIRH11/ZCCHC16</italic> in mental disorders.</p><p>Although a relatively higher expression level was observed in the brainstem, diencephalon and mesencephalon in the RT-PCR experiment, we have no direct evidence at present as to precisely where <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> is expressed in the brain or whether the putative Sirh11/Zcchc16 protein in the NA neurons from the LC. This is despite numerous attempts using <italic>in situ</italic>, Western blotting and immunostaining. However, the conservation of the amino acid sequence of the Sirh11/Zcchc16 in both boreoeutheria and afrotheria clearly demonstrates that it is subjected to purifying selection (dN/dS &lt;1), providing indirect but nonetheless supportive evidence that <italic>Sirh11/Zcchc16</italic> is a protein-coding gene (<xref rid="pgen.1005521.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the finding that the xenarthran <italic>pseudoSirh11/Zcchc16</italic> bearing many mutations in its coding frame has been subjected to relaxed or neutral evolution (dN/dS ~1) (<xref rid="pgen.1005521.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The Sirh11/Zcchc16 protein possesses a conserved CCHC zinc finger domain with potential RNA-binding capability. Therefore, it is possible that it functions as a part of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in neurons because mRNAs synthesized in the soma are transported to neurites and/or synapses as mRNPs by binding to RNA-binding proteins and are translated there [<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005521.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
