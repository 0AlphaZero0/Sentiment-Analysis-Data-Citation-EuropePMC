To examine the functions and roles of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin, a stable CHO-677 cell line expressing the murine &#945;v&#946;3 heterodimer (designated as "CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3" cells) was established using a highly efficient lentiviral-mediated gene transfer technique. Integrin subunits &#945;v and &#946;3 were detected at the gene and protein levels by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), respectively, in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line at the 20th passage, implying that these genes were successfully introduced into the CHO-677 cells and expressed stably. A plaque-forming assay, 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>), real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and IFA were used to detect the replication levels of Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line. After infection with FMDV/O/ZK/93, the cell line showed a significant increase in viral RNA and protein compared with CHO-677 cells. These findings suggest that we successfully established a stable &#945;v&#946;3-receptor-expressing cell line with increased susceptibility to FMDV. This cell line will be very useful for further investigation of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin, and as a cell model for FMDV research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>&#945;v&#946;3</kwd><kwd>cell line</kwd><kwd>Foot-and-mouth disease virus</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="CN">National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31302118</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="CN">Gansu Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars</funding-source><award-id>145RJDA328</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="CN">Key Technologies R&amp;D Program of Gansu Province</funding-source><award-id>1302NKDA027</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="CN">National High Technology Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2011AA10A211-1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source country="CN">China Agriculture Research System</funding-source><award-id>CARS-39</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrins comprise a family of allosteric, heterodimeric, transmembrane glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and sometimes cell-pathogen interactions [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All known integrins are noncovalently combined heterodimers composed of two subunits, &#945; and &#946;, at the cell surface that display activated and non-activated conformations. Nineteen diverse integrin &#945; subunits and eight &#946; subunits exist in multicellular animals, forming at least 25 &#945;&#946; heterodimers, which may make integrins the most structurally and functionally diverse and complex family of cell adhesion molecules [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among the 25 &#945;&#946; integrins identified to date, &#945;v&#946;3 integrin is probably the most extensively studied [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When the function of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin is constrained, vascular endothelial cells become apoptotic, tumor growth is suppressed, and the tumor may even disappear [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. &#945;v&#946;3 is the most active integrin in that it binds to many different extracellular matrix ligand proteins with an exposed arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) tripeptide sequence, including fibronectin (Fn), fibrinogen (Fg), vitronectin (Vn), lamin, collagen, von Willibrand factor, and osteopontin [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Integrin &#945;v&#946;3 is usually expressed at low levels on quiescent endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, but its expression is highly upregulated during wound angiogenesis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, RGD radiotracers that specifically bind to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin can be widely applied in other angiogenesis-related abnormalities. These properties make &#945;v&#946;3 integrin an attractive target for visualization of neovasculature [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Integrin &#945;v&#946;3 is one of the key regulators of pathological angiogenesis and endothelial functions in general.</p><p>Integrin &#945;v&#946;3 is also involved in many signal transduction pathways, in both directions across the cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that &#945;v&#946;3 integrin can transmit apoptotic signals [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Stupack et al. [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated that cells adherent within a three-dimensional extracellular matrix undergo apoptosis when unligated integrins are expressed, which recruits caspase 8 to the membrane, identifying an unexpected role of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin in the regulation of apoptosis. Zhao and Ross showed that unoccupied &#945;v&#946;3 integrin regulates osteoclast apoptosis <italic>via</italic> a component of integrin by transmitting a positive death signal [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Apart from its role in signal transduction, &#945;v&#946;3 integrin can adhere to the underlying basement membrane, acting as a cell-adhesion transmembrane receptor, while it also mediates the adsorption and invasion of a variety of viruses into susceptible cells. For example, &#945;v&#946;3 integrin is a functional receptor for Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) that plays a vital role in the infection process. FMDV is a member of the genus <italic>Aphthovirus</italic> of the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> that enters cells via a receptor-mediated endocytotic pathway, causing foot-and-mouth disease, a highly infectious and economically important disease that impacts domestic cloven-hoofed animals [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Although there have been many studies of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin, we understand relatively little about the roles it plays in FMDV infection. Specifically, the role of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin in tissue tropism and pathogenesis of viruses is still unclear. In this study, we cloned full-length cDNA of suckling mouse integrin subunits &#945;v and &#946;3, and established a CHO-677 cell line stably expressing &#945;v&#946;3. This will be a useful cell model for examination of the effects of a single &#945;v&#946;3 integrin receptor in mediation of FMDV infection. We then evaluated the susceptibility of this cell line to FMDV type O/ZK/93 (FMDV/O/ZK/93).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, virus and antibodies</title><p>293T cells and heparan sulfate-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-677 or pgsD-677, ATCC, CRL-2244) cells were cultured in Ham'F-12 (HyClone, USA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, USA), 1% streptomycin (0.2 mg/mL) and penicillin (200 U/mL).

After approximately 14 days, cell cloning islands were observed. After 20 rounds of continuous cloning, a stable &#945;v&#946;3-transgenic CHO-677 cell line was obtained and designated as CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line</title><p>To determine whether the &#945;v and &#946;3 genes were stably integrated into the CHO-677 cell genome, we analyzed expression of the &#945;v and &#946;3 transcripts and proteins in CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells using PCR and IFA, respectively.

As shown in panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, the virus produced larger and more plaques in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells than in the CHO-677 cells.</p><p>The growth kinetics of the virus were determined on BHK-21 cells using viral titers to compare the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth characteristics of FMDV/O/ZK/93 in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line and the parental cells. Samples were collected at specific times after infection and TCID<sub>50</sub> was titrated on BHK-21 cells. The peak titers of FMDV/O/ZK/93 were 10<sup>5.3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/0.1 mL in CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells at 36 hpi and 10<sup>3.9</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/0.1 mL in the parental cells at 48 hpi (panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We next determined the expression of viral proteins with IFA. Intracellular cytoplasmic fluorescence was detected in the infected CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line, whereas no fluorescence was detected in the CHO-677 cells (panel C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These findings indicated that the utilization efficiency of FMDV/O/ZK/93 for CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells was relatively high.</p><p>To analyze the replication capacity of the virus, we determined the copy numbers of FMDV/O/ZK/93 viral RNAs in both cells by qRT-PCR using the supernatants collected at different time points.

These results indicate that the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells are susceptible to FMDV, and therefore confirm that the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line was successfully constructed.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody blockade assay</title><p>Preliminary studies using antibody blockade analysis showed that treatment of cells with anti-&#946;3 serum reduced the virus titer in cell culture media compared to that of mock-treated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that the ability of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 to mediate virus infection is dependent on the presence of the &#946;3 subunit domain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although &#945;v&#946;3 integrin has been studied extensively and in-depth in the field of medicine, few studies of animal &#945;v&#946;3 integrin have been conducted, and those that have focused on using the transient expression of integrin subunits to study receptors and FMDV infection. Clark et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] colleagues studied the transient functional expression of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin on vascular cells during wound repair, while Neff et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] examined the high-efficiency utilization of bovine &#945;v&#946;3 integrin as a receptor for FMDV by transiently expressing &#945;v and &#946;3 subunit cDNAs. However, the transient expression of &#945;v&#946;3 cannot be controlled well, and its repeatability is not high because it is affected by many factors. Therefore, we established a stable CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line using a highly efficient lentivirus-based inducible expression system. Recombinant lentiviral vectors are powerful and efficient tools for transferring heritable genetic material into the genome of virtually any cell type [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lentiviruses are also perhaps the most versatile retroviruses because they can infect, transduce, and sustain their expression in almost any mammalian cell. The &#945;v and &#946;3 subunits were also connected by the IRES sequence, so that both subunits were expressed within the same cellular environment under control of the same promoter, which may have facilitated formation of the &#945;v&#946;3 heterodimer. The integrin subunit &#945;v and &#946;3 genes were extracted from the tongue or lung tissues of suckling mice. Although &#945;v and &#946; molecules have been studied in other papers, murine &#945;v and &#946; molecules have not been reported. Suckling mice have been shown to be a good animal model for studying viruses and are often used in experiments due to their simple and convenient application. For example, suckling mice can be used to propagate the virus and the 50% lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) test is determined in suckling mice. Additionally, commercial murine antibodies can be more easily obtained, which will facilitate studies of FMDV using this model. More importantly, suckling mouse &#945;v and &#946;3 genes show high sequence homology to their human, swine, bovine and camel counterparts.</p><p>FMDV utilizes four integrins (&#945;v&#946;1, &#945;v&#946;3, &#945;v&#946;6, and &#945;v&#946;8) and heparan sulfate (HS) as cell receptors to initiate viral infection. Chinese hamster ovaries lack &#946;1, &#946;3, &#946;6 and &#946;8 integrin genes, and CHO-677 cell is a heparan sulfate-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell. Specifically, CHO-677 cells do not express &#945;v&#946;1, &#945;v&#946;3, &#945;v&#946;6, &#945;v&#946;8 and HS, while the constructed CHO-677-&#945;v&#946;3 cell line can stably express murine &#945;v&#946;3 integrin. Expression of the integrin subunits &#945;v and &#946;3 at the gene and protein levels in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line showed that the &#945;v and &#946;3 genes were successfully introduced into the CHO-677 cells and expressed stably.</p><p>&#945;v&#946;3 integrin has been shown to act in many cells as a receptor for the internalization of FMDV. Entry of FMDV into host cells is a complex process initiated by virus binding to a specific cell surface receptor. Although receptors for FMDV have been identified, there is little information regarding the precise mechanisms by which these receptors promote entry. Therefore, we used FMDV to infect the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line to verify the mediating effects of &#945;v&#946;3 on infection. The effects of FMDV replication on the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line suggested that FMDV RNA levels were higher in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line than in CHO-677 cells. After peak replication at 36 h and 48 h, respectively, the viral RNA levels began to decline in both cells. The level of FMDV RNA in the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line was significantly influenced by &#945;v&#946;3 integrin, which is consistent with the results observed for the viral growth curves. A standard plaque assay was also used to characterize the pathogenicity of FMDV in CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 and CHO-677 cells. FMDV produced more plaques in CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cells than in CHO-677 cells. The expression of viral proteins differed significantly in FMDV/O/ZK/93-infected CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 and CHO-677 cells according to IFA, indicating that the CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line was constructed successfully and susceptible to FMDV infection.</p><p>Many of the intracellular signaling pathways activated by integrins are dependent on the &#946;-subunit cytoplasmic domain, which indicates a further possible function of the &#946;3 cytoplasmic domain in facilitating virus entry. Previous studies have demonstrated that the ability of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 to function as a receptor for FMDV is not dependent on the presence of complete subunit cytoplasmic domains [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we used an antibody blockade assay to study the role of the &#946;3 subunit in mediating infection. Our results demonstrated that the &#946;3 subunit played a critical role in post attachment events. Miller et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] studied the role of the &#946;6 cytoplasmic domain in infection and found that &#945;v&#946;6 did not merely pass the virus onto a second receptor for internalization, but also played an active role in events subsequent to attachment. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that the integrin &#946;6-1 subunit could induce partial protection against FMDV in guinea pigs. Although the &#945;v and &#946;6 subunits have been widely investigated, there have been few investigations of the role of &#945;v&#946;3 integrin in infection. Therefore, this cell line, which stably expresses murine &#945;v&#946;3 integrin, could be a useful cell model to research the mechanism of a single &#945;v&#946;3-receptor on virus infection, and should also be a good vehicle for enhancing viral titers.</p><p>In conclusion, we cloned the full-length cDNA of the integrin subunits &#945;v and &#946;3 from suckling mice and established a CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line stably expressing suckling mouse &#945;v&#946;3 integrin that had increased susceptibility to FMDV. Further studies should investigate the functions and mechanisms of &#945;v and &#946;3 subunits using this newly developed CHO-677-m&#945;v&#946;3 cell line, including its involvement in signaling pathways, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory response in animals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the National Natural Science
