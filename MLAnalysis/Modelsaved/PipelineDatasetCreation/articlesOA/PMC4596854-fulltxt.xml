Previous ancient DNA analyses of mitochondrial control region sequences indicated the New Zealand dog population included two lineages. We sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of fourteen dogs from the colonisation era archaeological site of Wairau Bar and found five closely-related haplotypes. The limited number of mitochondrial lineages present at Wairau Bar suggests that the founding population may have comprised only a few dogs; or that the arriving dogs were closely related. For populations such as that at Wairau Bar, which stemmed from relatively recent migration events, control region sequences have insufficient power to address questions about population structure and founding events. Sequencing mitogenomes provided the opportunity to observe sufficient diversity to discriminate between individuals that would otherwise be assigned the same haplotype and to clarify their relationships with each other. Our results also support the proposition that at least one dispersal of dogs into the Pacific was via a south-western route through Indonesia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support was provided by The Skinner Fund, Royal Society of New Zealand (KG); the Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution (LMS); the Department of Anatomy, University of Otago (KG and LMS); and the Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand (Contract UoO0926) (LMS).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Consensus sequences are available from the GenBank database (accession numbers KT168369-KT168382).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Consensus sequences are available from the GenBank database (accession numbers KT168369-KT168382).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dogs are found in human communities throughout the world where they may be companions, working dogs or simply co-inhabitants of villages. They have a special place in human history as the first domesticated animal, having appeared in the archaeological record around 15,000 years ago, well in advance of other domesticates [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since this time they have successfully moved with people across the globe, including through the islands of Oceania. Recent trends in dog keeping, particularly the rise in intensive breeding for particular physical characteristics, lie as a veneer over a much longer and more complex relationship between dogs and people.</p><p>Despite their long association with people, dogs appear relatively late in the archaeological record of Oceania (<xref rid="pone.0138536.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Near Oceania includes the large island of Papua New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands, and has evidence of human occupation that dates to as far back as the late Pleistocene (ca. 40,000 years ago). The antiquity of human occupation in Near Oceania contrasts with the relatively recent human colonisation of the islands of Remote Oceania to the north, east and southwest, which were not settled until about 3,000 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to demarking two phases in the settlement of the region, the distinction also relates to differences in biogeography. The continental islands of Near Oceania possess the greatest biodiversity within the region. Further east across the Pacific the islands become smaller and more dispersed, and there is an accompanying drop in biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0138536.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138536.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of the Pacific region.</title><p>The boundary between Near and Remote Oceania is shown by the dotted line.

Pie charts and the summary table show the relative proportions of Arc1, Arc2 and A29 haplotypes observed in samples from across the region (after [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0138536.g001"/></fig><p>The oldest evidence of dogs in Oceania comes from Australia, where the earliest dog (dingo) remains date from 3,500 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The dingo has subsequently adapted to surviving independently of people and is found in many areas of rural Australia. Although the dingo is considered a feral dog, individuals may also be taken in by indigenous communities where they become companions, protectors, and spiritual guardians, and can assist with hunting [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Papua New Guinea, the New Guinea Singing dog (NGSD) is thought to be a descendant of another relatively early introduction, although no well dated or genetically confirmed archaeological NGSD remains have been reported. They are rarely observed in the wild and the current captive population is descended from only eight individuals [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Near Oceania, dogs were introduced to areas where people had already been living for thousands of years.</p><p>The introduction of dogs into Remote Oceania is associated with the migration of people to these previously uninhabited islands, which began about 3,350 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This process is marked by the appearance of a distinctive pottery, termed &#8216;Lapita&#8217;, which is present in numerous archaeological sites that extend from Papua New Guinea to the western margins of Polynesia. The presence of Lapita pottery has been linked to the arrival of people originating from Island South East Asia, who spoke Austronesian languages. In addition to pottery and languages, these people introduced agricultural practices, a suite of domesticated animals and plants, a settlement pattern of villages situated on intertidal reefs or small offshore islands, and a characteristic set of artefacts including adzes and shell ornaments [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Dogs are generally considered to be one of the Lapita domesticated animals, along with pigs and chickens. To date though, Lapita dog remains are relatively rare, having only been recorded in limited numbers in archaeological sites in the Bismarck Archipelago of New Guinea (Table 10.1 in [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) and have not been reported in any of the key archaeological sites in Vanuatu or New Caledonia.</p><p>The subsequent, post-Lapita settlement of the islands further to the east also involved dogs, pigs and chickens, although they were not uniformly distributed across the region. The settlement of Polynesia occurred in two phases, beginning with the islands of West Polynesia around 3,000 years ago during the Lapita expansion. Then after a substantial hiatus, East Polynesia was rapidly settled over several hundred years following the arrival of people initially to the central tropical islands about 1000 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This second settlement phase included the islands at the margins of East Polynesia: Hawaii, Rapa Nui and New Zealand. In some of these island groups, such as Hawaii and New Zealand, the large number of dog bones found in early archaeological sites contrast strongly with the limited evidence of dog remains in the Lapita archaeological sites further west.</p><p>By the time European explorers arrived in Polynesia in the eighteenth century, dogs were present on some but not all island groups. In East Polynesia, dogs were often an important part of the social and economic fabric of daily life [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the ranked societies of Hawaii, dogs were observed as the property of chiefs and were raised in large numbers for feasts. In New Zealand, dogs were the only domesticated animal to be successfully introduced by the Polynesian ancestors of the Maori. While living, they were kept as watch-dogs, hunting dogs and general companions and were sometimes also kept for their hair; on their death they could be used as food for ceremonial occasions, their bones and teeth as industrial materials, and their pelts to make dog skin cloaks [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies using mtDNA to investigate the origins and dispersals of the dog throughout the Pacific indicate that the dingo, NGSD and Polynesian dogs are all descended from East Asian dogs (<xref rid="pone.0138536.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Using a 582 base pair (bp) fragment of the control region of the mitogenome (mitochondrial genome) from modern dogs, Savolainen and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that all dingoes sampled belonged to the A29 haplotype. Although this is one of a number of dog mtDNA lineages that reached Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) it was the only one successfully established in Australia. On this basis, they suggest that the dingo population was either founded by a very small number of individuals, or from a group of dogs that had passed through a series of genetic bottlenecks and hence had lost substantial genetic variation. Savolainen and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also reported that the 19 ancient Polynesian dogs samples, based on analysis of a shorter 263 bp control region fragment, belonged to two short haplotypes, Arc1 and Arc2, both different from the A29 control region haplotype carried by dingoes. The short Arc1 haplotype is indistinguishable from a number of widespread control region haplotypes, while Arc2 appears to belong to the A75 lineage found in modern Indonesian dogs.</p><p>A later study by Oskarsson and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] investigated the origins and routes of the introductions of dingoes, NGSDs, and Polynesian dogs in further detail, using the same 582 bp and 263 bp Arc1 and Arc2 control region fragments. The study used samples collected from modern dogs and dingoes, previously published modern dog and dingo sequences, and the ancient Polynesian short sequences. Oskarsson and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] compared the frequency and distribution of modern haplotypes in Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, including Taiwan and the Philippines, with those from the dingo and ancient Polynesian samples (<xref rid="pone.0138536.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Arc1 and Arc2 short haplotypes were found in 10% of modern dogs samples in South China, 16% in Mainland South East Asian dogs, and 42% in Indonesian dogs. The dingo haplotype A29, was found in 2% of modern dogs sampled in South China, 1% of dogs in Mainland South East Asia, and 8% of Indonesian dogs. The short Arc1 haplotype appears to have a predominantly mainland and western Island South East Asia distribution, while Arc2 is found in increasing frequency across Island South East Asia. Additionally, they found that the short Arc1 haplotype corresponded to a possible 13 control region haplotypes, while Arc2 was limited to a possible two, A75 and A120. Neither the ancient Polynesian short haplotypes nor the A29 haplotype carried by dingoes, were present in dogs from Taiwan and the Philippines, suggesting that dogs were not introduced into the Pacific region from or via this northeastern route.</p><p>Following recent advances in sequencing technology we can now use next generation sequencing to obtain complete ancient mitogenomes. As would be expected, recently published studies of complete mitogenomes of cattle [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and sheep [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have shown that the control region sequences provide only a partial picture of genetic diversity. This has also been the case in a recent study of mitogenomes from four human burials at Wairau Bar, which demonstrated that the people buried there possessed greater than expected mtDNA diversity [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ability to observe a more fine-grained level of diversity can be particularly significant when addressing founding population structure, particularly in a geographic area with a settlement history such as that in the Pacific, which most likely involved population bottlenecks and a relatively short chronology of human occupation.</p><p>Here we describe complete mitochondrial genome sequences for fourteen dogs from the site of Wairau Bar, one of the earliest archaeological sites in New Zealand and probably a central place during the colonisation phase [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Wairau Bar comprises a settlement with middens, living floors, specialist work zones, food preparation areas, and a burial ground. The site also contains numerous bones of moa, other extinct birds, and a suite of artefact types that link New Zealand with the tropical East Polynesian homeland zone. Because Wairau Bar is among the earliest settlement sites in New Zealand, it is a critical place for understanding the colonisation processes of the archipelago including the successful introduction of dogs to the southern-most point of their Oceanic distribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Samples</title><p>Dog teeth were selected from faunal material recovered from a large cooking feature (Oven Pit 1) during archaeological excavations in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0138536.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138536.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). These excavations were fully authorised by the appropriate government agencies (NZ Historic Places Trust Authority No. 2009/121), and the excavated faunal collections are held at the Otago Archaeological Laboratories, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The oven fill contained bone and shell midden, charcoal, and fire-cracked rocks. In addition to dog, fauna identified from the oven included the extinct moa (bone and eggshell) and at least 60 species of other birds, marine mammals, fish and shellfish. Moa eggshell from Oven Pit 1 was used to develop a detailed chronology drawing on ancient DNA, and Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates, which showed the oven had been filled with midden during a single event that occurred sometime after the early 1320s and no later than about 1350 [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The rapid deposition of the oven fill indicates that the dogs were all likely to have been a part of the same dog population living at Wairau Bar immediately prior to their death and incorporation in the midden. Over 400 dog bones, teeth and bone fragments were excavated from the oven, which represents at least 21 dogs. The large number of dog bones excavated from the site allowed 16 specimens of the same element (left maxillary fourth premolar) for inclusion in this study. This means that each of the 16 specimens represents a different individual, and ensures that no dog was sampled more than once.</p><fig id="pone.0138536.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0138536.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Wairau Bar archaeological site.</title><p>Location of the archaeological site (top left), location of Oven Pit 1 (top right), and section view of Oven Pit 1 (horizontal scale 2 m, vertical scale 0.5 m).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0138536.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Extraction, hybridisation capture and sequencing</title><p>All DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation before PCR amplification was carried out at the Ancient DNA Laboratory at the University of Otago, where stringent procedures are in place to avoid contamination [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. DNA extraction was performed on sixteen teeth. To reduce surface contamination, the teeth were submerged in 6% bleach for ten minutes and rinsed in ultra pure water prior to grinding for DNA extraction. Teeth were ground using a mortar and pestle and 150 to 250 mg was used for extraction following a silica based extraction protocol [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Each sequencing library was enriched independently, and pooled in equimolar ratios after a further 10 cycles of PCR amplification. Additionally, the libraries were eluted from the MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) by heating for 3 minutes to 95&#176;C instead of treatment with sodium hydroxide. Libraries were quantified using the Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies), pooled in equimolar concentrations and sequenced using 2 x 75 base pair-end runs on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Libraries prepared from extraction blanks were subsequently sequenced on a separate run.

This approach was justified under the assumption that the above quality control (QC) procedure preferentially reduces the quality of the damaged positions in the sequencing reads, which would lead to a reduction in the probability that the damaged position would be called downstream. Finally, to maximise the usability of all the sequences obtained in our analyses, we carried out imputation using Beagle (v4.0 r1399) with default settings and the 'gt' argument for the VCF input, imputed sites with a probability greater than 0.8 were retained [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To confirm the results of the QC, and imputation, visual inspection of all sites in the alignment files was undertaken using IGV [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The imputed VCFs were then compared with the positions in the bait sequence that varied from the reference. The bait sequence was processed separately using the same computational protocol as the Wairau Bar samples.

To date, the only reported ancient dog sequences from the Pacific comprise very short fragments of the control region from Polynesian and New Zealand dogs [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thalmann and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have recently documented complete mitogenomes for ancient dogs. Although these samples came from archaeological contexts in Europe and North America we have included samples from the major dog haplogroup A in our analyses as they provide the only other published ancient mitogenomes for comparison with the Wairau Bar dogs. Mitochondrial genome sequences and control region haplotypes were also obtained from studies of modern dogs from the Asia-Pacific region [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138536.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to investigate the geographical context of the samples.</p><p>We used the multiple sequence aligner MUSCLE (v3.8.31) [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to align the Wairau Bar sequences to the ancient and modern mitogenomes, and the modern control region haplotypes obtained from the literature. In their study of mitogenomes from dogs and wolves worldwide, Pang and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] analysed only 16,195 bp of the mitochondrial genome to allow them to exclude repetitive and difficult-to-align regions.

It is possible therefore that the haplotypes observed in the dogs we have sampled represent the founding lineages for the initial Polynesian dog population in New Zealand. Determining the number of founding haplotypes based on ancient DNA can, however, be a challenging task as observed variation can be the result of private mutations or false positives resulting from DNA damaged variants being called [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, given the tight temporal and spatial context of the sample (all individuals came from the same oven feature, deposited in one event) samples may represent several generations carrying the same lineage, possibly bitches and their offspring.

The Arc1 haplotype observed in the short fragment study was present in dogs from three New Zealand archaeological sites, at Otehei Bay, Urupukapuka Island, Bay of Islands, Harataonga, Great Barrier Island, and Redcliffs, Christchurch, mainland South Island (Matisoo-Smith, unpublished data).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dogs from Wairau Bar likely represent part of the initial population of dogs introduced to New Zealand, having arrived with people around the beginning of the fourteenth century AD [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We sequenced fourteen complete or nearly complete mitogenomes, from a sample of dog teeth obtained from one oven feature at this important site. We observed five different mitochondrial haplotypes, which may have contributed to the establishment of the dog population of New Zealand. While it is possible that these haplotypes represent private mutations that are not carried further in the dog population, they may also be founding lineages. Further analyses of dogs from early archaeological sites in New Zealand would assist with determining the status of these lineages, if any additional haplotypes were introduced elsewhere, or if the Wairau Bar dog population can be considered representative of the Polynesian derived founding population as a whole. This initial dog population was then subsumed by a new wave of dogs introduced during the European colonisation of New Zealand in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Analyses of dog bone from archaeological sites provide the only method of investigating the arrival and dispersal of the first dogs to arrive in New Zealand.</p><p>The limited number of mitochondrial lineages present at Wairau Bar suggests that only a few dogs may have been introduced to New Zealand within the first few years of settlement, despite the large numbers of dog bones recovered from early archaeological sites throughout the country [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it is also possible that the founding population came from a source population with very limited diversity, or that a combination of both factors contributed to the observed lack of variation. Historical observations of animal management practices in New Zealand and elsewhere in Polynesia, and the lack of animal control measures visible in the archaeological record, indicate that the majority of the dogs at Wairau Bar and other early archaeological sites were likely to be free ranging. The carrying capacity of free ranging dogs is closely related to the human environment that they occupy [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and it is possible that a large dog population grew rapidly from a small number of dogs following their arrival in New Zealand, given the quantity and quality of food sources available.</p><p>For populations such as that of Wairau Bar, which represent relatively recent migration events, the use of data solely from the mitochondrial control region is insufficient to address questions about population structure and founding events. Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of adopting a more fine-grained approach that identifies sufficient diversity to discriminate between individuals that would otherwise be assigned the same haplotype, and to clarify their relationships with each other. As with the dingo in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the founding population of dogs in New Zealand is likely to have been drawn from a group of dogs that had passed through a series of genetic bottlenecks at times during their movement across the Pacific, hence arriving in New Zealand with limited genetic variation. The use of mitogenomes, however, enables us to identify five haplotypes within the Wairau Bar sample, whereas only one (A75) could have been identified had we used only the control region.</p><p>The analysis of mitogenomes of the Wairau Bar dogs also contributes to our understanding of the dispersal of dogs throughout the Asia-Pacific region, prior to their arrival in New Zealand. Pang and colleagues&#8217; [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] analyses of the major dog clade identified ten sub-groups within Haplogroup A, with distinct geographical patterning. However, the majority of published mitogenomes from their study were from mainland China, with a few from Thailand, but none from Island South East Asia. The Wairau Bar dogs' mitogenomes sit within sub-group a2, which has an East Asian distribution and includes the A29 control region haplotype found in dogs and dingoes [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Further analyses of full mitogenomes from Island South East Asian village dogs and ancient DNA analyses of dog bone from archaeological sites could assist with understanding the distribution of dog lineages in this region, as human migrations from Island South East Asia likely played a pivotal role in the dispersal of dogs out into the Pacific.</p><p>The Wairau Bar dogs all carry the control region haplotype A75 (if indels are included in the analysis, the Wairau Bar dogs correspond to the control region haplotype A192) and the short Arc2 haplotype. The A75 control region haplotype and the Arc2 short haplotype have a distribution across Mainland China, Island South East Asia and the Pacific, but to date have not been found in modern dogs in Taiwan or the Philippines [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The A192 haplotype is found in modern village dogs from Bali, Indonesia ([<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Supplementary Information). The settlement of Remote Oceania is associated with expansion of Austronesian language speakers; these languages are thought to have originated in Taiwan, and were then introduced through the Philippines and southwards through Island Southeast Asia and into the Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Based on the presence of the A75 (A192) haplotype in the Wairau Bar dogs and the modern distribution of this haplotype, it appears that at least one of dog dispersals into the Pacific followed a more south-western route through Indonesia. Interestingly, this has parallels with the early movement of pigs and rats, based on genetic and geometric morphometric studies [<xref rid="pone.0138536.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138536.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The short haplotype Arc2 was carried by all of the Wairau Bar dogs analysed in our study. Previous short fragment analysis of other ancient samples from New Zealand and Polynesia found that samples were split between two haplotypes, Arc1 (32%) and Arc2 (68%). At this point it is not known whether the lack of the Arc1 haplotype arises from a sampling bias, or relates to geographical or chronological factors. The Arc1 haplotype has been previously identified in dog samples from three archaeological sites in New Zealand, two of which are offshore islands (Urupukapuka and Harataonga). Further analyses are required to investigate the possible distribution of Arc1 in New Zealand.</p><p>We sequenced fourteen complete mitogenomes of dogs from one of the earliest archaeological sites in New Zealand and were able to identify five haplotypes, rather than the single haplotype that would have been observable using the control region. The arrival of people and dogs in New Zealand represents the end point of the last major pre-industrial human migration; yet questions still remain about the timing and routes taken. While the preservation conditions in the Pacific are generally poor, particularly for open coastal sites like Wairau Bar, our results indicate that obtaining nuclear data from the best preserved of these samples may be possible in the future. Such data would allow us to address a range of questions including population structure among closely related individuals, and human selection for particular traits. The sequencing of additional complete mitogenomes from dog bones from New Zealand and Polynesian archaeological sites offers the possibility of refining our understanding of the dispersal of dogs during this last major human migration, and their subsequent movements at local and regional scales. Our results have wider implications for the use of dogs in studies about human migrations in other regions, since the sequencing of mitogenomes may greatly enhance the information potential of archaeological dog remains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138536.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Graph of mitogenome coverage of the Wairau Bar dog sequences.</title><p>Each sample is represented by a horizontal bar.
