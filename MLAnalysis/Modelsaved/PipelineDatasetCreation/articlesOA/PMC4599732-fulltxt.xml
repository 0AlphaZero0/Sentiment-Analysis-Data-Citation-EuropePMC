The starting point of our method is the generation of a signature summarising the consensual transcriptional response of multiple human cell lines to a compound of interest (namely the <italic>seed compound</italic>). This signature can be derived from data in existing databases, such as the connectivity-map, and it is used at first instance to query a network interlinking all the connectivity-map compounds, based on the similarity of their transcriptional responses. This provides a drug neighbourhood, composed of compounds predicted to share some effects with the seed one. The original signature is then refined by systematically reducing its overlap with the transcriptional responses induced by drugs in this neighbourhood that are known to share a secondary effect with the seed compound. Finally, the drug network is queried again with the resulting refined signatures and the whole process is carried on for a number of iterations. Drugs in the final refined neighbourhood are then predicted to exert the principal mode of action of the seed compound. We illustrate our approach using paclitaxel (a microtubule stabilising agent) as seed compound. Our method predicts that glipizide and splitomicin perturb microtubule function in human cells: a result that could not be obtained through standard signature matching methods. In agreement, we find that glipizide and splitomicin reduce interphase microtubule growth rates and transiently increase the percentage of mitotic cells&#8211;consistent with our prediction. Finally, we validated the refined signatures of paclitaxel response by mining a large drug screening dataset, showing that human cancer cell lines whose basal transcriptional profile is anti-correlated to them are significantly more sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by an EBI-SANGER post-doctoral fellowship to FI, by the Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation (proj.CTTV015) and by a CRUK Career Development Grant to VJD (C28598/A9787).

Using publicly available transcriptional data, derived either from general gene-expression data resources such as GEO [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and ArrayExpress [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or from more specific ones such as the Connectivity-map (a data-set of expression profiles derived from treatments with a large number of drugs on a set of human cell lines) (cMap) [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it has been possible to infer new potential therapeutic applications for already approved drugs (drug- repositioning) [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Starting from the idea that each perturbation affecting the transcriptional activity of the cell can be summarised by a given gene expression signature, two computational paradigms have been conceived [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The first paradigm is based on the <italic>signature reversion</italic> principle and aims at identifying drugs inducing a transcriptional response anti-correlated (opposite) to that of a given disease. Drugs identified with this approach are hypothesized to be capable of reverting the disease signature, and hence the disease phenotype. This idea has been successfully applied in various contexts, including Crohn&#8217;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], cancer [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The second paradigm is based on the <italic>guilt by association</italic> principle, which assumes that if two drugs elicit a similar transcriptional response across a panel of heterogeneous human cell lines, they could share a mode of action (MoA), even if directly binding different intracellular targets. Hence, if one drug has a therapeutic effect for a certain disease, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the second drug could exert that effect too. Based on this idea, a &#8216;drug similarity network&#8217; (DN) was assembled by systematically comparing transcriptional responses to drug treatment from the cMap database [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cluster analysis of this network revealed groups of densely interconnected drugs enriched for a common MoA, and was used to investigate the MoA of new compounds, as well as to detect unreported effects of well-known drugs that are already contained in it. For example, through this approach fasudil, a drug used to reverse blood vessel spasm, was found to be an effective inducer of cellular autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With a similar method, comparison of the transcriptional signature of MT7, a compound that arrests cells in mitosis and disrupts spindle formation, to the cMap drug signatures predicted that MT7 is a microtubule perturbing agent [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Here we propose an approach that, starting from the computational pipeline proposed in [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], allows a supervised refinement of gene expression signatures following drug treatment to disentangle them from spurious effects due to drugs&#8217; secondary effects. Particularly, we use the DN of [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as initial searching space to identify molecules eliciting a transcriptional response similar to that of a compound of interest, that we call the <italic>seed compound</italic> (SC) (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This analysis yields a neighbourhood of compounds connected to the SC and clustered into <italic>network communities</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] statistically enriched for certain MoAs (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Among these, groups of drugs not having the same principal MoA of the SC but sharing a secondary effect with it can be found. For example, Hsp90 inhibitors are densely interconnected in the DN to proteasome inhibitors. This happens because, even if having different direct targets, these two classes of compounds increase the abundance of unfolded proteins. In fact, compounds in the first class inhibit one of the most important chaperone proteins (involved also in protein degradation), whereas compounds in the second class inhibit an enzyme responsible for the degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins. As a consequence Hsp90 inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors both up-regulate genes involved in the response to the unfolded protein stress, and this results into a strong similarity at the transcriptional response level between these two classes of compounds [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For similar reasons, Topoisomerase I and II inhibitors and Cdk2 inhibitors are densely interconnected in the DN because of their common effect on cell cycle mediated by the inhibition of endogenous CDKs via the up-regulation of p21 (which follows the DNA damage) in the first case, and by the direct inhibition of Cdk2 in the second case [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These examples highlight that the definition of relevant primary MoA and secondary (non relevant) MoA is not general and varies across classes of drugs, with level of granularities that must be necessarily defined run-time by the user in a supervised and fully tunable step of analysis.</p><fig id="pone.0139446.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139446.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Iterative network guided connectivity mapping pipeline.</title><p>(A) A drug similarity network (DN) is assembled from the drug response signatures contained in the connectivity-map database; the DN is queried by using the transcriptional signature of a seed compound, composed by up- and down-regulated genes, indicated in red and blue respectively, following treatment with the seed compound. (B) The resulting neighbourhood is analysed. By using a supervised approach the drugs and drug communities connected to the seed compound are investigated for enriched modes of action (MoAs); to dilute effects on drug similarity due to commonalities in secondary MoAs, refined signatures are computed, taking into account inconsistent effects of drug treatment on transcription (i.e. genes up-regulated by the seed treatment and down-regulated when treating with the classes of compounds characterised by the common secondary MoA and vice versa, indicated in orange and cyan respectively). This subdivides the original seed signature into a refined consistent signature and a refined inconsistent signature; the drug network is queried again with the computed multiple refined signatures and resulting connection scores are combined yielding a new seed neighbourhood; (C) after a number of refinement iterations the final neighbourhood of the seed compound is considered as output of the procedure; compounds in the final network, predicted to share the principal MoA of the seed compound, are finally selected for experimental validation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0139446.g001"/></fig><p>To filter out the effect of secondary MoAs of two drugs on their similarity we designed an iterative, network-guided approach for disentangling the transcriptional changes due to a primary MoA of interest from those changes induced non-specifically through secondary effects (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). This is obtained by systematic reducing the overlap between the signature of the SC and those of neighbouring compounds that share a known secondary MoA with it. Hence, our methods combines an unsupervised step (the query of the drug network), with a supervised one where we take into account of a priori known characterisation of the drugs in the resulting network neighbourhood, and we use this information to refine the query signatures.</p><p>By applying two iterations of this method, and using paclitaxel (a microtubule inhibitor) as seed compound, we predicted two novel microtubule perturbing agents: splitomicin, an inhibitor of SIRT2 that deacetylates tubulin [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and glipizide, a short acting anti-diabetic drug possessing hypoglycemic properties [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We experimentally verified that treating cells with splitomicin and glipizide induces microtubule stabilization, by measuring microtubule growth rates and microtubule turnover with levels of acetylated tubulin (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Both splitomicin and glipizide treatments induced subtle perturbations to both chromosome congression and segregation, supporting their roles as agents that perturb microtubule function. Finally, we validated the ability of the generated refined signatures in predicting sensitivity to paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinorelbine, in terms of reduced cell viability across ~600 human cancer cell lines, from a high-throughput drug screening (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerrxgene.org/">http://www.cancerrxgene.org/</ext-link>), [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>To allow easy implementation of our pipeline, we provide a set of free, open-source R scripts and objects that implement our code and reproduce our results, available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francescojm/iNRG_cMap">https://github.com/francescojm/iNRG_cMap</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~iorio/PLoS_ONE_Submission">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~iorio/PLoS_ONE_Submission</ext-link>.

This response summarizes the consistent effect of an <italic>X</italic>-treatment on transcription across all the treated cell lines contained in the study, in the form of a genome-wide ranked list of genes (i.e. &#8216;Prototype Ranked List&#8217; (PRL-signature)&#8212;S1 Supplementary Dataset, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francescojm/iNRG_cMap/">https://github.com/francescojm/iNRG_cMap/</ext-link> and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~iorio/PLoS_ONE_Submission">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~iorio/PLoS_ONE_Submission</ext-link>). Then we used the paclitaxel PRL-signature as a seed to query the drug network described in the same study (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This network summarizes the effects of 1,309 bioactive small molecules.

These drugs elicit a transcriptional response similar to that of paclitaxel, according to the distance metric described in the supplementary methods and in [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], hence they could share a mode of action (MoA) with paclitaxel. We performed a statistical enrichment analysis quantifying how surprising it is to observe occurrences of drugs from a given community in the paclitaxel neighbourhood (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The drug most similar to paclitaxel is demecolcine (drug distance (D) = 0.71, in the 0.45% distance quantile), a microtubule-depolymerizing drug that at low doses binds to microtubule plus-ends to inhibit its dynamics. Additionally, in the paclitaxel neighbourhood some known microtubule destabilizers (such as celastrol, parbendazole, and fenbendazole) are present; the significantly recurrent communities are number 40 (p-value = 6.95 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>), enriched in the original DN for proteasome inhibitors (PI) and other mitotic progression blockers, and number 62, which in the network contains a mixture of calcium channel blockers, anti-infective agents and anti-platelet compounds.

First, the GO:term enrichment analysis of the paclitaxel optimal-signature highlighted the up-regulation of genes associated with the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Second, drugs in community number 40 are among the most recurrent ones in the paclitaxel neighbourhood (p-value = 6.95 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>), and this community is enriched for proteasome inhibitors such as celastrol and MG-132, which induce mitotic arrest [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To disentangle the specific effects of paclitaxel on microtubule stabilisation from the secondary effects arising due to paclitaxel induced mitotic arrest, we focused on three typical mitotic progression blockers and proteasome inhibitors predicted to be very similar to paclitaxel in the network based on our previous analysis: MG-132, celastrol and 5224221 (all contained in community n. 40) (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Although comparing the PRL-signatures of these three drugs with the paclitaxel optimal-signature showed an overall consistent profile of expression, reflecting the similarity of these drugs in the network, we also observed a number of genes that showed an inconsistent profile across the two classes of drugs (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Particularly, we identified a subset of genes behaving inconsistently across paclitaxel and proteasome inhibitor treatment and collected them into an inconsistent-signature composed by two groups of genes, defined as follows (and highlighted in yellow in the heat-map shown in <xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(A) Up-regulated set, containing genes in the up-regulated part of the paclitaxel optimal-signature but falling above the 70th percentile in the PRL-signature of at least two drugs among MG-132, celastrol and 5224221;</p></list-item><list-item><p>(B) Down-regulated set, containing genes in the down-regulated part of the paclitaxel optimal-signature but falling within the 30th percentile of the PRL-signature of at least two drugs among MG-132, celastrol and 5224221.</p></list-item></list><fig id="pone.0139446.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139446.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Paclitaxel refined networks.</title><p>(A and B) First iteration of the network guided connectivity-mapping: (A) Expression percentile heat-map for the genes in the paclitaxel optimal-signature, along the prototype ranked lists (PRLs) of paclitaxel and some of its neighbouring drugs: 3 proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and 2 benzimidazoles (included for comparison).

As we did for the paclitaxel optimal-signature, we performed a GO enrichment analysis on the paclitaxel/PIs inconsistent signature and the results were very similar to those of the previous case (<xref rid="pone.0139446.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Despite the reduction in the number of considered genes, most of the enriched terms were still linked to microtubules, spindle, spindle pole, chromosome condensation and segregation, indicating that this refined signature is more specifically linked to the effect of paclitaxel on microtubule stabilisation, with respect to the paclitaxel optimal-signature, which apparently covers a wider range of effects.</p><p>To better account for the effects on microtubule stabilisation, and to add more weight to the contribution of the expression-changes of these inconsistently modulated genes on the initial connectivity scores, we used the two refined signatures, respectively the paclitaxel/PIs consistent and inconsistent signatures, to compute individual connectivity scores to the cMap drugs, using the method implemented on the cMap query tool [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and combining the obtained results as follows. To avoid the problem of data comparability across the different batches in the cMap [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and to dilute cell line specific effects on drug response, we used the PRL-signatures rather than individual gene expression profiles [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We derived connectivity scores between the two signatures and all the cMap drug PRL-signatures using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). To compute the final refined paclitaxel neighbourhood, the normalised connectivity scores of the compounds yielding a positive connection with a false discovery rate (fdr) &lt; 5%, when queried with both the signatures, were averaged. Finally, the compounds were sorted according to their average score. This resulted in a list of 36 compounds, further referred to as the paclitaxel-refined network (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the initial paclitaxel network (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) the refined network contains more drugs; additionally, some benzimidazoles (well established microtubule destabilisers) such as albendazole and nocodazole are recovered from the cMap. Importantly, proteasome inhibitors are no longer connected to paclitaxel. This suggests that the similarity accounted while composing this network is disentangled from commonalities to mitotic arrest and probably reflects more efficiently the effects of the analysed drugs on microtubules.</p><p>To reduce the secondary effect of gross microtubule disruption from specific effect of microtubule stabilisation, we iterated this procedure by discriminating microtubule stabilisers and destabilisers in the paclitaxel-refined network. We focused on the 4 benzimidazoles, known to destabilise microtubules, contained in the paclitaxel-refined network: parbendazole, fenbendazole, albendazole and nocodazole (in order of similarity to paclitaxel). We computed a microtubule-stabilising signature (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) selecting the genes that are specifically up-regulated upon treatment with paclitaxel and down-regulated upon treatment with the benzimidazoles, and vice-versa. Then we checked for connections of the PRL-signature of the drugs in the paclitaxel-refined network with the microtubule-stabilising signature. This allowed us to predict the likelihood of a drug as a microtubule stabiliser versus destabiliser on the basis of positive and negative connectivity scores, respectively. In this way, we computed a connectivity score quantifying how likely it is that a drug stabilises microtubules (positive score) or destabilises them (negative score) (<xref rid="pone.0139446.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We combined these scores (after normalisation) with those resulting from the previous analysis by additionally refining the paclitaxel network (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0139446.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139446.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Paclitaxel final network.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0139446.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0139446.t001"/></alternatives></table-wrap><p>We performed a GO enrichment analysis on the genes contained in the microtubule stabilising signature.

This is further confirmed by the up-regulation of tubulin genes that would be expected as a cellular response to depletion of tubulin subunits arising from microtubule stabilisation. Hence, the final list of compounds could contain drugs whose impact on microtubule function is very similar to that exerted by paclitaxel. We chose to validate glipizide and splitomicin as they ranked in the top-2 positions in the final list. In agreement with the guilt by association principle mentioned in the introduction, although no direct interaction with tubulin has been reported for splitomicin and glipizide, our results suggest that they can indirectly induce microtubule stabilisation.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experimental validation of Glipizide and Splitomicin as microtubule stabilisers</title><p>Glipizide is an anti-diabetic drug and a potassium channel antagonist [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] which has not been previously associated with microtubule stabilisation, although potassium channel BKCa is known to directly interact with Microtubule Associated Protein 1A (MAP1A) in both excitable and non-excitable cells [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In here, we tested if glipizide and splitomicin are able to directly or indirectly induce microtubule stabilisation as predicted through our study.</p><p>To assess the extent to which the two drugs may suppress microtubule dynamics, we used two approaches: first, we measured the velocity and density of growing microtubule-end bound protein, EB3 fused to TdTomato (EB3-TdTomato), using live-cell imaging (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) and second, we measured the amount of acetylated tubulin, a post-translational marker for long-lived stable microtubule populations, using fixed-cell immunofluorescence (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Following an hour of drug treatment, the velocity and density of EB3 comets in interphase HeLa EB3-TdTomato cells were significantly reduced compared to control cells (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Under similar conditions, 100 nM paclitaxel treatment would abolish almost all of EB3 comets (NT and VMD, unpublished data). These data indicate two points: first glipizide and splitomicin treatments can reduce microtubule growth rates and suppress microtubule growth fraction, indicative of microtubule stabilization. Second, compared to paclitaxel, the impact of glipizide and splitomicin are mild, highlighting the strength of the signature in exposing drugs with a microtubule stabilising ability even when this is not as high as that of paclitaxel.</p><fig id="pone.0139446.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139446.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Splitomicin and Glipizide treatment reduce the incidence of microtubule growth and density and increase the amount of acetylated tubulin.</title><p>(A) Live-cell images of HeLa<sup>EB3-TdTomato</sup> cells treated with 40 <bold>&#956;</bold>M glipizide or 20 <bold>&#956;</bold>M splitomicin, as indicated.

Immunostaining studies showed a slight but reproducible increase in the proportion of cells positive for acetylated tubulin following drug treatment, compared to control DMSO treatment (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139446.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2(B) Fig</xref>); in contrast, no noticeable difference was observed in total tubulin intensities between drug treated and untreated populations (data not shown). This confirms that glipizide and splitomicin increase the incidence of stable and long-lived microtubules in cells. In summary, both EB3-comet behaviour and acetylated tubulin status show a role for glipizide and splitomicin in altering microtubule stability, consistent with our predictions. Because glipizide and splitomicin were excluded from being microtubule increasing agents in a high-throughput screen (HCS assay for microtubule stabilizers, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=2205">http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assay/assay.cgi?aid=2205</ext-link>), the role for glipizide and splitomicin in altering the state of microtubule dynamics is probably indirect.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Cell division events are perturbed in the presence of glipizide and splitomicin</title><p>Although glipizide and splitomicin have not been reported as direct tubulin binding agents, our studies so far indicate a role for glipizide and splitomicin in altering the state of microtubule dynamics.</p><p>Microtubule stabilisation is expected to perturb chromosome congression and segregation during cell division. We tested if microtubules stabilisation following glipizide and splitomicin treatment perturbed mitosis. For this purpose, we performed two assays: first, we quantified the percentage of rounded-up cells (mitotic index) in HeLa cell populations treated with varying concentrations of glipizide and splitomicin for either a three or six hour period. Second, we performed time-lapse microscopy to follow mitosis progression in cells exposed to glipizide and splitomicin.</p><p>Following a three hour period of drug treatment we observed an increase in mitotic indices of splitomicin or glipizide similar to paclitaxel treated populations, indicative of a mitotic perturbation. However, following a six-hour drug treatment, there was only a modest increase in mitotic cells in splitomicin treated populations, compared to populations treated with paclitaxel (<xref rid="pone.0139446.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3(A) Fig</xref>). This shows that mitotic arrest following glipizide and splitomicin treatment was not prolonged, a case similar to the mitotic delay but not terminal arrest observed following the depletion of a potent microtubule destabilizer, MCAK [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In agreement, time-lapse microscopy movies of drug treated cells showed a slight delay in anaphase onset compared to controls (<xref rid="pone.0139446.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3(B) Fig</xref>). To investigate if the cause for mitotic delay is related to defective microtubule function, we quantified the extent of chromosome congression and segregation defects in cells treated with varying concentrations of the two drugs. Analysing the presence of uncongressed chromosomes in metaphase cells showed a dose dependent increase in cells with congression defects following splitomicin and glipizide treatment (<xref rid="pone.0139446.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">(S3C and S3D) Fig</xref>).

Importantly, we find that splitomicin caused a more prominent increase in congression and segregation defects, compared to glipizide (<xref rid="pone.0139446.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3(D) Fig</xref>). These findings on the differences in the severity of mitotic defects are consistent with the less severe reduction in comet density following glipizide treatment compared to splitomicin treatment.</p><p>The data from live-cell assays show that glipizide and splitomicin disrupt mitotic progression less severely compared to paclitaxel, indicating our approach to be sensitive enough for identifying compounds that are less potent compared to paclitaxel.

If this hypothesis holds true for paclitaxel and drugs in the paclitaxel final neighbourhood, we would expect that the extent of inverse match between our refined transcriptional signatures for paclitaxel and the basal gene expression of cancer cell lines would correlate with their sensitivity (in terms of viability reduction) to microtubule stabilising drugs (<xref rid="pone.0139446.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

Connectivity scores among drugs based on these signatures are effective in predicting an unreported similarity in MoA between glipizide, splitomicin and paclitaxel. Our experimental results show that this similarity is due to the effects exerted by these drugs on the state of microtubules. Additionally, we present a validation on an independent dataset showing the ability of these signatures in predicting drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines whose basal expression is negatively connected to our refined signatures. Finally, the lack of predictive ability of these signatures when used individually to identify cancer cell lines negatively connected to them (and that of the paclitaxel optimal signature, when used alone) further confirms the usefulness of our strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Signature-matching methods have been exploited in a number of recent works as tools to identify drug-repositioning opportunities and to elucidate a drug&#8217;s mode of action (MoA). These methods consider changes in transcription upon drug treatment as the output of a &#8216;black-box&#8217; mechanism triggered by interaction between the analysed drug and its target. We presented an approach that goes one step further by allowing a supervised refinement of the drug signatures to disentangle them from spurious effects due to drugs&#8217; secondary effects.</p><p>In our proof of principle case, we identified microtubule stabilisation associated transcriptional responses, derived by a stepwise refinement in which indirect effects of paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest and general microtubule disruption are disentangled from microtubule stabilisation. This refinement revealed glipizide and splitomicin as mild microtubule stabilisers, along with several other known microtubule stabilisers. We validated splitomicin and glipizide&#8217;s microtubule stabilizing potential in cells using microtubule growth assays. Finally, we showed that sensitivity to microtubule-stabilisers could be predicted using the transcriptional response to microtubule-stabilizers in tumour cells. We found a significant anti-correlation between sensitivity to microtubule stabilising drugs and the level of basal expression of our refined signatures, ascertaining the usefulness of our approach and showing the potential for reasoned use of these signatures in predicting drug sensitivity in cell line models.</p><p>Our studies show splitomicin as a microtubule stabiliser promoting congression and segregation defects. This is consistent with chromosomal instability observed in SirT2 deficient animals [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], although this work attributes it to Histone methylation changes through Histone deacetylation defects. Unlike paclitaxel treatment, neither glipizide nor splitomicin cause a steady-increase in mitotic index. Also, splitomicin caused a more severe chromosome congression and segregation defect compared to glipizide. These probably reflect the differences in their extent of stabilising microtubules. Future studies on glipizide&#8217;s mode of action will be required to explain the mechanistic reason for this phenotypic difference.</p><p>Functional analysis of the refined signatures shows an enrichment of genes associated with sterol synthesis. Whether microtubule stabilisation induces cells to up-regulate genes in these functional classes as a transcriptional feedback has not been tested. Nevertheless, 2-methoxy estradiol, a physiological hormone closely linked to sterol syntheses, is known to possess microtubule pausing properties [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] suggesting the possibility of a transcriptional feedback loop. Additionally, the up-regulation of proteins such as CKAP5, KIF2C and C13of34 (Bora) regulating microtubule dynamics (growth and shrinkage) may be indicative of a negative feedback loop in response to microtubule stabilisation (i.e., the cell responds to microtubule stabilisation by up-regulating proteins required for microtubule dynamics). Similar feedback loops positively regulating the expression of the direct targets of a drug upon treatment have been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We believe that our approach, readily available as free open-source code, can be broadly applied to other drugs and diseases, as a means to obtain refined signatures of drug response that, as our example shows, can largely improve existing signatures. In our case study we made use of prior knowledge on the MoAs of the cMap compounds from the drug annotations assembled in [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This was projected on the drug communities identified in the same study, based on experimental data. However, these annotations could be replaced by any more updated user-defined catalogue, as fully detailed in the documentation of our public available source code. Thus making our approach general and portable.</p><p>Ultimately, the refined signatures that can be identified with our approach may also be useful as biomarkers of drug response in the clinic, providing improved predictability of drug resistance and thus allowing stratification of patients. The increasing amount of transcriptional data currently generated, both as drug-induced signatures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lincscloud.org/">http://www.lincscloud.org/</ext-link>) as well as patient&#8217;s expression profiles in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and other context, provide a prospective substrate for such analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Drug network making up and query</title><p>Following the guidelines provided in [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we assembled for each of the 1,309 drugs in the connectivity-map dataset [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] a PRL-signature (Prototype Ranked List). This summarises the transcriptional effect of a given drug across multiple treatments on different cell lines and consists of a genome-wide ranked list of microarray probe-sets, sorted according to their consistent differential expression across these multiple treatments[<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To compute the similarity between drug A and B, we compared the two corresponding PRL-signatures. To this end, optimal signatures were composed for A and B by selecting the top and bottom 250 probe-sets (the up- and down-regulated genes, respectively) in the corresponding PRL-signatures. This choice is justified as follows. In [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] the authors designed a rank-merging procedure to dilute batch- and cell-line-specific effects on the transcriptional responses to a given drug across multiple experimental settings. While on one hand this method as been shown (in the same study) to improve the classification ability of the GSEA based signature-matching metrics, on the other hand this produces a genome wide PRL for each of the connectivity map compounds. As a consequence no fold-change- or significance-based methods can be applied on the PRLs to derived optimal signatures, suitable to query again the connectivity map. However in [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the authors heuristically determined (by a simulation study) that picking the top/bottom 250 genes from these PRLs is a good choice. Based on these previously published findings we decided to employ this number of genes. Subsequently, we checked the positions of the genes in the A optimal signature along the B PRL-signature (and vice versa), through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For a given gene set, we calculated an enrichment score (ES) by walking down the A PRL-signature, increasing a running-sum statistic (RS) when a gene in the set was encountered and decreasing it when encountering a gene not in the set. Finally, the ES was computed as the maximum deviation from zero observed in this random walk. This quantifies how much the genes in the A optimal signature rank consistently at the top/bottom of the B PRL-signature (and vice versa). The resulting GSEA scores for the two optimal signatures (i.e. A along B PRL-signature and B along A PRL-signature) were finally combined, yielding a single numeric value, which quantifies the distance between compounds A and B.</p><p>To build the drug network (DN), we let each node represent a drug PRL-signature and edges connect a node pairs if the distance between the corresponding PRL-signatures falls within the 5% quantile of all the 8.56 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> possible drug pair-wise distances.</p><p>To functionally characterise the DN we clustered the nodes modules termed &#8216;communities&#8217;. These communities were then annotated by searching for statistically over-represented modes of action (MoAs). To generically compute connectivity scores between a signature of genes and a drug A in the DN, the similarity between the signature <italic>S</italic> = {<italic>U</italic>, <italic>D</italic>} (composed by two sets of genes, U and D, respectively up- and down-regulated) and the PRL-signature of a drug A was quantified. For this, the tendency of the genes in the two sets {<italic>U</italic>, <italic>D</italic>} to group at the extremities of the PRL-signature, was evaluated through a two-tailed GSEA [<xref rid="pone.0139446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the connectivity score (CS) of the A-PRL-signature to the signature S was defined as:

To this aim, we generated 10,000 randomised versions of the ranked list A and queried them with the signature S, thus yielding a set of 10,000 empirical values for the CS. From an empirical observation of these randomly generated CSs, we determined that they distribute as a mixture of three Gaussian distributions, therefore a probability density function (pdf) from these empirical values was estimated by fitting a 3-Gaussian mixture model on them. The resulting pdf was then used to compute empirical p-values for the observed CSs. Finally these p-values were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p><p>To compute connectivity scores for to the basal expression profiles of the GDSC cancer cell lines, we followed the same procedure but in this case the genome wide ranked lists of genes were derived from the basal expression profiles of 1,000 human cancer cell lines, as detailed in the supplementary methods.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Microtubule growth measurements</title><p>HeLa cells expressing EB3-Tdtomato were imaged 48 h after seeding in chambered glass coverslips (Cover glass Lab-tek Chambers, FISHER) in CO2-independent L15 medium (Invitrogen) at 37C.
