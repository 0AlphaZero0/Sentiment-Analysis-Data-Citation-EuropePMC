However, the precise role of IL12p40 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the expressions of IL12p40 and its receptor interleukin-12 receptor &#946; 1 both locally and systemically in IBD cases and healthy controls, and the contribution of IL12p40 in IBD pathogenesis. We found that the expression of IL12p40 was elevated both at messenger RNA and protein levels systematically and locally in IBD patients but more significantly in CD patients. Our genetic association study revealed that the polymorphisms of IL12B rs6887695 were associated with both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) susceptibility in Chinese population, but did not affect the serum IL12p40 level in either CD patients or UC patients. In addition, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from peripheral blood of CD patients secreted the most abundant IL12p40 production, compared with the UC patients and healthy controls. We also found for the first time that neutralizing IL12p40 secretion could inhibit proliferation, enhance apoptosis, induce a G0/G1 arrest, restrain T helper 1 type immune responses, and promote chemokine C-C motif ligand 20-mediated migration of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which might be the mechanisms why anti-IL12p40 treatment presented efficacy in CD.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), consisting of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic debilitating disorders characterized by recurring episodes of relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although the precise etiology of IBD has not yet been elucidated, a complex interaction between predisposing genes, environmental factors, and dysregulated mucosal immune responses to the commensal gut microbiome has been thought to make a great contribution to the disease pathogenesis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Among the numerous cytokines, interleukin (IL) 12 and IL23 were both considered as important inflammation mediators of innate and (or) adaptive immunity, and to have key role in driving intestinal inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> They had a common subunit named IL12p40, which was encoded by <italic>IL12B</italic> gene and was an important cytokine of IL12/23 pathway playing a crucial role in chronic intestinal inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and several case&#8211;control association studies have confirmed <italic>IL12B</italic> gene as susceptibility loci of both CD and UC across different racial and ethnic groups.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In addition, some studies demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IL12p40 could abrogate established experimental colitis in mice.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, in a 36-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial, ustekinumab, which was a fully human IgG1&#954; IL12p40 mAb, had been proved to be effective in induction and maintenance therapy of refractory CD.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Present studies have improved our understanding about the importance of IL12p40 in the pathogenesis of IBD; however, there were still 2 major issues to be clarified.

In addition, to date, there were no randomized controlled trials to have evaluated whether IL12p40 neutralizing antibody was effective in UC patients. In our study, we first evaluated whether blocking IL12p40 protein would affect the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but found no influence of IL12p40 signal on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation. The number of T cells at the sites of inflammation was crucial for the maintenance and exacerbation of inflammation. Only a few studies had ever reported that anti-IL12 treatment could induce T-cell apoptosis in murine colitis model or human lamina propria mononuclear cells.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> However, no studies had ever evaluated whether extinction of IL12 signaling would promote the apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, the influence of IL12 signaling on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation had also never been explored. Our apoptosis assay and proliferation assay revealed that anti-IL12p40 treatment promoted the apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro, suggesting that a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immune response would be attenuated. This might be the core of the mechanism that why anti-IL12p40 was effective in the therapies of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and CD. Furthermore, our cell cycle distribution analysis found that neutralizing IL12p40 led to a higher frequency of cells at G0/G1 phases and lower frequency of cells at S phase and G2/M phases, indicating a G0/G1 arrest of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding was consistent with the result of proliferation assay, and further confirmed the role of IL12p40 in promoting proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. A Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS)-induced apoptosis was thought to take an important role in T-cell survival.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> By restraining the activity of caspase 3, IL12 could inhibit FAS-dependent apoptosis in murine experiments.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> In another murine colitis model, FAS-mediated T-cell apoptosis was also highlighted because that MRL/MpJ-lpr(fas) mice lacking Fas function developed colitis that responds poorly to anti-IL12 treatment.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Whether CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell apoptosis induced by anti-IL12p40 treatment was also dependent on FAS-mediated signaling remained to be further verified.</p><p>CD was generally thought to be characterized as a Th1-mediated immune disorder, whereas UC was considered a Th2-mediated immune disease.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In order to investigate the potential role of IL12p40 in the regulation of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation, the expression of 4 specific transcript factors mRNA and 4 selected cytokines were identified by real-time PCR and ELISA assay, respectively. Anti-IL12p40 treatment exhibited to markedly inhibit CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell to express T-bet mRNA and IFN-&#947; production but promote them to express GATA3 and Foxp3 and IL4 production. The expression of ROR-&#947;t and the secretion of IL17A were also enhanced by neutralizing IL12p40, however, the elevation was not obvious enough. Accordingly, we thought that enhanced IL12p40 expression upregulated the differentiation of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Th1 cells characteristic of increased T-bet mRNA and IFN-&#947; production and inhibited them to differentiate into Th2 cells characteristic of decreased GATA3 mRNA and IL4 production, and Treg cells characteristic of decreased Foxp3 mRNA. Unexpectedly, IL10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced after blocking the IL12p40 signaling. Such decrease of IL10 secretion was also observed in patients with psoriasis receiving anti-IL12p40 therapies,<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> but the exact mechanism was still unknown. Our study demonstrated that anti-IL12p40 could downregulate Th1 immune responses, which might be another important reason for remission of CD after anti-IL12p40 therapies. Our finding that elevated expression of IL12p40 of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro suppressed Th2 responses indicated IL12p40 might play different roles in the pathogenesis of UC and CD, respectively. However, it needed more studies in vivo to confirm the inference. Another important viewpoint that the early and late CDs presented distinct patterns of mucosal T-cell mediated immunoregulation had ever been proposed,<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> the similar conclusion was also drawn from experimental colitis.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Kugathasan et al<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> found that early CD had a more strongly polarized Th1 type responses than late CD and pointed out that susceptibility to IL12-mediated modulation was strongly dependent on the stage of CD. In a mice model, the researchers also found that IL12 played a pivotal role only in early colitis but not in late colitis.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, a Transwell system was used to determine the migration of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward different chemokines including CCL4, CCL5, and CCL20. An obvious migration mediated by CCL20 was observed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells receiving anti-IL12p40 treatment. Cook et al<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> had even found that Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, but not Foxp3<sup>&#8722;</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>-infected mice migrated to recombinant CCL20 in vitro. Combined with our finding that Foxp3 mRNA expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was elevated after anti-IL12p40 treatment, we speculated that CCL20-mediated migration of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells toward inflammation sites might enhance the anti-inflammatory effect. However, this speculation remained to be confirmed by further vivo experiments.</p><p>In summary, the expression of IL12p40 was elevated both at mRNA and protein levels systematically and locally in IBD patients but more significantly in CD patients. Furthermore, our findings revealed that IL12p40 signaling had a key impact on the functions of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which might be an important part of IBD pathogenesis and the mechanisms why anti-IL12p40 treatment presented efficacy in CD.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the patients and healthy volunteers for their kind assistance with donating blood and biopsy samples.
