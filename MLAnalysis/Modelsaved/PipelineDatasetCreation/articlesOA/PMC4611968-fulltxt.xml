Current methods of decontamination such as phytoremediation and chemical adsorbents can be resource and time intensive, and may not be suitable for some areas such as remote communities where cost and transportation are major issues. Bacterial decontamination, with strict controls preventing environmental release, may offer a cost-effective alternative or provide a financial incentive when used in combination with other remediation techniques. In this study, we have produced <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains containing arsenic-resistance genes from a number of sources, overexpressing them and testing their effects on arsenic resistance. While the lab <italic>E. coli</italic> strain JM109 (the &#8220;wild-type&#8221;) is resistant up to 20&#8201;mM sodium arsenate, the strain containing our plasmid pEC20 is resistant up to 80&#8201;mM. When combined with our construct pArsRBCC arsenic-&#173;containing nanoparticles were observed at the cell surface; the elements of pEC20 and pArsRBCC were therefore combined in a modular construct, pArs, in order to evaluate the roles and synergistic effects of the components of the original plasmids in arsenic resistance and nanoparticle formation. We have also investigated introducing the lac operator in order to more tightly control expression from pArs. We demonstrate that our strains are able to reduce toxic forms of arsenic into stable, insoluble metallic As(0), providing one way to remove arsenate contamination, and which may also be of benefit for other heavy metals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biogenic nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>arsenic nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>arsenic decontamination</kwd><kwd>arsenic reduction</kwd><kwd>modular arsenic-resistance construct</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000266</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">EP/K026216/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6827"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arsenic contamination is a major problem globally, both from human and geological sources. High levels of arsenic are found in the soil of many areas in countries such as the UK and China (van Elteren et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and in a number of countries, including Argentina, India, and Mexico, geological contamination of agricultural land by arsenic is exacerbated by the use of arsenic-contaminated water in irrigation (Rosas-Castor et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Arsenic is also a major contaminant of ground water used for human consumption in countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal (Singh et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Synthetic biology is already being used to develop biosensors to detect arsenic contamination in water supplies, utilizing modular DNA components to create sensitive whole-cell systems that can be used in areas where traditional detection methods are not suitable (Joshi et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; de Mora et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This system, utilizing <italic>Bacillus subtlis</italic> as a chassis, is currently being developed for commercialization<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. However, while this is a valuable way to identify arsenic contamination, it does not address how to remove the arsenic.</p><p>There are a number of methods employed or under consideration that aim to remove arsenic contamination. These include the use of plants for phytoremediation, e.g., <italic>Pteris vitatta</italic> (Sugawara et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), to hyper-accumulate arsenic and remove it from soil, and the use of granular titanium dioxide to adsorb arsenic from contaminated water (Bang et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, these methods have drawbacks. For instance, phytoremediation requires a long-term commitment; the plants used require time to grow, several harvests, and re-plantings may be required; additionally, issues surround the introduction of non-native plants. There is also arsenic-contaminated plant biomass produced which must then be disposed of; this is usually done by incineration, with the potential for arsenic release into the air, and ashes taken to designated hazardous waste dumps (Ali et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Using adsorbent materials is also not without problems as they must be replaced or recharged regularly (German et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and there may be transportation difficulties for remote areas.</p><p>Arsenic decontamination using bacteria offers a way to circumvent these problems. In contrast to materials such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, bacteria are self-renewing and do not need to be re-charged thus transport costs are lower as only a small initial inoculant is required to begin the process. Additionally, bacteria are capable of not only absorbing arsenic contaminants but also converting it to other, less harmful forms (Kao et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To improve traditional phytoremediation, it could be coupled to bacterial decontamination, where the contaminated plant material can be used as a feedstock for the bacteria, converting the arsenic to less toxic forms and preventing the release of arsenic by burning.</p><p>When arsenic is found as a contaminant it is usually present in either the form of arsenite [As(III)] or arsenate [As(V)] (Smedley and Kinniburgh, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Since As(III) is the most detrimental to human health (Hughes, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), it would seem a good strategy to engineer an organism able to oxidize As(III) to the &#8220;safer&#8221; As(V), and indeed a number of efforts have focused on oxidation (Kao et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, As(V) is sensitive to pH changes (Smedley and Kinniburgh, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), so it is possible for a formerly &#8220;de-contaminated&#8221; site to become unsafe again as As(V) reverts to As(III). In addition, As(V) itself is toxic as it can be accidentally incorporated in place of phosphate by biological systems (Saltikov and Olson, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), inhibiting glycolysis and phosphorylation (Sung et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Therefore converting arsenic into its elemental, insoluble As(0) form may be the safest route to detoxification, despite the requirement to reduce As(V) to As(III) as a necessary step to achieving As(0).</p><p>In order to do this, we engineered a bacterium to remove arsenic using a synthetic biology approach to create a modular genetic construct containing genes involved in arsenic resistance. The effects of each module were investigated with the removal of parts as required. To this end, we have investigated a number of arsenic-resistance genes from the anaerobic bacterium <italic>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</italic> strain G20 (Li and Krumholz, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), both singly and in combination, by transforming them into <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The <italic>D. alaskensis</italic> genes are the arsenate reductases ArsC1, ArsC2 and ArsC3, the arsenic efflux pump ArsB, and the Ars operon repressor protein ArsR (used in conjunction with the repressible Ars operon promoter).</p><p>We have also included the modular use of a phytochelatin analog, EC20 (Bae et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) ([Glu-Cyt]<sub>20</sub>-Gly). Phytochelatins are metal-chelating peptides, produced enzymatically in plants, which are capable of binding to a number of heavy metals and metalloids, including arsenic (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Phytochelatin synthetase has been successfully expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, allowing the cells to produce nanoparticles of a number of different metals, including CdZn, CdSe, CdTe, and SeZn (Park et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, we chose to use EC20, a synthetic phytochelatin, directly translated from mRNA rather than made enzymatically. It has previously been expressed in bacteria to chelate a number of heavy metals, including cadmium (Bae et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), mercury (Bae et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), zinc, lead, copper, nickel, and molybdenum (Biondo et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Encoding EC20 in this way, and not using an enzyme to produce it, allowed us to localize it to the outer membrane of the cell by attaching EC20 to the membrane-spanning domain of IgA protease from <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (referred to as EC20/IgA). We have tested these components both separately and as part of a unified, modular arsenic-resistance/removal plasmid. We have demonstrated that our engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> is able to not only tolerate high levels of arsenic, but is also able to convert the arsenic to an insoluble elemental form, removing large amounts of arsenic from solution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Strains and Plasmids</title><p>The vector pArsC1 is based on the pUC19 plasmid; pUC19 and pArsC1 confer ampicillin resistance. pEC20 is based on pHE&#946;, ultimately derived from the pAK100 vector (Krebber et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>); pHE&#946; and pEC20 confer chloramphenicol resistance. pArsRBCC is based on pUC57-Kan; pUC57-Kan and pArsRBCC confer kanamycin resistance.

This can be attributed to <italic>E. coli</italic>&#8217;s native arsenic resistance mechanism encoded on an operon and containing the genes <italic>arsRDABC</italic> (Carlin et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). To supplement this natural arsenic resistance three plasmids were introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, each carrying additional arsenic-resistance genes, namely pArsC1, pEC20, and pArsRBCC. pArsC1 and pArsRBCC encode arsenic-resistance genes from the anaerobic bacterium <italic>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</italic>; pArsC1 contains the arsenate reductase <italic>arsC1</italic> (accession no.

The DNA sequence of EC20 is immediately followed by that of the membrane domain of IgA protease from <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (accession no.

Taking this high-oxygen background into account, along with the overall composition of this area (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E), the most likely composition of the large surface-bound structures is primarily metallic As(0), with an oxidized outer layer.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>EDX analysis of large cell surface-bound arsenic structures produced by pEC20 &amp; pArsRBCC (p2 + 3) cells (A) TEM image of cell with bound arsenic; (B) close-up of analyzed area; (C) green box indicates where beam was placed, red box indicates where background reading was taken; (D) atomic% from X-ray spectra, last reading (5:95 As:O) indicates background reading of support material; (E) summed X-ray spectrum from the analyzed region showing all elements present</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fbioe-03-00160-g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="S3-3"><title>Modular Construct</title><p>While the outer membrane located phytochelatin EC20 encoded on the plasmid pEC20 confers a high degree of arsenic resistance to cells, nanofiber formation is observed only when it is paired with pArsRBCC. Therefore we decided to combine these useful genetic elements into a single construct using DNA synthesis to codon-optimize genes for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), producing the plasmid pArs. In addition, the <italic>E. coli</italic> ArsR (accession no.

However, this new construct had a detrimental effect on growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). OD<sub>600</sub> measurements overestimated the number of colony forming units (CFUs) present, and even in the absence of arsenic cells were not dividing correctly. This was corrected through a tightening of operon expression by the addition of the lac operator, which was inserted into the Ars promoter downstream of the ArsR binding site.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Cells containing pArs after 16&#8201;h incubation at 37&#176;C; <bold>(B)</bold> comparison of WT cells with pArs and pArs_lac cells, with and without IPTG induction, at various arsenic concentrations after 16&#8201;h incubation at 37&#176;C and <bold>(C)</bold> after 3&#8201;days of incubation at 25&#176;C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fbioe-03-00160-g005"/></fig><p>Use of the lac operator immediately improved the growth rate in liquid culture of cells containing pArs_lac compared to pArs, with pArs_lac showing more CFUs than pArs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). On plates containing 0.1&#8201;mM IPTG the pArs_lac colonies are smaller than those of the control cells and the colony density slightly reduced, although pArs_lac cells still outperform pArs cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). Pre-induction treatment to allow cells to express arsenic-resistant proteins prior to arsenic exposure did not impact upon the number or morphology of colonies at lower arsenic concentrations, although higher IPTG pre-induction concentrations were deleterious. However, at high arsenic concentrations, of 60&#8201;mM and above, only pre-induced cells showed colony growth suggesting pre-induction is required for survival at high arsenic concentrations.</p><p>Strains containing the induced pArs_lac did not exhibit the same level of arsenate resistance as pEC20 cells but did show the same level of resistance as p2&#8201;+&#8201;3 cells, showing growth at 80&#8201;mM sodium arsenate after 3&#8201;days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). Thus, the lac operator only reduces the negative effects of EC20 over-expression but, while the cells grow more slowly, they are able to tolerate higher arsenic concentrations.</p><p>Systematic deletion of modules from the pArs_lac construct produced changes in the level of arsenic resistance afforded to the cells. Tested here were the removal of ArsC2 (&#916;C2) and ArsC3 (&#916;C3), both individually and together (&#916;C2&#8201;+&#8201;&#916;C3), and EC20/IgA fusion protein (&#916;EC20/IgA). While all the deletion mutants show improved growth compared to the pArs_lac strain after 16&#8201;h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A), when sodium arsenate is present the &#916;C2, &#916;C3, and &#916;C2&#8201;+&#8201;C3 mutants all showed similar growth to pArs_lac with a maximum tolerance of 30&#8201;mM sodium arsenate, with &#916;EC20/IgA showing the highest colony density of all the strains tested here. After 3&#8201;days incubation &#916;EC20/IgA displays greater apparent resistance to sodium arsenate than the pArs_lac and other mutant strains with the highest colony density at 80&#8201;mM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B), likely due to a relaxation of growth restraints on the cells caused by EC20/IgA affecting cell division rather than an increased ability to deal with the sodium arsenate. While the &#916;EC20/IgA mutation improves the growth of the pArs_lac strain it does not compensate for the resistance to arsenic afforded by EC20/IgA expression at lower levels, as p2&#8201;+&#8201;3 still shows the highest colony density at 80&#8201;mM sodium arsenate of the investigated variants.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold><italic>E. coli</italic> pArs_lac deletion variants gown on agar plates containing varying concentrations of sodium arsenate after (A) 16&#8201;h and (B) 3&#8201;days of incubation</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fbioe-03-00160-g006"/></fig></sec><sec id="S3-4"><title>Quantification of Arsenic Removal</title><p>Quantification of nanoparticle synthesis was determined through measuring the sodium arsenate removal by cells using ICP&#8211;OES. The arsenic concentration was measured after the cells had been removed from the samples by centrifugation and filtering (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results show that resistance to arsenic does not directly determine the amount of arsenic removed; pEC20 is able to survive sodium arsenate concentrations in excess of 80&#8201;mM and yet only removes around 1.3% of the arsenic, compared with pArsRBCC which has a maximum resistance of only 50&#8201;mM and which removes 6.9%. Ultracentrifugation of the samples increases the amount of arsenic removed but only for some of the strains. ICP&#8211;OES analysis of pET28b (as a control vector conferring kanamycin resistance) and pEC20 &amp; pArsRBCC (p2&#8201;+&#8201;3) cells shows that while ultracentrifugation has little effect on the pET28b samples the amount of arsenic removed for the p2&#8201;+&#8201;3 strain is increased to 16% on average (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), and in individual cases this has been observed as being as high as 22% arsenic removal.

This may form part of their arsenic-resistance mechanism; by converting soluble, toxic arsenic into an insoluble form attached to the cell it is no longer able to enter the cell and cause damage. The current proposed mechanism for the action of the <italic>E. coli</italic> arsenic-resistance operon, ArsRDABC, involves the uptake of As(V) by the cell, reduction of As(V) to As(III) by ArsC, and the efflux of As(III) <italic>via</italic> the efflux pump/ATPase pair ArsAB (Saltikov and Olson, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Further processing this arsenic into the insoluble, surface-bound As(0) detected in this study would increase arsenic resistance. Accumulation of nanoparticles at the cell surface, as observed with other metal-resistant bacteria (Capeness et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), is a component of the bacterial metal ion resistance mechanism. With our engineered strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> containing pArs_lac and pEC20 &amp; pArsRBCC (p2&#8201;+&#8201;3) the cells take this mechanism to an extreme, producing very large As(0) structures, stabilizing large amounts of As and removing it from the solution.</p><p>The phytochelatin analog EC20, when expressed at the cell surface as EC20/IgA, increases the arsenic resistance of <italic>E. coli</italic>, so that after 3&#8201;days of incubation there is no difference between cells grown on plates containing no arsenic and those grown in 30&#8201;mM sodium arsenate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The resistance mechanism employed here may involve the binding of As(V) to EC20/IgA, thereby lowering the effective arsenic concentration and giving the cells more time in which to process As(V) into As(III), and on to As(0). pArsC1 and pArsRBCC also increase resistance to sodium arsenate, but to a lesser extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). While all three plasmids individually increase sodium arsenate resistance when they are paired together they prove somewhat detrimental to the cells with all three possible combinations slightly reducing growth levels in the absence of sodium arsenate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This is most likely due to the increase in the protein expression load, with the cells overexpressing both the proteins of interest and two different antibiotic resistance proteins. In the presence of sodium arsenate, the resistance offered by the vectors outweighs the negative effects of the increased load, with pArsC1 &amp; pArsRBCC (p1&#8201;+&#8201;3) slightly increasing and pEC20 &amp; pArsRBCC (p2&#8201;+&#8201;3) greatly increasing arsenate resistance compared to the wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), although pEC20 by itself still confers the greatest level of resistance.</p><p>Arsenic resistance, however, does not directly correlate with nanoparticle production; while pEC20 cells are able to survive high sodium arsenate concentrations the cells do not produce the large arsenic structures nor the fibers seen with pEC20 &amp; pArsRBCC (p2&#8201;+&#8201;3) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and therefore the presence of the proteins encoded on pArsRBCC is a requirement for particle production. Similarly resistance does not directly influence the strains&#8217; ability to remove arsenic from a solution (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>); there is a balance between the beneficial effects of the introduced proteins on arsenic resistance and the increased cost to the cells in producing them, and there are also the interactions of the various proteins influencing arsenic resistance and nanoparticle formation. The possible mechanism for the production of the large As(0) structures is that EC20/IgA may be acting as a &#8220;holding area&#8221; for excess arsenic, allowing the cells to survive in very high sodium arsenate concentrations; when present, the overexpressed genes of pArsRBCC then act to rapidly convert large amounts of As(V) into As(III) and export it from the cell, with further conversion to As(0) and its attachment to the cell surface. This rapid processing allows much larger structures to form compared to the control cells over the same amount of time. As analogs of these proteins are found in the genome of <italic>E.&#8201;coli</italic> it may be that if allowed to continue for a sufficient length of time pEC20 cells would also show the larger surface-bound structure, with EC20/IgA preventing damage to the cell in the meantime. EC20/IgA may also play a role in promoting the formation of the large surface-bound As(0) structures and/or nanofibers by p2&#8201;+&#8201;3 cells, acting as nucleation points for the exported As(III) and facilitating its conversion to As(0).</p><p>In creating the modular construct, it was found that it had a detrimental effect on cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). This is likely mostly due to the over-expression of EC20/IgA; as it is located at the cell membrane large amounts of the protein could be interfering with cell division, causing the elongated morphology seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A. This occurs even though the Ars operon repressor ArsR was included in the construct to allow for expression only when arsenic is present. Putting the lac operator sequence into the promoter to supplement ArsR greatly improves the growth of the cells, having around the same growth as the control cells after 3&#8201;days when no IPTG is present, and still allowing the cells to survive concentrations of arsenate up to 80&#8201;mM when they are induced with 0.1&#8201;mM IPTG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C).</p><p>Modularizing the components of the arsenic resistance pathway has allowed us to investigate the role of these modules in arsenic resistance. The systematic module deletions demonstrated the detrimental effect of protein over-expression from the whole construct, as when ArsC2, ArsC3 (singly and together), and Ec20/IgA are deleted there is an improvement in cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These deletion variants also demonstrated that using the native <italic>E. coli</italic> ArsR repressor and Ars operon promoter sequences have a significant effect on arsenic resistance. The &#916;EC20/IgA mutation in effect gives the cells a similar genotype to the pArsRBCC strain, but while pArsRBCC uses the <italic>D. alaskensis</italic> ArsR and Ars promoter sequences with a maximum arsenate resistance of 50&#8201;mM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), pArs_lac_&#916;EC20/IgA is ameliorated for use in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and showed growth at 80&#8201;mM sodium arsenate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In addition, the data show ArsC3 is more important than ArsC2 in arsenic resistance, as &#916;C3 cells show less resistance to sodium arsenate than the &#916;C2 strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Taken together, these data will allow us to optimize the construct to maximize arsenic resistance while minimizing the detrimental effects of protein over-expression.</p><p>The modularized pArs_lac vector provides easy adaptability. If, for example, contamination to be remediated is known to contain only As(III), and not As(V), then the reductase genes could be removed to reduce the protein expression load on the cells. Similarly, if a different metal was to be investigated, the arsenic-specific components could be switched for others specific to the new contaminant. While pArs_lac (with 0.1&#8201;mM IPTG) displays lower growth than p2&#8201;+&#8201;3 at 80&#8201;mM sodium arsenate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C), pArs_lac offers the greatest degree of flexibility owing to its modular nature; as the most desired aspect of the construct is utility rather than maximum arsenate resistance it is pArs_lac that will be the focus of future work. The modularity also has the advantage of that in the future our construct can be further adapted to dealing with other metals and metalloids.</p><p>Using a biological approach to arsenic remediation offers a number of advantages over other chemical or mechanical methods. By using living organisms, it is very straightforward to replace or increase the amount of bioremediating material as the cells can be grown in normal growth media, reducing material costs; in addition, the nature of living organisms makes them almost infinitely adaptable, something we can further use to our advantage by applying the engineering principals of synthetic biology in our modification of the bacteria. Our work has also created new tools for the bioremediation of arsenic by utilizing previously studied proteins in new ways. Phytochelatin, for example, has been investigated in remediation or nanoparticle production contexts due to its affinity for many different heavy metals and metalloids (Park et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Singh et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); in many of these cases the protein is expressed inside the cell, but we have hybridized it with the membrane-spanning protein IgA, allowing it to be transported to the outside of the cell. When combined synergistically with other proteins in our work, this results in <italic>E.&#8201;coli</italic> strains that tolerate high levels of arsenic and which are able to convert arsenic ions into large, stable As(0) structures. Having the arsenic on the outside of the cell rather than internally may mean that the cell is able to handle higher amounts of arsenic, as well as survive longer, potentially allowing more arsenic to be removed using our method.</p><p>We have demonstrated that our engineered arsenic-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain is able to survive high levels of sodium arsenate, up to 80&#8201;mM, and can remove significant amounts of the arsenic by converting it into stable, insoluble metallic As(0). Our modularized plasmid allows the activity of the strain to be tuned for purpose, being able to add or remove modules as required, providing a flexible way of removing arsenic from a number of waste sources.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>ME and LH designed experiments.
