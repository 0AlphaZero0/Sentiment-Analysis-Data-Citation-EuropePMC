Many marine species have a benthic sessile adult phase and disperse <italic>via</italic> a planktonic larval stage. In these organisms, high gene flow between populations can be ensured by high larval dispersal, high fecundity and huge population sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, paradoxical levels of genetic differentiation has been observed in marine populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] originating from either local adaptation through natural selection or purely random processes such as genetic drift. In this context, marine invasive species offer the opportunity to study evolution and adaptation of life history traits upon introduction into new habitats<italic>.</italic></p><p>Originating from Northeast Asia, the Pacific oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> has been introduced and translocated worldwide, mainly for aquaculture purposes. Self-sustaining populations have today been recorded in at least 17 of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although highly variable, the invasiveness of <italic>C. gigas</italic> has been demonstrated in several countries and this species is considered as pest or noxious in an increasing number of coastal areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In European waters, <italic>C. gigas</italic> is cultured from Norway to Portugal as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. This species rapidly settled along the Atlantic coasts of France following its massive introduction at the end of the 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. More recently, feral populations of <italic>C. gigas</italic> have been reported in northern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as far north as Sweden, where dense populations of settled oysters can now be observed in several shallow water sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This expansion of Pacific oyster in the North Sea occurred much later after their first introduction than along the French Atlantic coast, suggesting that increase in population size may have been retarded by false or irregular recruitment depending on water temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Irregular recruitment has been reported to coincide with above-average summer temperatures in late summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>C. gigas</italic> now reproduce and settle in Scandinavian waters as far as 60&#176; N, while in the beginning of the 70&#8217;s, attempts of culture of this species failed at higher latitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this context, the success of the species and especially its northward expansion might be explained by climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but also local adaptation as well as phenotypic plasticity, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>History of initial introductions and later transfers, natural connectivity resulting from natural dispersal and their resulting genetic structure are needed to assess the potential local adaptation of newly settled populations (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). Moehler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] proposed that the genetic population structure of <italic>C. gigas</italic> in the Wadden sea could have been shaped by aquaculture practices. The presence of two separate genetic groups, one in the southern and one in the northern Wadden sea was suggested to be the result of two independent invasions. Rohfritsch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] investigated the possible effect of adaptation with a genome-scan approach. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], no significant genetic structure was noted when comparing the population from Japan to European populations sampled along the French coasts and between populations of southern Europe. However, a significant genetic structure was observed in Europe among northern populations (located in Germany, Denmark and Sweden) and between northern and southern populations, together with lower genetic diversity in the north. Recently, Lallias et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] highlighted how the number of oyster introduction events, aquaculture practices, genetic bottlenecks followed by genetic drift and natural dispersal could shape the genetic diversity and structure of introduced populations. Furthermore the analysis of F<sub>ST</sub> outliers revealed 6 candidate loci for adaptation which could either reflect (i) parallel adaptation to similar environmental pressures (fjord-like environment) within each of the two groups or (ii) a footprint of a secondary introduction of an alternative genomic background, maintained by multifarious isolation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This suggests that adaptation or reshuffling of pre-existing genetic backgrounds could have occurred during the invasion. In general, however, genome scans with an insufficient marker density have proved unsatisfactory to identify adaptation during marine invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and the study of phenotypic differentiation has been proposed as a more promising approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Colonization of new environments may promote rapid population divergence as a by-product of local adaptation to differential selective pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Local adaptation in populations can be examined by analysing phenotypic traits that are likely to be differentially selected in the wild, but genetic bases of trait variation are necessary to allow response to natural selection. In most cases, the heritability estimates of these traits are low and their study requires the analysis under common conditions of progenies of wild genitors (rather than their direct study in the field), allowing disentangling environmental and genetic effects. In this context, gene expression studies can reveal adaptive mechanism, and the genetic basis of traits affecting fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, comparing the extent of quantitative genetic differences of phenotypic traits among populations could be assessed by the degree of differentiation in quantitative traits Q<sub>ST</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] that has been widely used to assess the relative contributions of selection to phenotypic traits divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and gene transcription profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Transcriptomic scan (eQ<sub>ST</sub>) can indeed reveal adaptation, as outlier genes, showing the highest levels of differentiation between populations, will represent those that are most likely to evolve under directional selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Conversely, P<sub>ST</sub> (differentiation phenotypic traits) and eP<sub>ST</sub> scan can reveal selective selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In a context of climate change facilitating the establishment of invasive species, transcriptomic studies are promising in understanding basis of variation in phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>In this study we set out to investigate the evolutionary processes associated with the establishment and invasion into new environments of Pacific oyster population. Specifically, we raised progenies originating from Northern and Southern Europe along with their hybrids under common environmental conditions. A number of phenotypic traits, including gene expression patterns were analysed to search for evidence of differentiation in reproductive traits that might result from local adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biological material</title><p>Wild oysters were collected in October 2009 at the Ile de R&#233; (France) and Limfjord (Denmark), transported to the Ifremer&#8217;s facilities in La Tremblade (Charente-Maritime, France) and kept in common controlled conditions. The sampling site in France is located 30&#160;km from the location &#8220;MAR&#8221; that was studied by Rohfritsch et al.

Maturation was carried in shared conditions suitable for germ cell maturation according to Fabioux et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] in Ifremer&#8217;s facilities in La Tremblade. In May 2010, crosses within and between populations were produced, using 40 parental individuals (20 females and 20 males) from each of the two populations. For the hybrid progeny, the same individuals were employed as parental oysters as for the within site ones, crossing French males with Danish females. Gametes were collected as described in Huvet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Briefly, sperm and oocytes were collected in seawater by stripping the gonads. For the two groups of females, oocytes were counted and equally pooled. Oocytes were then distributed in fertilization beakers and then fertilized separately by each male at a ratio of 100 spermatozoa/oocyte.</p><p>Progenies were reared under standard and common hatchery and nursery conditions. In October 2010, when about 10&#160;mm large, juveniles were transferred to the field in the Marennes-Ol&#233;ron basin until sampling in June 2011. For each progeny (&#8220;French&#8221;, &#8220;Danish&#8221; and &#8220;hybrid&#8221;), 100 oysters were randomly collected (in 4 replicated baskets) and weighed (total and wet flesh weights).

Contributions of genes to RDA axis 2 were retrieved in order to identify individual transcripts that contribute the most.

Despite strong difference in expression levels between sexes, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], we nonetheless detected a clear difference in expression levels between progenies of oysters originated from France and Denmark, and their hybrids. From the RDA approach on microarrays we found that 4.3&#160;% of the explained variance is ascribed by the progeny in a mainly orthogonal way to sex differences, which means that despite the huge transcriptomic differences between sexes, the more modest differences between progenies proved to be mainly independent of the sex. Only characters being heritable could allow adaptation because significant genetic bases of trait variation (rather than only phenotypic plasticity) are necessary to allow response to eventual natural selection. In our study, the use of hybrid progeny allowed to identify transcripts presumed to show additive genetic variation. In the RDA the hybrid progeny appeared intermediate between French and Danish, and 50&#160;% of the transcripts contributing the most to RDA2 axis proved to behave mainly additively. Our analyses allowed us to obtain a list of candidate genes, the expression of which might have reflected adaptation during invasion or were already genetically differentiated in the founding populations. By the way overall microarray features, only a very limited proportion of the total genes showed intermediate values in hybrids. The extensive non additivity of the transcriptome has been observed in Drosophila (Gibson et al. &lt;2&#160;%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]) and maize (Auger et al., ~30&#160;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) in contrast with the classical assumption in quantitative genetics of predominately additive genetics effects. Furthermore, a low proportion (2&#160;%) of additive patterns of gene expression was previously observed by transcriptomic analysis in larvae of partially inbred Pacific oyster populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Finally, another study on oyster showed the non-additive nature of genetic variance for fitness-related traits and that the non-additive genetic component of yield is often the largest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, by focusing on a population likely to have adapted to a new environment during invasion (Denmark), we have access to the adaptation filter on phenotypic evolution and uncover additively behaving traits (intermediate expression in hybrids) in the subset of transcripts that are the most differentially expressed. Interestingly, Wendling and Wegner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] recently investigated the adaptive potential of North Sea <italic>C. gigas</italic> populations to local Vibrio spp., proposing that dominantly inherited resistance could facilitate fast adaptation.</p><p>In our study, ANOVA and eP<sub>ST</sub> analyses gave complementary results on phenotypic traits differentiation between the Danish and the French progenies. The majority of the mRNA differentially expressed in the ANOVA analysis was not in common with eP<sub>ST</sub> analysis. This could be explained by the fact that eP<sub>ST</sub> estimates were only performed on transcripts showing additive patterns and that most of the eP<sub>ST</sub> outliers did not have a high p-value in the ANOVA analysis. Roberge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], who find similar discordant results between ANOVA and Q<sub>ST</sub> estimates on salmon, suggested evolution as consequence of selection but without an additive genetic basis for these traits. eP<sub>ST</sub> estimates performed separately on males and females, demonstrates that considering sexes separately, when sex effect is so strong on gene expression patterns like in in gonads, could help in highlighting new candidates. Furthermore, this suggests that sex-dependent adaptation might be involved in the observed genetically-based phenotypic and transcriptomic variations of reproductive traits, supported by an increasing evidence of a role for sex differentiated effects in the architecture of complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Sex interaction effects are common in model organisms for a wide range of traits, and can often explain a substantial part of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>In males, functional annotation of outlier eP<sub>ST</sub> estimates pinpointed mRNA encoding proteins involved in sperm motility. The A-kinase anchor protein 7 isoform gamma [Genbank:AM866859], identified as outlier eP<sub>ST</sub> both in males and females and more expressed in Danish progeny, is a A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAPs) promoting the selective sequestration of intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) involved in epithelial sodium channel regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].This protein has been suggested to have additional and perhaps unique function in spermatozoa as a scaffolding protein for the Rho-GTPase pathway that regulates sperm motility. Furthermore, Kington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] found high expression levels of proteins having an important role in sperm motility of <italic>C. gigas</italic> involved in Rho signalling pathways. Sperm motility is commonly used as criteria of male gamete quality linked with the fertilization success and therefore potentially favouring colonization of new habitats. Furthermore, Filamin-A [Genbank:CU686267], more expressed in Danish progeny, is an Actin-binding protein that participates in the anchoring of membrane proteins for the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in sperm morphogenesis in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Finally, as cells protection against oxidative injury in marine invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], Alternative oxidase (AOX, [Genbank:BQ426710]), more expressed in Danish progeny, may have a role in oxidative protection in gonads, and potentially in gamete quality. In females, the Molluscan insulin-related peptide 5 [Genbank:CU987248] was more expressed in Danish progeny. In mammals, the role of insulin pathway in fertility is well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and in fish the insulin pathway has been positively associated to gamete quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In <italic>C. gigas</italic>, an Insulin-related peptide receptor has previously been identified in oysters by Gricourt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] as well as several factors of the insulin signalling pathway. Jouaux et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] found that insulin pathway elements can modulate germinal cells proliferation during food deprivation in the first stages of gametogenesis with expected consequences on fertility.</p><p>A comparison of divergence in neutral markers, F<sub>ST</sub>, to divergence in phenotypic traits, Q<sub>ST</sub>, has widely been used as a method to assess the relative strength of genetic drift and selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The Q<sub>ST</sub> levels typically exceed that observed in F<sub>ST</sub> suggesting an important role of natural selection on quantitative traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In our study, we did not have access to Q<sub>ST</sub> values but we restricted P<sub>ST</sub> values to additively behaving transcript with intermediate expression levels in hybrid. We found that mean eP<sub>ST</sub> (0.04) was similar to the estimated F<sub>ST</sub> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] on the same populations, while the outliers eP<sub>ST</sub> had values greater than 0.15. Our results therefore suggest that diversifying selection has most probably acted on outlier gene expressions. Finally, gene expression can also be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms, potentially in a transgenerational manner, meaning in a way, by genetic mechanisms non-DNA dependents. There are yet only a few papers studying epigenetics in oysters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and this is clearly an emerging topic. Moreover, few studies until now focused on epigenetic-mediated adaptation in invasive species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sex-ratio and population expansion</title><p>In our study, we observed a female biased sex-ratio in the Danish progeny. Sex-ratio biased to female in invasive species has also been observed in an estuarine shrimp, <italic>Palaemon macrodactylus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and was proposed as a good descriptor to detect invading populations in signal crayfish, <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Although sex determinism in <italic>C. gigas</italic>, an alternative and irregular protandrous hermaphrodite, is complex, it seems to be determined both by environmental and genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In our study, environmental effects were minimized by rearing progenies in common garden conditions, indicating that the observed differences in sex-ratio are genetically based. However interactions with environmental conditions have been suggested to result from regulatory pathways involved in sex determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Two genetic models have been proposed for sex determinism in <italic>C. gigas</italic>. The first suggests the presence of 2-genotypes, a dominant male M allele and a protandric recessive F allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The second propose a 3-genotypes model, FF for true female oysters, MM for true male oysters and FM for individuals that may mature as females or males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Furthermore, an energy-mediated sex determinism was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], in which sex-ratio could be a possible way to select faster-growing populations when more females are produced in the first year of the life. The greater condition index observed in the Danish progeny could translate a greater reproductive effort in this new-expanded Danish population. This index is strictly correlated to ripeness and gonadal occupation production during gametogenesis in oysters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In species like <italic>C. gigas</italic>, having an &#8220;r&#8221; demographical strategy, characterized by high fecundity, reproductive success is greatly dependent on the quantity of gametes produced, especially oocytes, as well as their quality. Furthermore, Cardoso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] found that in Northern European locations, oysters produce smaller eggs in larger quantities, suggesting an increasing reproductive output. The authors proposed that, since smaller oocytes are thought to have a longer development time, the environmental conditions along the Northern European coasts may result in increased larval dispersal and possibly in further population expansion. In this context, a greater reproductive effort together with a female-biased sex-ratio in <italic>C. gigas</italic> could favour a rapid colonization of new habitats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, genetic differentiation previously reported between <italic>C. gigas</italic> Southern Europe populations and population north to the Wadden Sea is corroborated by phenotypic differentiation based on transcriptomic data, biased sex-ratio and condition index. Overall, our results suggest a population expansion strategy of the studied Pacific oyster Danish population, potentially relying on a females-biased sex-ratio, a greater reproduction effort and gamete quality, noticeable on molecular signatures.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p>Microarray data are deposited in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository with the accession number GSE66103 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66103">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE66103</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All the experiments were conducted according to the regulations of local and central government, and the study protocol was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2015_1972_MOESM1_ESM.r" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
