An understanding of the molecular basis for this heterogeneity could lead to significant improvements in both monitoring and treatment. During chronic infection the process of T cell exhaustion inhibits the immune response, facilitating viral persistence<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. We show that a transcriptional signature reflecting CD8 T cell exhaustion is associated with poor clearance of chronic viral infection, but conversely predicts better prognosis in multiple autoimmune diseases. The development of CD8 T cell exhaustion during chronic infection is driven by both persistence of antigen and a lack of accessory &#8216;help&#8217; signals. In autoimmunity, we found that where evidence of CD4 T cell costimulation was pronounced, that of CD8 T cell exhaustion was reduced. We could reproduce the exhaustion signature by modifying the balance of persistent TCR stimulation and specific CD2-induced costimulation provided to human CD8 T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that each process plays a role in dictating outcome in autoimmune disease. The &#8220;non-exhausted&#8221; T cell state driven by CD2-induced costimulation was reduced by signals through the exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor PD-1, suggesting that induction of exhaustion may be a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Using expression of optimal surrogate markers of costimulation/exhaustion signatures in independent datasets, we confirmed an association with good clinical outcome or response to therapy in infection (hepatitis C virus (HCV)), and vaccination (yellow fever, malaria, influenza) but poor outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes (T1D), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)). Thus, T cell exhaustion plays a central role in determining outcome in autoimmune disease and targeted manipulation of this process could lead to new therapeutic opportunities.</p><p id="P3">In a complex set of data such as the transcriptome, similar measurements may be grouped together by network analysis to form discrete modules that can highlight novel pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of complex diseases. We have previously shown that a CD8 T cell transcriptional signature in patients with multiple immune-mediated diseases can predict a subsequent relapsing disease<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, the biology underlying this observation was not clear. We therefore applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> to the transcriptomes of purified CD4 and CD8 T cells isolated from a prospective cohort of 44 AAV patients with active, untreated disease<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) to further explore the mechanisms driving relapsing autoimmunity. Modules of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, rows) were summarized as &#8216;eigengene&#8217; profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, F</xref>) that were correlated with clinical variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, I</xref>, columns) and visualized in the form of a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, I</xref>). Modules derived from both CD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>) and CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 F-I</xref>) T cell transcriptomes showed strong correlation with disease outcome but not activity, and were co- correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) despite being mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). A similar analysis using a cohort of 23 SLE patients also presenting with active, untreated disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Data Table 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> identified analogous CD8 and CD4 T cell expression modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) that again correlated with clinical outcome but not disease activity. By contrast a type 1 interferon response signature was associated with disease activity but not with long-term outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2F</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Next, we reasoned that genes within co-correlated modules in related cell types might inform the biology of relapsing disease. By selecting CD4 T cell modules showing significant, strong correlation with relapse rate and performing network enrichment analysis we identified a module corresponding to CD4 T cell costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figs. 1F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">4</xref>). By way of validation we repeated this analysis using an independent co-expression network algorithm that similarly demonstrated association between a CD4 costimulation module and clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The independent association of modular signatures with clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, I</xref>) was confirmed using multiple linear regression modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3B-E</xref>) and was only apparent during active disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Extended Discussion</xref>). During chronic viral infection CD8 T cell memory responses are exquisitely dependent on CD4 T cell costimulation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which can lead to the resolution of chronic infection in both mice<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and humans<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. When antigen persists in the absence of costimulation CD8 T cells become &#8216;exhausted&#8217;<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, a phenotype characterized by progressive loss of effector function, persistent high expression of inhibitory receptors and profound changes in gene expression, distinct from those seen in effector, memory or anergic T cells<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Although mice lacking inhibitory receptors have an increased incidence and severity of autoimmunity<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> a specific role for exhaustion in dictating the outcome of autoimmune responses has not been demonstrated.</p><p id="P5">We hypothesized that CD4 T cell signals may be important in limiting exhaustion towards persistent <italic>self</italic>-antigen during autoreactive immunity, analogous to responses during persistent infection. We therefore used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>) to test for altered expression of transcriptional signatures reflecting T cell exhaustion (and other T cell-related phenotypes) between patient subgroups defined by the CD8 modular analysis, who go on to develop relapsing or quiescent autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig2A</xref>). Using this approach, we observed that genes specifically downregulated in exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic murine LCMV infection (but not altered in memory, na&#239;ve or effector cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 6</xref><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>) were similarly downregulated in CD8 T cells from patients at low risk of subsequent relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs. 3G-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>).</p><p id="P6">During chronic murine LCMV infection, T cell exhaustion is driven by coordinate upregulation of multiple coinhibitory receptors<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> that signal synergistically to produce a state of generalized immunosuppression<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In autoimmunity, these receptors were not coordinately upregulated as a group. Instead patients with good prognosis from each disease were characterized by upregulation of a distinct subset of exhaustion-associated coinhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig2C</xref>). Although a divergence from the murine LCMV model, T cell exhaustion accompanied by expression of a limited subset of coinhibitory receptors is similar to that described in intratumoral CD8 T cells<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> which are a target for checkpoint therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig.4I</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To confirm whether exhaustion was associated with clinical outcome, we used the murine CD8 T cell exhaustion signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 6</xref><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>) to perform unsupervized hierarchical clustering of three independent cohorts of patients with distinct diseases (AAV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig2. D-F</xref>; SLE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2 G-I</xref>; IBD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 J-L</xref>). In each case this identified a subgroup of patients with both early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, H, K</xref>) and recurrent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F, I, L</xref>) relapses. Whereas CD8 exhaustion was associated with poor outcome in viral infection, in every case it predicted favorable prognosis in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D-L</xref>). Again, independent association with outcome was confirmed using multiple linear regression models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig.3D, E</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that a transcriptional signature of relative CD8 T cell exhaustion, similar to that determining outcome in chronic viral infection and cancer, is apparent during active, untreated disease in patients with favorable long-term outcome in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diagnoses.</p><p id="P8">CD8 T cell exhaustion is characterized by high expression of coinhibitory receptors (such as PD-1<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>) and low expression of nascent memory markers (such as IL7R<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>) and is promoted by both the persistence of antigen<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and a lack of accessory costimulation<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. To understand signals driving exhaustion and outcome in autoimmunity, we attempted to recreate the outcome-associated transcriptional signatures using variable TCR signal duration and costimulation of primary human cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We stimulated purified human CD8 T cells using a magnetic bead conjugated with antibodies targeting costimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and measured expression of IL7R and PD-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5A-G</xref>) as markers indicating an exhausted phenotype. Comparison between persistent (6 days) and transient TCR stimulation (36 hours) showed that IL7R expression returned on a proportion of cells after several divisions when the TCR stimulus was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) but failed to do so if it persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, G</xref>). We then systematically tested whether costimulatory molecules, identified from the CD4 T cell network analysis described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figs. 3A, H-K</xref>), could overcome the effect of persistent TCR stimulation during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation. We found that specific costimulation with anti-CD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E, H</xref>), but not with other stimuli such as IFN&#945; or anti-CD40, resulted in maintained IL7R expression, limited upregulation of PD-1 and enhanced cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5L-O</xref>).</p><p id="P9">While CD8 exhaustion is known to limit viral control during chronic infection, exhausted cells may be restored to useful function by blocking inhibitory signaling through PD-1<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Enhancing coinhibitory signals is therefore a logical therapeutic strategy in autoimmune disease, aiming to facilitate exhaustion despite high levels of costimulation that would otherwise be predicted to result in an aggressive relapsing disease course. To test this concept, primary human CD8 T cells were costimulated during persistent TCR signaling as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) in the presence or absence of a bead-bound Fc-chimeric version of the principal PD-1 ligand, PDL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, F</xref>). When added to CD2-costimulated CD8 T cell cultures, increased PD-1/PDL-1 signaling suppressed differentiation of a non-exhausted IL7R<sup>hi</sup> subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3 F, H, I</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To define the phenotype of T cell exhaustion more robustly, as small numbers of surface markers are insufficient, we analyzed the transcriptome of CD8 T cells exposed to persistent stimulation with and without CD2 signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). This CD2 response signature characterized exhausted cells but not effector or memory subsets (by GSEA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J- L</xref>). Consistent with this, patient clusters generated using the CD2 response signature recreated subgroups similar to those generated using the murine LCMV CD8 exhaustion signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, G, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3M-O</xref>). Thus, CD2 signaling during persistent TCR stimulation of primary human CD8 T cells prevents the development of transcriptional changes characteristic of exhaustion, recreating transcriptional signatures associated with outcome in both viral infection and autoimmunity.</p><p id="P11">To confirm that the transcriptional signatures reflected the development of functional exhaustion <italic>in vitro</italic>, we showed that cells appearing exhausted by surface markers (IL7R<sup>lo</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup>) also expressed markers of apoptotic resistance, characteristic cytokine patterns and showed diminished survival on restimulation (BCL2<sup>lo</sup>IFN&#947;<sup>lo</sup>IL10<sup>hi</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6A-E</xref>). There was no evidence of preferential accumulation of CD8 T cell subsets following CD2-induced costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6F-H</xref>). These data highlight the importance of CD2 signaling in limiting the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion in the face of persistent TCR simulation, and provide a starting point for more sophisticated attempts to therapeutically exhaust an autoimmune response in a targeted fashion.</p><p id="P12">We next aimed to independently validate the association between the balance of CD4 costimulation and CD8 exhaustion with clinical outcome using published datasets. The majority of these profile unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in which T cell-intrinsic signatures are not readily apparent due to the confounding influence of expression from other cell types<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We therefore used a classification algorithm (randomforests) to identify optimal surrogate markers of costimulation/exhaustion modules in PBMC data from autoimmune patients taken concurrently with the T cells described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As the CD8 exhaustion and CD4 costimulation signatures were themselves correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 3G-I</xref>), it became easier to detect their combined signal in PBMC using surrogate markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig.7</xref>). The top-ranked candidate KAT2B is a transcriptional co-activator known to mediate an anti-apoptotic effect under conditions of metabolic stress<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and to increase cellular resistance to cytotoxic compounds<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. These characteristics, along with its high expression in memory and T-follicular helper and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), suggest that it may mark the development of a durable, persistent T cell phenotype promoting long-lived responses in either infection or autoimmunity. The observed association was confirmed by both technical replication (using the same samples run on an independent array platform) and independent validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To test whether similar associations may be apparent in multiple infectious and autoimmune diseases we directly compared expression levels of KAT2B (and of the other top surrogate markers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>) between clinical subgroups defined within published studies for which PBMC expression and linked clinical outcome data were available. Where subgroups were not pre-specified, we compared clinical outcome in groups stratified as having either above or below-median expression of KAT2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C-K</xref>). Hierarchical clustering using all top surrogate markers gave similar stratification to that seen using KAT2B alone, while as expected the separation of patient subgroups varied slightly in different clinical circumstances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 C-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Combined interferon and ribavirin therapy may result in increased virus-specific T cell responses in chronic HCV, although such eradication therapy is successful in only 50% of cases<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and in some cases no change in endogenous immune response is observed<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In a cohort of hepatitis C patients receiving combination therapy, KAT2B expression was progressively induced and showed significantly greater induction in patients ultimately responding to therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10A</xref>). In a clinical trial of malaria vaccination<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> high KAT2B expression identified a subgroup with response rates of 78%, almost twice that seen in the low response group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10B-D</xref>). Moreover, response to vaccination for either influenza<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10E-F</xref>) or yellow fever<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>) could be predicted by stratifying recipients based on their expression of KAT2B following vaccine exposure. Dengue viral infection can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection or self-limiting fever (uncomplicated dengue, UD) to hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Consistent with our observations in autoimmunity, we observed that KAT2B expression was elevated in patients developing the excessive inflammatory response of DHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">We next asked whether surrogate detection of T cell costimulation/exhaustion modules could predict progression of other autoimmune diseases. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by both autoantibodies and autoreactive CD4 T cells<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In a cohort of 75 IPF patients<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> high expression of KAT2B predicted subsequent progression to transplantation or death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). We also observed that PBMC Kat2b expression was elevated in the murine NOD model of T1D<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> with levels rising sharply during the T cell initiation phase, long before the onset of diabetic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10G</xref>). In a cohort of samples taken prospectively from children at high risk of disease but prior to its onset<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> expression of KAT2B was seen to specifically and progressively rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I-K</xref>) both in patients who progressed to T1D and in those who developed islet-cell autoantibodies.</p><p id="P16">We show that the balance between costimulatory and coinhibitory signals that shape T cell exhaustion coincide with opposite clinical outcomes during autoreactive and anti-viral immunity. This at once allows prediction of outcome during infection and autoimmunity and creates the potential for targeted therapeutic exhaustion of an autoimmune response in those predicted to follow an aggressive disease course. That this association is apparent in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases emphasizes the importance of signals shaping T cell exhaustion in driving risk of relapse or recurrence (prognosis) rather than disease susceptibility (diagnosis) or immediate severity (disease activity), and suggests that targeted manipulation of these processes may lead to new treatment strategies that extend beyond the conditions discussed here.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S2"><title>Patients</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="P17">Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Cambridge Local Research</p><p id="P18">Ethics Committee (REC reference numbers 04/023, 08/H0306/21,08/H0308/176) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects enrolled.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="S4"><title>AAV patients</title><p id="P19">59 AAV patients attending or referred to the specialist vasculitis unit at Addenbrooke&#8217;s hospital, Cambridge, UK between July 2004 and May 2008 were enrolled into the present study.

We applied network and pathway enrichment analysis to genes comprising these modules to determine whether they may have any biological relevance. Briefly, for network analysis genes from a specified target set of interest are progressively linked together based on a measure of their interconnection, which is derived from described functional interactions. Additional highly interconnected genes that are absent from the target genes (open symbols) may be added to complete a network of arbitrary size (set at n = 35). Networks may be ranked by significance which reflects the probability of randomly generating a network of similar size from genes included in the full knowledge database containing at least as many target genes as in the network in question. For pathways analysis, the overrepresentation of canonical pathways (pre-defined, well-characterized metabolic and signaling pathways curated from extensive literature reviews) amongst a specified set of target genes is assessed, with significance determined by computing a Fisher&#8217;s exact test with false discovery rate correction for multiple testing.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)</title><p id="P52">GSEA<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> was used to further assess whether specific biological pathways or signatures were significantly enriched between patient subgroups identified by gene modules (as opposed to testing for enrichment of pathways within modules themselves as outlined in the previous section).

In brief, all genes are ranked based on their differential expression between two groups then an enrichment score (ES) is calculated for a given gene set based on how often its members appear at the top or bottom of the ranked differential list. 1000 random permutations of the phenotypic subgroups were used to establish a null distribution of ES against which a normalized enrichment score (NES) and FDR-corrected q values were calculated.

Although signatures apparent in purified T cell transcriptome data correlate with clinical outcome, they cannot be similarly detected in data derived from PBMC due to the confounding influence of expression from other cell types nor can the same genes be used to predict outcome in PBMC<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, as CD4 T cell co-stimulation and CD8 T cell exhaustion signatures themselves showed close correlation we hypothesized that this would amplify the signal detectable in PBMC and that detection of the combined CD4/CD8 T cell response may be feasible. The availability of both separated T cell and PBMC data from the same patients at the same time facilitate a supervized search for surrogate markers of the co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures in PBMC. Expression data derived from both CD4 T cells and PBMC were available for a cohort of n=37 patients (AAV and SLE) following QC and hybridization to the HsMediante25k custom microarray platform and constituted a training cohort. Normalized, log- transformed expression data was analyzed using the MLInterfaces Bioconductor package in R<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. Using PBMC-level expression data samples were classified into subgroups showing either high or low expression of the costimluation/exhaustion signature (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 5H, I</xref>) and probes were subsequently ranked using the variable importance metric based on their ability to predict allocation to either group. The variable importance for a given gene reflects the change in accuracy of classification (% increase in MSE or increase in node purity) when that variable is randomly permuted. For a poorly predictive gene, random permutation of its values will minimally influence classification accuracy. Conversely, the most robust predictors will have a comparatively large effect on classification accuracy when randomly permuted.
