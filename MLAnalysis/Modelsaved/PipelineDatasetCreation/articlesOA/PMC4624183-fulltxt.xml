Transcript polyadenylation was detected as unmapped adenine residues at the ends of the mapped reads.

As in human, two pairs of bank vole genes, <italic>nad4l</italic>/<italic>nad4</italic> and <italic>atp8/atp6</italic>, are expressed from bicistronic transcripts. TAA stop codons of four bank vole protein-coding genes (<italic>nad1</italic>, <italic>atp6, cox3</italic> and <italic>nad4</italic>) are incompletely encoded in the DNA and are completed by polyadenylation. This is three genes (<italic>nad2</italic>, <italic>nad3</italic> and <italic>cob</italic>) less than in human. The bank vole <italic>nad2</italic> gene encodes a full stop codon (TAA in one vole and TAG in the other), which is followed by a 2&#160;bp UTR and the gene conforms to the tRNA punctuation model. In contrast, the annotations of the reference mouse and some other rodent mt genomes in GenBank include complete TAG stop codons in both <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad2</italic>, which overlap downstream <italic>trnI</italic> and <italic>trnW</italic>, respectively.

Several recent papers have reviewed the mammalian mt transcriptome based on human data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], while for other mammals even the basic characteristics, including the location of the transcript ends or presence of untranslated regions (UTRs) and intergenic sequences (IGSs), have not yet been described. This is surprising given that the mt genome sequence of the mouse (the first non-human mammal sequenced) has been known for over 30&#160;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The mt genome of mammals typically consists of ~16.5&#160;kb circular, double-stranded DNA that contains 37 genes coding for 13 protein subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs; rrnS and rrnL; the gene nomenclature follows that proposed by Boore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and adopted by e.g. Bernt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The individual genes are unequally distributed between the heavy (H) and light (L) strands, with the majority of the genes encoded on the H strand, except for the <italic>nad6</italic> gene and eight of tRNAs.</p><p>Each strand of human mtDNA has its own promoter(s) and both strands are transcribed as polygenic or polycistronic precursor transcription units, which are processed to release tRNAs, rRNAs and mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are two H-strand promoter/transcription initiation sites, one located in the control region (HSP1) and one near the 5&#8242; end of rrnS (HSP2), and one L-strand promoter located in the control region (LSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Both HSP1 and HSP2 initiate transcription in the same direction, but the transcription from HSP2 produces a full-length transcript covering the two rRNAs, 12 mRNAs and 13 tRNAs, while the transcription from HSP1 terminates downstream of rrnL, transcribing only <italic>trnF</italic>, <italic>rrnS</italic>, <italic>trnV</italic> and <italic>rrnL</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The existence of two distinct promoters is probably the basis for the differential regulation of synthesis of the rRNAs and H-strand encoded mRNAs, with the transcription from HSP1 being responsible for the synthesis of the majority of rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar to HSP2, the transcription initiated at LSP covers a large portion of the mt genome and includes the one mRNA (<italic>nad6</italic> gene) and the eight tRNAs encoded on the L strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Most of cleavage events required to release the mRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs from these precursor transcripts can be accounted for by the &#8216;tRNA punctuation&#8217; model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to the model, tRNAs are endonucleolytically excised from the precursor transcripts and the fragments that remain are processed to functional mRNA and rRNA transcripts. The 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; ends of the mRNA and rRNA transcripts are therefore defined by the endpoints of the intervening tRNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This model ensures that adjacent mRNA and tRNA genes do not overlap or a tRNA excision would result in truncated mRNA (similar arguments apply for rRNA genes). A striking, well-demonstrated feature of human mt transcription in which it deviates from the tRNA punctuation model is that two transcription units remain as bicistronic elements containing overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding <italic>atp8</italic> and <italic>atp6</italic>, and <italic>nad4l</italic> and <italic>nad4</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such overlapping ORFs are present in mtDNA sequences of other mammals too, but a presence of mature mt bicistronic mRNAs in mammals other than human remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Due to the absence of transcriptome data, annotation of mt genomes of non-human mammals relies on homology with the human genome or is purely the result of interpretation of the mt genome sequence. For example, there are two instances of an overlapping TAG stop codon (in <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad2</italic>) and downstream tRNA in the NCBI Reference Sequence of the house mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) mitochondrion (GenBank:NC_005089.1; as of February 2015) in an annotation apparently inferred solely from the mt genome sequence, while in human the stop codons of these genes are TAA codons incompletely encoded in DNA with the missing adenine residues added via mRNA polyadenylation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among other rodent mt genomes, some match the mouse annotation, including the Norway rat <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> NCBI Reference Sequence (GenBank:AC_000022.2) and the sequence of the sibling vole <italic>Microtus rossiaemeridionalis</italic> (GenBank:DQ015676.1), while others conform to the human model, including the golden hamster <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> NCBI Reference Sequence (GenBank:NC_013276.1) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the Korean red-backed vole <italic>Eothenomys regulus</italic> (GenBank:JN629046.1). The eastern European house mouse <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic> (GenBank:KF781649.1) annotation also follows human rather than the house mouse (strictly the western European house mouse <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>) annotation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mixed annotation of the 3&#8242; end of <italic>nad1</italic> in different mammals.

As for other non-human mammals, there is no experimental evidence of the ends of the bank vole mRNA molecules and their polyadenylation status. Recently, we sequenced and annotated the mt genome of the bank vole based on Sanger sequencing (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here, we utilize Illumina RNA-Seq data collected for two wild-caught individuals to describe the mt transcriptome of the bank vole. Although RNA-Seq data are primarily employed to gather information about nuclear-encoded transcripts, they typically contain a high proportion of reads matching the mt transcripts, potentially extremely useful in mt transcriptome characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We mapped the bank vole RNA-Seq reads to the sequence of the mt genome and characterise the 3&#8242;ends of the mRNAs from the bank vole mt genome. On the basis of this information, we assess the polyadenylation status of mRNAs, the codon usage to terminate the translation, and the presence of UTRs and IGSs in the bank vole mtDNA.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The mitochondrial genome of the bank vole.

Locating the poly(A) sites made it possible to determine where the stop codon of PCGs is completed by polyadenylation, including for the genes where a triplet TAA, TAG or TGT overlaps the first one or two nucleotides of the downstream gene. Knowing the location of the poly(A) sites also allowed the identification of the 3&#8242; ends of the transcripts and the search for the presence of UTRs and of non-coding IGSs.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Location of the transcript 3&#8242; ends by RNA-Seq.

The transcript polyadenylation sites are identified as stretches of adenine residue that do not map back to the genome and lie at the ends of mapped fractions of the reads (the top three reads).

It also explains why <italic>atp8</italic> and <italic>nad4l</italic> show no drop in coverage observed for the tRNA genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which is due to the library enrichment for poly(A)-tailed RNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exception to the tRNA punctuation model</title><p>There is also no intervening tRNA sequence between the <italic>atp6</italic> and <italic>cox3</italic> genes (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

The present study starts to fill this gap by using RNA-Seq reads derived from poly(A)-enriched bank vole RNA to characterise the 3&#8242; ends of the mt transcripts in this species.</p><p>The general characteristics of the bank vole mt transcriptome match the human model. All PCGs except one (<italic>nad6</italic>) are transcribed from the H-strand. The H-strand transcriptome consist of ten monocistronic and two bicistronic mRNAs. All bank vole transcripts punctuated by tRNA genes at their 3&#8242; ends are polyadenylated (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as found for human mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that the polyadenylation of bank vole mt transcripts occurred precisely at the sites predicted by the tRNA punctuation model, except for the <italic>nad5</italic> transcript, whose 3&#8242; end is at an IGS/<italic>cob</italic> boundary (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This deviation from the tRNA punctuation model matches previous findings in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The two mature bicistronic transcripts correspond to the mRNA for <italic>atp8/atp6</italic> subunits and the mRNA for <italic>nad4l</italic>/<italic>nad4</italic> subunits, with ORFs overlapping by 43 and 7&#160;bp, respectively. The expression of these genes from bicistronic units has been demonstrated in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and although the ORFs similarly overlap in mtDNA of other mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], only for the bank vole have we provided experimental evidence in support of the existence of mature bicistronic transcripts. This shows that this feature of mtDNA transcription is shared by rodents and primates.</p><p>Our RNA-Seq data provided no evidence for the location of the 3&#8242; end of the mRNA for <italic>nad6</italic>. This is the only PGC encoded on the L-strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ORFs of bank vole <italic>nad5</italic> and <italic>nad6</italic> overlap tail-to-tail for 4&#160;bp and the antisense sequence of <italic>nad6</italic> is fully contained in the 3&#8242; UTR of <italic>nad5</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, the bank vole <italic>nad6</italic> ORF is not punctuated by a downstream tRNA and its mRNA does not appear to be stably polyadenylated near the 3&#8242; end of the ORF, consistent with human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The location of the end of the bank vole <italic>nad6</italic> transcript therefore remains unknown as does its polyadenylation status. Thus, while our approach allowed accurate positioning of the 3&#8242; ends of major transcripts for all H-strand PCGs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), RNA extracted from enriched mitochondria and/or RT-PCR or deep sequencing strategies specifically targeting transcript ends will be required to describe the ends of the L-strand encoded transcript(s) as well as of rrnS and rrnL transcripts, and to test for possible additional minor poly(A) sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Four of the bank vole PCGs (<italic>nad1</italic>, <italic>atp6, cox3</italic> and <italic>nad4</italic>) have TAA stop codons that are incompletely encoded in the DNA and are completed posttranscriptionally by polyadenylation, which is demonstrated by the presence of a poly(A) site immediately downstream of the last DNA-encoded stop codon nucleotide (T or A; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This finding is in concordance with Slomovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who found in human cells that polyadenylation is a key step in completion of stop codons only partly encoded by mtDNA. Stop codons of seven PCGs in human mtDNA (including <italic>nad2</italic>, <italic>nad3</italic> and <italic>cob</italic>) require completion by polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, while the mechanism is shared by the two species, there is heterogeneity in the role of polyadenylation in completion of the coding information of the individual genes between human and the bank vole as some of the genes with incomplete stop codons in human encode full stop codons in the bank vole. For example, while the stop codon of <italic>nad1</italic> is only partly encoded in the DNA (TA and T, respectively) and is posttranscriptionally completed to TAA in both species (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], <italic>nad2</italic> encodes an incomplete stop codon (T) in human, but a full stop codon in the bank vole (TAA in one vole and TAG in the other), where it is further followed by 2&#160;bp of UTR sequence (AC) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The poly(A) site immediately follows this short 3&#8242;UTR (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which demonstrates that the bank vole <italic>nad2</italic> mRNA also fully conforms to the tRNA punctuation model, but that in this species polyadenylation is not required to complete the stop codon.</p><p>In contrast to the evidence from human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and bank vole, annotations of various rodent mt genome sequences in GenBank (including the reference mouse mt genome) include complete TAG stop codons in the CDS of both <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad2</italic> that overlap the downstream <italic>trnI</italic> and <italic>trnW</italic> by 2&#160;bp (AG) in each case (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Such CDS/tRNA overlap would imply a deviation from the tRNA punctuation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and an alternative RNA processing mechanism would need to be postulated. The discordance in <italic>nad1</italic> and <italic>nad2</italic> annotation among different species reflects insufficient transcriptome data. We believe that unambiguous determination of stop codons is, in some cases, not possible based solely on genomic sequence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study is a demonstration of how deep RNA-Seq from total RNA was useful to recover mtDNA transcriptome data in a non-model rodent species. This approach has previously been applied to study mt gene expression of an insect, including polyadenylation and polycistronic transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We show that RNA-Seq data are helpful in evaluation of gene boundaries, polyadenylation and post-transcriptional modification in mammalian mtDNA. Even though the structure, genetic content and organization of mtDNA are strongly conserved among mammals and human mtDNA is considered a paradigm for the whole class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is imperative that sequencing of new mt genomes incorporate evidence from the transcriptome as often as possible, as annotations based on genomic data only are liable to errors. Fortunately, typical mammalian whole transcriptome RNA-Seq data contain a high proportion of reads matching the mt transcripts that remain largely unexplored in most gene expression studies, but which can be extremely useful in mt transcriptome characterization. This includes RNA-Seq data from published studies that are available in read archives. As Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] points out, &#8216;the bulk of the organelle-derived RNA-Seq reads in public databases are waiting to be analysed&#8217;. Therefore, for some species (such as the mouse), it should be possible to rectify the situation even with the data that are now available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Samples and RNA extraction</title><p>RNA-Seq data were collected for two adult bank voles from England, a male from near Diptford in Devon (vole no. 1634; P. Kotl&#237;k specimen database) and a female from near Cirencester in Gloucestershire (vole no. 1815). The individuals were trapped and taken under the appropriate Natural England (general) licence for wildlife management, strictly following the guidelines therein. The bank vole is a widespread Eurasian rodent species of the family Cricetidae, which is taxonomically placed within the same superfamily Muroidea as the house mouse (which is in the family Muridae). Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) from spleen samples stored in RNAlater, followed by DNase treatment using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and an additional clean-up step using the RNeasy Mini Kit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Illumina sequencing</title><p>Library preparation and sequencing were performed with standard Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) protocols on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, mRNA molecules with stretches of poly(A) residues at the 3&#8242; end were separated from RNAs that lack a poly(A) tail. After the poly(A) enrichment and fragmentation, the RNA was size-selected to 250&#8211;400&#160;bp, reverse transcribed into cDNA, end-repaired and PCR-enriched. The resulting libraries were sequenced using the 100-bp paired-end module.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Mapping reads to the genome</title><p>The Illumina reads obtained for each vole were mapped to the annotated reference sequence of the bank vole mt genome (GenBank:KF918859) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Read mapping was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench, version 6.0.1 (CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark), with a minimum length fraction of 0.9 and minimum similarity fraction of 0.95. This means that only those reads were considered where at least 90&#160;% of the read matched the reference sequence with at least 95&#160;% identity. Such a setting ensured the specificity of the mapping, but allowed for the reads with poly(A) tails to be mapped with unaligned ends. Reads that mapped with unaligned three or more non-template adenine nucleotides at the 3&#8242; end were considered indicative of poly(A) sites, a criterion similar to that adopted by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To ascertain the location of the ends of the tRNA genes, the cloverleaf secondary structure of each tRNA was predicted using MITOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The secondary structure of the putative O<sub>L</sub> was predicted with the CLC Genomics Workbench.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#8217; contributions</bold></p><p>PK, SM and JBS conceived the study and designed the experiments, SM and KF performed the experiments, SM and PK analysed the data, and SM and PK wrote the manuscript, with contributions from KF and JBS.
