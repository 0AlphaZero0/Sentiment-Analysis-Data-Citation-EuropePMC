We sought to identify genetic variants conferring risk to NSTEMI or STEMI by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MI stratified into NSTEMI and STEMI in a consecutive sample of 1,579 acute MI cases with 1,576 controls. Subsequently, we followed the results in an independent population-based sample of 562 cases and 566 controls, a partially independent prospective cohort (N = 16,627 with 163 incident NSTEMI cases), and examined the effect of disease-associated variants on gene expression in 513 healthy participants. Genetic variants on chromosome 1p13.3 near the damage-regulated autophagy modulator 2 gene <italic>DRAM2</italic> associated with NSTEMI (rs656843; odds ratio 1.57, P = 3.11 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup>) in the case-control analysis with a consistent but not statistically significant effect in the prospective cohort (rs656843; hazard ratio 1.13, P = 0.43). These variants were not associated with STEMI (rs656843; odds ratio, 1.11, P = 0.20; hazard ratio 0.97, P = 0.87), appearing to have a pronounced effect on NSTEMI risk. A majority of the variants at 1p13.3 associated with NSTEMI were also associated with the expression level of <italic>DRAM2</italic> in blood leukocytes of healthy controls (top-ranked variant rs325927, P = 1.50 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;12</sup>). The results suggest that genetic factors may in part influence whether coronary artery disease results in NSTEMI rather than STEMI.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Aarne Koskelo Foundation, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Tampere University Hospital special government funds (EVO), the Finnish Foundation for Cardiovascular research, the Academy of Finland, and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation.

In most cases STEMI results from complete occlusion of a coronary artery [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] whereas NSTEMI is caused by partial or transient blockage [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In either case, prolonged ischemia ultimately leads to cell death. Both differences and similarities in prognoses for NSTEMI and STEMI have been reported, depending on follow-up time and study sample. [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140576.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Despite improvements in treatment, ischemic heart disease remains the most common cause of death world-wide [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>STEMI and NSTEMI differ in a number of clinically relevant characteristics. Compared to STEMI, NSTEMI tends to present with greater minimal luminal area in the culprit artery, smaller length of plaque rupture [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and smaller infarct size [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ruptured plaques are also found to be somewhat smaller and more heavily calcified in NSTEMI [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, recurrent infarctions are often of the same type, suggesting that some individuals may be particularly susceptible to either STEMI or NSTEMI [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although MI is moderately heritable [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a significant number of coronary artery disease (CAD) or MI risk loci have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the possible differences in genetic risk factors between STEMI and NSTEMI have been virtually unexplored.</p><p>To identify genetic variants conferring susceptibility to STEMI or NSTEMI, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MI with stratification into NSTEMI and STEMI. We followed the results in a case-control sample and a prospective cohort. Finally, we examined the correlation of the disease-associated variants with gene expression levels in blood leukocytes in a sample of healthy individuals. All participants of this study were Finns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Discovery GWAS</title><p>The characteristics of the discovery sample are presented in <xref rid="pone.0140576.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. <xref rid="pone.0140576.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0140576.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarize the GWAS P-values for MI, STEMI and NSTEMI.

Accordingly, the association of rs656843 with unspecified MI did not reach genome-wide significance when the two case-control samples were analyzed together (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.19&#8211;1.52]; P = 2.58 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>).</p><p>To complement the results from the case-control cohorts, we tested rs656843 for association with MI, NSTEMI, and STEMI in the prospective replication sample II. The association of rs656843 with NSTEMI, STEMI or MI was not statistically significant, although the estimate of the hazard ratio for NSTEMI (HR 1.13 [95% CI 0.84&#8211;1.51]) was consistent with the two case-control samples in direction of association. To assess the statistical power of the prospective sample, we tested 50 published MI/CAD risk SNPs present in our data for association with incident MI or NSTEMI. Depending on the phenotype tested, either 9 (MI) or 2 (NSTEMI) of the SNPs replicated at P &lt; 0.05 (data not shown, SNPs listed in Table A in <xref rid="pone.0140576.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>As both the discovery and replication samples consisted of Finns, we next wanted to study the association of rs656843 with MI or relevant traits in non-Finnish populations. Two large publicly available GWAS meta-analyses by the CARDIoGRAM [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and C4D [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] consortia had tested the association of rs656843 with CAD in multiple populations. The CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis covered 16,693 cases and 55,947 controls from 22 European cohorts. In C4D, the meta-analysis combined results from two European and two South-Asian cohorts containing altogether 15,379 cases and 15,026 controls. Rs656843 was not associated with risk for CAD in either of the two meta-analyses.</p><p>The association of rs656843 was statistically significant for NSTEMI and not for STEMI in the discovery and replication I samples, suggesting the risk conferred by rs656843 may not be equal for these two alternative subtypes of MI. To formally address this difference in association, we calculated posterior probabilities for statistical models where rs656843 provided either no risk whatsoever, the same risk for NSTEMI and STEMI, a related but attenuated risk for STEMI, or risk only for NSTEMI. Assuming a uniform prior, the model with the effect specific to NSTEMI had the highest posterior probability (0.71) followed by the model with a related but attenuated effect for STEMI (posterior probability = 0.29). The null model with no effect (posterior probability = 3.10 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>) and the model with the same effect for both NSTEMI and STEMI (posterior probability = 0.0013) were the least favored by the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Association with gene expression</title><p>The variants associated (P &lt; 0.05) with NSTEMI at the 1p13.3 locus are not predicted by the Ensembl VEP to change the structure of a protein (Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, database version 81.37).[<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The causal variant(s) may therefore act by altering gene expression, change the nucleotide sequence of a noncoding RNA molecule or not be among the variants tested for association.

We identified a novel genome-wide significant association between SNPs on chromosome 1p13.3 and risk for NSTEMI. The association of the top directly genotyped SNP rs656843 with NSTEMI and unspecified MI replicated in the independent case-control sample. Similar to most already published GWAS CAD/MI loci, the effect of rs656843 was consistent in direction but did not reach statistical significance for MI or NSTEMI in the prospective sample. The contrast between the case-control and prospective analysis results may stem from the different case ascertainment methods and sample sizes. The case-control replication sample was collected by a single study center and contained 389 NSTEMI cases, whereas the 163 incident NSTEMI cases in the prospective replication sample were identified from hospital discharge registries, diagnosed during routine clinical work in multiple hospitals. The case-control sample thus benefitted from both a larger number of cases and potentially more uniform diagnostic criteria. The association of rs656843 with STEMI was not statistically significant in any of the samples we studied. The data from the three study samples thus suggest rs656843 is associated with NSTEMI but not with STEMI.</p><p>The difference in association of rs656843 with NSTEMI and STEMI could in principle be explained simply by the different sample sizes and a corresponding lack of statistical power to detect an association with STEMI, given that the samples contained more NSTEMI than STEMI cases. To address this, we compared the posterior probabilities of four candidate models using an approach that properly accounts for the different amounts of information available for STEMI and NSTEMI. The comparison suggests the data are best explained by a model where rs656843 increases risk for NSTEMI only. A model with a related but attenuated effect on STEMI risk also provides a good fit, while a model where the effect of rs656843 on NSTEMI and STEMI risk was set equal fits the data poorly. The observed data thus support the interpretation that the effect of the 1p13.3 locus on MI risk is not the same for NSTEMI and STEMI and that the difference in association is not caused solely by different sample sizes.</p><p>Rs656843 was not associated with risk for CAD in two large international GWAS meta-analyses, one conducted in European and the other in South-Asian and European cohorts. Although these meta-analyses of CAD are not a direct replication of an association detected using NSTEMI as the endpoint, a considerable proportion of the CAD cases in both meta-analyses had been diagnosed with MI. Given the large sample sizes, it seems unlikely that phenotypic differences alone would explain the lack of association between rs656843 and CAD in the meta-analyses. The association detected in the present study may therefore depend on a genetic or environmental factor sufficiently common in Finland but rare in other European populations.</p><p>Genetic variants associated with NSTEMI on chromosome 1p13.3 are located within a 240 kbp long LD block. The region contains three genes, <italic>DRAM2</italic>, <italic>CETP1</italic> and <italic>DENND2D</italic>, all of which could potentially be causal. Variants associated with NSTEMI are associated with the expression of <italic>DRAM2</italic> and not with <italic>CEPT1</italic>, pointing towards <italic>DRAM2</italic> as causal. It must, however, be noted that the association of SNPs with NSTEMI is not exactly mirrored by their association with <italic>DRAM2</italic> expression. As expression quantitative trait loci are known to be ubiquitous across the genome [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is possible that the overlap between the NSTEMI and <italic>DRAM2</italic> associations is coincidental rather than causal.</p><p>The exact function of <italic>DRAM2</italic> remains to be elucidated, but it has been shown to be highly expressed in heart and to play a role in autophagy, the main cellular mechanism for recycling and degradation of organelles and long-lived proteins [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Silencing <italic>DRAM2</italic> inhibits autophagy under starvation [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and attenuates p53-mediated cell death [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], although <italic>DRAM2</italic> is not directly regulated by p53 [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Autophagy is particularly important for postmitotic cells such as cardiomyocytes and induced in response to both intra- and extracellular stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Depending on the context, it can either promote cell survival or contribute to cell death. Autophagy has also been suggested to affect myocardial sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], potentially connecting <italic>DRAM2</italic> function and a mechanism of cardiac damage. Further studies in e.g. myocardium are, however, required to show whether <italic>DRAM2</italic> can influence cardiac function.</p><p>We did not observe statistically significant differences between STEMI and NSTEMI patients for SNPs previously reported to be associated with MI, CAD or CHD at genome-wide significant level (Table A in <xref rid="pone.0140576.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). As most of the previously reported SNPs have been identified as associated with CAD and not specifically with MI, this implies that genetic variants affecting mechanisms relevant prior to plaque rupture, principally the development of CAD, confer similar risk for both NSTEMI and STEMI. Genetic differences between the two could mainly have to do with the acute response to plaque rupture and coronary artery occlusion. Interestingly, the most statistically significant difference between STEMI and NSTEMI patients for a previously reported SNP was at the <italic>ABO</italic> gene, originally identified as associated with risk for MI in presence of CAD [<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is particularly intriguing because the <italic>ABO</italic> locus is also the only genome-wide significant finding associated specifically with risk for MI independently of CAD.</p><p>Several limitations of the current study must be noted. First, as all of the study participants were Finns, the findings may not be directly applicable to other ethnic groups. Second, the sample sizes were moderately small, implying that the effect-size estimates of the novel findings may be inflated. This view is supported by the lack of statistically significant association of rs656843 with NSTEMI in the prospective setting. Although limited by the modest number of incident cases studied, the prospective setting gives a valuable realistic indication of the limited predictive value of rs656843 for incident MI or NSTEMI. Third, the controls in the replication sample I were on average approximately 20 years younger than the cases, resulting in loss of statistical power as some of the controls will likely suffer from MI in the future. Fourth, we used easily accessible blood leukocytes to study the correlation between DNA sequence variants and gene expression instead of potentially more relevant cell types such as cardiomyocytes or arterial endothelial cells.</p><p>The association of specific genetic variants preferentially with NSTEMI implies that whether an individual will get one form of acute MI rather than the other may partly be genetically influenced. This suggests future studies on the genetic basis of myocardial infarction could benefit from making the distinction between STEMI and NSTEMI. These two MI subtypes appear to share a majority of their genetic risk factors, but the differences may offer unique insights into the processes leading from coronary artery disease to myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Study cohorts</title><p>The MI cases of the discovery sample comprise all successfully genotyped Corogene study participants suffering from a spontaneous myocardial infarction related to ischaemia due to a primary coronary event (type 1 MI):[<xref rid="pone.0140576.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140576.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] either STEMI (N = 614), NSTEMI (N = 962), or MI with usnpecified ST-segment status (N = 3).
