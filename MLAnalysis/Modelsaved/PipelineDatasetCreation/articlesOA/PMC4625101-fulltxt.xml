Most of these individuals are chronically infected, but some clear the infection rapidly. Host factors seem to play a key role in HCV clearance, among them are the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. Certain HLA molecules, e.g., B*27 and B*57, are associated with viral clearance. To identify potential mechanisms for these associations, we assess epitope distribution differences between HLA molecules using experimentally verified and <italic>in silico</italic> predicted HCV epitopes. Specifically, we show that the NS5B protein harbors the largest fraction of conserved regions among all HCV proteins. Such conserved regions could be good targets for cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses. We find that the protective HLA-B*27 molecule preferentially presents cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) epitopes from NS5B and, in general, presents the most strongly conserved epitopes among the 23 HLA molecules analyzed. In contrast, HLA molecules known to be associated with HCV persistence do not have similar preferences and appear to target the variable P7 protein. Overall, our analysis suggests that by targeting highly constrained &#8211; and thereby conserved &#8211; regions of HCV, the protective HLA molecule HLA-B*27 reduces the ability of HCV to escape the cytotoxic T-cell response of the host. For visualizing the distribution of both experimentally verified and predicted epitopes across the HCV genome, we created the HCV epitope browser, which is available at theory.bio.uu.nl/ucqi/hcv.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>sequence conservation</kwd><kwd>HLA disease association</kwd><kwd>peptide-MHC binding predictions</kwd><kwd>CTL responses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003246</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">635.100.025</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Utrecht University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001829</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">High Potential Grant</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="36"/><word-count count="7036"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a severe infectious agent and affects millions of people per year (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Approximately 25% of the infected individuals spontaneously resolve the infection, whereas most develop a persistent viral infection, which may lead to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Although the determinants of HCV clearance, persistence, and disease outcome are not well known, it has been shown in numerous studies that the magnitude, diversity, and quality of T-cell responses play an essential role in controlling the infection and determining the outcome of HCV infection (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Especially, efficient (CD4<sup>+</sup>) T-cell responses against non-structural proteins might be important for viral control (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The importance of T-cell responses is also supported by the finding that certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules are associated with differential HCV infection outcome. Numerous HCV-HLA association studies have been performed covering different ethnic groups and different HCV genotypes [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)]. Interestingly, two allele groups, B*27 and B*57, which have previously been associated with slow disease progression in HIV-1-positive individuals [reviewed by Bashirova et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)], are also associated with viral clearance in HCV infection. For HLA molecules in these groups, which we will call <italic>protective alleles</italic>, several dominantly targeted CTL epitopes have been identified. These epitopes were shown to contain mutations in individuals unable to clear the HCV infection (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and lead to fitness loss (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) unless restored by compensatory mutations.</p><p>The HCV genome encodes a polyprotein precursor of about 3000 amino acid residues, which is processed into several mature structural proteins (Core, E1, E2) and non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B, P7) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A possible mechanism behind the observed associations between certain HLA class I molecules and HCV infection outcome could be the differential presentation of HCV proteins by certain HLA molecules, as was shown to be the case for HLA associations with HIV-1 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and HTLV-1 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Such protein targeting could be beneficial for various reasons. For instance, the targeted proteins could be highly expressed, or the timing of their expression could exhibit a critical period which is essential for viral replication. Alternatively, a targeted protein could harbor many conserved epitopes in which mutations would come at a high fitness cost, making it more difficult to escape from the CTL response. Here, we therefore address two related questions: (1) Is there evidence for differential presentation of HCV proteins by protective alleles? and (2) Do protective alleles target conserved regions of the HCV genome?</p><p>To address these questions, we analyzed the HCV epitope repertoires of several HLA molecules that have been associated with viral clearance or persistence, employing experimental data from public databases and <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of HLA-peptide binding to define these HLA epitope repertoires. We found that the protective HLA molecule B*27 shows a preference to present epitopes from the HCV protein NS5B, whereas other HLA molecules show no preferential targeting or target other HCV proteins such as P7. Analyzing the sequence variability of HCV proteins, we found that NS5B harbors the largest fraction of strongly conserved regions among all HCV proteins and that the predicted B*27 epitope repertoire contains the largest amount of strongly conserved epitopes of all alleles that were analyzed. Taken together, our analysis suggests a relationship between the protective potential of an HLA molecule and the degree of sequence conservation of the HCV epitopes targeted by that HLA molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><label>2.1</label><title>Experimentally Verified HCV T-Cell Epitopes</title><p>All experimentally verified HCV CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes restricted by HLA class I molecules were downloaded (October 2014) from two public databases: (1) the Los Alamos HCV immunology database<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> [Ref.

HCV is classified into 7 phylogenetically distinct genotypes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). As HCV genotype 1 is the most dominant strain worldwide and is well studied (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), we aligned each known epitope to the HCV reference strain H77 (accession number AF009606) using the blastp program (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Only those epitopes for which an alignment with 100% source coverage could be found were included in the analysis. To make sure that all epitopes we considered are from the HCV strains infecting humans, epitopes identified using HLA transgenic mammalian cells were excluded. This procedure resulted in 398 experimentally verified combinations of an HCV genotype 1 CTL epitope and its known HLA restriction (26 peptides appear in more than one combination). Only 7 epitopes were restricted by HLA-C molecules. To calculate the distribution of CTL epitopes over the HCV proteins for each HLA allele, we limited our analysis to 263 non-redundant experimental epitopes: whenever multiple epitopes aligned to the same positions in the H77 reference strain, we only included the epitope with the highest alignment score.

Different numbers of sequences were available for different HCV proteins, ranging from 466 sequences for NS5B to 918 sequences for NS3. To prevent a bias due to different numbers of sequences in the alignments, we used the Miller-Madow entropy estimator which corrects for such bias (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We repeated this analysis separately for sequences of HCV genotype 1.</p><p>To map sequence conservation of the HCV genome at the spatial resolution that is most relevant for epitope presentation, we applied a running median filter with window size nine to obtain an estimate of the overall conservation of a nine-mer centered at the respective position. The window size nine was chosen because it matches the typical length of peptides presented by HLA class I molecules. The first and last four positions of each protein were not assigned a median entropy, as no nine-mer is centered at these positions. We chose the median filter instead of other alternatives such as a running average because the distribution of entropies is strongly skewed. In order to separate strongly conserved regions from more variable regions, we applied a threshold of 0.037 bits &#8211; the lower quartile of the overall entropy distribution in the HCV proteome. Changing this threshold did not affect the qualitative results.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed using the R environment (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

We then compared the resulting distribution of epitopes across proteins to the distribution expected from a random ordering of the peptides.

Kuniholm et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) conducted a literature review of HCV-HLA associations. Using stringent selection criteria, the authors identified five HLA class I allele groups (B<sup>&#8902;</sup>18, B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27, B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57, Cw<sup>&#8902;</sup>01, and Cw<sup>&#8902;</sup>04) that are strongly associated with either HCV clearance or persistence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Interestingly, the two allele groups B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 and B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57, which are strongly associated with slow disease progression in HIV-1-positive individuals, are also associated with a favorable infection outcome in HCV-infected patient cohorts. Next, Kuniholm et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) tested the association of HLA alleles with HCV viremia in a large cohort of HCV-seropositive women and confirmed all the associations, except for B<sup>&#8902;</sup>18, though the effects were not always significant. Of the list of protective HLA allele groups, multiple CTL epitopes have only been reported for B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 and B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). We observed that 6 out of the 10 experimentally verified HCV CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes restricted by the protective HLA allele groups are located in the HCV protein NS5B, whereas the remaining 4 epitopes are distributed over 4 other HCV proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The share of NS5B epitopes from B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57 and B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 is larger than would be expected from the distribution of all known epitopes across HCV proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) or the protein length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Thus, this small set of experimentally verified epitopes suggests that the epitopes of protective alleles are concentrated in the NS5B protein.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>HLA class I allele groups with significant associations with HCV viremia as reported by Kuniholm et al.

We therefore used <italic>in silico</italic> binding prediction as an alternative approach to define HLA epitope repertoires (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). The cohort used by Kuniholm et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) to define protective allele groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was largely infected with HCV genotype 1 (55% with genotype 1a, 29% with genotype 1b, and 4% with genotype 1 of undetermined subtype). Therefore, we assumed that the associations identified by Kuniholm et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) should be valid in the context of HCV genotype 1 infection and used the genotype 1 reference strain H77 from the LANL HCV database (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) for our predictions. The HLA-binding affinities of all HCV peptides of length nine were estimated for several HLA alleles using the prediction tool NetMHCpan (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). This method predicts an IC50 value of &lt;500&#8201;nM for 8 out of the 10 known HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 and HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57 epitopes that are part of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions should be a valid approach to overcome the limited number of experimentally identified epitopes.</p><p>In a first attempt to study preferential targeting of HCV proteins by protective and susceptible HLA alleles, we followed the strategy taken in previous studies on HIV-1 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and HTLV-1 infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We ranked the predicted HCV epitopes by their predicted HLA-binding affinity within all HCV proteins and then determined the ranks of the two best-binding peptides derived from each HCV protein among all other HCV epitopes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These ranks are expected to depend on the protein length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C): shorter proteins are less likely to contain many top-ranking peptides than long proteins. This intuition was confirmed for the NS4A protein, which is the shortest of the HCV proteins (56 amino acids). Interestingly, the ranks for the second shortest protein P7 (64 amino acids) were much higher and comparable to the other proteins. However, this analysis did not show any convincing differences between protective and susceptible alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Binding affinity rankings of the best epitopes do not differ between susceptible and protective alleles</bold>.

The median of each group is indicated by a horizontal line.

Thus, we decided to alternatively look at the whole set of peptides that are predicted to bind each HLA class I molecule. The fraction of peptides bound by each HLA is normally considered to be around 2%. We therefore looked at the top 30&#8211;120 binders (corresponding to 1&#8211;4% of the HCV proteome, respectively) and compared the observed distribution of proteins among those binders to the expected distribution based on the protein length. Overall, HLAs seem to deviate significantly from uniform protein targeting (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.007, chi-square test, for the 120 binders cutoff). To investigate which HLA-protein combinations gave rise to the difference between the observed protein targeting and a uniform targeting based only on protein length, we investigated the standardized residuals of the chi-square test. Standardized residuals measure the difference between an observed frequency and the expected frequency; a positive residual means that a combination occurs more often than expected, whereas a negative residual means that it occurs less often than expected. The magnitude of the residual gives an indication of statistical significance. For instance, a standardized residual of 2 or &#8722;2 means that the difference is twice as large as the standard error in measuring the expected frequency and roughly corresponds to a significance level of &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.05. In the following, we will call the residuals <italic>enrichment scores</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to the previous analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the enrichment scores revealed differential targeting for many HLA molecules. Specifically, plotting the scores as a function of the cutoff shows that HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>2705, but none of the other protective or susceptible HLA alleles, targets NS5B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). We also performed a two-dimensional analysis of the targeting patterns of all HLA-protein combinations by averaging the standardized residuals across the cutoffs from 60 to 120 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), which showed a rich pattern of protein targeting by many HLA alleles.

For example, NS5B could be expressed in infected cells in large amounts or early during the infection, resulting in both cases in an efficient antigen presentation and a good CTL response. Unfortunately, little is known about the expression of HCV proteins in infected cells. Alternatively, since HCV is known to escape CTL pressure by continuous evolution (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), CTL responses to structurally and functionally constrained parts of the HCV genome are likely to be most beneficial. Thus, a possible mechanism how targeting of NS5B by HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 would increase the odds of viral clearance could be that NS5B harbors many constrained epitopes. Therefore, we sought to identify conserved regions in the HCV genome and to compare their locations with those of HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 epitopes.</p><p>The relative variability of HCV proteins was assessed by estimating the average Shannon entropy of all positions for each protein using prealigned amino acid sequences from <italic>all</italic> genotypes available from the Los Alamos HCV database. Each of these alignments includes only one sequence per patient. In order to allow for direct comparison between the proteins, we corrected for the number of sequences per protein alignment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). We then identified strongly conserved regions in the HCV genome as nine-mers in which the median entropy was lower than the lower quartile of the overall entropy distribution; this was the case for about 10% of all nine-mers in the genome. Not surprisingly, strongly conserved regions are not uniformly distributed across HCV proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Almost half of the sequence of NS5B and Core are covered by strongly conserved regions, whereas such regions are not found at all in the NS2, NS4A, and P7 proteins. The degree of conservation probably reflects the structural flexibility of these proteins: the structural protein Core, for example, constitutes the capsid of the virus particle and affects several cellular processes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). For most of the HCV proteins, however, the functional and structural constraints are not yet known. The number of sequences available is not evenly distributed over the different HCV genotypes. Therefore, we could only repeat the conservation analysis on a genotype basis for genotype 1, as the number of available sequences per protein is less than 50 for the other genotypes. The sequence conservation within genotype 1 (plotted downward in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) largely mirrors the conservation across all genotypes (plotted upward), a notable exception being the NS4A protein which is quite conserved within genotype 1 but highly variable across all genotypes.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>NS5B is the most conserved HCV protein</bold>. Protein variability was estimated using bias-corrected Shannon entropy scores calculated for each position in HCV protein alignments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>).

Four of the epitopes lie within or border of strongly conserved regions of NS5B and NS3, one lies within a less conserved region of NS5B, and one is found in the short highly variable P7 protein. While these sequence conservation of these epitopes thus largely reflects the average sequence conservation of the proteins themselves, the small number of known HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 epitopes does not allow meaningful statistical assessment.</p><p>Therefore, we also analyzed the localization of <italic>in silico</italic> predicted epitopes for all HLA alleles used in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> using the top 30, 60, and 120 binders, which correspond to the top 1%, 2%, and 4%, as explained above.

However, the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis did not confirm such an effect for the other protective HLA alleles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have shown that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses play important roles in controlling HCV replication during infection (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and certain HLA alleles have been significantly associated with differential infection outcome (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The underlying mechanism behind these associations remains unclear. In case of HIV-1 and HTLV-1, it was shown that the immune system can effectively control infectious diseases by targeting certain pathogen-derived proteins (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Similarly, other studies found that T-cell epitopes are not equally distributed over the genome of HIV-1 and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> but that they cluster together in conserved regions (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We hypothesized that targeting of conserved regions within the HCV proteome by HLA alleles could be a potential mechanism to control viral replication during the acute phase of HCV infection, which could then further determine disease outcome.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed a literature study to compile a list of protective and susceptible HLA alleles. This turned out to be rather difficult due to limited data and differences between ethnic groups. Using the five strong HLA class I/HCV associations defined by Kuniholm et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) as a basis for our analysis, we found that experimentally verified CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes restricted by the protective HLA molecules HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 and HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57 are enriched within the NS5B protein. When carrying out a similar analysis using <italic>in silico</italic> predicted epitopes, we could only see a preference for presentation of NS5B by HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>2705, but not for HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57:01. Interestingly, however, for precisely this HLA-protein combination, several epitopes have been identified for which mutations appear to have a high fitness cost (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In line with previous studies (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), we found that NS5B is the most conserved protein, followed by Core and NS3, while the other proteins harbor more highly variable regions. Combined with these results, our study thus suggests that the protective effect of HLA-B<sup>&#8902;</sup>2705 might be mediated by preferential targeting of conserved epitopes.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that quite many HLA class I alleles seem to preferentially present epitopes from the P7 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), which according to our analysis does not harbor any conserved regions. It is interesting to observe that the HLAs targeting P7 include the two detrimental alleles B<sup>&#8902;</sup>18 and Cw<sup>&#8902;</sup>04. Given that P7 is also the protein whose functional role for HCV infection is most unclear (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the P7 targeting prevents those HLAs from inducing more protective responses to other proteins. However, two caveats are that (1) the protective allele Cw<sup>&#8902;</sup>01 also targets P7 and (2) P7 is the second shortest HCV protein, hence the uncertainty involved in ranking its best epitopes is high compared to longer proteins like NS5B.</p><p>HCV genotype differences also play a role in potential protective effects. It was shown, for example, that the protective effect of B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 is dependent on the genotype, with genotype 1-infected patients having T-cell responses against the protective B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 epitope, and genotype 3-infected patients showing no evidence of T-cell responses to any epitope from the same region in the HCV proteome, which differed in its sequence by three amino acids (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Our analysis focused on genotype 1 sequences (i.e., we use genotype 1a and 1b reference strains in our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and analyze only experimentally verified CTL epitopes from genotype 1 sequences), as HLA associations taken into account here were defined largely in the context of HCV genotype 1 infections. When more sequence and epitope data become available from the other genotypes, it will be possible to repeat our analysis on a genotype basis.</p><p>So far, there is no direct evidence that targeting more conserved HCV proteins by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells helps controlling HCV replication. However, it has been widely argued that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses specific for conserved regions of HIV-1 (especially Gag p24) should slow down disease progression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). As in the case of HIV-1, the most conserved HCV proteins are also the most functionally and structurally constrained ones, which makes it more difficult for the pathogen to escape from host immune control in these proteins than in other regions. In line with this reasoning, it has been shown that a point mutation within a B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 restricted dominant T-cell epitope in NS5B (pos. 421-429, ARMILMTHF) entails a large fitness cost (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A study of viral evolution in non-structural proteins during the acute phase of HCV infection showed that mutations in this NS5B epitope are also found and maintained in subjects that are not B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 positive (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This lack of reversion over time suggests that additional (compensatory) mutations must have occurred, which do not allow simple reversion. Moreover, a rare mutation in the anchor residue of a subdominant B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 restricted NS5B epitope (pos. 516-524, GRAAICGKY) was shown to nearly abrogate viral replication, which could be restored by two upstream mutations (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Interestingly, also for B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57, it has been shown that mutations in an NS5B epitope (pos. 209-217, KSKKTPMGF) substantially impaired viral replication, which was restored by compensatory mutations further upstream (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another recent study found that B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57-positive HCV-infected chronic carriers harbor HCV strains with a high frequency of mutations in key residues of this NS5B epitope as well as in an E2 epitope [pos. 158-166, NTRPPLGNW; Ref. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)]. These epitope variants were also shown to be recognized to a lesser extent in chronic carriers, which indicates that presentation of these epitopes is important in viral clearance. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, none of the other known B<sup>&#8902;</sup>57 or B<sup>&#8902;</sup>27 epitopes were studied in such detail. Still, these data indicate that NS5B is a highly constrained region of the HCV genome and shed some light on why immune responses targeting this conserved protein of HCV might result in a favorable infection outcome.</p><p>We wish to stress that the research presented in this article is exploratory and that more clinical data are required to test the mechanistic hypothesis suggested by our results. Specifically, the sixteen predicted epitopes shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> should be good CTL targets, as they have low entropy and high predicted binding affinity. This prediction is testable by measuring CTL responses against these epitopes <italic>in vivo</italic> and correlating the strength of immune escapes against these epitopes to the ability to clear the HCV infection.</p><p>Going beyond hepatitis C infections, we believe that the methodology we developed here for measuring HLA protein targeting and epitope distributions may be useful for studying class I responses to other infections as well.
