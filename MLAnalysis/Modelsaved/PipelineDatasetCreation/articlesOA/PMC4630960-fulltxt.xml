Accordingly, Multilocus Genetic Risk Scores (MGRSs) have been computed in previous studies in order to assess the cumulative association of multiple SNPs. When several SNPs have to be genotyped for each patient, using successive uniplex pyrosequencing reactions increases analytical reagent expenses and Turnaround Time (TAT). While a set of several pyrosequencing primers could theoretically be used to analyze multiplex amplicons, this would generate overlapping primer-specific pyro-signals that are visually uninterpretable.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the current study, two multiplex assays were developed consisting of a quadruplex (n=4) and a quintuplex (n=5) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) each followed by multiplex pyrosequencing analysis. The aim was to reliably but rapidly genotype a set of prostate cancer-related SNPs (n=9). The nucleotide dispensation order was selected using SENATOR software. Multiplex pyro-signals were analyzed using the new AdvISER-MH-PYRO software based on a sparse representation of the signal. Using uniplex assays as gold standard, the concordance between multiplex and uniplex assays was assessed on DNA extracted from patient blood samples (n = 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All genotypes (n=90) generated with the quadruplex and the quintuplex pyroquencing assays were perfectly (100 %) concordant with uniplex pyrosequencing. Using multiplex genotyping approach for analyzing a set of 90 patients allowed reducing TAT by approximately 75 % (<italic>i.e.</italic>, from 2025 to 470 min) while reducing reagent consumption and cost by approximately 70 % (<italic>i.e.</italic>, from &#8764;229 US$ /patient to &#8764;64 US$ /patient).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This combination of quadruplex and quintuplex pyrosequencing and PCR assays enabled to reduce the amount of DNA required for multi-SNP analysis, and to lower the global TAT and costs of SNP genotyping while providing results as reliable as uniplex analysis. Using this combined multiplex approach also substantially reduced the production of waste material. These genotyping assays appear therefore to be biologically, economically and ecologically highly relevant, being worth to be integrated in genetic-based predictive strategies for better selecting patients at risk for prostate cancer. In addition, the same approach could now equally be transposed to other clinical/research applications relying on the computation of MGRS based on multi-SNP genotyping.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multiplex</kwd><kwd>Pyrosequencing</kwd><kwd>Polymporphisms</kwd><kwd>Prostate</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Since 2005, a large number of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with more than 300 complex diseases and traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For prostate cancer (PCa), 47 risk-associated SNPs have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] that are essentially found in 8q24 and 17q chromosomal regions although not strictly restricted to these areas. Most of these SNPs have been tested in large population surveys as stand-alone predictors.</p><p>Considering that each SNP has only a moderate association with PCa, Multilocus Genetic Risk Scores (MGRSs) were computed in different studies to assess the cumulative association of multiple SNPs. Zheng et al. assessed the cumulative effect of five selected SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Compared to men without any of these risk genotypes, the odds ratio for PCa was 4.47 (2.93-6.80) in those having four of them or more. Kader et al. computed MGRS based on 33 established PCa risk-associated SNPs and demonstrated the potential added value of the score for PCa risk prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, a MGRS computed from a set of nine published SNPs (rs1016343, rs16901979, rs6983267, rs4242382, rs10993994, rs10896449, rs4430796, rs1859962, and rs5945619) improved the performance of a clinical risk-calculator in predicting prostate biopsy result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The predictive performance of the integrated clinico-genetic model (AUC = 0.781) was higher than the predictive performance of the clinical score alone (AUC = 0.770). This set of nine risk-associated SNPs was selected from the breast and prostate cancer cohort consortium (BPC3) results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], according to reported allelic odds ratio, prevalence and potential linkage disequilibrium.</p><p>While approaches for identifying men at high risk of PCa are still needed, the costs of genetic testing are currently too high to perform large-scale screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Consolidating a broader use of genetic testing in PCa early detection algorithms will require a cheaper and faster though equally high throughput and reliable procedure. Pyrosequencing is a cost-effective DNA sequencing technique that has many applications, including rapid SNP genotyping. The chemiluminescent signal produced during the reaction is detected in the pyrosequencer and displayed in a pyro-signal (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a pyrogram&#8482;) which is then translated into the corresponding nucleotide sequence. Usually, genotyping a single SNP is carried out with one separate reaction in one well (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a uniplex experiment). Genotyping of multiple SNPs using uniplex pyrosequencing requires therefore performing multiple simultaneous or successive reactions for each patient, which impacts reagent costs and Turnaround Time (TAT). A more efficient alternative would be to use simultaneously a set of several pyrosequencing primers in a single well (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a multiplex reaction).</p><p>Duplex (n=2) and triplex (n=3) pyrosequencing applications for SNP genotyping were recently developed using LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], CTLA-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or CYP2C19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] target genes. In these applications, nucleotide dispensation orders were carefully selected and successfully avoided overlapping primer-specific signals. However, only one gene with two to three different SNPs were assayed. For some multiplex pyrosequencing applications, overlapping primer-specific signals are unavoidably created and visually uninterpretable. Accordingly, the AdvISER-M-PYRO software was recently and specifically developed to allow the analysis of overlapping pyro-signals generated from multiplex reactions (i.e, the comprehensive set of each peak height characterizing a well-defined pyro-sequence in uniplex experiments or a combination thereof in multiplex experiments) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In parallel, the pyrosequencing nucleotide dispensation order was improved by developing the SENATOR (&#8220;SElecting the Nucleotide dispensATion Order&#8221;) algorithm. AdvISER-M-PYRO is based on the modelling of multiplex pyro-signals as a sparse representation of elements (named atoms) from a standardized learning dictionary that includes corresponding uniplex pyro-signals. The first application of SENATOR and AdvISER-M-PYRO consisted in genotyping alterations underlying bacterial resistance to <italic>&#946;</italic>-lactam antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, two multiplex assays were developed consisting of a quadruplex and a quintuplex PCR, each followed by pyrosequencing analysis for genotyping a set of PCa-related SNPs (n=9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The dispensation order was selected using SENATOR and multiplex pyro-signals were analyzed with an adapted version of AdvISER-M-PYRO (named AdvISER-MH-PYRO), which integrates a new function allowing bi-allelic SNP genotyping. The analytical reagent costs, waste production and TAT of conventional uniplex and new multiplex pyrosequencing assays were compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and DNA extraction</title><p>Both multiplex pyrosequencing assays were developed and validated on DNA extracted from patient blood (n = 10).

Although protocols for individual SNP genotyping differed initially in terms of MgCl2 concentration (2.25 or 3.0 mM) and number of PCR cycles (35 or 40), subsequent condition testing allowed to standardize the PCR multiplex protocol.</p><p>Multiplex PCR was carried out in a 50 <italic>&#956;</italic>L reaction mixture containing 7 or 10 <italic>&#956;</italic>L (for quadruplex and quintuplex assays, respectively) of the extracted DNA (50 ng), 5 <italic>&#956;</italic>L of a PCR buffer (100 mM Tris hydrochloride, and 500 mM potassium chloride, pH 8.3), 3mM MgCl2, 1U AmpliTaq Gold&#174;; DNA Polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold&#174;; DNA Polymerase kit from Applied Biosystems&#174;;, Austin, USA), 200 <italic>&#956;</italic>M of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs: dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP Li-salts from Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and forward and reverse PCR primers (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (Eurogentec, Li&#232;ge, Belgium). Amplification was performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems&#174;;) using the following conditions: 95 &#176;C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles with denaturation at 95 &#176;C for 40 seconds, annealing at 60 &#176;C for 40 seconds, and extension at 72 &#176;C for 80 seconds, with a final extension step at 72 &#176;C for 7 minutes. Electrophoresis of PCR products was performed on 2 % agarosis gel. Pyrosequencing was then carried out with a pyrosequencer PyroMark PSQ 96 MA Sequencer from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) on PCR products, using a mixture of the pyrosequencing primers (0.4 <italic>&#956;</italic>M each) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), enzymes and substrate (PyroMark Gold&#174;; Q96 Reagents kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. Each PCR and pyrosequencing reaction included a negative control. All uniplex and multiplex pyrosequencing reactions were carried out with the selected dispensation orders. They were also compared in terms of analytical reagent costs, production of waste material and TAT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Multiplex pyro-signal processing using AdvISER-MH-PYRO</title><p>All multiplex pyro-signals were converted into their corresponding genotypes in three successive steps, as described below. Firstly, two standardized learning dictionaries were created, one for the quadruplex, the other for the quintuplex assay. Each dictionary includes a uniplex theoretical pyro-signal for each genotype expected to be found within each genomic region. Aside of the theoretical uniplex pyro-signals (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 7 and 10 in the quadruplex and quintuplex assay, respectively), those generated by uniplex pyrosequencing were also included in both dictionaries. These experimental uniplex pyro-signals were standardized by dividing all peak heights by the corresponding first unitary peak height (FUPH), as previously recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In a second step, each multiplex pyro-signal was analyzed with AdvISER-MH-PYRO software. While not included with the previous AdvISER-M-PYRO version which was dedicated to bacterial DNA genotyping, a new feature was implemented into AdvISER-MH-PYRO in order to carry out bi-allelic SNP genotyping. For these SNPs, the pyro-signal generated by a heterozygous variant results from the superposition of pyro-signals generated by both corresponding homozygous allelic variants which, as expected, disclose peak heights twice higher than their heterozygous counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When the contribution of each homozygous and heterozygous variant is computed for a bi-allelic SNP, a correction factor is then applied by the AdvISER-MH-PYRO version, taking this effect into account. AdvISER-MH-PYRO was implemented in an R package (www.uclouvain.be/ctma.html) that can be applied to analyze multiplex signals generated in a broad range of human SNP genotyping applications.

Accordingly, multiplex PCR and pyrosequencing reactions were first carried out with an initial PCR primer concentration (0.1 <italic>&#956;</italic>M for each SNP) on a first subset of patients (n=3), and contributions of each SNP to the global multiplex pyro-signal were computed with AdvISER-MH-PYRO. Concentrations of PCR primers were then adjusted in order to select the best conditions for balancing the respective contribution of each SNP in multiplex pyro-signals (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interoperability of the dictionary</title><p>Considering that the multiplex pyrosequencing approach, as described in this study, requires building a standardized dictionary based on experimental uniplex pyro-signals, an essential feature of the method appears therefore the interoperability of this dictionary for analyzing multiplex pyro-signals generated by different pyrosequencers. Accordingly, multiplex (quadruplex and quintuplex) pyro-signals generated with the PyroMark Q96 ID sequencer, Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), were analyzed using the same dictionary and AdviSER-PYRO software and compared to original results generated by PyroMark Q96MA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Selection of the nucleotide dispensation order</title><p>SENATOR was used to select a dispensation allowing to differentiate between all UNSs of interest for the current application (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The maximum values of the pairwise correlation coefficients between all multiplex signals were equal to 0.9891 and 0.9892 for the quadruplex and quintuplex assays, respectively.

In this respect, a combination of two multiplex pyrosequencing assays was developed to test in two runs a set of nine prostate cancer-related SNPs. Appropriate nucleotide dispensation orders were selected with the SENATOR function which considers all UNS expected to be found within each genomic region of interest in order to produce uncorrelated uniplex pyrosequencing signals. Multiplex pyro-signals were then analyzed with a new algorithm developed by our team (AdvISER-MH-PYRO). All quadruplex and quintuplex pyro-signals were converted into 4 and 5 genotypes, respectively.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that quadruplex and quintuplex pyro-signals from amplicons generated by a multiplex PCR amplification in a single well are translated into their respective single counterpart and that bi-allelic variants of each target gene are simultaneously identified and assigned. All multiplex results were perfectly (100 %) concordant with uniplex results. The latter were taken as gold-standard in this study, considering that uniplex pyrosequencing distinguishes reliably the specific pattern associated with each of the various genotypes, providing therefore accurate typing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as confirmed in previous studies comparing pyrosequencing versus Sanger sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The analytical reagent costs, waste production and TAT of conventional uniplex and new multiplex pyrosequencing assays were compared. The new multiplex approach allowed to lower costs and waste material production by &#8764;70 % and &#8764;75 %, respectively. In an era where research laboratories strive to be more environmentally-friendly, this new multiplex method could therefore contribute to minimize waste disposal and footprint. The comparison of TAT was also clearly in favor of the multiplex approach. TAT was indeed reduced by &#8764;75 %, without any compromise on results quality and reliability and despite a multiplex pyrosequencing run being 10 min longer due to a higher number of dispensed nucleotides.</p><p>While uniplex SNP pyrosequencing does not compete with with faster and more cost-effective methods (TaqMan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or Sequenom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), current improvements enabling multiplexing makes it a suitable alternative to the latter methods in terms of TAT, cost and waste production. Although not assessed in this study, in-del could also be genotyped in a multiplex experiment with the AdvISER-MH-PYRO algorithm.</p><p>Considering that the AdvISER-MH-PYRO software and both dictionaries are available in the corresponding package (www.uclouvain.be/ctma.html), and that PCR conditions have already been optimized, these new assays can also easily be implemented in other laboratories now. As evidenced by this study, multiplexing has proved to be particularly relevant when developing new rapid, robust, reliable, cleaner and cost-effective SNP genotyping assays. While the added clinical value of MGRS based on 9 PCa risk-associated SNPs proved indeed not bring a major benefit as previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it was technologically interesting to repeat this SNP analysis using the multiplex pyrosequencing method, especially because this method is widely applicable to a range of other clinical and/or research applications, all relying also on MGRS computation, and therefore requiring multi-SNP genotyping for each patient. Such applications are currently developed in a wide range of diseases, including coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For these, the methodology reported in this paper is implementable subject to optimization of primers concentration, to building a standardized uniplex pyro-signals-based dictionary and to carrying out multiplex signal analysis with the newly available AdvISER-MH-PYRO function.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#8217; contributions</bold></p><p>JA, VB and JLG designed the study.
