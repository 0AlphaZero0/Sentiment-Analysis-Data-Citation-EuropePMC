Indeed, in order to cope with the radiation damage observed at room temperature, the crystal structure solution of myoglobin required the merging of partial data sets, each comprising a single precession photograph, from 22 crystals per heavy-atom derivative (Kendrew <italic>et al.</italic>, 1960<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb36"> &#9656;</xref>). However, with the introduction of cryogenic data-collection techniques (Hope, 1988<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb31"> &#9656;</xref>) the effects of radiation damage could be limited dramatically. This generally allowed the collection of complete data sets from single crystals of biological macromolecules, even at beamlines at high-intensity third-generation synchrotron sources, and this soon became the norm.</p><p>The emergence of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) saw multi-crystal data collection in MX revived and taken to its logical limits. Owing to the exceptionally bright nature of XFEL beams, experimenters adopted a &#8216;diffraction before destruction&#8217; approach, dubbed serial femtosecond crystallo&#173;graphy (SFX), streaming microcrystals through the X-ray beam and collecting still diffraction images where the crystal and X-ray laser pulse coincide (Chapman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> &#9656;</xref>). Complete data sets are then compiled by combining data from many thousands of still diffraction images. While SFX is likely to prove a watershed in MX, chiefly because the crystal structures determined using the technique should be largely free of radiation damage (Neutze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb44"> &#9656;</xref>; Boutet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#9656;</xref>), the technique is not without its disadvantages. In particular, the amount of protein required in SFX experiments is currently rather high even for structure solution based on molecular-replacement techniques (<italic>i.e.</italic> only native data sets are collected). Moreover, although software for SFX data analysis is rapidly developing (Sauter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb57"> &#9656;</xref>; White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb65"> &#9656;</xref>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb64"> &#9656;</xref>; Barty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> &#9656;</xref>; Sawaya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb58"> &#9656;</xref>), as the diffraction images collected in such experiments contain predominantly partially recorded reflections measured from crystals of different sizes with laser pulses of different spectral content, estimation of the intensity (and its standard deviation) of any given reflection is problematical and data-processing methods will have to evolve significantly if the quality of SFX-collected data is to approach that currently available in &#8216;traditional&#8217; MX experiments.</p><p>Inspired by the success of SFX, experimenters at synchrotron MX beamlines have used similar paradigms (bright X-ray beams, fast read-out detectors, small crystals, single-exposure experiments) to develop synchrotron serial crystallography (SSX), showing that it is possible to compile useful data sets from hundreds or thousands of crystals introduced into the synchrotron beam either <italic>via</italic> jets (Nogly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb45"> &#9656;</xref>), liquid streams in glass capillaries (Stellato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb62"> &#9656;</xref>), free-standing high-viscosity micro-streams (Botha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> &#9656;</xref>), sandwiched between two silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>; Coquelle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb17"> &#9656;</xref>) or cyclic olefin copolymer (COC; Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb32"> &#9656;</xref>) wafers that are translated through the X-ray beam, or contained on a cryocooled sample holder (Gati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> &#9656;</xref>). In the latter case the whole sample mount is continuously rastered through the X-ray beam, being rotated at the same time (de Sanctis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb54"> &#9656;</xref>), and diffraction images are recorded on the fly at set time intervals. As for crystals introduced into the X-ray beam in liquid streams or on silicon nitride wafers, the large majority of diffraction images collected contain no useful information. However, that fact that the sample is also rotated while being rastered means that where the crystal and the X-ray beam coincide some diffraction images could contain fully recorded reflections, thus rendering the processing and scaling of diffraction images using standard software packages relatively straightforward and improving the overall data quality. Moreover, for crystals larger than the X-ray beam, diffraction images can be grouped into those originating from the same crystal, thus also facilitating data processing and improving the resulting data quality (Gati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> &#9656;</xref>).</p><p>While for the same crystal volume and X-ray beam size the resolution obtainable in SSX experiments is likely to always be lower than that in SFX, SSX will become an important technique in MX. In particular, initial crystals of many systems are often small and SSX provides a means to study them without the need for the often time-consuming and cumbersome optimization of crystal size and/or quality. Indeed, when combined with the extremely bright X-rays beams that will be available at future low-emittance fourth-generation storage rings (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esrf.fr/Apache_files/Upgrade/ESRF-orange-book.pdf">http://www.esrf.fr/Apache_files/Upgrade/ESRF-orange-book.pdf</ext-link>), such experiments may well become the norm. However, even when rastering samples contained on a cryocooled sample holder through the X-ray beam, SSX often suffers, as does SFX, from the fact that no attempt is made to synchronize the intersection of the X-ray beam and crystal during the experiment. Moreover, as the SFX &#8216;diffraction before destruction&#8217; principle currently does not apply in SSX experiments on cryocooled samples, the amount of diffraction data collected from any given crystal is far from optimized.</p><p>Recent developments based on either the optical (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb32"> &#9656;</xref>) or diffraction-based (Soares <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb61"> &#9656;</xref>) pre-interrogation of multi-crystal sample holders have ensured the synchronization of X-ray beam and crystals in SSX protocols and have enormously reduced the amount of sample required for a successful experiment. In a further step towards the optimal collection of diffraction data in SSX experiments from samples which can sustain the collection of many X-ray diffraction images before significant radiation damage occurs, we have developed an automatic procedure (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>). Here, the positions of many randomly oriented (micro)crystals contained in a single cryocooled sample holder are determined using an X-ray-based two-dimensional scan, the diffraction strength of each crystal found is automatically ranked and partial data sets from each crystal are collected and processed online. Subsequent manual hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA; Giordano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"> &#9656;</xref>) is then used to decide the most correlated partial data sets to merge to produce the best quality data set for use in downstream analysis and structure solution. The protocol developed can in principle be applied to crystals mounted in almost any type of currently available mounting platform (<italic>i.e.</italic> nylon loops, micro-meshes, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> or COC wafers <italic>etc.</italic>) and is applicable not only to multi-crystal data collection but additionally automates multi-position data collection from large crystals when exploiting mini-focus or micro-focus X-ray beams.</p><p>As proof of the general usefulness of the protocol developed, we present the results of applying this method to various systems and scenarios. These include the compilation of a complete data set from microcrystals of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, the collection and merging of partial data sets collected from different positions of larger crystals and the collection of data sets for use in structure determination using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion techniques.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2.</label><title>Methods &#160; </title><p>In the experiments described here, the best results were obtained from crystals mounted in a flat sample holder (<italic>i.e.</italic> MiTeGen MicroMeshes; MiTeGen, USA; Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>a</italic>), avoiding stacking of crystals and an excess of surrounding mother liquor, before either flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen or directly on the beamline. When mounted on a goniometer, the plane of the sample holder should be perpendicular to the direction of the X-ray beam. This ensures that any crystal brought into the X-ray beam will remain illuminated over a relatively small rotation range (&#177;5&#176; in the experiments described here<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>). To make this adjustment, we usually exploit the mini-kappa goniometers (Brockhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb11"> &#9656;</xref>) installed on most of the MX beamlines at the ESRF. The <italic>MeshAndCollect</italic> protocol (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>b</italic>) is implemented in a customized Passerelle-EDM workflow engine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://isencia.be/passerelle-edm-en">http://isencia.be/passerelle-edm-en</ext-link>) called the <italic>Beamline Expert System</italic> that is based on previous developments (Brockhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> &#9656;</xref>) and is embedded in the <italic>MXCuBE</italic>2 beamline-control graphical user interface (Gabadinho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb24"> &#9656;</xref>; de Sanctis &amp; Leonard, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb55"> &#9656;</xref>). Once the workflow has been launched the user defines the size of the X-ray beam to be used. Ideally, this should correspond to, or be smaller than, the minimum dimension of the crystals contained in the sample holder. The area over which the initial two-dimensional mesh scan is performed (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) is drawn by the user, with the dimensions of the grid and the X-ray beam size defining the number of points in the mesh scan. Diffraction images collected at each of these points are analysed on the fly for protein diffraction using the software <italic>DOZOR</italic> (&#167;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.1"/>2.1). The user receives a heat map (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>), also stored in the ISPyB database (Delageni&#232;re <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb19"> &#9656;</xref>), showing the grid points at which diffraction has been observed. The user then has the possibility of adjusting the contrast level to include or exclude points for subsequent data collection. In the last experimental step partial data sets (&#177;5&#176; total rotation range, 100 images per partial data set) are collected sequentially at each grid point with a <italic>DOZOR</italic> score above the threshold. Each partial data set is automatically processed using the <italic>GrenADes</italic> pipeline (Monaco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb40"> &#9656;</xref>) based on <italic>XDS</italic> (Kabsch, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb35"> &#9656;</xref>) running in parallel with the data collection. Partial data sets that have been successfully processed are then scaled together using <italic>XSCALE</italic> (Kabsch, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb35"> &#9656;</xref>). The resulting CC<sub><italic>I</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) values calculated for the common unique intensities of each pair of data sets are used in a HCA protocol (Giordano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"> &#9656;</xref>) to produce a dendrogram (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>). This is then used to decide which partial data sets to combine to produce, using the <italic>CCP</italic>4 programs <italic>POINTLESS</italic> and <italic>AIMLESS</italic> (Evans &amp; Murshudov, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> &#9656;</xref>), the final data set for structure solution and refinement (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>). A feature of <italic>POINTLESS</italic> is that it uses the first partial data set provided as input as a reference data set. This avoids, where it might have been possible during automatic data processing, indexing ambiguities between partial data sets, with the result that the merged data set obtained is not artifactually merohedrally twinned (for a discussion of this, see Brehm &amp; Diederichs, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> &#9656;</xref>). Any twinning then detected (<italic>i.e.</italic> using the &#8216;<italic>H</italic>-test&#8217;; Yeates, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb66"> &#9656;</xref>) in the final merged data set, although an average over all crystals included, is likely to be real, facilitating determination of the true space group for use with the correct twinning fraction (if appropriate) in subsequent structure solution and refinement. </p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1.</label><title>
<italic>DOZOR</italic> &#160; </title><p>One of the core features of the protocol described here is the ability to automatically recognize and rank the series of single diffraction patterns collected during the low-dose mesh scan of the sample holder. This is carried out using the program <italic>DOZOR</italic>. As the algorithm used will be illustrated in more detail elsewhere, it will be only briefly described here.</p><p>In a first step, <italic>DOZOR</italic> determines the distribution of background intensity on a diffraction image as a function of the diffraction vector length <italic>h</italic>. This is accomplished by the iterative summation of pixel intensities and the sequential rejection of outliers. After azimuthal averaging this produces the one-dimensional background function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="d-71-02328-efi1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

Notably, a very low X-ray dose pre-screening of a sample mount is used to both identify the positions of crystals contained on the sample mount and to rank the diffraction characteristics of the crystals in order to create a priority for the subsequent automatic collection of partial data sets, and a HCA protocol is used to choose which partial data sets to merge to produce the best final data set. Moreover, when the sample holder contains a series of crystals much larger than the X-ray beam the method also automates the type of multi-crystal/multi-position data collection (Riekel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb53"> &#9656;</xref>) that has become essential in the structural study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; Rasmussen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb51"> &#9656;</xref>; Hollenstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb30"> &#9656;</xref>; Lebon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb38"> &#9656;</xref>).

In all of the cases presented our workflow has yielded data sets that are fit for purpose (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9656;</xref>, &#167;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4.2"/>4.2). As might be expected (Fry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb23"> &#9656;</xref>), the protocol described here is particularly amenable to systems (<italic>i.e.</italic> thaumatin, bacteriorhodopsin, Maelstrom) that crystallize in high-symmetry space groups. However, our experiments using monoclinic crystals of lysozyme show that the method can also be applied to low-symmetry systems. Furthermore, as the monoclinic form of lysozyme crystallized as clumps of intergrown crystals (Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>a</italic>), the success of this latter experiment demonstrates that the protocol developed also automates the collection of diffraction data using mini-focus or micro-focus X-ray beams under conditions where mounting single crystals of a particular sample may prove to be difficult or impossible.</p><p>It is worth noting that the completeness of the data set obtained for monoclinic lysozyme following the HCA-directed merging of the partial data set collected is rather incomplete (21 of 40 automatically processed partial data sets merged, 85% completeness; Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9656;</xref>). However, this is not the result of a combination of low-symmetry crystals lying in preferred orientations in the sample holder. Indeed, merging 39 of the 40 automatically processed partial data sets greatly improves the completeness (Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>g</italic>). However, the quality of the resulting data set is seriously degraded compared with that obtained by merging only partial data sets in the main HCA cluster (Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>g</italic>). Moreover, in contrast to what is observed following HCA-directed merging, the resulting difference electron density does not allow the proper identification of nitrate ions bound to the protein (Figs. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>f</italic> and 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>h</italic>). It is thus clear that HCA is an indispensable tool for the proper merging of partial data sets. Nevertheless, that the merged data set for monoclinic lysozyme obtained following HCA is somewhat incomplete suggests, for some low-symmetry systems at least, that data collection from samples in two loops with different orientations in the X-ray beam may be required to ensure a fully complete, high-quality data set.</p><p>The examples that we present include the compilation of complete diffraction data from partial data sets collected from a series of microcrystals (&#8764;5&#8197;&#181;m in the largest dimension), contained on the same sample holder, of a membrane protein (bacteriorhodopsin) grown in lipidic mesophase. Such mesophases are very important media for the growth of membrane-protein crystals (Gordeliy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb28"> &#9656;</xref>), but are often opaque in nature, particularly when cooled. It can thus be challenging to identify, mount and centre in the X-ray beam small crystals produced in such media. That the workflow described here uses diffraction-based methods to identify the positions of crystals in a sample holder is clearly a major advantage in such cases as it obviates such problems, particularly when entire crystallization drops are harvested, by automating the collection of partial data sets from multiple crystals.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2.</label><title>Structure solution and refinement &#160; </title><sec id="sec4.2.1"><label>4.2.1.</label><title>Diffraction data for structure solution by molecular replacement &#160; </title><p>The examples of bacteriorhodopsin (BR1 and BR2), thaumatin and monoclinic lysozyme described above clearly show that the protocol that we have developed yields, even for very small crystals, complete diffraction data sets that allow structure solution by MR.

Traditionally, such projects are based around the production of relatively large, robust crystals for use in soaking experiments (Oster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb47"> &#9656;</xref>). However, the results presented here show that this clearly does not need to be the case and that complete, high-quality data sets could straightforwardly be compiled from a series of smaller crystals mounted on the same sample holder. Moreover, as evidence suggests that smaller crystals require reduced fragment/ligand-soaking times to obtain the same occupancy of the fragment/ligand in crystal structures (Cole <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> &#9656;</xref>), microcrystal-based fragment screening experiments may well become the norm, with soaking times based on the largest crystal contained in the crystallization drop ensuring the maximum occupancy of ligands/fragments in all of the crystals mounted on a single sample loop.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2.2"><label>4.2.2.</label><title>Diffraction data for structure solution exploiting anomalous scattering &#160; </title><p>In order to demonstrate the possibilities of the workflow presented here to produce data suitable for experimental phasing techniques that exploit anomalous scattering, two different systems were investigated. The first of these, thermolysin, contains one catalytic Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion and three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions per protein chain (316 residues), producing a theoretical anomalous diffraction ratio (&#9001;&#916;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>&#9002;) of &#8764;2% for data collected at the peak of the Zn&#8197;<italic>K</italic> absorption edge.

However, the crystals of this system diffract rather poorly (see Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9656;</xref>). The collection of data of sufficiently high quality for the structure solution of both systems is thus clearly challenging, even from single crystals. Nevertheless, as can be seen in Figs. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref> and 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>, for both systems our multi-crystal workflow clearly yields diffraction data of sufficient quality for structure solution. As might be expected, a high data multiplicity was important in both cases (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9656;</xref>) and to achieve this for Maelstrom required combining partial data sets from crystals mounted on six different sample holders (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>

Subsequent HCA of the partial data sets collected then allows the choice of which partial data sets to merge to produce a final data set for downstream structure solution and refinement. Compared with previously presented SSX protocols (Gati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> &#9656;</xref>; Nogly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb45"> &#9656;</xref>; Stellato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb62"> &#9656;</xref>), <italic>MeshAndCollect</italic> has several advantages, notably that small but contiguous data sets can, if desired, be collected from all crystals contained on the sample holder. Crystal wastage is thus not an issue, data reduction from raw diffraction images to structure factors and standard deviations is comparably straightforward and the quality of the final data set is improved. Moreover, the experiments described in &#167;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3"/>3 clearly demonstrate the capability of <italic>DOZOR</italic> to detect diffraction signal in low-dose two-dimensional mesh scans even for the smallest crystals (BR2; &#167;3.1<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.1"/>) studied in this work, which had an average volume of &#8764;50&#8197;&#181;m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>When starting this work, we presumed that cryocooled crystals contained on the same loop would be relatively isomorphous as all crystals are from the same crystallization drop and subject to similar handling during mounting and cryocooling (Giordano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"> &#9656;</xref>). The dendrograms shown in Figs. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> &#9656;</xref>, 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> &#9656;</xref>, 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> &#9656;</xref>, 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> &#9656;</xref> and 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref> suggest that this is the case, although in several of our examples many of the partial data sets collected are not used to construct the final result. Most of the above histograms contain one main cluster with high mutual correlation coefficients and a continuum of data sets with decreasingly low correlation to the main cluster. Such a pattern is indicative of strongly varying data quality between partial data sets rather than crystal non-isomorphism and suggests that some partial data sets were collected from positions with overlapping crystal lattices or other issues such as crystal damage. Clearly, the evaluation of initial two-dimensional mesh scans with <italic>DOZOR</italic> did not filter such positions out. Furthermore, with only a 10&#176; rotation range measured at each position it is difficult to detect such problematic data sets on the basis of their internal processing statistics, and HCA is required to filter out the worst partial data sets. In the case of Maelstrom, where partial data sets were measured from crystals on several different sample mounts, the dendrogram (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>) shows well populated clusters above a cutoff of dist(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) = 0.15 and a continuum of poorly correlated data sets below this cutoff. This suggests that both non-isomorphism and variation in data quality between partial data sets is present. However, as can be seen, both poor-quality and non-isomorphous partial data sets are successfully filtered by the HCA procedure.</p><p>Despite the success of the experiments described above, the procedure developed will eventually be improved in many areas. Here, all samples were mounted and cryocooled manually, and it may be that better results can be achieved by taking advantage of robotic crystal-handling methods both for the removal of mother liquor from the crystallization drop and the mounting and cryocooling of crystals in a suitable sample holder (Cipriani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> &#9656;</xref>). Moreover, for the different experiments described here the total absorbed doses per crystal (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> &#9656;</xref>; calculated post-experiment using <italic>RADDOSE</italic>; Paithankar &amp; Garman, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb49"> &#9656;</xref>) are rather low compared with the Henderson/Garman limits (Henderson, 1990<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb29"> &#9656;</xref>; Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb48"> &#9656;</xref>) generally used in diffraction data collection from cryocooled single crystals of macromolecules. In future versions of the pipeline presented here, following the low-dose two-dimensional mesh scan the optimum total exposure time per crystal (partial data set) will be calculated before the data-collection step using the <italic>EDNA</italic> characterization software (Bourenkov &amp; Popov, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#9656;</xref>; Incardona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb33"> &#9656;</xref>), the result being better quality and/or higher resolution data collected per crystal. For crystals that are highly radiation-sensitive one might even imagine the use of a &#8216;Burn Strategy&#8217; workflow (Leal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb37"> &#9656;</xref>) to provide a precise estimation of the maximum allowable total absorbed dose per crystal.</p><p>As the <italic>EDNA</italic> procedure implies the indexing of diffraction patterns (Incardona <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb33"> &#9656;</xref>), comparison, for crystals larger than the X-ray beam, of orientation matrices will allow either the pre-clustering of partial data sets collected from different points on the same crystal or the measurement of crystal size and alignment in the sample holder. In the latter case this information could be used to automatically guide helical data collections (Flot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"> &#9656;</xref>; de Sanctis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb54"> &#9656;</xref>) that, provided that diffraction is homogenous, may allow the collection of complete data sets from each of the different crystals contained in the sample holder. For crystals of a similar or smaller size than the X-ray beam prior knowledge of the crystal orientation in the X-ray beam will allow a broader range of experiments than is currently the case. In particular, the order of the collection of partial data sets could be constructed to ensure the compilation of a complete data set when only a few crystals are available or to ensure the collection of as highly redundant data as possible. Finally, for sample mounts containing many small robust, well diffracting crystals one can also imagine a modification to the pipeline in which complete diffraction data sets for structure solution and subsequent refinement are collected from all crystals contained in the sample holder. Separating such data sets into different clusters would result in ensembles of crystal structures for each target.</p><p>Once data collection and processing have been completed, a final improvement to the pipeline is in the choice of partial data sets to merge to produce a final data set. This choice clearly depends on the aim of the experiment in hand (<italic>i.e.</italic> structure solution by molecular replacement, <italic>de novo</italic> structure solution using SAD <italic>etc.</italic>), and in principle is best made using HCA based on CC<sub><italic>I</italic></sub>(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) (&#167;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2"/>2; Giordano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb26"> &#9656;</xref>). However, for partial data sets from low-symmetry crystals the number of common unique reflections for each pair of data sets may be low, thus leading to artefacts, and a better approach may be to combine HCA with the type of &#8216;scale-and-merge&#8217; algorithms currently implemented in the <italic>PHENIX</italic> package (Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb1"> &#9656;</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phenix-online.org/version_docs/dev-1977/reference/scale_and_merge.html">https://www.phenix-online.org/version_docs/dev-1977/reference/scale_and_merge.html</ext-link>) or recently described for other SSX protocols (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb32"> &#9656;</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions &#160; </title><p>We have presented here a pipeline for the routine collection of partial diffraction data sets from many randomly oriented crystals of the same biological macromolecule contained in a single cryocooled sample holder. The major advantages of the pipeline developed are (i) that it can be applied to crystals mounted in almost any available sample holder suitable for cryocooling, thus rendering the methodology available to the widest possible range of potential users, (ii) that the positions of all well diffracting crystals are determined and that their diffraction strength is ranked prior to data collection, (iii) that small, but contiguous, partial data sets are collected from as many crystals contained in the sample holder as is desired and (iv) that HCA is used to choose partial data sets for merging to produce the best possible data set for downstream analysis and structure solution. As described above, the protocol developed can be applied to both SSX-type experiments involving microcrystals and to multi-position data collection from crystals larger than the X-ray beam size. The results presented here suggest that the method developed will be useful in all areas of macromolecular crystallography, including the compilation of a complete data set from many very small crystals (&#8764;5&#8197;&#181;m in the largest dimension), in structure determination exploiting anomalous scattering and in projects aimed at rational drug design.</p><p>While we have confined our experiments to crystals mounted on cryocooled sample holders, there is no reason, providing that the increased radiation damage is taken into account, that the automated screening and data-collection procedure developed cannot also be applied at room temperature, particularly in experiments that involve <italic>in situ</italic> screening and data collection (Axford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb2"> &#9656;</xref>; Jacquamet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb34"> &#9656;</xref>; le Maire <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb39"> &#9656;</xref>; Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb32"> &#9656;</xref>).

(<italic>a</italic>) A mesh scan is performed on the sample. The resulting images are automatically inspected for protein diffraction and scored according to diffraction strength. A heat map is generated that represents the diffraction intensity, where the positions for partial data collections are marked. After the user has selected the settings for the partial data collections, the <italic>MxCuBE</italic>2 data-collection queue is automatically filled and all partial data sets are collected.
