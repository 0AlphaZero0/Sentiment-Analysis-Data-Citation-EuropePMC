These viruses show a high genetic compatibility with other subtypes of AIVs and have been involved in the genesis of H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8 viruses causing severe infection in humans. The first case of human infection with H9N2 viruses in Hunan province of China have been confirmed in November 2013 and identified that H9N2 viruses from live poultry markets (LPMs) near the patient&#8217;s house could be the source of infection. However, the prevalence, distribution and genetic characteristics of H9N2 viruses in LPMs all over the province are not clear. We collected and tested 3943 environmental samples from 380 LPMs covering all 122 counties/districts of Hunan province from February to April, 2014. A total of 618 (15.7%) samples were H9 subtype positive and 200 (52.6%) markets in 98 (80.3%) counties/districts were contaminated with H9 subtype AIVs. We sequenced the entire coding sequences of the genomes of eleven H9N2 isolates from environmental samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene sequences of the H9N2 AIVs exhibited high homology (94.3%-100%). All eleven viruses were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees and belonged to a same genotype. No gene reassortment had been found. Molecular analysis demonstrated that all the viruses had typical molecular characteristics of contemporary avian H9N2 influenza viruses. Continued surveillance of AIVs in LPMs is warranted for identification of further viral evolution and novel reassortants with pandemic potential.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the grant from Hunan Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission, China (C2015-63), and by the National Science and Technology Key Project of China (2013ZX10004-202).

These viruses are lowly virulent for poultry, frequently cause mild disease and rarely result in poultry deaths. However, they have been associated with severe morbidity and mortality in poultry when they co-infected with other pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Occasionally H9N2 viruses have been identified in pigs and humans [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. H9N2 AIVs in Asia can be divided into three main lineages represented by their prototype strains based on antigenic and phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin: A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94 (BJ94) or the A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (Y280), A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (G1), and A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97 (Y439) or A/Chicken/Korea/96323/96 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The BJ94-like viruses are primarily prevalent in chickens and have beengradually substituted by F98-like viruses represented by A/Ck/Shangha/F/98 (F98) in the East and South China [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to the constellation of eight viral gene segments, multiple genotypes of H9N2 viruses have been generated by complicated gene segment reassortment [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At least 98 genotypes are divided into seven series (A-G) worldwide from 1966 to 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, a novel genotype (G57) or genotype S represented by A/chicken/Zhejiang/HJ/2007(HJ07) emerged in 2007 and became predominant in farm chickens in China since 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>H9N2 viruses show a high genetic compatibility with other subtypes of AIVs and have been involved in the genesis of novel AIVs causing severe infection in humans [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses caused the first human infection in Hong Kong in 1997 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. High homology of virus genomes suggested that internal genes of some H9 viruses were closely related to the human H5N1 influenza viruses of Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The novel H7N9 AIVs that have been firstly identified in Anhui province and Shanghai city of China have quickly spread to several provinces and led to many human infections and deaths since 2013. Gene sequence analysis of the pathogens showed that all six internal genes of the H7N9 viruses were derived from H9N2 viruses [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A similar conclusion applies to the human-infecting H10N8 viruses in Jiangxi province of China in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Circulation of H9N2 viruses in live poultry markets (LPMs) continues to pose a serious public health threat. Like other developing countries, LPMs in China are part of the everyday food supply chain that offer poultry meat and live birds for sale. However LPMs also provide sites for different subtypes of avian influenza virus mixing, transmission and exchange of gene segments, and for zoonotic transfer between humans and poultry [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, LPM exposure history is considered to be a main risk factor for human infection with AIVs [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Closure of LPMs has a measurable effect on infection spread control [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In Hunan province of China, influenza monitoring continues to catch human cases infected with AIVs. Six cases of human infection with H5N1 AIVs have been confirmed in the province including the first case in mainland China since 2005, while the first laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with H9N2 viruses in the province was diagnosed in November 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Epidemiological investigation identified that H9N2 viruses from LPMs near the patient&#8217;s house could be the source of infection [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the ecology of H9N2 viruses in LPMs all over the province is not clear. For a comprehensive assessment of the ecology of AIVs in LPMs in Hunan province, as well as providing a scientific basis for prediction and warning of possible influenza pandemics, here we describe the detection and genetic characteristics of H9N2 viruses in LPMs of Hunan province in 2014.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Hunan province lies in south-central China and is administratively divided into 14 cities, 122 counties/districts.

All the viruses except the A/Environment/Hunan/27408/2014 had a R-S-S-R connecting peptide in the cleavage site of the HA molecule, which is a typical feature of land avian influenza viruses [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The HA receptor binding sites had a 226L motif (H3 numbering), suggesting that these viruses could preferentially have affinity for human-like &#945;-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. All the viruses had a 3-amino acid deletion at positions 63&#8211;65 in the NA stalk region. It has been reported that this deletion might be necessary for virus adaptation from wild birds to poultry [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. No H274Y substitution was observed in the NA protein, which indicated that these viruses would be sensitive to NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The S31N/G sequence of M2 protein suggested that all these viruses were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All the viruses maintained 627E and 701D in PB2 of the low pathogenic AIV signatures [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pone.0142584.t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0142584.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of critical amino acid residues in proteins of H9N2 avian influenza viruses from live poultry markets in Hunan province, China.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0142584.t004g" xlink:href="pone.0142584.t004"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t004fn001"><p>

We discovered that 15.7% samples were positive for H9, while more than half of the LPMs and more than four-fifths counties/districts were contaminated with H9 subtype viruses. The sequenced H9N2 viruses were highly homologous in gene sequence, belonged to the same genotype and had some specific molecular features. These results provide baseline information for the prevalence of H9N2 AIVs in LPMs of Hunan province, and provide a scientific basis for prevention and control of avian influenza in Hunan province and help early warning forecast for influenza pandemics.</p><p>Our findings provide further evidence that LPMs are heavily contaminated with AIVs [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The positive rate for influenza A of Hunan province was 39.4%, higher than that of Nanchang, nearby Jiangxi province (~30%)[<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The H9 subtype positive rate was also higher than that of nearby Guangdong province (11.8%)[<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These results indicated that identification the first human case of H9N2 viruses of Hunan province was no accident. In various mixtures of subtypes of AIVs, the H9 subtype occupied a high proportion and was a predominant strain. That mixture of different HA subtype AIVs provided the possibility for the emergence of novel reassortant viruses and partially explained why the six internal gene segments of H7N9 and H10N8 viruses were derived from H9N2 viruses. Sewage and poultry drinking water were main issues for sampling and disinfection since they had the highest positive rates among different sample types. Geographical distribution of H9 subtype AIVs were mainly in the north, northeast, south and southwest of Hunan province. However little is known about why these viruses have this distribution pattern and how they spread.</p><p>Dongting lake wetland in Hunan province, which is on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway of migratory birds, plays an important role in the ecology of AIVs by supporting complex reassortment [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this region H9N2 viruses isolated from wild birds and poultry are distinct [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Another aim of this study was to see whether reassortment of AIVs occurs in LPMs between poultry and wild birds. Our data demonstrated that all eleven viruses belonged to a same genotype and no gene reassortment was found.</p><p>Genotype G57 of H9N2 viruses became the single predominant H9N2 genotype in the farm chicken population in China, caused widespread outbreaks in 2010&#8211;2013 and provided all of their internal genes to the novel H7N9 viruses [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A previous study showed that two H9N2 viruses isolated from poultry markets in Hunan province in 2011 and 2012 exhibited genetic diversity, with their PB1 genes in different evolutional lineages [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the data from our study suggested all sequenced H9N2 viruses had a similar genome constellation, as well as belonged to genotype G57, which was still predominant in LPMs of Hunan province in 2014. Although the geographic distribution of our isolates covered eight of fourteen cities, we still did not found genotype diversity. One possible reason is circulation of live poultry trading leading to the spread of a single genotype of virus. Another possibility is that the range and numbers of our monitoring were not enough to find genetic reassortment. Therefore, we need to continue to strengthen avian influenza surveillance in LPMs and improve monitoring sensitivity.</p><p>Studies indicated that H9N2 viruses with 226L in the HA molecule could replicate in ferrets and be transmitted by direct contact [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This variant was found in 76% of the H9N2 viruses in chicken in Central Asia and the Middle East [<xref rid="pone.0142584.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142584.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our findings demonstrated that all eleven viruses were 226L variants and several viruses had mutations in other key sites. The transmission and virulence of these viruses should be further tested and verified in mammalian animal models.</p><p>In summary, we conducted LPM surveys for AIVs in all 122 counties/districts of Hunan province in China and performed preliminary analysis of genetic characteristics of the H9N2 viruses isolated from LPMs of different cities. Our findings extend our knowledge of the ecology of H9N2 AIVs circulating in LPMs and provide significant insights into molecular evolution of these viruses. We emphasize the importance for continued surveillance of AIVs in LPMs for identification of further AIV evolution and response to potential influenza pandemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142584.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the PB2 and PB1 genes of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses from live poultry markets in Hunan province, China.</title><p>Phylogenetic trees of the entire coding nucleotide sequences for the genes of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses in this study compared with nucleotide sequences of representative H9N2 viruses of G1, Y280, and Y439 lineages.
