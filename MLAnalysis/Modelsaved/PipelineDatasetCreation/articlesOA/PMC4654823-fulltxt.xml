A limitation of several recently proposed infection markers is the lack of larger cohorts providing populational serum concentration measurements in order to establish normal reference values. This is important because the performance of most biomarkers is context-sensitive and in some cases age-specific. For example, C-reactive protein is increased after surgical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which reduces its specificity to diagnose infections in postoperative patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) is physiologically elevated during the first 48 h of life, which has to be taken into account when defining optimal cutoffs for the diagnosis of neonatal early-onset sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Pancreatic stone protein (PSP) has recently emerged as a promising marker of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. PSP has so far been studied predominantly in adults, and was shown to predict multi-organ failure and mortality in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and post-traumatic sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A study using a bioscore combinding PSP with procalcitonin (PCT) significantly improved the ability to diagnose neonatal early-onset sepsis, with a negative predictive value of 100 % if both PSP and PCT were negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These data suggest that PSP is a promising candidate for further studies assessing performance and use in clinical practice. To date, however, no reference values are available for PSP. While its main physiological role is poorly understood, PSP may act by promoting cellular proliferative responses in the pancreas and was shown to activate polymorphonuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Animal studies have shown induction of PSP expression in subsets of intestinal and gastric cells by stress conditions in the absence of direct pancreatic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The present study aimed to determine circulating PSP serum levels in healthy individuals from birth to adulthood in order to provide reference values for clinical use and future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Subjects for this study were recruited through three different studies conducted between July 1<sup>st</sup> 2009 and December 31<sup>st</sup> 2012.

The study was submitted to and approved by the institutional ethics committees at each of the involved hospitals (Cantonal Ethics Committees of the Canton of Berne, Canton of Zurich and Canton of Lucerne, and Bicantonal Ethics Committee of Basel, Switzerland). Written consent from the parents of pediatric participants, and from adult study participants was obtained.</p><p>104 patients included in this study were enrolled through the prospective, randomized-controlled multicentre Neonatal Procalcitonin Intervention Study (NeoPInS, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, trial number NCT00854932) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in three Swiss neonatal intensive care units (Department of Neonatology, University Children&#8217;s Hospital Bern and Children&#8217;s Hospital Lucerne; Department of Pediatrics, Cantonal Hospital Winterthur, Switzerland). Children were included in the present study only if they were admitted within the first 72 h of life to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for suspicion of early-onset sepsis that was subsequently ruled out. Infection was ruled out using all of the following criteria: 1. Negative cultures, 2. Normal infection markers, 3. No signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Newborns with complex congenital malformations, chromosomal aberrations, and congenital heart disease and those who died within the first week after admission were excluded.</p><p>Umbilical cord blood samples were obtained in 113 patients. Umbilical cord samples paired with postnatal samples were obtained prospectively at the University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland, between August 2011 and April 2012 in preterm and term newborns in the absence of major neonatal disease, infections or comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Umbilical cord blood was collected from the umbilical artery (UA) and the umbilical vein (UV) after delivery of the placenta.

To cover the wide age range from preterm and term neonates over children to adults, Age<sub>Graphics</sub> calculated in years from week 0 gestational age (wGA) was used here. The specific calculations were Age<sub>Graphics</sub> = wGA/52 for neonates, and Age<sub>Graphics</sub> = age in years + 40/52 for children and adults. The age-dependent estimate of the mean and its 95 % confidence interval were calculated by fourth degree linear regression. The adjacent categories method, applying the Wilcoxon&#8211; Mann&#8211;Whitney test, was used to determine which age categories had significantly different PSP concentrations as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It started with 12 categories defined by 11 age limits set at &lt;32 and &lt;37 (preterm neonates), &lt;40, and &lt;42 wGA (term neonates), &lt;1 year (infants), &lt;4, &lt;8, &lt;12, and &lt;16 years (children and adolescents), and &lt;30 and &lt;50 years (adults). Then, adjacent age categories with the least significant differences were combined step by step until concentrations were significantly different between the resulting combined age categories. For these categories, the minimum, the 10th percentile (P10), P25, the median (P50), P75, P90, the maximum, and the number and proportion of results &#8804; P10 in adults and &#8805; P90 in adults were calculated.</p><p>Bland-Altman plots were constructed, and the mean bias and the 95 % limits of agreement were calculated based on logarithmized concentrations.</p><p>Two-sided tests were used throughout, and <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Control samples in adults were received from volunteers of a Caucasian population with a median age of 45 years (19&#8211;82). There was no gender difference in the PSP values in adults.</p><p>PSP ranged from 1.0 to 99.4 ng/ml with a median of 9.2 ng/ml. PSP was non-normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks test statistic, W = 0.6793; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas logarithmically transformed PSP concentrations were approximately normally distributed (W = 0.989; <italic>p</italic> = 0.007; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The results indicate that PSP shows a relevant age-dependent variation, with lowest values observed in premature newborns, followed by a rise until childhood and adolescence. We observed a slight decrease of PSP serum concentrations in adults in comparison to children and adolescents. We observed a significant increase of PSP with increasing gestational age, and a more than twofold postnatal rise.</p><p>PSP has predominantly been studied in critically ill adults, with highest levels found in patients with sepsis and multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In recent ICU based studies, high PSP levels predicted mortality in septic adults, whereas established infection markers such as CRP or PCT were increased in presence of infections, but did not allow to stratify for sepsis mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a study on critically ill children, PSP levels were significantly higher in patients with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and patients who died tended to have higher PSP levels accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similarly, increased PSP levels were observed in newborns with early-onset sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The performance of PSP was comparable or superior to other markers such as CRP, PCT or soluble human triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), suggesting PSP is independently increased in presence of infections. In addition, studies performed in ICUs indicate that significant PSP increase occurs in presence of significant stress and multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Previous publications investigating PSP in sepsis and shock defined optimal cutoff thresholds using receiver-operating characteristics curve analyses based on the respective study cohorts. Notably, these resulted in different cutoffs for PSP, which were mostly higher than the 90<sup>th</sup> centile for PSP in the populational reference patients in our cohort. For example, in newborns with early-onset sepsis, a PSP cutoff of 9 ng/ml discriminated best from non-infected infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, PSP cutoff values of 33.9 ng/mL combined with the presence of discolored sputum had a specificity of 97 % to identify patients with pathogenic bacteria on sputum culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and predicted exacerbations. PSP &gt;130 ng/ml predicted mortality in adults with peritonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of note, adult studies in patients with sepsis reported serum concentrations as high as &gt;1000 ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In view of the considerable variability in cutoffs used by previous studies, the present study fills an important gap by providing reference ranges for future studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In practice, different thresholds for PSP may need to be applied in newborns compared to older age groups.</p><p>Of note, the inter-individual variability of PSP was highest in the umbilical cord values, with a range from 1 to 99 ng/ml, and PSP was increased in infants with perinatal acidosis. These findings may suggest that the stress response associated with birth can increase PSP.</p><p>Interestingly, a large number of serum proteins show a physiologic increase with gestational age followed by rapid postnatal increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The precise mechanisms are unclear, and likely relate to a transient physiological systemic inflammatory response due to the microbiological colonization of skin and mucosal surfaces, including gut exposure to microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Strengths of the present study include the large sample size capturing a wide range of age span from extremely preterm infants to older adults, and the restriction of samples to individuals in the absence of with disease or infection. The good agreement between capillary and venous PSP samples observed suggests that capillary sampling for PSP is accurate, which may facilitate further studies on PSP in neonates and young children. Blood sampling in neonates and children may represent considerable challenge due to practical issues with access difficulty, patient pain, and parental anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Capillary sampling involving adequate skin warming is often used as a rapid and safe alternative in neonates and young children.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. For ethical reasons, it was not feasible to obtain sequential PSP samples over a prolonged period of time in newborns and children. A subset of PSP samples were obtained in neonates enrolled in a sepsis marker study, where infection had been ruled out. Due to issues with sampling in the pediatric age group, PSP was measured in otherwise healthy newborns and in children undergoing general anaesthesia. As sampling occurred upon induction of anaesthetics for minor and elective procedures, it is unlikely that acute-phase response due to the procedure relevantly influenced PSP values in this group. The neonatal group was carefully selected to exclude patients with infection or major disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PSP levels change significantly with age with lowest levels seen in extremely preterm babies, and highest levels observed in children.
