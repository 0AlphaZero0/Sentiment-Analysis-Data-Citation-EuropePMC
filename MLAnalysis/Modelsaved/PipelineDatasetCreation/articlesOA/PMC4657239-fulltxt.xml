Production of active form of vitamin is a prerequisite for attempts to naturally fortify foods with B<sub>12</sub> by microbial fermentation. Active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is distinguished from the pseudovitamin by the presence of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMBI) as the lower ligand. Genomic data indicate that <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> possesses a fusion gene, <italic>bluB</italic>/<italic>cobT2</italic>, coding for a predicted phosphoribosyltransferase/nitroreductase, which is presumably involved in production of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.

Their characteristic structure consists of a corrin ring with a central atom of cobalt and two axial ligands coordinated to the cobalt, the so-called upper and lower ligands. Among cobamides, cobalamins, distinguished by the presence of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMBI) as a lower ligand (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), are of special human nutritional value because of their activity of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> plays an important role in nucleotide synthesis as well as the metabolism of branched amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. These molecules fulfill their role as cofactors in cytoplasmic methionine synthase and in mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which are responsible for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine and the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cobalamin deficiency may lead to megaloblastic anemia and/or neuropsychiatric complications and, left untreated, can result in irreversible neurological disorder or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. DMBI as a lower ligand is crucial for the binding of cobalamin to the intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein responsible for its transport in the human gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to the complexity and cost of the chemical synthesis of cobalamin, which requires approximately 70 steps, its industrial production is exclusively through microbial fermentation, most commonly by <italic>Pseudomonas denitrificans</italic> and <italic>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>Chemical structures. <bold>a</bold> Structure of cobalamin (<bold>1</bold>) molecule with the lower ligand DMBI (<bold>2</bold>) indicated by a dotted box.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> production by <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> is of special interest because of the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status of the organism, which allows its direct use in food and feed preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> is an efficient producer, reaching cobalamin levels of 15&#160;&#181;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and furthermore, reportedly produces only trace amounts of pseudocobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the pseudo form of the vitamin the lower ligand, adenine (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), renders its affinity to intrinsic factor 500-fold lower than cobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some other GRAS organisms, mainly <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, have also been reported to produce cobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, it is questioned whether these species produce the active or the pseudo form of vitamin. <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri,</italic> which possesses the genes for B<sub>12</sub> synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], was recently shown to produce pseudocobalamin exclusively due to its inability to incorporate other bases than adenine as the lower ligand of the cobamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> produces vitamin B<sub>12</sub> for which the GRAS status has been granted (&#167;184.1945), however since &#8220;Streptomyces spp. produce antibiotics and are therefore inappropriate for QPS (EFSA opinion 2008)&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] the bacterium itself is not eligible for such status. With Lactobacilli unable to produce active vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> remains the only known producer with GRAS status granted by the FDA, and QPS granted by EFSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] allowing for its direct use in food and feed preparations.</p><p>The complete biosynthesis of cobalamin requires approximately 30 gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but it is the final steps of the pathway, namely production, activation and attachment of the lower ligand that decide whether the final product will be an active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or an analog. In aerobic and aerotolerant microorganisms, DMBI is synthesized in an oxygen-dependent manner from reduced FMN by the action of the BluB enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], while in strict anaerobes gene cluster <italic>bzaABCDE</italic> has been recently associated with this function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Synthesized DMBI is then activated by the CobT enzyme (CobU in aerobes) into &#945;-ribazole-phosphate (&#945;-RP) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), preparing the lower ligand for attachment to form the complete cobalamin molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent studies determined that the selectivity of CobT is responsible for the range of lower ligands that can be attached to cobamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A study with seven CobT homologues from diverse organisms revealed that DMBI is a preferred substrate (with the exception of ArsAB of <italic>Veillonella parvula</italic> preferentially activating phenolic bases), although some of the homologues, such as CobT from <italic>L. reuteri,</italic> were unable to activate DMBI in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a related report, it was suggested that the ability to exclude certain lower ligands from incorporation into cobamides provides a mechanism preventing the production of compounds that cannot be used by the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The genetics of the complete cobalamin synthesis pathway of <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> have been previously studied and described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Although homologues of the fusion enzyme BluB/CobT2 have been found in multiple organisms on the genetic level, the enzyme has not yet been studied. In this work, we used the heterologously expressed and purified BluB/CobT2 enzyme of the type strain <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> subsp. <italic>shermanii</italic> DSM 4902 to study its predicted novel ability to both synthesize and activate DMBI for attachment as a lower ligand in the final steps of biosynthesis of the active vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Heterologous expression and purification of the BluB/CobT2 enzyme</title><p>The <italic>bluB/cobT2</italic> coding region [NCBI: NC_014215.1] was cloned in the pFN18A vector and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> KRX competent cells.

The BluB/CobT2 regions homologous to BluB and CobT are interspaced by a proline-rich (23&#160;%) stretch of ~34 amino acids possibly forming a spacer region between the BluB and CobT2 domains. The proline-rich sequence, typical of non-helical protein linkers, can form extended rigid structures separating the protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], but &#8220;elbow bending&#8221; dynamics can also be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

DMBI was observed only in trace amounts, and this result was not affected by NADH concentration, suggesting efficient activation of the produced DMBI into &#945;-RP by BluB/CobT2 (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It has been noted previously that benzimidazoles do not appear to be used for any other purposes than the lower ligands of cobamides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The fusion of BluB with CobT allows the efficient use of produced DMBI, which is not required for any other processes in the cell.</p><p>In general, the fusion of two activities in a single polypeptide may be beneficial for the enzyme activity because of the increased efficiency of substrate transfer, protection of the intermediates, facilitation of the interactions between domains and establishment of a fixed stoichiometric ratio of the enzymatic activities of sequential reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In our experiments the molar concentrations of &#945;-RP obtained from reaction coupling synthesis and activation of DMBI were ~2&#8211;3-fold higher than the DMBI concentrations measured from the DMBI synthesis reaction alone (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This may indicate that the presence of NaMN stimulates the production of DMBI, possibly through imposing certain conformational changes on the BluB/CobT2 enzyme, resulting either in more efficient release of DMBI from the active site of the BluB part or an increase in BluB enzyme activity. The increased formation of &#945;-ribazole-phosphate in the presence of NaMN relative to the formation of DMBI can be attributed to either of these mechanisms, leading to efficient usage of the scarce substrates. This issue could be addressed further through crystallography studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Effect of substrate and environmental pH on DMBI activation by BluB/CobT2</title><p>It has been previously shown that semi-purified <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> CobT requires NaMN or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in addition to DMBI for &#945;-RP formation, with NaMN being a superior substrate producing sevenfold more &#945;-RP than NMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

From the perspective of the biosynthesis of cobalamin, the activation of adenine is of particular interest because adenine activated into 7-&#945;-<sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyladenine 5&#8242;phosphate (Ade-RP) would serve as a substrate for the lower ligand of pseudocobalamin, resulting in competition between production of the active and pseudo-vitamin form. Previous studies using partially purified cell-extracts of <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> have suggested that in this bacterium, the CobT-like activities do not include the activation of adenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Here, the activation of adenine was tested at pH 7.5 and 8.5 in the presence of NaMN, conditions that were found suitable for the activation of DMBI. A peak with the retention time of 1.25&#160;min at <italic>m/z</italic> 348 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#160;S2) and with the same size was detected in reactions with and without adenine and in the sample with enzyme alone. This peak is most likely due to ATP used in the purification process of the enzyme, leading to residual AMP in the BluB/CobT2 preparation. Because 9-&#946;-<sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyladenine 5&#8242;phosphate (AMP) and Ade-RP are isomers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), they cannot be distinguished by MS/MS. However, because the addition of adenine in the reaction did not increase the size of the Ade-RP/AMP peak, we conclude that BluB/CobT2 does not react with adenine under the conditions tested. It was previously shown that the <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> cell extracts form DMBI from FMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and activate DMBI rather than adenine for attachment as a lower ligand into cobamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] however, the mechanisms behind this preference remained obscure. One possible explanation was provided by structural studies of CobT from <italic>S. enterica,</italic> which revealed that two polar amino acids stabilize adenine in the active site: serine at position 80 interacts with the amino group (N10) and glutamine at position 88 interacts with the N3 ring nitrogen of adenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Both of these groups are different in DMBI (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), and therefore mutations of S80 and Q88 show different preferences of DMBI versus adenine activation. DMBI lacks the amino group and has a CH group instead of the N3 ring nitrogen. Crofts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that changing serine to phenylalanine at position 80 decreased the reaction of CobT with adenine, while changing glutamine to methionine at position 88 decreased the reaction with adenine and furthermore increased the reaction with DMBI. The effect of these amino acid changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic residues were found to be additive, as <italic>S. meliloti</italic> expressing the CobT enzyme of <italic>S. enterica</italic> carrying both mutations was found to produce the lowest amount of pseudo-cobalamin and the highest amount of cobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the present study, multiple sequence alignment of <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> BluB/CobT2 with other enzymes revealed the hydrophobic residues phenylalanine and valine at positions corresponding to S80 and Q88 in <italic>S. enterica</italic> CobT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Similar organization is present in CobT proteins of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and <italic>P. denitrificans</italic>, two known producers of cobalamin, which carry hydrophobic phenylalanine and methionine in these positions (see also Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), further implying the role in substrate specificity. Considering that <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> has been reported to produce small amounts of pseudocobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] but no activation of adenine by <italic>P. freudenreichii</italic> BluB/CobT2 was observed, the reaction leading to the pseudo form may be catalyzed by another, yet unidentified enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Several bacteria possess another enzyme capable of activating cobamide bases, such as ArsA and ArsB, which are homologous to CobT, but activate phenolic bases as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], while species such as <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> and <italic>Moorella thermoacetica</italic> have been reported to possess two seemingly redundant CobT enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which could have different substrate specificities.

The source temperature was 150&#160;&#176;C, desolvation temperature 600&#160;&#176;C, desolvation gas flow 1000&#160;L/h, nebulizer gas flow 6.5&#160;bar, and cone gas flow 50&#160;L/h. The trap collision energy ramp was 15&#8210;90&#160;eV, trap gas flow 2&#160;mL/min and scan time 0.2&#160;s. A lock-spray mass correction standard (leucine-enkephalin; <italic>m/z</italic> 556.2771) was introduced every 10&#160;s.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12934_2015_363_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
