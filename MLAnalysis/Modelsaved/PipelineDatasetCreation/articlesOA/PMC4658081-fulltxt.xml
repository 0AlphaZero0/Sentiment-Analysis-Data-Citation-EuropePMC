Preliminary evidence in humans suggests that mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) may confer resilience to these stress-related changes. We specifically tested this idea using a well-controlled mouse model for chronic stress in combination with transgenic MR overexpression in the forebrain. Exposure to unpredictable stressors for 21 days in adulthood reduced learning and memory formation in a low arousing hippocampus-dependent contextual learning task, but enhanced stressful contextual fear learning. We found support for a moderating effect of MR background on chronic stress only for contextual memory formation under low arousing conditions. In an attempt to understand potentially contributing factors, we studied structural plasticity. Chronic stress altered dendritic morphology in the hippocampal CA3 area and reduced the total number of doublecortin-positive immature neurons in the infrapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. The latter reduction was absent in MR overexpressing mice. We therefore provide partial support for the idea that overexpression of MRs may confer resilience to the effects of chronic stress on hippocampus-dependent function and structural plasticity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SFK was supported by ALW grant # 821-02-007 from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO.

This supports the notion that gene&#8211;environment interactions affect susceptibility to stress-related diseases, with some genes enhancing susceptibility and others conferring resilience to stressful events in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Upon exposure to stressful events, the adrenal glands secrete high levels of corticosteroid hormones (corticosterone in rodents and cortisol in humans; [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Corticosteroids enter the brain and bind to two types of intracellular receptors: mineralocorticoid (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). MR and GR exert slow transcriptional control over responsive genes via hormone response elements present in promoters [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Apart from their actions in the nucleus, MR and GR also mediate rapid, non-genomic actions via membrane-located receptors [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>GRs are present throughout the brain and have a low affinity for corticosterone [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Under non-stressful conditions only part of the receptors are occupied, whereas stress-levels of corticosteroids cause a substantial increase in binding. Intracellular MRs are highly expressed in some limbic areas, notably hippocampus and amygdala, and have a much higher affinity for corticosterone, implying substantial occupancy even by basal hormone levels. Increasing MR density may thus more effectively change MR signaling than increased ligand concentrations. The affinity of membrane-located MRs appears to be similar to that of GRs [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>MRs play a crucial role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. For instance, non-genomic MR actions facilitate glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus and amygdala and enhance synaptic retention of AMPA receptors [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Behaviorally, MRs promote an appropriate learning/cognitive strategy under stressful conditions and are relevant for spatial learning or establishing contextual fearful memories [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, MR overexpression in the forebrain reduces anxiety and enhances memory retention [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies in humans also support the importance of MRs for behavioral adaptation. First, splice variants of MR mRNA and <italic>lower</italic> levels of mRNA were found in postmortem brain regions of patients with major depressive disorder [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Second, in an aged population, carriers of the MR-I180V single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with loss of function had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than non-carriers [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Third, a specific MR haplotype&#8211;related to <italic>high</italic> MR expression levels- was associated with a heightened dispositional optimism in women [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In agreement, a recent study in humans revealed a beneficial effect of MR stimulation in cognition both in depressed patients and healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, a human study using fMRI has shown that a common functional polymorphism of the MR (Iso /Val (rs5522), associated with variability in HPA axis reactivity, moderates the effect of childhood emotional neglect and amygdala reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In stressed individuals, a shift from hippocampal to dorsal striatal memory systems was found to be dependent on the MR activation [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, blockade of MRs prevents the stress-induced enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsal striatum, possibly explaining the behavioral shift towards habitual responses, and prevents a stress-dependent shift from trace to delay conditioning learning [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>These studies have led to the hypothesis that high (functional) MR levels confer resilience to stress-related psychopathologies [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, we tested this hypothesis in a mouse model. Specifically, we examined if enhanced forebrain MR expression levels confer resilience to the effects of chronic unpredictable stress regarding hippocampus-dependent behavior and hippocampal structural plasticity.</p><p>Since activation of corticosteroid receptors depends on plasma corticosterone levels [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], MRs may play a different role in behavioral tasks which differ in the degree of salience. We therefore assessed the effects of chronic unpredictable stress and MR overexpression on behavior under low arousing and high arousing experimental conditions, which differ in the degree of activation of the HPA-axis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice used in our experiments were bred in-house. In each breeding cage, two wild type C57Bl6 female mice (Harlan, The Netherlands) were housed with one MR-transgenic (MR-tg) male mouse for one week [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At postnatal day 23, all pups were weaned, genotyped and pups with identical genotypes but from different litters housed two per cage (either MR-Tg or their littermate controls). Mice were kept in a temperature and humidity controlled facility (21.5&#8211;22&#176;C, with humidity between 40 and 60%) on a 12h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8:00 a.m.) with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All experiments were performed in strict accordance with the Dutch regulations for animal experiments. The protocol was approved by the committee on Animal Health and Care from the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Permit Number: DED 206) and in accordance with the EC Council Directive of September 2010 (2010/63/EU). All efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Chronic Unpredictable Stress</title><p>At two months of age, mice were randomly selected for chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) or control treatment. Mice in the CUS group were exposed to a 21-days CUS paradigm that was based on earlier described approaches [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The stressors used in this CUS paradigm were applied daily (each different stressor was repeated once-weekly) in an unpredictable order between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. in a separate room. Control mice were left undisturbed in their home cages in the regular housing room.</p><p>The following stressors were used in the CUS protocol:</p><p>Elevated plus maze (EPM): All mice were placed one-by-one in the center of a light grey colored plus formed maze (UGO BASILE S.r.l.&#8211;Italy) always facing the same open arm. After 15 minutes, the mice were removed from the maze and returned to their home cages. The maze was cleaned thoroughly with 70% EtOH between each use. All movements of the mice were recorded using a life-recording camera system that was installed above the maze (Ethovision XT 6, the Netherlands). The EPM was performed on day 1, day 11 and day 21 of the CUS regimen and only in animals that underwent CUS. We applied the EPM on day 1 to test the anxiety levels of both MR-tg and control stressed animals (at that time non-stressed, as this is the first stressor of the regimen) and on day 21 to test for habituation over time (in the stressed animals only) (<xref rid="pone.0142012.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Forced swim: Mice were placed for 3 minutes in a glass beaker (24 cm x 12 cm x 12 cm, Fisher Scientific, the Netherlands) filled with 1.6L water at 28&#176;C. After these 3 minutes, the mice were placed in a cage under a red lamp for 5 minutes in order to dry before returning them to their home cages.</p><p>Rotating platform: Home cages with two mice were placed on a see-saw rocker for 1 hour with 70 oscillations per minute.</p><p>Wet sawdust: Four mice were placed in a cage filled with a layer of wet sawdust for 4 hours.</p><p>Immobilization: Mice were individually placed in a restrainer for 30 minutes.</p><p>Group housing: Four mice (two MR-tg and two control animals) were housed overnight (5:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m.) in a single cage.</p><p>Isolation: Mice were housed overnight individually in a type 2 cage (140 mm x 365 mm x 207 mm).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Neuroendocrine parameters</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of CUS, we measured bodyweight, thymus weight and adrenal weight. The bodyweights of the mice were recorded at three time-points: three hours after the stressor on day 1, three hours after the stressor on day 11 and in the morning of day 22 (one day after the CUS).</p><p>To further validate the effectiveness of CUS, a subset of mice was decapitated on day 22 between 08.30 and 11.00 h, and trunk blood was collected in EDTA-covered capillary tubes (Sarstedt, The Netherlands) to measure basal plasma corticosterone levels. These levels were measured in duplicate via a radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (MP Biochemicals, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). At the same time-point, the adrenal glands and thymus were dissected and weighed.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Behavior</title><p>We started all behavioral tests one day after the final stressor of the chronic unpredictable stress (PND82) and during the light phase (9:00 a.m. and 13:00 a.m.) using different cohorts of mice 1) for memory in low arousing behavioural tasks (object in-context) and 2) for memory under high-arousing conditions (contextual fear conditioning). As the elevated plus maze is one of the stressors of the CUS paradigm, we used the data of the stressed animals only (from both cohorts that underwent behavioral testing as mentioned above) to assess anxiety and locomotion upon initiation of the CUS (day1) and during the last day of the CUS (day21, <xref rid="pone.0142012.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Object in-context memory</title><p>We tested one batch of mice for place memory in a non-stressful test specific for the influence of context on object recognition [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a context we used blue-colored plastic boxes (h x l x w: 33 cm x 54 cm x 37 cm) that contained bedding material; blocks of Lego and small bottles were used as objects. The overall test was performed over three days (illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0142012.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>): on day 1 the mice were habituated for 10 minutes in the context without objects. On day 2 the mice habituated first for 10 minutes in a context (A) that had no cues on the walls but had two identical objects, i.e. 2 blocks of Lego, placed in opposite corners. After this, mice were habituated for another 10 minutes in a novel context (B) that had cues on the walls in the form of stripes and contained two (new) identical objects, namely 2 small bottles, placed in opposite corners. Between habituating to both contexts, a retention interval of 1 min was used, during which the mice were kept in a familiar cage (i.e. a cage that was used to transfer the mice from the housing room to the testing room) until context B was presented. On day 3 the object in-context recognition memory was tested by placing the mice for 10 minutes in context B in which 1 of the 2 familiar objects of this context, namely the small bottle, was replaced by an object from context A, i.e. a block of Lego.</p><p>In all contexts, the mice were placed facing the same wall and opposite to the objects. Objects were cleaned thoroughly, placed in a 15 cm distance from the corners of each context and new bedding material was added on top of the old and mixed between each task, in order to saturate the olfactory cues of previous mice that had been tested. Sniffing was used as explorative behavior when the animal displayed such behavior towards an object within a distance of maximum 2 cm. Climbing on top of or watching the objects from a (close) distance was not considered as sniffing behavior.</p><p>We used the discrimination index (DI) observed on day 3 as measurement of the object in-context recognition memory. The DI is calculated as time being spent exploring the novel object compared to the total exploration time towards both objects (tnovel /(tnovel + tfamiliar)) [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Contextual fear conditioning</title><p>Contextual fear was also assessed one day after the final stressor, in another batch of mice.

Although we found that CUS induced CA3 pyramidal dendritic atrophy in the dendritic complexity index and dendritic length, these changes appeared to be unaffected by MR overexpression. CUS&#8211;as reported before- suppressed neurogenesis, which was moderated by MR in the infrapyramidal blade. We therefore tentatively conclude that MR overexpression may protect against some but not all CUS-induced changes in hippocampal behavior and structural plasticity.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Experimental model</title><p>We used transgenic mice with forebrain specific overexpression of human MR under the control of a CaMKII&#945; promoter [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More specifically, these animals have a 3&#8211;4 fold MR mRNA increase in the hippocampus and 8-fold increase in amygdala. Immunohistochemical staining of MR showed more MR-positive neurons and greater intensity of staining in CA-1, CA-2, CA-3 of the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus (DG), lateral septum and cortex compared to control mice; we confirmed this in the present set of animals (unpublished observation). MR-Tg was not detected in cerebellum, hypothalamus or peripheral tissues such as liver, lung and muscle [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The presently reported effect of MR overexpression on corticosterone levels is not in line with results from Mitra et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], who reported that selective MR overexpression in the amygdala reduces stress-induced corticosterone secretion. This could be explained by the different models used to induce MR overexpression; that is, Mitra et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] used viruses to overexpress the MR locally (only in the BLA) in adult rats. In this model, the HSV vectors that was to drive overexpression infect only approximately 30% of the neurons. Therefore, other areas contributing to anxiety-like behaviour and HPA axis activity, such as the hippocampus [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], were not affected, as opposed to the model we used. Moreover, viral MR overexpression occurred only during adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In our model, MR overexpression started around PND15 and remained present up until measurements in adulthood, which may have resulted in compensatory mechanisms.</p><p>Similar to what was reported before for fully-grown MR-tg mice [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we found MR-tg mice to be significantly heavier than control mice, even at a relatively young age (~2 months old). Since MRs were overexpressed in the forebrain but not in hypothalamus (unpublished observations), this might indicate that forebrain MR play a substantial role in appetite and/or metabolic processes. Although this is of interest, it most likely did not affect our present findings, as we did not use food-rewarded tasks.</p><p>Both control and MR-tg mice exposed to CUS gained less bodyweight over the 21-days period when compared to non-stressed mice.

Our data indicate that MR overexpression does not moderate the effects of CUS on contextual learning under high arousing (fear) conditions, as opposed to contextual learning under low arousing conditions.

A second and less likely explanations is that mice had reached a ceiling in contextual fear memory. Interestingly, we observed a main effect of genotype in contextual fear conditioning which was particularly evident directly after re-exposure. This might be due to MR-dependent differences in overall anxiety. However, we did not observe genotype effects in the elevated plus maze, determined one day before contextual fear learning (<xref rid="pone.0142012.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Alternatively, MR expression may influence the generalization of fear. This too is unlikely because MR-tg and control animals showed low levels of freezing when tested in a different context (data not shown). The tendency towards more pronounced freezing in non-stressed MR-tg (vs control) mice agrees with earlier studies in na&#239;ve mice reporting that pharmacological blockade of MR hampers retention of fear context [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and hampers selective attention, executive function and working memory in men [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>With respect to a very sensitive hippocampus-dependent memory task under relatively non-arousing conditions [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] we found support for our hypothesis: overexpression of MR appears to protect against CUS-induced deficits. Of note, although the difference between chronically stressed and control animals was highly significant in wild type mice and absent in MR-tg animals, the interaction effect was only evident at trend level, so interpretation of the data should be done with care. The employed memory task, as other contextual tasks [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], might improve with a rise in circulating CORT levels; we cannot entirely exclude that putatively higher circulating CORT levels in MR-tg mice with a history of CUS contributed to the observed resilience. In contrast to the contextual fear conditioning paradigm, we found no support that MR overexpression by itself (under non-stressful conditions) improves memory for an object-in-location.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Structural plasticity</title><p>The potentially protective effect of MR overexpression under non-arousing conditions could be explained by accompanying changes in structural or functional plasticity. We addressed the first possibility, by examining dendritic complexity of CA3 pyramidal cells and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, two parameters that are exquisitely sensitive to CUS [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Chronic unpredictable stress has been reported to result in reduced hippocampal CA3 dendritic complexity [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, elevated plasma corticosterone levels and altered glutamatergic tone have been implicated [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In agreement, we found a main effect of CUS on the dendritic complexity index and dendritic length. However, there was no indication for a moderating effect of MR overexpression. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that the improved object-in-location memory in MR overexpressing (compared to wild type) CUS mice is caused by changes in CA3 dendritic complexity. CA3 neurons, however, are not the only critical elements for good performance in this particular learning task, which would explain the disparate findings. CA1 or dentate neurons may be equally important for optimal task performance, but&#8212;in terms of dendritic complexity- these are far less sensitive to CUS than CA3 neurons [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Chronic stress has also been reported to reduce hippocampal adult neurogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. CUS or MR overexpression did not consistently change BrdU or Ki67 staining in the DG; interaction effects were not linked to significant post-hoc differences between specific groups. However, we did find a significant moderating effect of MR overexpression on CUS-induced DCX suppression in the infrapyramidal blade. This effect might contribute to our behavioral observations; spatial learning depends on as well as affects neurogenesis. Neurons in the suprapyramidal blade show greater experience-related activity but mature later than those in the infrapyramidal blade [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Changes in the infrapyramidal blade may therefore disproportionally contribute to the behavioral changes. No changes were found along the rostral-caudal part of the hippocampus in all three neurogenic markers. The effects of CUS on neurogenesis are believed to be mediated&#8212;at least in part&#8212;by elevated plasma corticosterone levels [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142012.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It seems unlikely, though, that the protective effect of MR overexpression is caused by a reduction of stress-induced corticosterone levels; our neuroendocrine observations do not support this.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study supports that MR overexpression may confer resilience to the effects of prolonged stress exposure on some but certainly not all aspects of hippocampal memory performance and structural plasticity. Comparable observations have been made for other mediators of the stress response: genetic deletion of CRH also preserves learning and memory and neuronal integrity which is otherwise disrupted after exposure to chronic stress [<xref rid="pone.0142012.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Collectively, these studies indicate that reducing vulnerability factors (such as CRH) or enhancing resilience factors (such as MR) might maintain brain function at an optimal level in the face of chronic stress exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142012.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Elevated plus maze results as observed in stressed control and MR-tg mice.</title><p>The bar graphs show results for: (A) total number of arm entries, (B) percentage of open arm entries and (C) percentage of time spent in the open arms.
