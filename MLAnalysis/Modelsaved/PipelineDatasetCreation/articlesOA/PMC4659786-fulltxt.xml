However, different insect species are poorly controlled by the available Bt toxins or have evolved resistance to these toxins. Evolution of Bt toxicity could provide novel toxins to control insect pests. To this aim, efficient display systems to select toxins with increased binding to insect membranes or midgut proteins involved in toxicity are likely to be helpful. Here we describe two display systems, phage display and ribosome display, that allow the efficient display of two non-structurally related Bt toxins, Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa. Improved display of Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa on M13 phages was achieved by changing the commonly used peptide leader sequence of the coat pIII-fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a peptide leader sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) and by using a modified M13 helper phage (Phaberge) that has an amber mutation in its pIII genomic sequence and preferentially assembles using the pIII-fusion protein. Also, both Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa were efficiently displayed on ribosomes, which could allow the construction of large libraries of variants. Furthermore, Cry1Ac or Cyt1Aa displayed on M13 phages or ribosomes were specifically selected from a mixture of both toxins depending on which antigen was immobilized for binding selection. These improved systems may allow the selection of Cry toxin variants with improved insecticidal activities that could counter insect resistances.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13568-015-0160-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic></kwd><kwd>Phage display</kwd><kwd>Ribosome display</kwd><kwd>Cry toxins</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) produces insecticidal Cry proteins that kill important crop pests and also mosquitoes that are vectors of human diseases (Bravo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Pardo-L&#243;pez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). Bt strains produce different non-related Cry toxins including the 3-domain family of Cry toxins (3D-Cry) such as Cry1Ac or the Cyt family of toxins such as Cyt1Aa. Members of the 3D-Cry family show insect specificity to dipteran (ex. Cry4Ba), coleopteran (ex. Cry3Aa) and lepidopteran (ex. Cry1Ac) insects. It is widely accepted that 3D-Cry toxins exert their toxic effect by the sequential binding to insect gut proteins named cadherins and glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchored proteins such as aminopeptidase-N (APN) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) resulting in toxin oligomerization and pore formation that finally cause cell lysis and disruption of the insect gut (Pardo-L&#243;pez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>).</p><p>Most Bt strains that show toxicity against dipteran insects also produce a different family of insecticidal proteins called Cyt toxins (Sober&#243;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Both Cry and Cyt toxins are synthesized as protoxins that are activated by insect gut proteases releasing active toxin fragments (Pardo-L&#243;pez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). Cyt toxins are also pore-forming toxins, that in contrast to Cry toxins, does not interact with protein receptors binding directly to membrane lipids present in insect gut cells, resulting in membrane insertion (Sober&#243;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). More interestingly, Cyt1Aa synergizes the insecticidal activity of the 3D-Cry Cry11Aa and Cry4Ba toxins by their binding interaction, functioning as a surrogate receptor molecule (P&#233;rez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>; Cant&#243;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). Recently it was shown that Cyt2Aa specificity could be modified to kill aphids by the insertion of a peptide sequence, in exposed loop regions, that mediates binding to an aphid APN (Chougule et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>).</p><p>The molecular evolution of Bt toxins could provide improved toxins against insect species that are poorly controlled by the available Cry toxins and also for the selection of Bt toxins that could recover toxicity to insects that develop resistance to the action of these proteins (Bravo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). Different display systems that allow construction of libraries of mutants and selection of binders with improved affinity, along with the gene coding for these variants, have been developed such as phage display or ribosome display systems (Hanes and Pl&#252;ckthun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>; Bratkovic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>).</p><p>Phage display system allows selection of protein variants with improved binding characteristics (Azzazy and Highsmith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>; Mullen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). For this purpose, the foreign protein DNA sequence is fused to a coat protein gene enabling the fusion protein to be displayed on the surface of the phage that can be then screened by enabling the phage to interact with ligands, a process known as biopanning allowing the molecular evolution of proteins (Dr&#246;ge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>; Mullen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). To display the fusion protein, it has to be translocated to the host periplasm by a peptide leader sequence while a helper phage provides all the necessary components for phage assembly. In contrast, the ribosome display system involves an in vitro translation of the protein that prevents the synthesized protein and the mRNA from leaving the ribosome and binders with improved affinities are selected by panning (Hanes and Pl&#252;ckthun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>). Ribosome-display allows construction of libraries with sizes up to 10<sup>14</sup> in contrast with phage display where libraries of 10<sup>9</sup> size are typically obtained due to the limitation in <italic>E. coli</italic> transformation efficiency (Dreier and Pluckthun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>).</p><p>Cry1A toxins have been displayed in three different phages (M13, T7 and &#955;), these systems have shown different problems for displaying Cry toxins (Marzari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Kasman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>; V&#237;lchez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Pacheco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). In the case M13, the Cry1Aa and Cry1Ac toxins were not properly displayed resulting in deletions of the Cry1Aa-fused protein, while the displayed Cry1Ac protein did not bind to functional receptors in vitro suggesting structural constraints of the toxin (Marzari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Kasman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>). In contrast the Cry1Ac toxin was efficiently displayed in both T7 and &#955; phages where the assembling of these phage particles occurs in the cytoplasm (V&#237;lchez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Pacheco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Nevertheless, T7 and &#955; systems rely on in vitro packaging systems that are quite labile and have limitations for the construction of libraries with large number of variants with a limit up to 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> variants.</p><p>Improvement of M13 display can be achieved by using engineered helper phages such as the &#8220;Phaberge&#8221; helper phage that contains an amber mutation on its genome favoring the assembling of phage particles containing the recombinant pIII-fusion protein when non-suppressive <italic>E. coli</italic> host cells were infected (Soltes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>). Also, improvement of display of several different proteins on M13 was achieved by changing the commonly used peptide leader sequence of the fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a peptide leader sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) (Steiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). The Sec and SPR pathways translocate proteins to the periplasm post-translationally and co-translationally, respectively (Steiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). Contrary to phage display, ribosome display is a free-cell system that does not require in vivo processes to display the proteins; therefore the environment for production, folding and stability of the interest-protein can be manipulated and optimized in vitro. These features have been exploited to select and evolve peptides, proteins and antibody fragments (W&#246;rn and Pl&#252;ckthun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Jermetus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2001</xref>; Osada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>; Mouratou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Correa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we have adapted and/or improved these two complementary systems with the aim to maximize chances to have an efficient display whatever the family of Cry toxins to evolve. We show the successful display of Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa toxins on M13. Also, Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa were successfully displayed using ribosome-display. The two Bt toxins retain their specific binding characteristics for their specific ligands. Furthermore, we show that specific selection of the displayed toxins by biopanning. These improved systems may allow the selection of Cry toxin variants with improved insecticidal activity that could counter insect resistances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Enzymes, buffers and mass weight marker were from Fermentas, Thermo Scientific.

We designed a phagemid for the fusion of Bt toxins to pIII viral protein that depends on a SRP signal sequence. The ssDsbA, which tags the proteins to its SRP-dependent translocation, was generated by assembly-PCR as previously reported (Steiner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). The pCANTAB 5E phagemid was used as backbone vector (Amersham Biosciences) and the ssPelB was substituted by ssDsbA, hereafter called pCAD (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In addition, to increase the display levels of toxin by using a helper phage with a conditional deficiency of pIII production (phaberge), the amber stop codon of pCAD between the toxin-pIII fusion was mutagenized (pCADS vector).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>

To explore the ribosome display as alternative display system, Bt toxins genes were cloned in the pFPRDV vector (Correa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). This vector enables the incorporation of T7 promoter and ribosome binding-site sequences for transcription and translation in vitro, respectively; also the fusion of TolA spacer at C-terminal of the toxins without stop-codon is included in pFPRDV (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The toxic fragments of Cry1Ac or Cyt1Aa toxins were PCR amplified from the constructs of pFPRDV using the primers T7B and TolAkurtz as described in materials and methods (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).

The advantage to display Bt toxins in a toxic fragment format is the lack of disulfide bridges since cysteins residues are removed after toxin activation. To determine that Cry1Ac toxin is folded correctly we analyzed the binding ability of ternary complex to the receptor CR7-12 by ELISA binding assays. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c shows that ternary complex prepared with Cry1Ac mRNA specifically bound to CR7-12.

In the case of the mRNA of Cyt1Aa toxin was only recovered when the bait was the antibody anti-Cyt1Aa antibody or Cry11Aa toxin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although display in phages of Cry toxins has shown not to be optimal (Bravo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>), few examples of successful selection of improved variants of certain Cry toxins have been reported (Ishikawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>; Craveiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). Nevertheless the display systems used are not likely to be efficient to display and select improved variants for most Cry toxins (Ishikawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>; Craveiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). Therefore, the improvement of display systems that efficiently display Cry toxins allowing the creation of large libraries could provide means for rapid evolution of most Bt toxins.</p><p>In the case of phage display we show here that the display of two structurally non-related Bt toxins could be improved by changing the peptide leader sequence of the fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a peptide leader sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP). Since the Sec pathway translocates proteins post-translationally while the SRP pathway co-translationally, this result suggests that Cry1Ac folding in the cytoplasm limits translocation and display efficiencies. Furthermore, we show that by using a helper phage (Phaberge) that assembles phage particle preferring the Cry1Ac-pIII fusion protein, display of Cry1Ac was further improved (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). More interestingly we show that Cry1Ac is properly folded retaining its receptor binding capacities and toxicity. Using the system described here we have successfully displayed Cry3Aa toxin that is toxic to coleopteran insects (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The phage display system described here allows great flexibility for panning selection since the different display levels of Cry toxins could be used for selection of variants with different binding affinities. Enhanced display of Bt toxin libraries using Phaberge and SRP translocation sequence are likely to select binders with moderate affinity due to the selection of binders by avidity since several binding sites are present in one phage particle. Consecutive mutagenesis and selection using display systems that allow moderate (SRP sequence and M13) or low (Sec sequence and M13) display efficiencies would select binders with higher binding affinities. We believe that depending on the binding target (receptor vs insect gut membranes) and toxicity of the native Cry toxin used for library construction the phage display systems described here could be useful to put in place a panning procedures to select improved toxins.</p><p>Ribosome display has the unique feature that it allows the construction of large libraries that are more likely to be useful to select toxins with improved binding and toxicity. We show here that Cry1Ac toxin of 60&#160;kDa is efficiently displayed in ribosomes and that selection with a cadherin receptor specifically selected Cry1Ac-displayed ribosomes. To our knowledge this is the first example of a protein of more than 50&#160;kDa that is successfully displayed in ribosomes. It still needs to be determined if other 3D-Cry toxins of similar size could be displayed on ribosomes to determine if ribosome-display could be a general system for evolution of other 3D-Cry toxins. However, it is still possible to display individual domains II or III that are involved in receptor binding for library construction and selection of improved binders using ribosome display. In this regard, we have successfully displayed Cry1Ac domain II and shown that it retains cadherin receptor binding (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).</p><p>In the case of Cyt1Aa we show that is can be efficiently displayed using both the improved phage display system described here and also using ribosome display. Nevertheless, Cyt1Aa was capable of Cry11Aa binding only when displayed in ribosomes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) in contrast when displayed in M13 where it was not capable to bind Cry11Aa (data not shown). As mentioned earlier, Cyt1Aa enhances the toxicity of Cry11Aa or Cry4Ba against mosquitoes by functioning as a surrogate receptor. We will use ribosome display to select Cyt1Aa mutants that bind other Cry toxins as a way to develop tools for improving Bt Cry toxicity against specific insect targets. In the case of Cyt2Aa toxin it was shown that insertion of a peptide sequence with aphid APN binding activity in certain loop regions resulted in Cyt2Aa toxins with aphid toxicity (Chougule et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). Thus, by using both display systems described here, selection of Cyt1Aa variants capable to bind to insect gut membranes of certain insect species could select Cyt1Aa toxins with toxicity to certain insect pests.</p><p>Overall we describe here two efficient display systems for Bt toxins that are likely to be useful to evolve Bt toxicity to control pets that show low susceptibility to these toxins or to control insect pests that evolved resistance to Cry toxins in field conditions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13568_2015_160_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
