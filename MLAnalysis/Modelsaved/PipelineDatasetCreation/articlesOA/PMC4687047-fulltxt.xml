Birds fly by flapping their wings, which is dependent on the chemical energy produced by muscle work, or use soaring-gliding flight, in which chemical energy is replaced with energy harvested from moving air masses, such as thermals. Flapping flight requires more energy than soaring-gliding flight, and this difference in the use of energy increases with body mass. However, soaring-gliding results in lower speeds than flapping, especially for small species. Birds therefore face a trade-off between energy and time costs when deciding which flight strategy to use. Raptors are a group of large birds that typically soar. As relatively light weight raptors, falcons can either soar on weak thermals or fly by flapping with low energy costs. In this paper, we study the flight behavior of the insectivorous lesser kestrel (<italic>Falco naumanni</italic>) during foraging trips and the influence of solar radiation, which we have adopted as a proxy for thermal formation, on kestrel flight variables. We tracked 35 individuals from two colonies using high frequency GPS-dataloggers over four consecutive breeding seasons. Contrary to expectations, kestrels relied heavily on thermal soaring when foraging, especially during periods of high solar radiation. This produced a circadian pattern in the kestrel flight strategy that led to a spatial segregation of foraging areas. Kestrels flapped towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals were not available. However, as soon as thermals were formed, they soared on them towards foraging areas far from the colony, especially when they were surrounded by poor foraging habitats. This reduced the chick provisioning rate at the colony. Given that lesser kestrels have a preference for feeding on large insects, and considering the average distance they cover to capture them during foraging trips, to commute using flapping flight would result in a negative energy balance for the family group. Our results show that lesser kestrels prioritize saving energy when foraging, suggesting that kestrels are more energy than time-constrained during the breeding season.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the &#8220;HORUS&#8221; project (ref: P09-RNM-04588) financed by the Consejer&#237;a de Innovaci&#243;n, Ciencia y Empresa of the Junta de Andaluc&#237;a and FEDER funds from the European Union.

Animals allocate energy to support physiological and behavioral traits, but especially to move within a landscape (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Most avian species move by flying, either through flapping or soaring-gliding. The majority of birds fly by flapping their wings which requires their muscles to convert chemical energy into work [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], although they have also evolved morphological and behavioral adaptations to take advantage of the energy available in moving air masses and to fly by soaring-gliding with little muscle work [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some sea birds depend on strong winds to soar when flying large distances over ocean waters using dynamic soaring [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By contrast, terrestrial birds can exploit upward winds deflected by cliffs and ridges to fly without flapping their wings using slope soaring, or they can exploit rising air columns, also known as thermals, using thermal soaring [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thermals are created by the differential heating by solar radiation of the soil surface and the air in contact with it. Birds circle up on thermals, increase their flight altitude and then glide down to the next thermal in a similar way to man-made gliders [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Birds are therefore able to substitute muscle power with kinetic or potential energy extracted from the environment when soaring-gliding.</p><p>Flight theory predicts that the power needed for a soaring-gliding flight is about 1.5 times the basal metabolic rate, whereas flapping flight requires several times more energy [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This statement has been verified in empirical studies on diverse flying species [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, the power needed for flapping flight increases steeply with body mass [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], at the same time as the mass-specific basal metabolic rate decreases [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the difference in energy expenditure between the two flight strategies increases with body mass [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a consequence, the heavier a bird is, the more energy efficient it is to adopt soaring-gliding over the flapping flight strategy [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The question then arises of why not all birds use the soaring-gliding flight strategy if it is so advantageous.</p><p>There are other morphological traits apart from body mass, such as wing shape or wingspan that affect bird flight performance and consequently can be critical in deciding which flight strategy to adopt [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. But, in the case of thermal soaring, the answer may also lie in the spatial and temporal constraints imposed by this flight strategy that potentially offsets its energy advantage. Thermals are the result of convective processes between the earth&#8217;s surface and the air in contact with it, and do not develop uniformly over an heterogeneous landscape [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The spatial scale of thermal formation is of the order of hundreds or thousands of meters, which usually exceeds the home range of smaller bird species and consequently prevents them from using thermal soaring when searching for resources [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, as thermals are weak over the sea, birds are forced to make detours over land when using soaring-gliding flights during migration, which in turn extends traveling time [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, thermals are not permanently available because their formation depends on adequate weather conditions, which limits the time available to fly [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thermal formation follows a daily pattern: it begins shortly after sunrise, increases in depth and intensity throughout the morning, peaks around noon, and then decreases towards sunset [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Soaring birds usually adapt their daily movements to this predictable pattern in order to exploit the thermals available in an efficient way and thus fly with reduced costs [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, given the spatial and temporal pattern in thermal formation that soaring birds have to cope with, they fly at lower cross-country speeds when using thermal soaring than when flapping [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Birds therefore face a trade-off between energy and time costs when deciding which strategy to adopt when flying. As a general trend, large terrestrial birds use thermal soaring in order to reduce flight costs, whereas small birds use flapping flights as the energy benefits linked to soaring on thermals does not compensate for the time costs experienced [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Raptors are a representative group of large soaring birds. Within this group, falcons are relatively light with a low body mass and low wing loading [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These morphological characteristics allow them to soar on a wide range of thermal intensities [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] but also to fly by flapping with relatively low energy costs [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Falcons do not seem as constrained by thermal formation as larger raptors do, and they can fly throughout the entire day and even at night when thermals do not form [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, falcons are able to cross large bodies of water where thermals are weak or absent [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Accordingly, falcons have traditionally been considered flapping raptors with a preference for powered flight, without any need for thermals to fly [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, preliminary data on the foraging movement of the lesser kestrel, <italic>Falco naumanni</italic> (one of the smallest falcons in the world), showed higher than expected frequencies of soaring when individuals were commuting between the breeding colony and the foraging areas. We therefore designed a study to evaluate to what extent this species relies on thermal soaring for foraging.</p><p>Lesser kestrels are small insectivorous colonial falcons that breed in buildings and cliffs in steppe-like habitats, pastures and non-irrigated crops [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Throughout the breeding season, lesser kestrels continuously prospect the surroundings of their colonies to locate the ephemeral, concentrated, and unpredictable abundances of insects across a heterogeneous environment [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Because kestrels do not store prey items they have to return to the colony to provision their mates or chicks once they capture a prey. The soaring-gliding flight strategy would allow kestrels to reduce flight costs when searching for food during an energy-intensive period such as the breeding season [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, we tracked individual lesser kestrels using high frequency GPS-dataloggers to investigate flight behavior along foraging trips during the breeding season. 1) We hypothesized that lesser kestrels would adopt the soaring-gliding flight strategy along foraging trips in suitable thermal conditions. 2) We expected individuals to increase flight altitude as thermals increase in depth and intensity throughout the day in order to obtain higher potential energy values during foraging trips. 3) We also expected individuals to use this potential energy gain to fly larger distances with reduced costs and to reach foraging patches located far from the colony, especially if prey availability is low close to the colony. Additionally, 4) we calculated power requirements for lesser kestrels to complete a foraging trip and the daily energy expenditure when adopting a pure flapping or a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy in order to evaluate the trade-off between the two flight strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statements</title><p>The environmental authority (Direcci&#243;n General de Gesti&#243;n del Medio Natural y Espacios Protegidos, Junta de Andaluc&#237;a) provided permits to access the study colonies and to attach GPS-dataloggers to this endangered species.

We attached GPS-dataloggers (GiPSy models 2, 4, and 5; Technosmart, Rome, Italy) with small batteries (90&#8211;100 mA) to the birds nesting in nest-boxes. GPS devices were fixed to the birds&#8217; backs using a micro back-pack harness supplied by Marshall Radio Telemetry (North Salt Lake, Utah, U.S.A.) or a similar hand-made harness formed by a carbon fiber plate and a 4 mm wide Teflon ribbon (Bally Ribbon Mills, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.). GPS-dataloggers were covered with a protective thermoretractable case. The total mass of the equipment (harness + GPS + battery) was about 6 g and never exceeded the 5% of the lesser kestrel&#8217;s mean body mass, which is within the recommended limits for flying animals [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To get the birds used to the harness and the GPS device, we fixed a dummy GPS-datalogger with the same weight to the harness at least a week before fixing the real device and starting to record the birds&#8217; movement (see details of the procedure in Hern&#225;ndez-Pliego <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).</p><p>We attached GPS-dataloggers to 39 individual lesser kestrels during the study period, but were unable to recover tracking data from 4 of them. Finally, we obtained a total of 825,365 GPS-fixes from 35 individuals (17 females and 18 males). Some of them were tracked during two (8 individuals) or three (1 individual) breeding seasons. We configured the GPS-dataloggers at five different sampling frequencies: one fix per second, one fix per minute, or every 3, 5, and 10-minutes. Since the GPS stored the data in the logger, we had to recapture the individuals to recover the data. A new full-powered device was then deployed before releasing the individual to be able to continue tracking. The kestrels were captured when they entered the nest-boxes using remote-controlled sliding doors. Individuals were telemetered during a mean of 55.86 &#177; 30.72 days per breeding season, range 6&#8211;100 days; they were recaptured a mean of 5.16 &#177; 2.44 times per year, range 2&#8211;11 (n = 45). Data were collected during daylight hours (5 to 20 h UTC) during the breeding season (March&#8211;July). We removed the harnesses from the kestrels at the end of each breeding season.

We obtained estimates of thermal and orographic uplift throughout the study period from the Movebank Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation (Env-DATA) system [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thermal and orographic uplift estimates were calculated by reanalyzing weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We obtained two orographic uplift estimates that were calculated using data from different digital elevation models (DEM): the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 90-m DEM, and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 30-m DEM. We did not expect slope soaring to be a frequent flight strategy for lesser kestrels in our study area which is mostly flat. Nonetheless, because of the existence of hills and escarpments that can deflect wind that can be exploited by individuals, we decided to evaluate the effect of orographic uplift on lesser kestrel flight behavior. Because of the temporal and spatial resolutions of the estimates, we had only 4 values per day of thermal and orographic uplift at the location of each colony.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Flight variables</title><p>GPS locations were explored graphically using GIS (ArcGIS 10, ESRI, Redlands, California, U.S.A.) to identify individual foraging trips. We use the term foraging trip to refer to a set of consecutive locations of an individual kestrel which, start from the breeding colony and extend beyond 300 m and in which we are able to identify a foraging event (mostly clumped locations at low altitude above the ground with highly variable instantaneous speed). The details of the foraging trip identification and segmentation procedure can be found in Hern&#225;ndez-Pliego <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The movements from the colony to the area where the foraging event took place and the return movement to the colony are referred to as commuting flights (outward and inward flight, respectively). Incomplete foraging trips, i.e. trips in which departure from or arrival at the colony was not recorded by the GPS were removed from statistical analyses. We also removed those foraging trips that started or finished at roosting sites away from the colony.</p><p>GPS devices provided the flight altitude and instantaneous speed for each location. We calculated the flight altitude above ground as the difference between the flight altitude recorded by the GPS and the topographic elevation obtained from a 10 m-resolution DEM obtained from the Andalusian Environmental Department (REDIAM, Junta de Andaluc&#237;a, 2010&#8211;2011). We removed any position with low accuracy (less than 4 satellites, dilution of precision over 3, or positions with negative altitude values).</p><p>We analyzed commuting flights recorded at 1-second intervals in order to investigate the use of thermals by lesser kestrels. Thermal soaring events in these commuting flights recorded at 1-s are easily detectable through a circular flight path with an increase in flight altitude and positive climb speed (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Soaring events were considered to be any flight segment with a circular pattern lasting more than 5 s, with positive vertical speed and that resulted in an increase in altitude of at least 10 m. To err on the conservative side, we only considered the climbing phase of the thermal soaring events for our analyses since the gliding phase might include flapping flights. For commuting flights in which we identified thermal soaring events, we calculated the following parameters indicative of the intensity or efficiency in the use of thermals by kestrels: (1) number of thermal soaring events and (2) accumulated ascent per horizontal distance covered; and (3) total ascent and (4) mean climb speed per thermal soaring event. Furthermore, we analyzed all foraging trips regardless of the sampling frequency at which they were recorded, from 1-second to 10-minutes, in order to study changes in the daily pattern of lesser kestrel flights. For these foraging trips, we calculated the following flight variables: (1) mean cross-country speed and (2) maximum flight altitude recorded per commuting flight; and (3) maximum distance from the colony and (4) duration of the foraging trip. To reduce the influence of outliers we used the third quartile of flight altitude as the maximum flight altitude because a single maximum value might be highly influenced by GPS altitude errors. In order to study the influence of solar radiation in all those flight variables, we used the value of solar radiation measured at the time rounded to the nearest half-hour when each commuting flight started. In foraging trips in which the outward flight was not recorded because the sampling frequency was longer than its duration, we calculated the time rounded to the nearest half hour when the first location was obtained and the solar radiation measured at that time. Additionally, to estimate the importance of thermal or topographic uplift in determining lesser kestrel foraging flight strategies, we built models to evaluate its influence on flight variables. As thermal and orographic uplift are estimated at a rough temporal scale (6-h intervals), we calculated the mean values of every flight variable obtained from commuting flights or foraging trips (depending on the variable) included in each of these intervals, and separately for each colony. We pooled all individuals and flights tracked at each colony during each 6-h interval to estimate the mean values.</p><fig id="pone.0145402.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145402.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Track of a lesser kestrel foraging trip using thermal soaring along the commuting flights.</title><p>(A) The white star represents the breeding colony.

We considered a body mass of 130 g (the mean value for the species [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) to carry out the calculations. We also assumed a mean wingspan of 0.68 &#177; 0.02 m (&#177; standard deviation) and a mean wing area of 0.062 &#177; 0.0002 m<sup>2</sup>, based on data obtained from field measurements (authors&#8217; unpub. data, n = 5) in line with Pennycuick&#8217;s procedure [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We estimated the energy needed for a lesser kestrel to perform a foraging trip when adopting a pure flapping or a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy. We calculated the mean time kestrels spent on foraging trips per day (both the time invested in commuting flights and in the foraging event) using complete days of tracking, using those dates and individuals in which we had continuous tracking data from sunrise to sunset. To estimate energy expenditure, we conservatively assumed that kestrels were resting when they were not on a foraging trip. Then, we estimated the individual daily energy expenditure from adopting a pure flapping or a pure soaring-gliding strategy in commuting flights during the breeding season. We considered 4.03 mLO<sub>2</sub>/min as the resting oxygen consumption, a figure that has been determined empirically for the lesser kestrel by open-circuit respirometry [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To estimate energy expenditure we used the standard conversion coefficient of 20.1 KJ/LO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], resulting in a resting metabolic rate for lesser kestrels of 1.35 W, which we adopted instead of the basal metabolic rate calculated using Pennycuick&#8217;s software. Finally, we calculated the individual total daily energy requirement by adding the estimates of daily energy requirements for foraging and resting.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to estimate the potential influence of solar radiation and thermal and orographic uplift in the flight variables of the lesser kestrel foraging trips.

Response variables used at the 6-hour interval level were mean values per interval.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the first group of models, we fitted GAMMs to every variable indicative of intensity or efficiency in the use of thermals (i.e., number of thermal soaring events and accumulated ascent per horizontal distance, and total ascent and mean climb speed per thermal soaring event) to assess whether they were affected by solar radiation, which we were using as a proxy for thermal updraft intensity. We fitted GAMMs to maximum flight altitude in order to test our hypothesis of increasing flight altitude with increasing solar radiation based on the fact that thermal updraft increases in depth with solar radiation. We also fitted GAMMs to maximum distance from the colony to test the hypothesis that with higher values of solar radiation the kestrels have higher potential energy gain to fly larger distances at a lower cost. As soaring can have a negative influence on flight speed, we fitted GAMMs to study the effect of solar radiation on the cross-country speed of commuting flights and the duration of foraging trips. We used a Gaussian distribution of errors and the identity link function to fit models to all flight variables tested as a response variable excluding maximum flight altitude, cross-country speed, and total ascent and mean climb speed per thermal soaring event; for these variables we used a gamma distribution of errors and the logarithmic link function (which were more adequate after exploration of model residuals). We included solar radiation as a continuous predictor and individual identity as the random factor of all models. In models fitted to flight variables at commuting flight level (maximum flight altitude, cross-country speed and the 4 variables of efficiency of thermal use), we included the commuting flight type as a categorical predictor with 2 levels (outward and inward flight) so as to assess potential differences in the flight behavior of individuals when leaving or returning to the colony. In models fitted to flight variables at foraging trip level (maximum distance from the colony and trip duration) we included the breeding colony as a categorical predictor with 2 levels and also its interaction with solar radiation because the landscape mosaic of land uses in the surroundings of the two colonies was completely different (agricultural and urban) and had an impact on prey availability, and possibly strong effects on the kestrels&#8217; foraging strategy. Furthermore, we included the GPS sampling frequency as a correction factor with 5 levels because it could affect calculation of variables obtained from flights tracked at different frequencies (maximum flight altitude, cross-country speed, maximum distance from the colony and duration).</p><p>For a direct estimation of the influence of thermal and orographic uplift on lesser kestrel flight variables and to differentiate the influence of each factor on flight behavior, we built a second group of GAMMs using mean values of flight variables at 6-h intervals as response variables to match the temporal resolution of uplift estimations available from meteorological models. These models provide a more direct insight into the relationship between lesser kestrel flight variables and thermal and orographic uplift compared to previous models that used solar radiation as a proxy. However they are constrained by the lower temporal resolution of climatic models which is an important limitation considering diurnal fluctuations in uplift. We used a Gaussian distribution of errors and the identity link function to fit models to all mean flight variables used as response variables except in those fitted to mean maximum flight altitude where we used a gamma distribution of errors and a logarithmic link. Residual analysis indicated that this was the best error distribution. In these models we included thermal uplift as a continuous predictor and date (year and day-of-year combined) as the random factor because of the lack of independence between observations on the same day that usually belong to the same individual. We also tested orographic uplift as a continuous predictor in the model to evaluate if kestrels flew not only by thermal soaring but also using slope soaring, more dependent on wind conditions. Since Env-DATA provided us with two orographic uplift estimates, we built two models for every response variable, each of which included one of the predictors and which were subsequently compared to each other. The orographic uplift estimate included in the best model of these two was also included in the final model of every response variable (see model selection later in this section). We performed a Bonferroni correction to adjust the significance level when testing the effect of orographic uplift on all kestrel flight variables. As with the first group of models, we also included the breeding colony and its interaction with thermal uplift as predictors.</p><p>We applied penalized smoothing splines to the solar radiation or thermal uplift estimate in all the GAMMs in order to take account of any nonlinear response to the predictor. The degrees of freedom of the smoothing function were automatically selected using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We followed the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection since it indicates that the best model is that with the lowest AIC value. The best GAMMs for cross-country speed of commuting flights, maximum distance from the colony, and duration of foraging trips when using solar radiation as a predictor were those including the smoothed term of the predictor. For the remaining response variables, the best GAMMs were those including the linear effect of solar radiation or thermal uplift. We therefore fitted these variables to Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) with the same distribution of errors and the same link function used to fit the GAMMs, and including the same predictors and random factors. We fitted the GLMMs following a backward-stepwise procedure, by removing non-significant predictors until only significant ones remained. The significance of the predictors was tested using likelihood ratio tests comparing the model with and without the predictor.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using R-3.0.2 software [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] fitting GAMMs and GLMMs using &#8220;mgcv&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and &#8220;lme4&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] packages, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Use of thermals</title><p>We tracked 18 individual lesser kestrels (10 males and 8 females) with a GPS-datalogger programmed at 1 fix per second, and identified 303 thermal soaring events.

However, our results show that lesser kestrels rely heavily on thermals and use them to soar in more than 80% of commuting flights between the colony and foraging areas during the breeding season. Unlike GPS tracking, direct observations are probably biased. While hovering kestrels are clearly visible in the field, a small kestrel gaining altitude on a thermal at more than 1000 m cannot be observed with the naked eye [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (see <xref rid="pone.0145402.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>). Our research is a valuable example of new insights into bird flight strategies thanks to continuous tracking and the higher spatiotemporal resolution provided by recent bio-logging devices [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. According to current state of flight theory it was not expected that small-sized birds, such as falcons, would rely heavily on thermal soaring because of the low energy benefits obtained given the cost in flight speed [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results indicate that lesser kestrels fly at relatively high cross-country speeds when soaring on strong thermals, a factor that to a certain degree mitigates the trade-off between energy and time when deciding to use thermal soaring. This is not the first study to describe thermal soaring in small birds [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but our study indicates that thermal soaring is used by lesser kestrels in a similar way to that characterizing large soaring raptors [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It could be argued that the extra load of the GPS-datalogger (6 g) forces the kestrels to use thermals more often than normal. If extra load was the cause of frequent thermal soaring we would expect a difference between inward and outward commuting flights. In inward flights kestrels usually return to the colony with a prey which is approximately an average 1&#8211;20 g of extra load. The results obtained from testing the commuting flight type as predictor (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicated no significant differences between inward and outward flights (Tables <xref rid="pone.0145402.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145402.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>).</p><p>During foraging trips in which thermal soaring is used, lesser kestrels fly towards foraging areas located farther from the colony (2.5 times) than during those without, but at the greater cost of time (3.5 times). Moreover, kestrels fly at higher altitudes (4.5 times) with lower cross-country speed (20% slower) when they use thermal soaring along commuting flights than when they do not (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The use of thermals by kestrels increases with the availability and strength of thermal updrafts as observed by its increased use with solar radiation (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Individual efficiency of thermal soaring (mean climb speed, total ascent per thermal and accumulated ascent per distance covered) increases with solar radiation (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Analyses, with a larger sample size, using all foraging trips throughout the breeding season also indicate that maximum flight altitude (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), maximum distance from the colony (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), and duration (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) increase with solar radiation. Cross-country speed in commuting flights initially decreases with solar radiation, but then increases again when the highest solar radiation values are reached (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Our analyses show a consistent positive effect of solar radiation and thermal uplift on lesser kestrel flight variables that suggests that atmospheric kinetic energy is highly significant in kestrel foraging strategies. In contrast, we do not find any evidence of kestrels using slope soaring when commuting between the colony and foraging areas. This is not surprising due to the low relief of our study area and the absence of strong constant winds, but lesser kestrels could take advantage of slope soaring to fly in more abrupt areas, as other raptor species do[<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As the availability, strength and depth of thermals are promoted by solar radiation, individual lesser kestrels use them more frequently and can improve their thermal soaring efficiency when solar radiation increases, as previously reported in large soaring raptors [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our findings suggest a segregation of flight strategy of the lesser kestrel regarding solar radiation conditions. Kestrels seem to fly by flapping mostly at lower solar radiation intensities when thermals are weak or not available, but they prefer thermal soaring at higher values of solar radiation when thermals are stronger, in line with the flight strategy of European bee-eaters <italic>Merops apiaster</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>Flight-cost models for lesser kestrels indicate that the soaring-gliding flight strategy is much cheaper (3&#8211;4 times) than continuous flapping. The difference is not negligible. This would explain why lesser kestrels mostly use thermal soaring when thermals are available. The increase in flight altitude with solar radiation (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) suggests an adjustment of kestrel flight strategy to thermal conditions in order to harvest the greatest possible amount of potential energy to reduce flight costs, as many studies have previously described in a variety of large soaring birds [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Considering that kestrels carry back one prey at a time and that optimal prey are 2&#8211;3 g grasshoppers [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], we estimate that long distance foraging flights for lesser kestrels would incur an energy deficit if flapping flights were used for commuting. A 2 g migratory locust <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (a typical prey species; see [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) would provide 14.98 KJ [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In our study area the average foraging trip performed with flapping flight would cost kestrels 20.91 KJ at minimum power but 6.75 KJ with soaring-gliding. Consequently, kestrels would need to feed on three prey every two foraging trips in order to maintain a positive energy balance if individuals fly by flapping during the foraging trips, whereas they would need a single prey every two foraging trips when thermal soaring. Thus, thermal soaring becomes a cost-effective flight strategy for foraging kestrels, especially when individuals also have to feed their mate or offspring. However, using a soaring-gliding strategy increases flight duration because of the lower cross-country speed (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Accordingly, when using this strategy, kestrels are optimizing the energy balance at the cost of a lower chick provisioning rate at the colony. The cross-country speed at which lesser kestrels fly in commuting flights when not using thermals (26.53 km/h) is closer to minimum power speed (31.36 km/h), a figure that is far from maximum range speed (54.72 km/h) indicated by flight models. Thus, even when using the powered flapping flight strategy kestrels try to reduce costs by flying at the speed of minimum energy cost along commuting flights.</p><p>Thermal soaring is therefore an essential strategy for lesser kestrels to reduce flight cost when searching for food during the breeding season. Kestrels would develop a cognitive map of how prey are spatially distributed in the surroundings of the colony through direct experience or &#8220;public information&#8221; [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Individuals would overlay this cognitive map with thermal availability in order to decide where to go to forage and finally adopt the optimal flight strategy to be used after weighing up the trade-off between energy and time costs of the trip. This leads to the concept of energy landscape to describe the spatial distribution of movement costs regarding individual location [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The energy landscape of a central-place forager, such as the breeding lesser kestrel, is strongly affected by the distance required to commute between the colony, or central place, and the foraging area: the greater the distance, the higher the flight cost [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, the energy landscape is not static and may change in space and time because of individual endogenous or exogenous factors [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Intraday variations in solar radiation mean that the energy available in the atmosphere in thermal updrafts is continuously changing in a predictable pattern. Therefore, there is a spatiotemporal energy landscape that kestrels can exploit on a daily basis. As solar radiation increases, prey that are farther from the colony have a lower energy cost. Thus, when thermal updrafts are low in the first hours after sunrise or before sunset, lesser kestrels adopt the costly flapping flight strategy to fly towards foraging areas close to the colony, resulting in short commuting flights. Meanwhile, as thermal updraft increases throughout the day, kestrels adopt the slower soaring-gliding flight strategy to fly towards foraging areas farther from the colony at reduced cost, but at the expense of a longer flight (Figs <xref rid="pone.0145402.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0145402.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145402.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>However, commuting to a foraging area far from the colony is only advantageous if prey are of higher quality in those areas, they are available in higher densities, or easier to catch. So, if kestrels increase foraging distance with solar radiation (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) or thermal uplift (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) this is because foraging farther afield provides them with some advantage. Negative density-dependent effects, such as low prey availability or high intraspecific competition, are commonly experienced by colonial species in the surroundings of the colony [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and might provide kestrels with enough motivation to fly towards foraging areas located far from the colony as soon as thermals form. As kestrels could easily reach these areas with flapping flight in the absence of thermals at a higher cross-country speed, this also supports the idea that there is an energy rather than a time constraint in increasing commuting flight distance. This is clearer when we compare the two kestrel colonies. The Silo colony surrounded by herbaceous crops, an optimal habitat for the lesser kestrel [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], shows a slight increase in foraging distance with solar radiation (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), while foraging trip duration remains almost constant (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Lesser kestrels increase foraging distance with the help of thermals thereby reducing competition and prey depletion close to the colony only when they can maintain the same chick provisioning rate. The EBD colony, surrounded by poorer habitats is likely to suffer from greater competition or prey depletion. As soon as thermals are available lesser kestrels fly towards herbaceous crops far from the colony, causing a decrease in the chick provisioning rate. This explains the bimodal distribution in the maximum foraging trip distance from the colony (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), and the dramatic increase in that distance (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) and in foraging trip duration (<xref rid="pone.0145402.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) with solar radiation. Therefore, thermal soaring is a crucial strategy for the lesser kestrel to prospect larger areas in the surroundings of the colony when searching for the unpredictable explosions of insects, especially when the colony is situated within a poor-quality habitat matrix.</p><p>Our estimates of daily energy expenditure for individual lesser kestrels during the breeding season (<xref rid="pone.0145402.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>) overlap in range with those previously obtained for this species using doubly-labelled water (~ 300 KJ/day) by Tella [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The difference in average values could be due to the study period, since Tella [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] estimated mean daily energy expenditure of kestrels during the nestling period whereas our estimates relate to the whole breeding season. Indeed, our values were similar to the daily energy expenditure of common kestrels (<italic>Falco tinnunculus)</italic> for the entire breeding season (200&#8211;400 KJ/day) [<xref rid="pone.0145402.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, when we examine the estimates of daily energy expenditure in relation to the flight strategy in foraging, we observe that those adopting a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy are much lower. The reason for this may be because lesser kestrels are unlikely to complete foraging trips by adopting only a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy, as they usually hunt by hovering, while they can use a pure flapping strategy when thermals are not available. Consequently, daily estimations of energy expenditure when foraging with a pure soaring-gliding flight strategy would underestimate the real values. Accordingly, our estimations of the lesser kestrel&#8217;s daily energy expenditure when adopting one pure flight strategy or another establish the extreme values of the energy expenditure gradient, within which the real values would be located.</p><p>To conclude, lesser kestrels rely heavily on thermals for foraging flights during the breeding season. Our findings indicate that lesser kestrels show a temporal segregation of flight strategy that leads to a spatial segregation of foraging areas on a daily basis. Kestrels fly by flapping towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals are absent, resulting in short foraging trips. But, as soon as thermals are available, kestrels use them to soar towards foraging areas far from the colony, presumably in order to avoid high competition, prey depletion or low-quality habitats in areas surrounding the colony, resulting in long foraging trips and consequently a reduced chick provisioning rate. This spatiotemporal segregation was more marked in the urban EBD colony, which is located in a poor-quality habitat. Our results indicate that during the breeding season lesser kestrels are more energy than time-constrained. The small size of the insect prey on which they forage and the limitation of providing a single prey at a time (kestrels transport a single prey to the colony in their beak or talons) mean that they can only forage far from the colony by harvesting energy from the environment, and at the expense of a reduced chick provisioning rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0145402.s001"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>Simulation of lesser kestrel flight during a real foraging trip tracked at 1-second frequency.</title><p>Simulation has been produced using Doarama, an on-line 3D visualization engine that allows GPS tracks to be uploaded and uses aerial imagery from the Bing repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.doarama.com/">https://www.doarama.com</ext-link>).
