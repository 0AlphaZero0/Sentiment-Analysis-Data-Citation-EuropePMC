The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I allele, HLA-C*06:02, is the main psoriasis risk gene. Epidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for psoriasis development. Functional implications of HLA-C*06:02 and mechanisms of lesional T cell activation in psoriasis, however, remained elusive. Here we identify melanocytes as skin-specific target cells of an HLA-C*06:02&#8211;restricted psoriatic T cell response. We found that a V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 T cell receptor (TCR), which we had reconstituted from an epidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone of an HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive psoriasis patient specifically recognizes HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive melanocytes. Through peptide library screening, we identified ADAMTS-like protein 5 (ADAMTSL5) as an HLA-C*06:02&#8211;presented melanocytic autoantigen of the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 TCR. Consistent with the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1-TCR reactivity, we observed numerous CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in psoriasis lesions attacking melanocytes, the only epidermal cells expressing ADAMTSL5. Furthermore, ADAMTSL5 stimulation induced the psoriasis signature cytokine, IL-17A, in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from psoriasis patients only, supporting a role as psoriatic autoantigen. This unbiased analysis of a TCR obtained directly from tissue-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reveals that in psoriasis HLA-C*06:02 directs an autoimmune response against melanocytes through autoantigen presentation. We propose that HLA-C*06:02 may predispose to psoriasis via this newly identified autoimmune pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Psoriasis vulgaris (OMIM no. <ext-link ext-link-type="Omim" xlink:href="MIM177900">MIM177900</ext-link>) is among the most frequent T cell&#8211;mediated disorders, affecting 120&#8211;180 million people worldwide by a chronically relapsing hyperproliferative skin inflammation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths and Barker, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lowes et al., 2007</xref>).

HLA-C*06:02 is present in more than 60% of patients, increases the risk for psoriasis 9- to 23-fold, and decides an earlier onset and more severe disease course (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gudjonsson et al., 2003</xref>). A direct contribution of HLA-C*06:02 to psoriasis manifestation, however, could not be determined as the result of a strong linkage disequilibrium within the <italic>PSORS1</italic> locus (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lowes et al., 2007</xref>) and a lack of experimental systems for analyzing its function in psoriasis.</p><p>HLA class I molecules present peptide antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Novel psoriasis lesions develop upon epidermal influx (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>) and clonal expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating persistent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment and activation by locally presented autoantigens (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Potential psoriatic autoantigens have been proposed by us and others mainly based on the hypothesis that the lesional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells react against keratinocytes (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Valdimarsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besgen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lande et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the target cells and antigens that drive pathogenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in psoriasis lesions are still unproven. Accordingly, an autoimmune pathogenesis of psoriasis remained hypothetical to date.</p><p>We formerly established an unbiased technique to characterize &#945;&#946; TCRs of single T cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). By this method, we identified dominant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones in psoriasis lesions and determined the molecular structure of their paired TCR &#945;- and &#946;-chain rearrangements. Clonal T cell expansions in autoimmune lesions result from a T cell response to locally presented autoantigens (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kent et al., 2005</xref>). Epidermal psoriatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells preferentially rearrange TCR V&#946;13S1 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1994</xref>). Here, we reconstitute a V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 TCR from an epidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone isolated from a psoriasis lesion of an HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive patient in a T hybridoma cell line. Along with human CD8&#945;&#946; and NFAT-sGFP transfection, this TCR hybridoma reports on TCR signaling by robust sGFP expression (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Seitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Siewert et al., 2012</xref>). Assuming that the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1-TCR hybridoma carries the antigen specificity of pathogenic psoriatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we used it to explore the mechanisms of lesional psoriatic T cell activation.</p><sec id="s01"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s02" sec-type=""><title>Melanocytes are HLA-C*06:02&#8211;restricted autoimmune target cells of the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 TCR</title><p>We first analyzed the reactivity of the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 TCR in co-culture experiments with various skin cell types in association with HLA-C*06:02. We observed that primary melanocytes from both HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive psoriasis patients and healthy donors, but not HLA-C*06:02&#8211;negative psoriasis patients or healthy individuals, activated the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1-TCR hybridoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Hybridoma activation was enhanced by preincubation of melanocytes with IFN-&#947; to increase the otherwise low HLA-C surface expression (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McCutcheon et al., 1995</xref>) and inhibited by an HLA class I&#8211;blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). To specify the role of HLA-C*06:02 in V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1-TCR ligation, we co-cultured the TCR hybridoma with two inherently HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive melanoma cell lines, WM278 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and 1205Lu (not depicted) as melanocyte surrogates.

Tissue sections were immunostained for CD8 and the melanocyte markers MART-1 or c-Kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bovenschen et al., 2005</xref>), the numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher in the epidermis of psoriasis lesions and nickel eczema than in normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Significantly more CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited direct contacts with melanocytes in psoriasis (median 37.2%, SD 15.4) than in nickel eczema (median 6.9%, SD 4.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In psoriasis biopsies where HLA-C*06:02 typing was available, contact frequencies in HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and negative (<italic>n</italic> = 3) samples were in a similar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The psoriatic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells polarized lytic granules containing Granzyme B toward the melanocyte contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>), indicating TCR-mediated activation. Lytic granules constitute an important effector mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but their directed release does not necessarily induce apoptosis of target cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Knickelbein et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, an antibody against cleaved Caspase 3 (cCASP3), a crucial mediator of apoptosis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Porter and J&#228;nicke, 1999</xref>) detected no signs of cell death in melanocytes in psoriatic epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Instead, melanocyte numbers in psoriasis lesions were reportedly increased (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, melanocytes are likely targets of a noncytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#8211;mediated autoimmune response in psoriasis. According to the selective epidermal localization of melanocytes, a melanocyte-directed autoimmune response may explain why psoriatic inflammation is primarily confined to the skin.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Melanocytes are targets of a noncytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in psoriasis lesions.</bold> (A and B) Representative immunohistologic images of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (green) and melanocytes (red) stained for c-Kit (A) or MART-1 (B) in healthy skin (<italic>n</italic> = 5), nickel contact eczema (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and psoriasis (<italic>n</italic> = 23).

Unlike the antigenic peptides, none of the corresponding full-length proteins activated the TCR hybridoma when coexpressed with HLA-C*06:02 in COS-7 cells or the human cell line, HEK293FT, although Western blot confirmed ectopic protein expression (not depicted). When overexpressed in genuinely stimulatory HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive WM278 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>) or 1205Lu cells (not depicted), however, one of the six parent proteins, ADAMTSL5, enhanced V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1-TCR hybridoma activation substantially beyond the basal activation induced by vector-transfected cells. Conversely, ADAMTSL5 protein lost its ability for TCR hybridoma stimulation upon deletion (Del<sub>58&#8211;65</sub>) or alanine substitution (Ala<sub>58&#8211;65</sub>) of the peptide epitope when expressed in both HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive WM278 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>) and 1205Lu cells or HLA-C*06:02&#8211;negative WM9 cells cotransfected with HLA-C*06:02 (not depicted). Knockdown of ADAMTSL5 in WM278 cells diminished TCR hybridoma activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>). Thus, only ADAMTSL5 retained the antigenicity of the peptide epitope as a full-length protein in HLA-C*06:02&#8211;positive or HLA-C*06:02&#8211;transfected melanocytic target cells, corroborating its role as psoriatic autoantigen of the V&#945;3S1/V&#946;13S1 TCR in melanocytes.

ADAMTSL5-2 siRNA and control siRNAs 1 and 2 were obtained from MWG Eurofins. siRNA target sequences are given in Table S2. 24 h after siRNA transfection of WM278 cells, 100 ng/ml IFN-&#947; was added. 24 h later, medium was replaced and hybridoma cells were added and co-cultured for 24 h.</p><p>For validation of ADAMTSL5 knockdown, ADAMTSL5 mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in triplicates using Light Cycler 2.0 (Roche). Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) mRNA was used as an internal standard.</p></sec><sec id="s20" sec-type=""><title>Immunofluorescence staining of paraffin sections</title><p>Sections (5 &#181;m) from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples were cut on adhesive glass slides (SuperFrost plus; Menzel-Glaeser), dewaxed, and rehydrated. Heat-induced antigen retrieval used Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris Base, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9.0) at 120&#176;C for 15 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibody or isotype controls at 4&#176;C for 12&#8211;60 h, washed, and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 90 min. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. ADAMTSL5-blocking peptide was added at 5 ng/ml.</p><p>For multiple stainings, primary antibodies were used in conditions established in single-color stainings. For triple staining, anti&#8211;Granzyme B antibody was stained using the tyramide signal amplification method (TSA; PerkinElmer).

Epidermal segments were evaluated in each photographic image using Fiji/ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Stained cells and direct cell contacts were counted in each overlay independently by two authors. Resulting median values in each individual were used for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s22" sec-type=""><title>PBMC peptide stimulation, intracellular cytokine staining, and ELISA</title><p>PBMCs were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Freshly isolated PBMCs were seeded to 96-well flat-bottom plates (10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 IU/ml IL-2 and 10% human AB serum. Highly purified ADAMTSL5 peptide (VRSRRCLRL, purity &gt;95%; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an unrelated peptide (ELQGLKDD) lacking homology to human proteins were used at 10 ng/ml.</p><p>Intracellular cytokine staining was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2011</xref>). After 48 h of peptide stimulation, monensin (Golgi stop [BD], 0.35 &#181;l for 200 &#181;l culture medium) was added for 5 h. Cells were surface stained for CD8, fixed, and permeabilized in fixation buffer (eBioscience) and intracellularly stained using antibodies against IL-17A and IFN-&#947;. Data were analyzed by FlowJo software 887 (Tree Star). Lymphocyte gates were defined using SSC and FSC channels. Positive/negative cut-off levels for IFN-&#947; and IL-17A were defined by isotype control stainings of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in unstimulated samples from healthy donors in each experiment.</p><p>To determine cytokine secretion, PBMCs were stimulated with peptides for 48 h as described above for intracellular cytokine staining. Culture supernatants were harvested, and IFN-&#947; and IL-17A were quantified in triplicates using ELISA kits (Mabtech). During the experiments, the investigator was blinded for the sample group allocation. Thresholds for positive cytokine induction by ADAMTSL5 peptide are set at mean + 3SD of healthy control samples.</p></sec><sec id="s23" sec-type=""><title>HLA typing</title><p>HLA haplotypes were determined by sequence-based typing at the Laboratory for Immunogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, University of Munich.

There is more than one group without normal distributions in each comparison (Shapiro-Wilk W test). Accordingly, when the p-value of Kruskal-Wallis H-test was significant, two-group comparison was performed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Different proportions in the two groups were compared using Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Software version 4 and R software.
