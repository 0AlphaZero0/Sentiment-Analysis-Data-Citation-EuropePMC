This is despite T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) exerting usually a moderate affinity (&#181;M range) to antigen when binding is measured <italic>in vitro</italic><sup>1</sup>. In view of the molecular and cellular parameters contributing to T-cell antigen sensitivity, a microscopy-based methodology has been developed as a means to monitor TCR-pMHC binding <italic>in situ</italic>, as it occurs within the synapse of a live T-cell and an artificial and functionalized glass-supported planar lipid bilayer (SLB), which mimics the cell membrane of an Antigen presenting Cell (APC) <sup>2</sup>. Measurements are based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between a blue- and red-shifted fluorescent dye attached to the TCR and the pMHC. Because the efficiency of FRET is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the inter-dye distance, one can employ FRET signals to visualize synaptic TCR-pMHC binding. The sensitive of the microscopy approach supports detection of single molecule FRET events. This allows to determine the affinity and off-rate of synaptic TCR-pMHC interactions and in turn to interpolate the on-rate of binding. Analogous assays could be applied to measure other receptor-ligand interactions in their native environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd>Bioengineering</kwd><kwd>Issue 104</kwd><kwd>T-cell antigen recognition</kwd><kwd>receptor-ligand interaction kinetics</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>Calcium flux measurement</kwd><kwd>single molecule microscopy</kwd><kwd>F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><fig id="Fig_53157" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><alternatives><media id="Video_53157" xlink:href="jove-104-53157.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor"/><graphic xlink:href="jove-104-53157-thumb"/></alternatives></fig><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A more fundamental understanding of how T-cells recognize antigens requires looking at the right place, that is, within the immunological synapse formed between the T-cell and the APC. Here, molecular binding kinetics are not only determined by the inherent biochemical properties of the interaction partners involved but depend to a large extent on cellular parameters, which include cellular forces, membrane architecture and lateral interactions between membrane proteins as well as synapse-specific geometrical constraints <sup>3</sup>. Biochemical approaches are limited in resolving power as they necessitate the disruption of at least one of the synaptic membranes involved. For this reason a FRET-based imaging methodology was developed to monitor binding of the TCR to antigenic pMHCs <sup>2</sup>. Here T-cells are decorated with a recombinant and site-specifically labeled TCR&#946;-reactive single chain antibody fragment (scF<sub>V</sub>) and confronted with planar glass-supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), which harbor MHC class II molecules loaded with a fluorescently labeled antigenic peptide, costimulatory molecules and adhesion proteins. Synaptic binding between dye-labeled TCR and dye-labeled pMHC results in FRET, which can be monitored on a bulk and single molecule level by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.</p><p>In this article it is explained in detail how to utilize SLBs for assaying T-cell synapses, verify their integrity through a functional T-cell calcium-flux assay, conduct FRET measurements in bulk and with single molecule sensitivity, and analyze the acquired data. Recommendations are offered to producing properly conformed proteins required for bilayer functionalization. For more specific information regarding bilayer formation and setup of a suitable TIRF microscope please refer to an additional public access JoVE publication published back to back <sup>4</sup>.</p><p>Nature of SLBs</p><p>Functionalizable SLBs can be readily generated from unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) containing the two lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-gylcero-3-phosphocholine (short: POPC, 90-99%) and 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-{[N(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid] succinyl} (short: DGS NTA-Ni, 1-10%). SUVs spread on clean glass slides to form a contiguous planar bilayer <sup>4</sup>. DGS-NTA-Ni serves to anchor polyhistidine-tagged proteins via polyhistidine-mediated complex-formation with the synthetic NTA-Ni-containing head group (<bold>Figure 1A</bold>). For stable association one typically replaces the native transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the adhesion protein ICAM-1 and the costimulatory molecule B7-1 with one tag containing twelve histidines (ICAM-1-12H, B7-1 -12H) (<bold>Figure 1B</bold>). The peptide-loaded class II molecule I-E<sup>k</sup> contains two membrane-embedded (&#945; and &#946;) polypeptide chains. The transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of both chains have to be replaced with a tag containing six histidines each (I-E<sup>k</sup>&#945;<sub>6H</sub> &#946;<sub>6H</sub> or I-E<sup>k</sup>-2x6H). As an alternative, extending the &#945;-chain with twelve histidines and leaving the extracellular domain of the &#946;-chain untagged (giving rise to I-E<sup>k</sup>&#945;<sub>12H</sub> &#946;<sub>0H</sub> or I-E<sup>k</sup>-12H) gives rise to satisfactory results (<bold>Figure 1B</bold>).</p><p>Site-specific labeling of pMHCs</p><p>It is important to label the pMHC stoichiometrically and site-specifically in order to be able to convert measured FRET yields into meaningful equilibrium binding constants. This can be achieved by chemical labeling of a synthetic peptide that is loaded into the peptide-binding cleft of recombinant histidine-tagged MHC class II molecules <sup>2,5</sup>. The peptide includes all residues of the T-cell epitope as well as a short C-terminal linker (GGS) followed by cysteine (e.g. in the moth cytochrome c (MCC) peptide ANERADLIAYLKQATK-<bold>GGSC</bold>, the linker is marked in bold). This cysteine is used to label the peptide stoichiometrically with the use of maleimide-dye derivatives. At this point extra care should be devoted to verifying quantitative dye-coupling to the cysteine-containing peptide. HPLC-purification of the peptide-dye adduct is recommended and has to be followed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. Any recorded masses corresponding to the peptide educt (without dye) reflect incomplete labeling. If this is true, the HPLC-purified peptide should be subjected to consecutive rounds of dye-labeling until labeling is deemed quantitative. Note that MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy should be avoided as this method involves laser radiation for sample ionization. This treatment disintegrates the attached sensitive fluorophores before peptide mass is read out and thus underrepresents degrees of dye-conjugation.</p><p>Indirect yet site-specific labeling of cell-bound TCRs with the use of monovalent single chain F<sub>V</sub> fragments</p><p>It is still challenging to attach dyes to cell surface-associated proteins of living cells in a site-specific manner. To overcome this hurdle for surface-exposed TCRs, a monovalent single chain version (scF<sub>V</sub>) from the genes of the TCR&#946; -reactive monoclonal antibody H57-197 <sup>2</sup>has been constructed. The crystal structure of this antibody in complex with the TCR allows to rationally design a version, in which a serine residue in close proximity to the C-terminus of the MHC associated peptide (where the corresponding FRET partner dye is attached) is substituted for a cysteine residue. This mutant cysteine then serves as an acceptor for dye conjugation (<bold>Figure 2</bold>).</p><p>Methodologies to record FRET</p><p>Bulk FRET values are best suited to verify the relationship between chosen inter-dye distances and FRET efficiencies measured in this TCR-pMHC binding system <sup>2</sup>. In addition, bulk FRET measurements reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in synaptic TCR-pMHC affinities (see below and protocol section 3.2). Various approaches for quantifying FRET efficiencies have been introduced in the literature <sup>6</sup>. In this article FRET is recorded via</p><p>(a) donor recovery after acceptor bleaching, and via</p><p>(b) sensitized FRET acceptor emission.</p><p>The first method (a) requires the use of a FRET acceptor that can be easily photobleached, and a donor, which is rather photostable. In addition it is important to ensure that the photobleached acceptor is no longer capable of quenching the donor fluorescence. As the same detection channel (donor) is used for quantification, no correction factors and no chromatic aberrations have to be considered, which renders this methodology simple and reliable. However, quantitative measurements cannot be repeated on the same specimen spot and changes in FRET cannot be recorded over time. To avoid effects caused by molecular diffusion or cellular motility a fast bleaching step should be aimed for, which minimizes the time passing between the first FRET donor (before acceptor bleaching) and the second FRET donor image acquisition (after FRET acceptor bleaching). It is recommend to employ a powerful laser light source of the FRET acceptor excitation wavelength in order to minimize illumination and bleaching times.</p><p>In contrast, in the approach of sensitized FRET emission measurement (b) the FRET donor is excited and the emission of the FRET acceptor is observed in the FRET acceptor channel. Changes in FRET acceptor signal can be recorded over time but emission of the FRET donor into the red-shifted acceptor channel (termed bleedthrough) and FRET acceptor cross-excitation via donor excitation have to be accurately determined and subtracted from the recorded FRET acceptor channel. For this the corresponding FRET donor and FRET acceptor images have to be spatially aligned.</p><p>Detection of single molecule (sm) FRET events</p><p>With the use of lasers as excitation source, a sensitive camera and noise-attenuated TIRF microscopy the fluorescence of single fluorophores can be easily traced over time. Similar is true for the detection of intermolecular smFRET events. However, complications may be caused by FRET donor bleedthrough and cross-excitation of the FRET acceptor, and thus great care has to be taken when adjusting the fluorophore densities in the smFRET experiment.</p><p>In the protocol provided below (protocol section 4) the TCR was chosen as FRET donor in high abundance and pMHC as FRET acceptor in low abundance. To attenuate FRET donor bleedthrough sufficiently, decorate 10-30% of the TCRs with fluorescent scF<sub>V</sub> and 90-70% of the TCRs with non-fluorescent scF<sub>V</sub>. Here the FRET acceptor channel was chosen as single molecule channel because it is confocal with the single molecule FRET channel. This helps to align smFRET events with single molecule FRET acceptors, which is the basis of smFRET validation.</p><p>Extracting synaptic off-rates through smFRET measurements</p><p>Photobleaching of both FRET donor and FRET acceptor have to be accounted for when extracting the half-life of interactions from single molecule FRET traces. The number of observable FRET-signals at the beginning of their appearance as single donor-acceptor pair <italic>N(0)</italic> is reduced over time by both unbinding of the receptor-ligand complex and photobleaching. The number of surviving complexes at a given time <italic>N(t)</italic> can be mathematically expressed as follows:</p><p>
<graphic xlink:href="jove-104-53157-0.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/>
</p><p>In the photobleaching term <italic>exp(-t/<bold>&#964;</bold><sub>bleach</sub>)</italic> the time <italic>t</italic> is described by the product of the number of observations <italic>n</italic> and the illumination time <italic>t<sub>ill</sub></italic> because of the non-continuous, discrete observation mode (<italic>i.e.</italic>, bleaching only occurs during illumination). Within the kinetic term <italic>exp-(t/<bold>&#964;</bold><sub>off</sub>)</italic> the time <italic>t</italic> is the product of the number of observations <italic>n</italic> and the time <italic>t<sub>lag</sub></italic> for a single FRET observation (<italic>i.e.</italic>, kinetic unbinding happens continuously). Equation 1 can be expressed as:</p><p>
<graphic xlink:href="jove-104-53157-1.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/>
</p><p>The term <italic><bold>&#964;</bold></italic><sub>bleach</sub>/<italic><bold>&#964;</bold></italic><sub>ill</sub> describes the number of observations until bleaching occurs and is defined as the expectation value <italic>&lt;n<sub>bleach</sub>&gt;</italic> of its exponential function. Equation 2 can be simplified as follows:</p><p>
<graphic xlink:href="jove-104-53157-2.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/>
</p><p>The expectation value <italic>&lt;n(t<sub>lag</sub>)&gt;</italic> of the number of frames <italic>N(t)</italic> with observable FRET-events after time <italic>t</italic> is directly determined from the experiment. It depends on the settable time between observations (<italic>t<sub>lag</sub></italic>) chosen in the experiment and the unknown values for <italic>&#964;<sub>off</sub></italic> (the inverse of the off-rate <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> ) and <italic>&lt;n<sub>bleach</sub>&gt;</italic>, the expectation value of number of observations before bleaching occurs.</p><p>Thus, calculation of the expectation value <italic>&lt;n(t<sub>lag</sub>)&gt;</italic> for at least two values of <italic>t<sub>lag </sub></italic>allows the experimental determination of <italic>&lt;n<sub>bleach</sub>&gt;</italic> and <italic>&#964;<sub>off</sub></italic> .</p><p>Extracting synaptic 2D-K<sub>D</sub> values through FRET-based measurements</p><p>Measuring TCR occupancy a, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the ratio between bound TCRs and total TCRs, is central to determining synaptic <italic>2D-K<sub>D</sub></italic> values. According to equation 4 this term is directly proportional to the measured FRET yield as long as TCRs serves as FRET donors and pMHCs as FRET acceptors.</p><p>

</p><p>with a = TCR occupancy, <italic>C</italic> =conversion factor</p><p><italic>C</italic> is a constant, which depends on the FRET system and the fluorophores used. It can be determined experimentally as shown below. a can be converted into a <italic>2D-K<sub>D</sub></italic> according to equation 5 when the initial density of TCR ligands prior to addition of T-cells to the bilayer is known. This is because of the high mobility of SLB-attached proteins and also because SLBs provide an almost inexhaustible reservoir of ligands <sup>2</sup>.</p><p>

</p><p>with <italic>[pMHC <sub>initial</sub>]</italic> = initial density of pMHC prior to the addition of T-cells</p><p>With equations 4 and 5 one can now easily determine the synaptic <italic>2D-K<sub>D</sub></italic> between TCR and pMHC. This is most reliably done with FRET measurements based on donor recovery after acceptor bleaching (see protocol section 3.1).</p><p>However, to measure <italic>C</italic> the relationship between the FRET intensity <italic>I<sub>FRET</sub></italic>(corrected for background, FRET donor bleedthrough and FRET acceptor cross-excitation) and TCR occupancy a has to be determined. For this, one needs to know the ratio R between the average fluorescence intensity of single TCR-associated FRET donor fluorophores (e.g. Cy3 or AF555) sm <italic>I<sub>FRET donor</sub></italic> and the average intensity of single molecule FRET events sm <italic>I<sub>FRET</sub></italic>. R depends on the FRET system in question, emission filters and camera used for fluorescence detection.</p><p>The TCR occupancy a can then be directly determined according to equation 6.</p><p>

<italic>a= bulk I<sub>FRET</sub>/ bulk I<sub>TCR-cy3 </sub>&#8226; 1.45</italic>
</p><p>The relationship between the TCR occupancy a and the FRET yield can be determined by FRET donor recovery after acceptor bleaching. For this both parameters are plotted against one another for a number TCR microclusters as shown in <bold>Figure 4A</bold>.The slope of the linear fit indicates the conversion factor <italic>C</italic> (from equation 4).</p><p>As demonstrated in <bold>Figure 4A</bold>, C amounts for (a) the H57 scF<sub>V</sub>- Cy3/pMHC-Cy5 FRET system and (b) the applied microscope system configuration to 1.995.

This is because the on-rate as well as the stability of such interactions are significantly influenced by the particular circumstances under which binding takes place. Minimally-invasive FRET-based imaging approaches are thus in principle perfectly suited for such tasks, yet involve a number of hurdles that must first be overcome. Noise generated by cellular autofluorescence limits the sensitivity of the measurements and should therefore be kept at a minimum. TIRF microscopy serves this need very well <sup>12</sup> but requires the functionalization of glass-slides, ideally in the form of a planar glass-supported lipid bilayer decorated with proteins of choice <sup>13-15</sup>. Another advantage of a partly reconstitutive approach is that recombinant bilayer-resident FRET partners can be much more easily labeled in a quantitative, site-specific and rational manner with smaller and brighter fluorophores than would be possible with cell surface-expressed proteins. TCRs are tagged with recombinant scF<sub>V</sub>s, which do not influence T-cell recognition, as was tested previously <sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the protein composition of the SLB, for example the density of pMHCs and the choice of accessory factors can be adjusted to one&#8217;s specific needs. We have previously performed experiments with varying densities of stimulatory pMHCs, but have not detected significant differences in 2D-k<sub>off</sub> and 2D-K<sub>D</sub><sup>2</sup>.</p><p>So far here the recognition of MHC class II molecules has been dealt with only, mainly because of the nature of their peptide binding cleft, which is open at both ends and thus accommodates larger peptides including a linker for fluorophore attachment. In some cases such approach might also work for labeling MHC class I molecules <sup>16</sup> but great caution should be taken to verify their use in experiments. The sensitivity of T-cells towards antigens, which can be measured via T-cell proliferation assays, as well as the pMHC-TCR binding kinetics as measured <italic>in vitro</italic> by surface plasmon resonance should not be affected by the addition of the linker and fluorophore to the peptide. Alternatively, MHC class I molecules themselves can be labeled in a site-specific manner with the introduction of an unpaired cysteine within the sequence of the heavy chain (unpublished observations).</p><p>With the use of appropriate molecular probes any synaptic protein-protein interaction can in principle be studied in a fashion described herein. Such probes, <italic>e.g.,</italic> scF<sub>V</sub>s or Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins)<sup>17</sup>, should be monovalent and should bind their target stably without affecting the interaction of interest. Of course, structural information is highly desirable for rational probe design but not absolutely required. When establishing a new pair of FRET partners, it is recommended to record and analyze FRET in bulk first. Sites of label attachment may be varied considerably to maximize the FRET signal and also to verify that measured FRET yields differ based on the inter-dye distance. Once the system is optimized, single molecule FRET signals may be recorded by limiting the labeling of the high abundance FRET partner to 10-30% and bleaching the low abundance FRET partner until single molecules are resolvable in the field of illumination.</p><p>Last but not least it should be noted that SLBs approximate some but not all aspects of a physiological plasma membrane. Qualities such as membrane curvature and flexibility, domain compartmentalization, cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell motility as well as a high variety of surface-expressed membrane proteins are not represented by SLBs but might influence the process under investigation. Much effort will need to be invested to establish imaging modalities that allow monitoring protein-protein interactions with single molecule resolution in physiological synapses, which are inaccessible to TIRF imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing financial interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>M.A. was supported by a Schr&#246;dinger fellowship of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, J3086-B11) and thanks the Max-Planck-Society for financial and administrative support.
