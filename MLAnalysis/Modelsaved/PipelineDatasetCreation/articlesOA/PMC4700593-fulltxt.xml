In proteins, the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine (Met) is converted to methionine sulfoxide (Met-O), which can cause a loss of biological activity. To rescue proteins with Met-O residues, living cells express methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) in most subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplasts <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Here, we report the identification of an enzymatic system, MsrPQ, repairing Met-O containing proteins in the bacterial cell envelope, a compartment particularly exposed to the ROS and RCS generated by the host defense mechanisms. MsrP, a molybdo-enzyme, and MsrQ, a heme-binding membrane protein, are widely conserved throughout Gram-negative bacteria, including major human pathogens. MsrPQ synthesis is induced by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful antimicrobial released by neutrophils. Consistently, MsrPQ is essential for the maintenance of envelope integrity under bleach stress, rescuing a wide series of structurally unrelated periplasmic proteins from Met oxidation, including the primary periplasmic chaperone SurA. For this activity, MsrPQ uses electrons from the respiratory chain, which represents a novel mechanism to import reducing equivalents into the bacterial cell envelope. A remarkable feature of MsrPQ is its capacity to reduce both <italic>R</italic>- and <italic>S</italic>- diastereoisomers of Met-O, making this oxidoreductase complex functionally different from previously identified Msrs. The discovery that a large class of bacteria contain a single, non-stereospecific enzymatic complex fully protecting Met residues from oxidation should prompt search for similar systems in eukaryotic subcellular oxidizing compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5">The fact that no Msr had been identified in the cell envelope of important human pathogens, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, was surprising as this compartment is particularly exposed to the oxidizing compounds present in the environment. We postulated that such a Met-O reducing system had remained unidentified, and applied a genetic approach to uncover it, using <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model. We first constructed an <italic>E. coli</italic> Met auxotroph mutant lacking all cytoplasmic Msrs and found this strain (JB590) to be unable to use Met-O as the only Met source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We then searched for suppressor mutations conferring Met-O reducing capacity to JB590, which led to the isolation of strain BE100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Genetic analysis of the suppressor revealed the presence of an insertion sequence element (IS2) within <italic>yedV</italic>, a gene coding for the histidine kinase of the uncharacterized YedV/YedW two-component system <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In close vicinity were two genes, <italic>yedY</italic> and <italic>yedZ</italic>, encoding, respectively, a periplasmic molybdopterin-containing oxidoreductase and its putative membrane redox partner <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. YedY had been shown to reduce a variety of substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>, including trimethylamine N-oxide, and dimethyl, methionine and tetramethylene sulfoxides <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, its physiological function had remained elusive, although a recent study in <italic>Azospira suillum</italic> suggested the homologous protein to be important for HOCl resistance <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We found that insertion of the IS2 led to a 100-fold increase in the levels of the <italic>yedYZ</italic> mRNA in strain BE100 and to higher YedY protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Deletion of either <italic>yedY</italic> or <italic>yedZ</italic> prevented BE100 to grow on Met-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), while the simultaneous overproduction of YedY and YedZ, but not of YedY or YedZ alone, rendered the parental strain JB590 able to use Met-O (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that the ability of the suppressor strain BE100 to reduce Met-O resulted from the increased synthesis of YedY and YedZ, implying that these two proteins function together as an Msr system. Growth of the BE100 strain was dependent on <italic>moeA,</italic> a gene required for the synthesis of molybdopterin cofactors, and on <italic>tatC</italic>, encoding a protein required for the translocation of metalloenzymes across the inner membrane (IM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Exposure of wild-type cells to HOCl, but not to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, induced the synthesis of YedY to levels comparable to those observed in BE100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), indicating that these proteins are specifically expressed in response to bleach stress. Interestingly, induction by HOCl was dependent on the presence of a functional YedV/YedW system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">All previously identified Msrs rely on electrons derived from NADPH <italic>via</italic> the thioredoxin system for activity <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. This was not the case for YedYZ, as deletion of <italic>trxA</italic>, encoding the thioredoxin responsible for Msr recycling <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, had no effect on the ability of BE100 to reduce Met-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). As YedZ contains a <italic>b</italic>-type heme <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, a cofactor typically associated with the quinone oxidizing cytochrome <italic>b</italic> of the respiratory chain complexes, we considered the respiratory chain as a potential electron source. Deletion of <italic>menA</italic> and <italic>ubiE</italic>, two genes required for quinone synthesis, prevented BE100 from utilizing Met-O (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>), supporting a model in which YedZ uses electrons derived from the IM pool of mature quinones to provide reducing equivalents to YedY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). From now on, YedY and YedZ will be referred to as MsrP (for <underline>p</underline>eriplasm) and MsrQ (for <underline>q</underline>uinone), respectively.</p><p id="P7">We then tested whether MsrPQ, in addition to free Met-O, also rescued Met-O residues present in proteins. Purified MsrP was shown to reduce N-acetyl-Met-O, a substrate mimicking protein-bound Met-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>), with a K<sub>m</sub> of 3.8 &#177; 1.2 mM, in line with the values reported for other Msrs <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Note that in the experiments involving purified MsrP, electrons were provided to the oxidoreductase by an inorganic system reducing molybdoenzymes <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Next, we tested the ability of MsrP to reduce oxidized calmodulin (CaMox), a substrate commonly used to assess Msr activity. We used a gel shift assay based on the reduced mobility exhibited in SDS-PAGE by proteins containing Met-O <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Incubation of CaMox with MsrP restored its mobility, suggesting that MsrP was able to reduce Met-O residues in CaMox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This was confirmed by showing with LC-MS/MS that the oxidized Met residues that could be detected in CaMox were reduced back to levels similar to those observed in CaM following incubation with MsrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that MsrP is able to reduce protein-bound Met-O.</p><p id="P8">Upon oxidation, two diastereoisomers of Met-O can form, referred to as <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S,</italic> owing to the asymmetric position of the oxidized sulfur atom in the lateral chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). All Msrs described so far exhibit stereospecificity, specifically reducing either the <italic>R</italic> (MsrB, MsrC) or the <italic>S</italic> isoform (MsrA, BisC). Using highly pure diastereoisomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>), we found MsrP to exhibit activity towards both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), with K<sub>m</sub> values of 25.7 &#177; 4.7 mM and 8.0 &#177; 2.7 mM for <italic>R</italic>- and <italic>S</italic>-Met-O, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Accordingly, the BE100 suppressor strain was able to use <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic> Met-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), in contrast to strains expressing single stereospecific Msrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus, MsrP is a new type of Msr with no stereospecificity.</p><p id="P9">To search for the physiological substrates of MsrP, periplasmic proteins from a &#916;<italic>msrP</italic> mutant were oxidized with HOCl, incubated with MsrP and subjected to a semi-quantitative 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis. 20 proteins that had one or more HOCl-oxidized Met residues that MsrP could reduce were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). Using gel shift assays in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis, we confirmed the ability of MsrP to reduce the chaperone SurA and the lipoprotein Pal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). Altogether these results established that MsrP is able to repair a wide panel of structurally and functionally diverse periplasmic proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="P10">SurA is the primary periplasmic chaperone, escorting most &#946;-barrel proteins to the outer membrane (OM) <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. As HOCl-oxidized SurA loses its chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), we used this property to probe the physiological importance of the MsrPQ system. First, we showed that SurA could be oxidized <italic>in vivo</italic> by HOCl and that expression of the MsrPQ system, but not of MsrP alone, restored its mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Similar results were obtained for Pal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), confirming that MsrP and MsrQ collaborate in the protection of SurA and Pal from oxidative damage. We then tested if the repair of SurA by MsrP, which restores the activity of the chaperone <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), was important to keep SurA active under HOCl stress. For this, we used a mutant strain lacking the chaperone Skp, in which SurA becomes essential <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We found that deleting <italic>msrP</italic> rendered the &#916;<italic>skp</italic> strain hypersensitive to HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that oxidized, inactive SurA accumulates in the absence of MsrP. In agreement with this, the sensitivity of the &#916;<italic>skp</italic>&#916;<italic>msrP</italic> mutant to HOCl was suppressed by overexpression of SurA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Further highlighting the need to protect Met residues in periplasmic proteins, HOCl-pretreated &#916;<italic>msrP</italic> mutants were found to be more sensitive to SDS, a phenotype indicative of defects in the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">The conservation of MsrPQ throughout Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">6</xref>) illustrates the importance of having a Met-O reducing system in the periplasm. <italic>Neisseria</italic> species stand out as an exception in lacking MsrPQ. However, in these bacteria, evolutionary tinkering generated an envelope hybrid protein combining two classic stereospecific Msr domains <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. A remarkable feature of MsrPQ is that its rescue activity depends on electrons provided by the respiratory chain. This represents an entirely novel way to provide reducing power for protein quality control in the envelope. Indeed, known-reducing systems functioning in the periplasm use electrons provided by the IM protein DsbD and thioredoxin <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Hence, diverting electrons from the respiratory chain to control extracytosolic protein quality is an unprecedented link between metabolism and cellular integrity.</p><p id="P12">The chaperone SurA is one of the targets of the MsrPQ system. Having a protein folding helper under the control of a repair system reveals an additional layer in the complex periplasmic protein quality control network. Testing if this system is an attractive target for antimicrobial development, as suggested by the colonization defect exhibited by the <italic>msrP</italic> mutant in <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, will be fields of future research. By highlighting the importance of protecting proteins targeted to oxidizing compartments, our work calls for a detailed investigation of the process of Met-O reduction in the ER, where only an <italic>R</italic>-Met-O specific MsrB has been identified <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. As long speculated, a possibility would be that the ER contains an epimerase catalyzing the interconversion of <italic>R</italic>- and <italic>S</italic>-Met-O. Alternatively, in light of the present study, the ER could contain a novel Met-O reducing system yet to be discovered.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Strains and microbial techniques</title><p id="P13">The strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Unless otherwise specified, for all deletion mutants, the corresponding alleles from the Keio collection <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> were transferred into the MC4100 wild-type strain using P1 transduction standard procedures <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and checked by PCR. To excise the resistance cassette, we used pCP20 <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Strain AG227, deleted for the entire <italic>yedYZ</italic> operon, was constructed as follows. First, a <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette, encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and SacB, a protein conferring sensitivity to sucrose, was amplified from strain CH1990 using primers <italic>yedYZ::cat-sacB</italic>_Fw and <italic>yedYZ::cat-sacB</italic>_Rv. The resulting PCR product shared a 40-bp homology to the 5&#8242; UTR of <italic>yedY</italic> (<italic>msrP)</italic> and to the 3&#8242; UTR of <italic>yedZ</italic> (<italic>msrQ)</italic> at its 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; ends, respectively. After purification, the PCR product was transformed by electroporation into CH1940. These cells harbor the pSIM5-tet vector, which encodes the Red recombination system proteins Gam, Beta and Exo under the control of the temperature-sensitive repressor cI859, encoded by the same vector. Induction of the Gam, Beta and Exo proteins was induced by shifting the cells to 42&#176;C for 15 minutes prior to making them electrocompetent. Recombinant cells were selected on chloramphenicol-containing plates (25 &#956;g/ml) at 37&#176;C for 16h. At this temperature, the pSIM5-tet vector, which has a temperature-sensitive origin of replication, is lost. Colonies were also tested for the presence of the <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette by negative selection on sucrose-containing media (5% sucrose, no NaCl). Finally, we verified that the <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette replaced the <italic>msrPQ</italic> operon in the resulting strain (AG219) by sequencing across the junctions. The <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette was subsequently moved from AG219 to TP1004 by P1 transduction. The <italic>cat-sacB</italic> cassette was eliminated from the resulting strain (AG220) by transforming it with the pSIM5-tet plasmid, electroporating it with the oligonucleotide Delta_<italic>yedYZ</italic> (300 ng) and performing lambda red recombination as described above. Recombinants were selected on sucrose-containing media at 30&#176;C for 16h. To eliminate the plasmid, the selected colonies were grown at 37&#176;C for 16h. Loss of the cassette in the resulting AG227 strain was verified by positive (sucrose resistance) and negative (chloramphenicol sensitivity) selection and by PCR.</p><p id="P14">The <italic>msrQ</italic> deletion mutant (strain BE105) was generated using the PCR knockout method developed by Datsenko and Wanner <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.
