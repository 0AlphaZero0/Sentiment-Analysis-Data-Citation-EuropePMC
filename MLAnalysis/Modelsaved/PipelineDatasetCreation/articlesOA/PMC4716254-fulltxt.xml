Since surgery is often complicated by large tumour size and extensive tumour vasculature, preoperative treatment strategies with the aim of devitalising the tumour are being explored. One option is treatment with antiangiogenic drugs. The multikinase inhibitor pazopanib, which possesses pronounced antiangiogenic effects, has shown activity in metastatic and unresectable STS, but has so far not been tested in the preoperative setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This open-label, multicentre phase II window-of-opportunity trial assesses pazopanib as preoperative treatment of resectable STS. Participants receive a 21-day course of pazopanib 800&#8197;mg daily during wait time for surgery. Major eligibility criteria are resectable, high-risk adult STS of any location, or metachronous solitary STS metastasis for which resection is planned, and adequate organ function and performance status. The trial uses an exact single-stage design. The primary end point is metabolic response rate (MRR), that is, the proportion of patients with &gt;50% reduction of the mean standardised uptake value (SUV<sub>mean</sub>) in post-treatment compared to pre-treatment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT. The MRR below which the treatment is considered ineffective is 0.2. The MRR above which the treatment warrants further exploration is 0.4. With a type I error of 5% and a power of 80%, the sample size is 35 evaluable patients, with 12 or more responders as threshold. Main secondary end points are histopathological and MRI response, resectability, toxicity, recurrence-free and overall survival. In a translational substudy, endothelial progenitor cells and vascular epithelial growth factor receptor are analysed as potential prognostic and predictive markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Approval by the ethics committee II, University of Heidelberg, Germany (2012-019F-MA), German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (61-3910-4038155) and German Federal Institute for Radiation Protection (Z5-22463/2-2012-007).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT01543802, EudraCT: 2011-003745-18; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sarcoma &lt; ONCOLOGY</kwd><kwd>Clinical trials &lt; THERAPEUTICS</kwd><kwd>NUCLEAR MEDICINE</kwd><kwd>VASCULAR MEDICINE</kwd><kwd>Surgical pathology &lt; PATHOLOGY</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>One of the first trials to evaluate pazopanib, a multikinase inhibitor with pronounced antiangiogenic properties, in neoadjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, using a window-of-opportunity design to minimise potential risks for patients, and yet to provide valid information on efficacy and safety.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Multimodal response assessment: dynamic fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT (primary outcome), dedicated MRI protocol, specific protocol for histopathological assessment, has been used.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Translational substudy exploring the role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor as potential biomarkers for antiangiogenic treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Heterogeneous study population in terms of histological sarcoma subtype and clinical setting (primary tumours and solitary recurrences/metastases).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Timing of metabolic response assessment is several days after discontinuation of therapy, &#8216;rebound growth&#8217; is therefore possible; however, metabolic response is assessed close to the time of surgery, which is the clinically most relevant time point; surgery takes place at least 7&#8197;days after treatment discontinuation to minimise risk of surgical complications.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) constitute a heterogeneous group of malignant mesenchymal tumours with varying histological differentiation. High-grade, deeply located, large STS have a poor outcome. For both, primary and recurrent tumours, radical surgery, usually combined with postoperative radiotherapy, is the mainstay of treatment and the only potentially curative modality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Likewise, oligometastatic disease with one or few manifestations in one single organ is treated surgically in selected patients with the aim of prolonging survival and reducing symptom burden. Surgery is, however, often hampered by large tumour size with infiltration of adjacent structures, and extensive vasculature of the tumour.</p><p>For primary and recurrent tumours, various preoperative treatment strategies have been tested in clinical trials.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Preoperative doxorubicin/ifosfamide has not been shown to yield any benefit in overall or progression-free survival in a randomised trial when compared with surgery alone.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The addition of regional hyperthermia to preoperative chemotherapy has improved local progression-free and disease-free survival.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Regarding preoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy, additional concerns exist because the administration of drugs with a lifetime dose limit, such as anthracyclines, in a non-metastatic setting, might narrow future treatment possibilities in case of recurrence. Preoperative radiation has been shown to have a slight survival benefit compared to postoperative radiation, but the latter is often preferred because of a lower rate of wound complications.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Isolated limb perfusion is an option for selected patients but requires a high logistic effort and is limited to referral centres.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In conclusion, there is still no consensus if and which preoperative treatment should be applied in patients with STS,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and further modalities are to be tested in clinical trials.</p><p>The ideal preoperative treatment for STS would be fast-acting and effective in terms of devitalisation of the tumour and disruption of its hypervasculature, thus facilitating resection. It would have a low incidence of side effects, thus not hampering surgery and postsurgery recovery. In addition, a valid possibility of early response assessment would be highly desirable, since this could spare non-responders from ineffective treatment and a potentially harmful delay of surgery.</p><p>The multikinase inhibitor pazopanib has been approved as treatment for metastatic or non-resectable STS based on the results of a phase III trial that compared pazopanib treatment to placebo in patients with metastatic non-adipocytic STS who were angiogenesis inhibitor na&#239;ve and had progressed on at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Patients in the pazopanib arm had significantly longer progression-free survival (median: 20 vs 7&#8197;weeks; HR=0.31, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.40), which was the primary end point of the trial. There was no significant difference in overall survival (12.5&#8197;months with pazopanib vs 10.7&#8197;months with placebo; HR=0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.11), but the trial was not powered for this secondary end point. In the heavily pretreated trial population, treatment was sufficiently well tolerated, with a median dose intensity of 96.3% and 14% of toxicity-related treatment interruptions in the pazopanib group. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, hypertension, anorexia and diarrhoea. The trial was restricted to patients with non-adipocytic STS because of the previous phase II trial, which showed no activity in the stratum of adipocytic STS.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Subsequent central pathology review, however, re-classified two patients with stable disease (internal communication by the trial sponsor). Based on this finding, activity of pazopanib against liposarcoma is probable.</p><p>Given this proof of efficacy, its fast and pronounced antiangiogenic effects mediated by kinase inhibition,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and its favourable safety profile,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> pazopanib might be an ideal candidate for neoadjuvant treatment in STS. Therefore, we decided to conduct a pertinent phase II trial as a &#8216;window of opportunity&#8217; study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In this design, patients receive an investigational agent in a &#8216;window period&#8217; before starting the established treatment. The risk that effective treatment is unduly delayed is minimised by keeping the duration of the investigational treatment short. The described window-of-opportunity design is feasible for pazopanib, as shown in a trial for non-small cell lung cancer.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>A crucial precondition for an effective use of preoperative treatment is good and early response monitoring. Dynamic F-18 labelled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT (dFDG-PET-CT) appears to be ideal for this purpose. It has been prospectively validated as a strong predictor of histopathological response and progression-free survival, for both neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapy in patients with STS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;18</xref> Unlike histopathological response assessment, which can only be performed retrospectively after surgery, dFDG-PET-CT allows for early selection of patients who may benefit from preoperative therapy. MRI is another viable option for early response assessment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, it has not yet been validated as a predictor of progression-free survival. Therefore, up to now, dFDG-PET-CT can be deemed the best available modality for early prospective response assessment of chemotherapy for STS.</p><p>Another reason for conducting a neoadjuvant study in patients with STS is that it can provide information on biomarkers for response prediction. Ultimately, such markers would allow distinguishing responders from non-responders, thus facilitating true &#8216;targeted therapy&#8217;. In the context of antiangiogenic therapy, there are several circulating angiogenic factors that might serve this purpose. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) and soluble vascular epithelial growth factor (sVEGF) correlate with tumour burden in STS,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and might thus serve as early predictors of clinical and histological response.</p><p>We present the trial protocol.

All examinations will be performed centrally at the same PET-CT scanner. A topogram and a low-dose CT are used for positioning of the patient, to include the primary volume of interest (VOI) for the dPET-CT. Following the intravenous application of FDG, dynamic data acquisition (4D mode) is performed for 60&#8197;min. Then a whole-body PET-CT is acquired using 2&#8197;min per bed position. The iteratively reconstructed images are evaluated using dedicated software. Besides the SUV (standardised uptake values), further parameters of the tracer kinetics are assessed using compartment and non-compartment models. The SUV<sub>mean</sub> 60&#8197;min after the FDG injection is used to assess the therapeutic effect. Exploratory analyses of dynamic PET-CT response will be based on a VOI analysis. The following parameters of the FDG kinetics will be calculated: (1) SUV (mean, max) 55&#8211;60&#8197;min postinjection; (2) influx rates and transport rates based on a support vector machine algorithm and a two-tissue compartment analysis; and (3) calculation of the fractal dimension of the FDG kinetics based on fractal analysis. The percentage change of all parameters of the FDG kinetics as well as discriminant analysis based on the absolute values of the FDG kinetics and their changes will be determined along with CIs. In particular, the SUV<sub>mean</sub> will be used primarily for the assessment of response. MR is assumed with a change of 50% following pazopanib treatment (21&#8197;days).

We were able to show a positive association between clinical tumour load and cEPC level in the blood of patients with lung cancer<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and STS (unpublished data). Consequently, pretreatment cEPC levels might reflect tumour load and metabolism, and thus constitute a prognostic marker. The same might hold true for the postoperative cEPC level, which could be an indicator of residual microscopic tumour load and thus of recurrence risk. On the other hand, high cEPC pretreatment levels, indicating an extensive tumour vasculature and thus a high susceptibility to an antiangiogenic treatment, might be a predictive marker for response. The same might be true for a drop in cEPC level during treatment. Similar associations have been observed between sVEGF levels and treatment response.</p><p>In order to explore these hypotheses, the study foresees measurement of cEPC and cVEGF levels at various time points.

Based on results from a phase III trial, which showed efficacy for pazopanib treatment in STS,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> patients who are treated according to this protocol can be expected to have a higher chance of complete tumour resection and thus a lower risk of tumour recurrence, which should positively affect progression-free and overall survival. Moreover, the preoperative treatment has the potential to result in a less radical, tissue-sparing resection with fewer side effects. In contrast, the expected magnitude of potential risks and harmful side effects of the study treatment are small. Pazopanib is a registered drug. Overall, it is well tolerated, and most side effects are manageable and quickly subside once the dosage is reduced or the therapy discontinued. Therefore, the risk that surgery is delayed or perioperative morbidity is increased due to pazopanib side effects is expected to be small. Given the short preoperative treatment period in the window-of-opportunity design and the demonstrated efficacy of pazopanib in STS, the risk of relevant tumour progression during treatment is judged to be very low.</p><p>Study-related diagnostic procedures performed in addition to standard of care include two dPET-CTs. These expose the patient to radiation. However, the overall radiation dose of these two procedures does not exceed the annual dose threshold stipulated by relevant German laws for individuals who are professionally exposed to radiation. Thus, the risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancy is judged to be very low and outweighed by the scientific benefit of the study as well as the individual clinical benefit of each participating individual. dPET-CT, although not yet part of standard clinical algorithms for primary STS, does yield additional relevant information. It can detect occult metastases leading to a change in treatment strategy. Moreover, the planning of resection is facilitated for the surgeon, as PET-CT provides additional information on tumour extension and depicts the metabolism in different tumour areas, which potentially changes the surgical approach.</p><p>Before the start of the study, patients are informed, in writing and verbally, about the nature and implications of the proposed study, and especially about the possible benefits for their health, and possible risks are explained.

The principal investigator can decide to discontinue the entire study if he concludes that continuation would pose a relevant threat to the health or well-being of the individual participants, or if he concludes that the risk-benefit-ratio of the study is unfavourable, that is, if the risks clearly outweigh the potential benefits.</p><p>Prior to initiation, the trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01543802) and the European Clinical Trials database (EudraCT: 2011-003745-18).

While pazopanib has shown efficacy in metastatic and unresectable STS<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and therefore been approved for this indication, the drug has not yet been extensively evaluated in the preoperative setting in resectable STS. Results of a study on preoperative pazopanib combined with radiation therapy were recently published.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The study assessed the safety of this combination but, being a phase I trial, it was not designed to provide sufficient information on efficacy. An ongoing pilot trial (NCT01446809) evaluates pazopanib induction therapy prior to preoperative chemotherapy. Results, to appear in 2016, are awaited. Another ongoing phase II/III trial (NCT02180867) compares the combination of pazopanib and chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy without pazopanib. Results, to appear in 2018, are awaited.</p><p>Our trial is unique in that it tests preoperative pazopanib monotherapy in a window-of-opportunity design. The relatively short duration of pazopanib therapy was chosen to minimise the risk of tumour progression and consequent unresectability in non-responders. Notwithstanding, given the drug's mechanism of action, 21&#8197;days of treatment are considered sufficient to detect efficacy by assessing dPET-CT response, which is the trial's primary outcome.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The wide range of secondary outcomes allows validating other potential parameters for response assessment. In particular, the trial offers the unique possibility to prospectively compare different modalities of response assessment, that is, MRI and histopathological features, with dFDG-PET-CT, which is considered &#8216;gold standard&#8217;.</p><p>The timing of MR assessment with dFDG-PET-CT is important for the validity of the results and their interpretation. For several tumour entities, the phenomenon of &#8216;rebound growth&#8217;, that is, an increase in tumour proliferation and possibly neoangiogenesis shortly after discontinuation of antiangiogenic therapy, has been described.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#8211;39</xref> Therefore, to assess the strongest achievable response to an antiangiogenic drug such as pazopanib, it would probably be best to perform MR assessment at the last day of therapy. Following this rationale, one would also perform surgery without previous discontinuation of therapy. However, surgical complications, mainly wound and anastomotic morbidity, have been described in patients with prior antiangiogenic treatment. Evidence suggests an inverse correlation of their incidence with the time interval between treatment discontinuation and surgery. To minimise this complication risk, we established a wash-out period of at least 7&#8197;days between end of drug treatment and surgery, corresponding to five half lives of the drug. The same 7-day period was used in a recent trial on neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment for renal cell carcinoma.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> We believe that this would also be a rational approach if pazopanib were to be used as neoadjuvant treatment outside of trials. Consequently, we aimed at assessing MR after treatment discontinuation and close to the date of surgery. This mirrors the metabolic state of the tumour at the time of surgery, thus providing the best estimate of the clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit of pazopanib.</p><p>Another important element of the trial is its translational substudy. The trial design offers the opportunity to measure two potential biomarkers, cEPCs and sVEGF, during antiangiogenic treatment and in the perioperative setting, and to correlate them with several parameters of treatment response.</p><p>In summary, this trial will provide initial evidence regarding preoperative pazopanib treatment of STS, and, if efficacy can be demonstrated, lead to a pertinent phase III trial. Moreover, cEPCs and sVEGF are further explored regarding their use as biomarkers for antiangiogenic treatment of STS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> UR and PH conceived of and planned the trial.
