RNA is present in the urine enclosed in detached cells or in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from intact kidney and urinary tract cells. Conditions, which alter relative quantities of individual microRNAs (miRNAs) in urine, include inflammatory processes within the genitourinary tract, malignancies and infections [<xref rid="pone.0147249.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The presence of cell-specific miRNAs in the urine may aid early diagnosis of organ-specific pathology.

Inverted-U-shape relationship is seen, while several outliers are denoted. This pattern would not be expected of typical tissue profiles, and is likely a result of inconsistent cell type composition, with diversity represented in the mid-abundance miRNAs. For example, miR-203 and miR-205 are expressed in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0147249.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which are present in urine irregularly, predominantly in women.</p><fig id="pone.0147249.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0147249.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Mean-variance association of miRNA abundance.</title><p>A scatter plot depicting the mean (x axis) and coefficient of variation (y axis) relationship of log-transformed normalized miRNA counts across all samples.

We found indications that intra-individual variability is considerably smaller than inter-individual differences, and that the exact timing of urine collection has minor consequences. Thus, for miRNA profiling to be useful as urine biomarkers, careful consideration is needed for biofluid fractionation and sex-specific analysis, while the time of voiding may be less important. We found similar miRNA profile differences between men and women in urine cells and extracellular vesicles, likely reflecting that extracellular vesicles are originating from the same cell types that are present in the sediment. This suggests that potential biomarkers found in urine sediment cells are likely to be present in the extracellular vesicles, and vice versa. However, in patients with kidney or urinary tract disease, as opposed to the healthy subjects who volunteered to this study, the composition of cells and extracellular vesicles in the urine may have different derivations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0147249.s001"><label>S1 Figs</label><caption><title>Figs presenting supplementary data.</title><p>Fig A&#8211;MA plot of miRNA expression in urine EVs compared to cells.
