In seed plants, this body plan has been described as the superimposition of two patterns: an apical-basal and a radial pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The molecular processes that establish this primary body plan have mainly been studied in the angiosperm model species Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>). In contrast, knowledge about the molecular regulation of embryo development in gymnosperms is limited, partly owing to the lack of identified zygotic embryo defective mutants and genetic tractability. However, by using somatic embryos and reverse genetics it has been possible to study the regulation of embryo development in conifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We are studying the early stages of embryo development in Norway spruce and especially the role of members of the <italic>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX</italic> (<italic>WOX</italic>) gene family, which encode transcription factors that play important roles in the determination of cell fate during embryogenesis in angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Angiosperms and gymnosperms separated approximately 300 million years ago and expectedly their patterning during embryogenesis differs significantly. For convenience, embryogenesis in Arabidopsis can be divided into three general phases, described as proembryogeny, early embryogeny (globular-stage to heart-stage transition) and late embryogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Proembryogeny begins after fertilization. An asymmetric cell division of the zygote generates a smaller apical cell and a larger basal cell. The apical cell is the founder of the embryo proper, while the basal cell develops into the suspensor. The apical cell undergoes several rounds of stereotyped asymmetric divisions, giving rise to cells with positionally determined cell fate. At the beginning of early embryogeny, in the 8-cell embryo proper, a single round of tangential divisions separate the outer layer of eight cells from the eight inner cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The inner cells are founder cells of the ground tissue and vascular elements. The outer cells form the protoderm which will become the epidermis. Plant epidermis is characterized by the secretion of lipids and waxes to its outer cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The continuous hydrophobic layer forms the cuticle. Owing to the periclinal cell division pattern in the protoderm, the protodermal cells remain essentially separated from the inner cells throughout embryogenesis. Root and shoot meristems are established during the transition from globular to heart-stage. After the heart-stage the suspensor is degraded by programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During late embryogeny, there is a switch from pattern formation to storage product accumulation.</p><p>In conifers, the sequence of embryo development can also be described by three phases: proembryogeny, early embryogeny, and late embryogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Proembryogeny begins when the zygote undergoes several rounds of nuclear duplications. The produced free nuclei are first arranged in a tier before cellularization. After a cell division, two tiers are formed. The cells in the upper tier elongate to form a functional suspensor and the cells in the lower tier divide creating the embryonal mass (analogous to the embryo proper in angiosperms). Early embryogeny begins with the elongation of the embryonal suspensor. Cells in the outer layer of the embryonal mass divide mainly anticlinally, but also periclinally giving rise to additional internal layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], unlike angiosperms where only anticlinal cell divisions take place. Nevertheless, the outer cell layer in the embryonal mass in conifer embryos defines a functional protoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Late embryogeny is a period of histogenesis and organogenesis. Early during this phase, the suspensor cells are dismantled by programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the root and shoot apical meristems are delineated.</p><p>Members of the <italic>WOX</italic> gene family play important roles in determining cell fate during plant development. Phylogenetic analyses have identified three major clades in the <italic>WOX</italic> gene family: the modern (<italic>WUS</italic> and <italic>WOX1-7</italic>), the intermediate (<italic>WOX8</italic>, <italic>9</italic>, <italic>11</italic>, and <italic>12</italic>) and the ancient clade (<italic>WOX10</italic>, <italic>13</italic>, and <italic>14</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the gymnosperm Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>), 11 <italic>WOX</italic> genes that belong to all major clades, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>All <italic>WOX</italic> genes examined show very specific expression patterns, both spatially and temporally, which are important for their molecular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>WOX2</italic>, <italic>WOX8</italic> and <italic>WOX9</italic> have been implicated in patterning and morphogenesis of the early embryo in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>AtWOX2</italic> is expressed in the egg cell and the zygote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. After the first cell division, <italic>AtWOX2</italic> marks the apical cell, while, <italic>AtWOX8</italic> and <italic>AtWOX9</italic> mark the basal cell. <italic>AtWOX8</italic> and <italic>AtWOX9</italic> share redundant functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Arabidopsis <italic>wox8wox9</italic> double mutant shows aberrant orientation of cell division planes in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Previously, we showed that the Norway spruce gene <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> is the orthologue of <italic>AtWOX8</italic> and <italic>AtWOX9</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similarly to Arabidopsis, down-regulation of <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> causes disturbed orientation of the cell division plane and cell fate determination during early embryo pattern formation suggesting that <italic>PaWOX8/9</italic> exerts an evolutionarily conserved function.</p><p>It has previously been shown that <italic>PaWOX2</italic>, which is highly similar in sequence to <italic>AtWOX2</italic>, is expressed during embryo development in gymnosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Herein we report that <italic>PaWOX2</italic> is transiently expressed in the embryonal mass and in the upper part of the suspensor in early and early late embryos. Furthermore, by using reverse genetics, we functionally characterize <italic>PaWOX2</italic>. Down-regulation of <italic>PaWOX2</italic> during development of early embryos results in aberrant early embryos, which lack distinct embryonal mass and suspensor domains, a proper protoderm, and have shorter suspensor cells. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved function of <italic>WOX2</italic> in protoderm formation early during embryo development among seed plants. In addition, <italic>PaWOX2</italic> might exert a unique function in proper suspensor cell expansion in gymnosperms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p>The embryogenic cell line 61:21 of Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic> L.

In our study, about one-third of the EEs from line 35S:<italic>WOX2i.4</italic> showed an aberrant phenotype that is unique for 35S:<italic>WOX2i</italic> lines. Furthermore, the yield of MEs in the 35S:<italic>WOX2i</italic> lines is significantly reduced compared to the control. By using an inducible promoter we could show that down regulation of <italic>PaWOX2</italic> when&#160;LEs had already developed has no effect on further development of the embryos. Therefore, the transient high expression of <italic>PaWOX2</italic> during development of EEs and LEs is crucial for further development of LEs. The low recovering rate implies a more essential role for <italic>PaWOX2</italic> during early embryo development in Norway spruce compared to that of <italic>AtWOX2</italic> in Arabidopsis. However, an alternative scenario could be based on the previously suggested functional redundancy of <italic>AtWOX1</italic>, <italic>AtWOX3</italic> and <italic>AtWOX</italic>5 with <italic>AtWOX2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has been shown that the redundant functions of <italic>AtWOX1</italic>, <italic>AtWOX3</italic> and <italic>AtWOX</italic>5 become essential for normal development of the apical lineage in the absence of <italic>AtWOX2</italic> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>WOX1</italic> homologs have not been found in Norway spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More research is required before we know if <italic>WOX</italic> genes in conifers exert redundant functions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>PaWOX2</italic> is transiently expressed in the embryonal mass and in the upper part of the suspensor in early and early late embryos. Our results suggest that <italic>PaWOX2</italic> is required for the establishment of embryonal mass and suspensor domains, expansion of suspensor cells and proper protoderm formation during early embryo development. EEs that fail to form a protoderm cannot develop further and degenerate. Taken together, our results suggest that <italic>WOX2</italic> exerts a conserved role in protoderm development in both gymnosperms and angiosperm, whereas its function in the expansion of suspensor cells may be restricted to the gymnosperm lineage.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12870_2016_706_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probe (*) of <italic>PaWOX2</italic> and corresponding reference genes.
