It is a tumor of the serosal cavities, predominantly of the pleura and is generally widespread throughout the cavity at the time of presentation. Patients who are treated with supportive care have a median survival of only 9&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Those treated with the best available chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatinum) have an average increased survival of only 10&#160;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with a median survival between 9 and 14&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, in select patients with early-stage epithelial disease who undergo extra pleural pneumonectomy, followed by adjunct chemotherapy and radiotherapy, 5-year survival rates of 46&#160;% have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, like most cancers, early detection of malignant mesothelioma has the potential to improve patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test, a serum-based method for cancer detection, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The test is based on the discovery that there are cancer-specific transcript variants of ecto-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and consists of 2-D gel electrophoretic separation of serum proteins followed by immunoblot analysis with an ENOX2-specific recombinant antibody. ENOX2 belongs to a family of cell surface proteins that oxidize reduced pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)H] and are essential for cell enlargement and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At least 20 tissue of origin specific patterns of ENOX2 transcript variants have been described (and/or combinations of isoforms) indicative of the cancer tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These ENOX2 proteins are shed into the circulation and can be detected in some early stage cancers, including: breast, lung, colon, prostate and ovarian cancer (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>Table of ranges</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>

Identification of cancer presence by detecting ENOX2 transcript variants produces a low incidence of both false positives and false negatives (&gt;1&#160;% for subjects with clinically confirmed cancers), as they are molecular signature molecules produced specifically by cancer cells and are absent from non-cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The predictive correlation between ONCOblot findings and the onset of cancer is based on findings that support ENOX2 as a marker of cancer presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Considerable interest exists in the development of early screening tests for malignant mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed populations. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine if cancer-specific ENOX2 transcript variants might serve as biomarkers to detect the presence of malignant mesothelioma in advance of clinical symptoms. To this end, serum samples, collected prior to diagnosis as part of a prospective cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], were examined by using the ONCOblot test. This examination of serum samples from asbestos-exposed subjects revealed that patients with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma produced a consistent pattern of two ENOX2 transcript variants. These two transcript variants were detected well in advance of clinical symptoms. These findings indicate that the ONCOblot Tissue of Origin Cancer Detection Test might, if validated in other studies, provide a useful addition to the diagnostic repertoire of tests for the early detection of malignant mesothelioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population characteristics</title><p>Sera from 17 individuals with confirmed malignant mesothelioma were studied (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The median survival for this group of patients was 24&#160;months (95&#160;% CI 20&#8211;30) after clinical diagnosis.

Of the remainder, three subjects (ID 1542, 4334, and 4476) expressed only Protein 2 and two subjects (ID 4288 and 10011) expressed only Protein 1 (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of the benign subjects exhibiting only Protein 1, both were female. For three subjects, longitudinal annual serum samples were available. For patient ID 1268, both ENOX2 protein isoforms were detected over a 10&#160;year period (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This individual remains clinically malignancy-free 1.5&#160;years after the last sample was analyzed. He has extensive pleural plaques, has never smoked and has a normal serum mesothelin level (data not shown). Only one of the ENOX2 isoforms was expressed in the other two benign patients examined longitudinally, though the protein was present over several years. Patient ID 4288 died approximately 1.5&#160;years after the last sample was analyzed from non-malignant causes. Patient ID 1542 remains alive approximately a year after the last sample was examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Correlation between clinical diagnosis and ENOX2 spot diameter</title><p>For subjects who developed mesothelioma, the spot diameter at the earliest date of detection for both Protein 1 and Protein 2 was 1.95&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;mm (not shown).

Malignant mesothelioma is characterized by the presence of two ENOX2 protein species of molecular weight 64 and 41&#160;kDa, and pI 3.9 and 4.3, respectively.</p><p>All 17 patients who were diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma displayed both mesothelioma-specific protein ENOX2 isoforms. Importantly, both ENOX2 isoforms were required for a correct identification of malignant mesothelioma by using the ONCOblot test (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Of the cancer types examined to date, the ONCOblot pattern for malignant mesothelioma most closely resembles that of bladder cancer (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, the pI of the larger molecular weight transcript variant is sufficiently different to avoid mischaracterization (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In any case, differentiating these two cancers rarely presents a diagnostic dilemma clinically. For malignant mesothelioma two ENOX2 protein transcript variants are evident; indeed multiple ENOX2 isoforms are seen in approximately half of the different types of cancer (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>The two ENOX2 transcripts were apparent in the seven mesothelioma patients examined, 4&#8211;11&#160;years before the clinical onset of disease (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is an exciting finding and implies that production of ENOX2 proteins are an early event in carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the earliest prediagnostic indicator of cancer thus far reported. The use of serum biomarkers for the early detection of cancer has been the goal of many individual researchers and research consortia, such as the Early Detection Research Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While some serum biomarkers have been described, few are used in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and most give a lead time of less than a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Biomarker utility is hampered by low levels of specificity combined with a propensity to yield false positives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The only useful biomarker for mesothelioma is mesothelin which is elevated in between 15 and 40&#160;% of individuals exposed to asbestos before diagnosis of mesothelioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Asbestos-exposed individuals represent an ideal cohort to evaluate prospective serum biomarkers for cancer detection, due to both their quantifiable exposure to a carcinogen and the well-established link to a specific cancer type, malignant mesothelioma.</p><p>The distribution of histological asbestos-related lung cancer is similar to that of lung cancers of other etiologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The test has been evaluated previously for both non-small cell and small cell lung cancers (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Those cancers exhibit a single ENOX2 protein unique to lung cancer but can be distinguished by their pIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Of the subjects with benign disease, 60&#160;% lacked ENOX2 proteins in their serum (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Both protein transcript variants were found in the serum of only one subject currently diagnosed with benign disease (subject ID 1268). For the remaining five subjects diagnosed with benign disease, only one protein transcript variant was detected. It is possible that&#160;the presence of one of the two mesothelioma-specific isoforms is an indicator of early pathological changes that predate the development of mesothelioma, as the transition from benign disease to malignant mesothelioma may be required for both transcript variants to be present. This issue would require longer follow-up to elucidate. Within the ONCOblot test, the presence of only the high molecular weight mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 transcript variant would be identified as &#8216;not in the database&#8217; as no malignancy characterized to date produces a single ENOX2 transcript variant with a similar molecular weight and pI as this ENOX2 transcript variant. In contrast, the presence of only the low molecular weight transcript variant would be misidentified as a cancer of blood cell origin (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Of note, for the three patients who were diagnosed with benign disease and examined in a time series, the detected ENOX2 spot size either remained constant or declined during the observational period. Two of these subjects (subject ID 1542 and 4288) produced only one ENOX2 transcript variant (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Although the remaining patient (subject ID 1268) produced both mesothelioma-specific transcript variants (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), a steady decline of Protein 1&#8211;40&#160;% of the initial amount detected was observed over a 9&#160;year period. The largest spot diameter encountered in patients clinically diagnosed with mesothelioma was 6.6&#160;mm representing a nearly tenfold increase in ENOX2 proteins in the serum compared to levels giving rise to a 2&#160;mm diameter spot at early detection. It is possible, though not proven, that as the controls in this study have all been exposed to asbestos that these false positives may represent a pre-malignant stage of mesothelioma that has yet to become clinically meaningful. Furthermore, mesothelioma is recognized for the long latency period between asbestos exposure and malignancy, so it is possible that during this phase equilibrium is maintained between the host and the cancer. The presence of one of the mesothelioma-associated ENOX2 transcript variants may reflect this interaction. The immune system is capable of influencing the outcome of mesothelioma patients, as evidenced by the occasional finding of spontaneous mesothelioma regression accompanied by strong lymphocyte infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and by spontaneous humoral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This notion will be investigated further.</p><p>A test that can detect mesothelioma at an early stage might offer the prospect of early intervention as an approach to improve patient outcomes. The data from this study demonstrate that serum ENOX2 proteins characteristic of malignant mesothelioma can be detected in subjects 4&#8211;11&#160;years before diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, and raises the possibility that the benefits of early intervention could be studied in such individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In a population of asbestos-exposed subjects who eventually developed malignant mesothelioma, ENOX2 transcript variants characteristic of malignant mesothelioma were present in serum 4&#8211;10&#160;years in advance of clinical symptoms.

Samples were chosen from individuals with (1) a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma confirmed by the Western Australian Mesothelioma Registry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and (2) from asbestos-exposed control subjects with benign pleural plaques either alone or with accompanying asbestosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For a sub-set of subjects, annually collected longitudinal serum samples were available. This study was approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test</title><p>Serum samples were analyzed for the presence of ENOX2 protein transcript variants by using the ONCOblot Tissue of Origin Cancer Detection Test as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, 25&#160;&#181;l of serum were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with isoelectric focusing in the first dimension to determine pI and SDS&#8211;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension to determine molecular weight. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and ENOX2 proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis with an ENOX2-specific recombinant antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase using a colorimetric substrate for detection. Blots were scanned and the pI and molecular weight of each ENOX2 transcript variant present was calculated by comparison to molecular weight standards and to two internal reference proteins (serotransferrin, ca. 82&#160;kDa, pI 6.8, and &#945;-fetuin, ca. 53&#160;kDa, pI 4.1). The two reference serum proteins, serotransferrin and &#945;-fetuin are detected on western blots because they both share a similar five amino acid sequence within the antibody combining site shared by all ENOX2 protein transcript variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Transferrin or &#945;-fetuin antibodies were not added nor is the reaction unspecific. Each transcript variant of ENOX2 migrates to a specific location defined by the two reference proteins and has a specific location (molecular weight and pI) on the blot that correlates to the known tissue of origin determined from banked sera samples collected from individuals with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of cancer (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>The protein chemistry differences that underlie the molecular weight and pI differences that distinguish tissue-specific ENOX2 transcript variants result from alternative splicing of the ENOX2 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Each of the&#160;protein transcript variants share a common exon 5 which contains the ENOX2-specific antibody-combining site including the amino acid sequence EEMTE. The overall sensitivity of the test is estimated to be &gt;95&#160;%.</p><p>The different tissues of origin provide for non-overlapping patterns of ENOX2 protein transcript variants each with a characteristic number of protein transcript variants, molecular weights and pIs. The majority of the tissues of origin, including small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, are represented by a single transcript variant. Several tissues of origin, including mesothelioma, ovarian, hepatocellular, uterine and six others are represented by two transcript variants. Three cancer tissues of origin, stomach, colon and kidney, have three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Quantitation of ENOX2 based on spot diameter</title><p>To estimate relative amounts of ENOX2 in sera, data from patients were compared to a standard curve of known amounts of a functional, 46&#160;kDa form of recombinant human ENOX2 generated in <italic>E coli</italic>.

The complete amino acid sequence of a 72&#160;kDa form of ENOX2 is available from GenBank under accession no. AF207881.
