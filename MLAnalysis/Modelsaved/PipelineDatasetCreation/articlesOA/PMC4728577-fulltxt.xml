Introduction</title><p>Bacteriophage receptor binding proteins (RBPs) have recently been developed into a number of tools that make use of their high specificity and robustness [<xref rid="B1-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These technologies include diagnostics involving RBPs bound to surfaces [<xref rid="B2-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], or to beads [<xref rid="B3-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], for the selective capture of bacteria. Moreover, RBPs have also been employed as therapeutics that reduce specific bacterial colonization <italic>in vivo</italic>, either alone [<xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or as part of a larger molecular machine [<xref rid="B6-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As diagnostics, RBPs offer several advantages over other technologies, such as antibodies, including greater stability, ligand specificity, and affinity even against carbohydrate epitopes which are not typically recognized effectively by most antibodies [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The importance of developing technologies for the rapid identification of pathogens cannot be understated, as food contaminated with bacterial pathogens presents both a public health concern and a serious financial liability for producers. Also, rapid methods of bacterial detection can help surmount challenges in diagnosing bacterial agents of disease prior to progression and/or spread of the infection. RBPs therefore represent a highly versatile, effective and much-needed technology for bacterial pathogen detection.</p><p>Phages recognize their hosts through RBP binding to a specific receptor on the host cell surface. RBPs are also responsible for properly orienting the phage onto the host cell, which must occur prior to a successful infection [<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These proteins can be called tailspikes, tail fibres or spike proteins. Due to their diversity in host-binding specificity, RBP genes often cannot be recognized in a sequenced genome based solely on homology with already characterized RBPs [<xref rid="B10-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], since even if the phage RBPs share structural homology, they do not tend to share sequence homology [<xref rid="B11-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Known phage RBPs have been shown to be very stable proteins, displaying high resistance to proteases and detergents. These properties are inherent to phage RBPs, presumably since these proteins have evolved to be functional in harsh native environments such as the intestinal tract. On a molecular level, this stability is generally attributed to the fact that RBPs are often trimers rich in &#946;-structures that are intertwined in a &#946;-helical architecture. The phage P22 trimeric tailspike, Gp9, serves as a classic example of RBP spatial arrangement [<xref rid="B1-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Overall, the high stability, specificity, and ease of recombinant overexpression make RBPs excellent alternatives to antibodies and ideal tools for the development of new diagnostic technologies.</p><p>In addition, RBPs are not limited to phages, but can also be found as components of phage-like molecular machines such as pyocins [<xref rid="B13-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and gene transfer agents (GTAs) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Pyocins, also known as headless phages, bind to a target cell and create a channel across the membrane(s), disrupting the transmembrane potential and killing the cell [<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These machines are currently being exploited as antibacterial agents and have had their target range altered by substituting different RBPs with their host recognition moieties, giving known pyocins novel target ranges [<xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. GTAs are non-replicative phage-like particles that package portions of the bacterial chromosome and inject that DNA into a neighboring target cell [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both of these machines rely on their RBPs for binding to and identification of their host, and thus present other natural reservoirs for proteins of this class.</p><p>Considerable research has been done on RBPs, especially the P22 RBP, which has been used as a model for understanding protein folding and phage infection [<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, although lambda phage has been shown to be a useful tool for annotating phage genomes, to date there is no rapid method for identifying phage RBPs, even within sequenced genomes. This is a result of the fact that RBPs are difficult to identify based on homology, since RBPs each bind to distinct receptors. As well, phage DNA has been shown to be challenging to sequence, likely as a result of hyper-modification of the phage DNA bases [<xref rid="B17-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], further contributing to challenges associated with RBP identification. In order to overcome these difficulties, we developed a method to rapidly identify RBPs in the absence of sequence information. We generated <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression libraries expressing randomly sheared fragments of phage DNA and then screened these libraries for colonies producing a gene product able to bind to the host organism. We tested this technique with two phages: <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium phage P22, which belongs to the <italic>Podoviridae</italic> family, and <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 typing phage 1, belonging to the <italic>Myoviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In both cases, the tailspike or putative tail fibre was successfully identified using the screen and all identified genome fragments contained coding regions for putative RBPs. Together these results demonstrate the utility of an assay for accurate RBP identification from phages belonging to two of the three major families of tailed phages.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-08-00017"><title>2.

ECTP1_00144 and ECTP1_00148 were also submitted to the Phyre server, but while ECTP1_00144 was also predicted to be a tail fibre, it was only isolated in one insert. Even then, this protein was isolated together with ECTP1_00145, so it is unlikely that ECTP1_00144 is the RBP responsible for <italic>E. coli</italic> binding in this case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-08-00017-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since Gp37 is the known RBP for T4, we further compared Gp37 and ECTP1_00145 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00017-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and found limited homology between the two. BlastP analysis showed 36% sequence identity between Gp37 and ECTP1_00145 over 23% sequence coverage, with an <italic>E</italic>-value of 6 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;29</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00017-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Interestingly, most of the homology was at the C-terminal end of the proteins, the region known to be involved in receptor binding in Gp37. However, the Gp37 domain responsible for binding, between amino acids 931 and 966 [<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was less conserved with ECTP1_00145. The difference in this particular region may be indicating that the two proteins have different receptors. Interestingly, all but one of the 14 histidine residues found in this region, which form pairs needed for iron coordination, were conserved in ECTP1_00145 (indicated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00017-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Although only the 24.6 kDa binding tip of the full 109.2 kDa Gp37 protein has been crystallized, other putative Gp37-like tail fibres have been described that more closely resemble ECTP1_00145 in size and sequence (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00017">Table S1</xref>). As expected, there was even less homology between T4 Gp37 and P22 Gp9, with 35% identity over 19% sequence coverage and an <italic>E</italic>-value of 0.12. These differences are further reflected in the crystal structures of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00017-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). This lack of homology between the two proteins used in this assay demonstrates the capacity of the assay to identify very different RBPs, in this case a tailspike and a tail fibre that are encoded by two separate families of tailed phages.</p><fig id="viruses-08-00017-f004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Alignment and structure of RBPs detected in this study.

Discussion</title><p>Receptor binding proteins are the components used by phages for host recognition and attachment.

However, in order to advance the usage of these technologies, a method for the timely identification of RBPs is necessary. This research describes a method for the discovery of RBPs from phages that does not depend on sequencing or bioinformatic comparison. Briefly, phage DNA is extracted, fragmented, ligated into an expression vector, transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane where recombinant proteins are overexpressed. The membrane is then probed for binding to the phage host bacterium.</p><p>This assay allows for the discovery of RBPs based on their ability to bind to a host bacterium, and thus represents an improvement over previous methods for identifying RBPs based on homology to already known RBPs or on genome synteny, since the latter methods prohibit the discovery of truly novel and unrelated RBPs. Phenotypic screens have been used in the past to discover phage proteins, including discovery of phage lysins from both isolated phages and from metagenomic samples [<xref rid="B24-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It may eventually be possible to utilize DNA from an environmental sample to search for RBPs that originate from phages that cannot be propagated under laboratory conditions, which would help elucidate the characteristics of these phages. However, we acknowledge that the current form of this assay is limited by the fact that the target bacteria must be culturable on agar plates and that if a chaperone is necessary for RBP folding, that chaperone must be located in close proximity to the RBP in the phage genome. To circumvent the need to culture the target organism, future studies could use this method in combination with other detection methods, such as antibodies, to distinguish host bacteria bound to the nitrocellulose membranes. Interestingly, we noticed that all of the inserts discovered in the assay had the same orientation in the vector, suggesting that they were utilizing the vector promoter. However, protein expression most likely involved the native ribosome binding sites of the individual genes, as opposed to that of the vector, since the inserts were found to be translated in different frames.</p><p>To date, we have not utilized this assay for species beyond the <italic>Enterobactericae</italic>, but due to the wealth of proteins from other species that have been expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which includes RBPs [<xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it is likely that this assay will be amenable to RBP discovery from phages targeting other species. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) has been used in the past for over-expression of Gram-positive phage tailspikes [<xref rid="B26-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is possible that a <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> expression system might facilitate the identification of RBPs from Gram-positive phages, but this has yet to be assessed. An <italic>in vitro</italic> expression system is another alternative technology that may produce superior results with some phages, such as those whose gene products are not readily expressed in <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><p>This assay may also have utility beyond identifying phage RBPs. For instance, both GTAs and pyocins have RBPs, which could be detected by this assay if a library of GTA or pyocin DNA were generated. This would provide both a novel source of bacterial binding proteins and a means of better characterizing these molecular machines. Relatedly, RBPs identified in this assay could be used to alter the targets of pyocins or of whole phages.</p><p>RBPs are some of the most biotechnologically relevant proteins encoded in phage genomes, as they have evolved to specifically and effectively bind their bacterial hosts. As well, RBPs represent the most dynamic proteins encoded by most phages, as constant evolutionary arms race dynamics between phages and bacteria over time lead to a strong selection for new variants [<xref rid="B27-viruses-08-00017" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. RBPs encompass a considerable diversity of binding targets, making them attractive in commercial exploitation and important for understanding the lifecycle of any phage. Over the last decade, phage research has exhibited a resurged interest, especially in the area of phage therapy. However, the fact still remains that phages, and particularly the bacterial receptors they recognize, need to be well characterized and carefully chosen in order to ensure the success of phage therapy strategies. Therefore, rapid RBP identification and careful characterization of RBP-receptor interactions is a logical and promising avenue to develop in order to help move this field forward.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Harald Nothaft for his help with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00017-f002">Figure 2</xref>.
