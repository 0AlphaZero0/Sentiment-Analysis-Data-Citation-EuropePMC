Among modern biomaterials, calcium phosphates represent the best bone substitutes, due to their chemical features emulating the mineral phase of bone tissue. Although many studies on stem cells differentiation mechanisms have been performed involving calcium-based scaffolds, results often focus on highlighting production of in vitro bone matrix markers and <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue ingrowth, while information related to the biomolecular mechanisms involved in the early cellular calcium-mediated differentiation is not well elucidated yet. Genetic programs for osteogenesis have been just partially deciphered, and the description of the different molecules and pathways operative in these differentiations is far from complete, as well as the activity of calcium in this process. The present work aims to shed light on the involvement of extracellular calcium in MSC differentiation: a better understanding of the early stage osteogenic differentiation program of MSC seeded on calcium-based biomaterials is required in order to develop optimal strategies to promote osteogenesis through the use of new generation osteoconductive scaffolds. A wide spectrum of analysis has been performed on time-dependent series: gene expression profiles are obtained from samples (MSC seeded on calcium-based scaffolds), together with related microRNAs expression and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional validation. On this basis, and relying on literature knowledge, hypotheses are made on the biomolecular players activated by the biomaterial calcium-phosphate component. Interestingly, a key role of miR-138 was highlighted, whose inhibition markedly increases osteogenic differentiation in vitro and enhance ectopic bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, there is evidence that Ca-P substrate triggers osteogenic differentiation through genes (SMAD and RAS family) that are typically regulated during dexamethasone (DEX) induced differentiation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) through Flagship &#8220;InterOmics&#8221; (PB05) (received by SS) and through &#8220;Futuro in Ricerca 2013&#8221; (RBFR13V4M2) (received by FV).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="10"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Both mRNA expression and miRNA raw data are available in ArrayExpress database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>) under accession numbers respectively E-MTAB-3440 and E-MTAB-3441, thus providing needed information according to MIAME guidelines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Both mRNA expression and miRNA raw data are available in ArrayExpress database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>) under accession numbers respectively E-MTAB-3440 and E-MTAB-3441, thus providing needed information according to MIAME guidelines.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last two decades, the knowledge advancement in the fields of stem cell have highlighted the possibility to harvest and manipulate in vitro adult mesenchymal stem cells derived from various tissues, including bone marrow, periostium, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, skin and retina [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Among all stem cells reservoirs, bone marrow still remain the most commonly used worldwide, since it represents a reservoir of multi-potent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) able to differentiate in vitro toward several lineages [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], finally offering high potential for their use in regenerative medicine applications. In particular, in order to overcome the very low frequency of occurrence among bone marrow nucleated cells, bone marrow derived MSC are typically expanded in monolayer (2D), due to their capacity to adhere to a plastic surface, before their use in combination with three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds. When loaded into 3D ceramic-based scaffolds the resulting constructs have been demonstrated to be osteoinductive <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, MSC combined with porous bioceramics have been also used with excellent results to repair large bone defects in both animal and human pilot clinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>These results have opened new frontiers addressed to the investigation of biological and molecular mechanisms of MSC differentiation, and on the influence of the artificial microenvironment affecting the cellular activity [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Various stimuli of different nature may in fact influence MSC status, modulating their fate. Recently, mechanical and physical stimulations [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have been investigated about their capability to directly induce MSC differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, currently the most studied cues are represented by bio/chemical factors, which can cause signaling pathways through cell membrane receptors, second messengers and the downstream cascades, thus leading to specific cell lineages. External biochemical factors can be administered as solutions in the culture medium, or in the form of biodegradable scaffolds, where cells can be cultured and receive the released chemical components. In particular, in bone tissue engineering, the intrinsic osteoconductive properties of bioceramics work together with the biological properties of the MSC, finally triggering the formation <italic>in vivo</italic> of a well vascularised bone tissue. When implanted in ectopic model, MSC are able to reconstitute an <italic>organoid</italic> composed of both MSC derived bone tissue and bone marrow tissue originated from host hematopoietic progenitors [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>However, one of the key elements to trigger the bone repair process is the use of a proper scaffold, that should prime cell differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage and provide the template for bone tissue formation [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among modern bone substitute biomaterials, calcium phosphates represents promising alternatives as bone substitutes, mimicking the chemical composition of the natural bone tissue mineral phase [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this system the ceramic substitute performs both as mechanical carrier, and as osteo-mimetic substrate for the MSC differentiation and new bone tissue formation [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Although the power of scaffolds&#8217; morphological and topological features in affecting the cellular activity [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], biomaterial chemical composition can induce MSC osteogenic differentiation independently from the macrostructure of the substrate. This has been successfully proofed by using both bulk and porous ceramics, granules and thin scaffolds as cell substrate [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The release of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and phosphate (P) ions by dissolution is believed to be the main origin of the bioactivity of CaP biomaterials, and experimental evidence clearly indicates the key role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in osteoinduction [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been measured, for example, that during bone remodeling cycle, bone resorption by osteoclasts produces local increases in the extracellular calcium concentration, reaching levels of 40mM [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and being crucial in regulating osteoblasts proliferation, differentiation and activity. The differentiation of human bone marrow-derived MSC towards osteoblasts is accompanied by the expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding-proteins [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies on stem cells differentiation have been performed involving calcium-based scaffolds, results often focus on highlighting production of bone markers, formation and quantity of the mineralized matrix, while information about the biomolecular mechanisms involved in stem cells differentiation due to calcium cues is limited. The complex genetic programs for osteogenesis have been just partially deciphered: it is known, for example, that the master transcription factor, essential inducer of osteoblastic differentiation, is <italic>RUNX2</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, it is recognized that the main components of the bone matrix are osteocalcin, collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, and some markers of differentiation toward osteoblast lineage (such as CRYab) have been recently identified [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Calcium dynamics in MSC and its role in stem cells differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148173.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The differentiation process is based on the expression of cell type-specific genes, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> can play a role in controlling this through regulation of transcription factors via the action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transducers [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]: nevertheless, how variations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> level can influence gene expression still remains unclear. Similarly, it is known that many of the cellular effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are mediated by calmodulin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein able to bind up to 4 calcium ions leading to conformational changes which allow its binding to specific proteins to elicit a specific response [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but the description of the different molecules and pathways operative in these differentiations is far from complete, as well as the activity of calcium in this process.</p><p>The present work aims to evaluate the involvement of extracellular calcium in MSC differentiation: a better understanding of the early stage osteogenic differentiation program of MSC is required in order to develop optimal strategies to promote osteogenesis.

Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array, a human whole-transcript coverage chip (40,716 different probes derived from RefSeq download as of February 2012), was exploited for 3 replicates for each time point. Data analysis was mainly performed in R-Bioconductor environment [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Oligo package was used to read HuGene2.0-st.cel format. Normalization was performed, in order to make further comparisons meaningful, through robust multi-array average (RMA) algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], implemented in Affy package. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG) was performed through Limma package. This analysis approach relies on two matrices: the design matrix (which provides a representation of the targets and corresponds to the microarray data matrix), and the contrast matrix (which allows to define comparisons of interest among samples). A slightly restrictive choice was made by considering just DEG presenting a log fold change (logFC) &gt; = |2|. P value &lt; 0.05 was set to identify significant results.</p><p>miRNA expression was evaluated through Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA4.0 Array, a small non-coding RNAs chip which interrogates all mature miRNA sequences in miRBase Release 20, together with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and small Cajal body-specific RNA (scaRNA), for many organisms. The total amount of transcripts from all species is 30.424, while those of human origin are 6.631. miRNA analysis were performed on duplicates for T0 time point, while 3 replicates were considered for T5 and T10 time points. miRNA analysis was performed using algorithm implemented in Bioconductor analysis software, in R platform. First, miRNA expression values underwent normalization processing, in order to ensure that observed between-array differences are due to biological phenomena, excluding artifacts coming from sample handling or processing. Normalization of microRNA microarrays is problematic because of the small number of miRNA measured by the arrays, and the much smaller quantity of differentially expressed miRNA among samples, which are those suitable to be exploited for normalization. Variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) approach [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] is widely used for miRNA microarray data, since it assumes that less than half of the sequences on the arrays is differentially expressed.

After defining the lists of differential expression at various time points, similarity clusters (heatmaps and dendrograms) on the selected genes and miRNA were produced, to evaluate consistency of replicates and difference among diverse time points; Venn diagrams were plotted to show expression overlap among different analyzed conditions; functional annotation of genes and miRNA was performed, to identify active biological process, with particular interest for bone-related processes.</p><p>Late genes such as osteopontin (SPP1), bone sialoprotein (IBSP) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) were found overexpressed over time, whereas no significant differences of gene expression were observed for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I (COLI), and osteonectin (SPARC), whose levels increase prior to the onset of mineralization (<xref rid="pone.0148173.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Major differences in gene expression dynamics were observed during first days of cell-substrate interaction, since no DEG is peculiar of C set (i.e. T10 vs. T5); such differences were associated with activation of molecular signaling pathways related to bone remodeling, as confirmed by SPP1(ON) and BMP family gene levels. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) family that bind to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors, and transduce signals through Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. Recently, it has been shown that calcium up-regulates gene transcription of BMP2 in human MSC [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This finding is confirmed herein, as BMP2 and BMP6 gene expression levels were high already after few days of in vitro culture, finally supporting the key role for BMP signalling pathway in calcium phosphates driven osteogenesis.</p><p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential signaling messenger that modulates a variety of cellular functions ranging from cell growth to differentiation to cell death. On the contrary, osteopontin transcription was shown to increase in relation to phosphate, the other ion building the hydroxyapatite crystals, which acts on the OPN promoter, through the glucocorticoid receptor [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Osteocalcin and osteonectin genes were not significantly regulated during in vitro cell culture, although a complete cellular maturation and in vivo bone formation was observed within HA constructs. These results are however in accordance to what previously reported about the ability of osteoblasts to form bone matrix even in mice in which these genes have been previously silenced [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the combination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sup>3-</sup><sub>4</sub> ions in vitro triggers an osteogenic differentiation through BMPs/SMAD and RAS signaling pathways, involving genes typically regulated during the dexamethasone (DEX) induced differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Smad1/5/8 are intracellular signaling proteins that can modulate BMP-mediated osteogenesis, and the intensity of BMP signals can be determined by BMP receptors via Smad1 C-terminal phosphorylation. Moreover, non-Smad associated kinase cascades are also activated by TGF-beta superfamily members: in particular, some non-smad pathways used by BMP-2 include RAS/Raf/ERK [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to induce bone marrow derived osteoprogenitor cells towards osteoblastic phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In particular, several genes found up-regulated during MSC culture onto HA substrates (<xref rid="pone.0148173.t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>) belong to the RAS superfamily, and their expression appears to be regulated positively by glucocorticoids, such as DEX [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pone.0148173.t010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0148173.t010</object-id><label>Table 10</label><caption><title>Differentially Expressed genes Concerning RAS pathway.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0148173.t010g" xlink:href="pone.0148173.t010"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t010fn001"><p>DEG evidenced for their involvement into RAS pathway.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The up-regulation of SMAD and RAS family genes when MSC are cultured with osteogenic medium containing DEX is expected and consistent with the fact that the DEX regulates the osteogenesis of human MSC and mineralization in vitro. Interestingly, only by using Ca-P as substrate, these genes were equally upregulated, suggesting an osteogenic commitment of hMSC cultured on HA in basal medium, similar to the results achievable by supplementing growth factors for directing cell fate towards osteoblast lineage. Moreover, the Ca-P induced osteoblastic commitment also guaranteed the initiation and maturation of ectopic bone formation. Already 14 days after in vivo implantation, MSC induced neo bone formation appeared, confirming the key role of mineral phase as autoconsistent osteoinductive stimulus.</p><p>It is worth to note the significant involvement of inflammation players in the osteogenesis process. This is testified by the presence of a high number of inflammation-related genes among the list of DEG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148173.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Although mechanisms underlying their regulatory action in osteogenic process have not been completely elucidated, recent studies showed that many mediators of the inflammatory response play a key role in osteogenesis. Among DEG, a set of genes known to be involved both in inflammation and bone formation appears, which includes: IL6, encoding a cytokine that acts in the maturation of B cells, is known to be an important pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by osteoblasts in bone resorption process [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and in human BMSCs it seems to positively influence the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, essential for normal skeletogenesis and bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]; the protein encoded by PTGES gene, a glutathione-dependent prostaglandin E synthase, was evidenced in the monolayered MSCs [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and several studies suggest this gene contributing to decrease cell proliferation and induces osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]; IL1, an heterodimer containing &#945; and &#946; subunits, seems to intervene in bone remodeling process [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it was also demonstrated the importance of miRNA, key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, in the control of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function. Various positive and negative miRNA regulators of bone remodelling have been identified, and in some cases used for therapeutic purpose [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have focused on miRNA modulated by BMP signaling as a means to understand the role of miRNA in osteoblasts. Since some miRNA can be co-expressed and/or co-regulated, it is possible that families of miRNA may promote one phenotype at the expense of another. Among them, inhibition of miR-138, here found, it was shown to markedly increase osteogenic differentiation in vitro and enhance ectopic bone formation in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0148173.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Moreover, down-regulation of miR-140 and miR-193, expressed during cartilage development, was also shown, in accordance with the expressions of genes typically involved during MSC differentiation towards the chondrogenic lineage. This is in agreement with our results showing a process of <italic>in vivo</italic> intramembranous ossification, in spite of the endochondral one, where the bone tissue is created by cartilaginous tissue expressing specific chondrogenic genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The presented study attempts to investigate which molecular players are activated by calcium-phosphate based scaffolds. The strategy employed herein highlights the importance of the microenvironment (i.e. in principle chemical conditioning provided by the substrate), for cell activation and subsequent tissue formation. A better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control growth and differentiation of MSC may enable the production of biologically functional biomaterials with defined cell-specific properties for regenerative medicine strategies. In particular, the development of composite materials, which combine the easy workability of polymers with the osteoinductive properties of Ca-P phases, allows realizing clinically relevant biomaterials, avoiding the use of specific exogenous growth factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148173.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Annotated DEG expression values.</title><p>The complete list of differentially expressed genes together with their expression levels (logFC) and p values.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148173.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148173.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes and miRNA common among different comparisons.</title><p>List of genes and miRNA showing differential expression in more than one comparison, indicating a strong dependence of their expression on time.
