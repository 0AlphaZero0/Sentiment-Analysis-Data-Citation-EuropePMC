Here, we show that carboplatin treatment of human ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cells triggers an ordered sequence of events, which precedes the emergence of mitotic chemoresistant cells. The initial phase of cell death after initiation of carboplatin treatment is followed around day 14 by the emergence of a mixed cell population consisting of cycling, cell cycle-arrested and senescent cells. At this stage, giant cells make up &gt;80% of the cell population, p21 <italic>(CDKN1A)</italic> in strongly induced, and cell numbers remain nearly static. Subsequently, cell death decreases, p21 expression drops to a low level and cell divisions increase, including regular mitoses of giant cells and depolyploidization by multi-daughter divisions. These events are accompanied by the upregulation of stemness markers and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, peaking after approximately 14 days of treatment. At the same time the cells initiate epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which over the subsequent weeks continuously increases, concomitantly with the emergence of highly proliferative, migratory, dedifferentiated, pro-inflammatory and chemoresistant cells (SKOV3-R). These cells are anchorage-independent and grow in a 3D collagen matrix, while cells on day 14 do not survive under these conditions, indicating that SKOV3-R cells were generated thereafter by the multi-stage process described above. This process was essentially recapitulated with the ovarian carcinoma cell line IGROV-1. Our observations suggest that transitory cells characterized by polyploidy, features of stemness and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype contribute to the acquisition of chemoresistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chemoresistance</kwd><kwd>giant cancer cells</kwd><kwd>polyploidy</kwd><kwd>senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ovarian cancer ranks fifth as the cause of death from cancer in women with &gt;20,000 new cases annually in the United States, &gt;40,000 in the European Union and &gt;50% of new cases diagnosed worldwide in developing countries [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Ovarian cancer has a dire prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of &lt;25%. At least 90% of malignant ovarian tumors are carcinomas, presumably originating from the M&#252;llerian epithelium of the ovarian surface and the Fallopian tube, the latter especially in the context of hereditary ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The WHO classification distinguishes serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional cell and squamous carcinoma [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of these, serous ovarian carcinoma is the most common ovarian cancer, but tumors of other subtypes carry a similarly poor prognosis. For example, the survival of advanced clear cell carcinoma is extremely low due to its insensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy compared to non-clear cell ovarian cancers [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Distinct mutation patterns and expression profiles indicate that high-grade and low-grade serous ovarian cancers are two distinct disease entities, with the latter bearing considerable molecular resemblance with low-grade endometrioid, mucinous and clear-cell carcinomas [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These tumor subtypes are collectively referred to as type 1 cancers and typically harbor mutations in components of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (ERBB2, KRAS, BRAF), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PIK3CA), the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase PTEN, &#946;-catenin (CTNNB1) and the SNI/SNF-related chromatin remodeler ARID1A, they are relatively genetically stable and may arise from benign precursor lesions. In contrast, the aggressive type 2 cancers, including high-grade serous adenocarcinoma, are characterized by frequent TP53 mutations (up to 97%), the occurrence of BRCA1/2 alterations (~20%) and the lack of a clear precursor lesion.</p><p>Several features contribute to the fatal nature of ovarian cancer. Tumor cells are usually shed at a very early stage of the disease, and their spread to other pelvic and peritoneal organs is facilitated by the peritoneal fluid serving as a carrier [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This passive transcoelemic dissemination represents a primary route to the formation of metastatic lesions. The peritoneal environment, which is formed by a malignant effusion building up in the peritoneal cavity, may be an essential determinant of disease progression. This malignancy-associated ascites is rich in tumor-promoting soluble factors [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], highly tumorigenic cancer cells [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and different types of immune cells, including large numbers of pro-tumorigenic macrophages (TAMs) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], supporting tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and immune evasion.</p><p>Ovarian carcinoma growth and progression are thought to be fueled by cells expressing stem cell markers [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and are therefore referred to as cancer stem cells or cancer propagating cells (CPCs). These are characterized by a low proliferation rate, a high apoptotic threshold and a high capacity for drug elimination, rendering these cells highly chemoresistant. CPCs also have a high tumorigenic potential, which facilitates the formation of metastases. Surface marker expression has been used extensively to identify ovarian CPCs by flow cytometry as cells with high levels of CD44, CD117 (KIT), CD133 (PROM1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) expression, high intracellular ALDH activity and/or enhanced Hoechst dye extrusion by ABC transporters (side population cells) [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, ovarian cancer cell subpopulations have been isolated that express stemness markers at highly variable levels, in different combinations and with none of these markers being obligatory [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that a common ovarian CPCs may not exist or has not been identified. Expression of several of these markers has also been associated with a poor clinical outcome, supporting a role for these cells in tumor progression and drug resistance. Thus, even though the cancer stem cell hypothesis is a matter of debate, it is likely that the aberrant expression of stemness-associated genes is an important determinant of tumor progression and recurrence.</p><p>CPCs have been proposed to reactivate developmental programs that are used by embryonal stem cells to maintain pluripotency [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], notably the core transcriptional circuitry governed by OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 (core module) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consistent with this idea OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 are expressed in ovarian CPCs [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the enforced expression of OCT4 or NANOG enhances the malignancy of ovarian carcinoma cell lines [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The expression of pluripotency factors has also been linked to chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.</p><p>The acquisition of stemness is closely linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a developmental program that transiently disrupts homotypic epithelial cell-cell adhesion and converts epithelial cells to migratory, invasive mesenchymal cells [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cancer EMT, which recapitulates developmental EMT, is the driving force of metastasis. CPC-like cells from ovarian carcinoma patients have a mesenchymal phenotype [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], supporting the view that these cells initiate metastasis. EMT has also been associated with chemoresistance [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], emphasizing its relevance with respect to recurrence of the disease.</p><p>DNA and spindle damaging agents, such as carboplatin (CPT) and paclitaxel used for the treatment of ovarian cancer, induce polyploidy [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in particular in the absence of functional p53 [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A fraction of these polyploid cells shows the hallmarks of replicative senescence, including cell cycle arrest and high acidic &#946;-galactosidase activity [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Surprisingly, these cells are endowed with the potential to regain a para-diploid, highly proliferative state [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This reversible polyploidy is associated with the induction of pluripotency markers in lymphoma cell lines, thus linking apparently opposing processes, i.e. stemness and senescence [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A similar phenomenon has recently been described for different carcinoma cell lines treated with CoCl<sub>2</sub> as a hypoxia-mimetic [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation are known to trigger processes associated with malignancy and tumor progression, including senescence [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], polyploidization and giant cell formation [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], expression of stemness-related markers [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and EMT [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Collectively, these observations suggest that the acquisition of a chemoresistant, mitotic phenotype is a multi-stage process, but this hypothesis has not been systematically addressed as of yet.</p><p>However, the relationship of polyploidization/depolyploidization, cell cycle arrest, stemness, SASP and EMT is not fully understood. Thus, it is not clear, whether these processes occur in the same cell, and if so, whether they occur simultaneously or as a sequence of events. It is also not known whether giant cells are the central players in the formation of replicating, chemoresistant cells after application of DNA-damaging drugs or whether other cells play a major role.</p><p>In the present study, we have used the human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the most frequently used model for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], to systematically address these questions. SKOV3 cells were originally described as being derived from an ovarian adenocarcinoma without specification of the histological subtype [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], but the subsequent analysis of xenotransplants in mice indicated a clear cell carcinoma origin [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This classification of SKOV3 cells is compatible with the presence of PIK3CA and ARID1A mutations, which are typical of human ovarian clear cell carcinoma, and the deletion rather than mutation of TP53 found in &gt;97% of high grade serous adenocarcinomas [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. SKOV3 cells are moderately sensitive to CPT, but highly resistant cells can be selected for after drug exposure. Using this experimental system we found an ordered sequence of events that preceded the emergence of chemoresistance, which could essentially be recapitulated with TP53-mutated IGROV-1 cells, an ovarian cancer cell line most likely of low-grade serous adenocarcinoma origin [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Proliferative CPT-resistant SKOV3 cells emerge after the transient occurrence of enlarged cells, polyploidy and accelerated senescence</title><p>After an initial phase of cell death mainly resulting from mitotic catastrophe, as indicated by the interphase cells with multiple micronuclei, CPT-treated SKOV3 cells showed typical temporal alterations of cell morphology associated with profound changes in size, resulting in highly resistant cells after 21 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; subsequently referred to as SKOV3-R cells). Median cell size of attached cells peaked at day 14 (16,000 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>), and then progressively decreased to a size (2,000 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>) only slightly larger than untreated cells (1.700 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>). On day 14, the population consisted of a mixture of cell types which we defined as small (&lt;3,000 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>), medium (3,000&#8211;6,000 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>) or giant cells (&gt;6,000 &#956;m<sup>2</sup>), with a distribution of 8%, 16% and 76%, respectively, the latter composed of mono- and polynucleated cells at a ration 2:1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The transient increase in cell size was also visible when detached cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (forward scatter; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Another conspicuous feature of many of the larger cells appearing around day 14 was their flattened, senescent-like morphology. After day 14, the fraction of giant cells progressively decreased, while medium-sized cells first increased and then decreased and small cells continuously increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Since cell size not only depends on cell cycle phase and ploidy, we also determined the size of nuclei. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, the changes in cell size were paralleled by similar changes in nuclear size (small : medium : giant cells = 2% : 4%: 94%;), pointing to a dynamic changes in ploidy during the observation period.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Morphology, size and growth properties of SKOV3 cells after CPT treatment</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Cells were treated with CPT for 10 days, 14 days, 28 days or 21 weeks, stained with Giemsa dye and evaluated by bright field microscopy.

Importantly, giant cells also emerged when cells were treated periodically with CPT, i.e., when short periods of treatment were followed by drug-free recovery phases, thus mimicking the clinical administration of chemotherapy. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, substantial number of giant cells were observed after different time schedules, including 3 cycles of a 1-day treatment/7-day recovery regimen and 4 cycles of a 1-day treatment/21-day recovery schedule. These findings demonstrate that the continuous presence of CPT is not required to cause the formation of giant cells.</p><p>Giant SKOV3 cells have also been reported to be induced by hypoxia mimetics [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We were therefore interested to investigate whether hypoxia might have an impact on giant cell formation in response to CPT treatment. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> shows that hypoxia induced giant cell formation to a slightly lesser extent than CPT, thus confirming the results of the mimetics study quoted above. Intriguingly, the combination of both treatments showed a statistically highly significant cooperative effect.</p><p>Next, we compared the anchorage-independent growth potential in a collagen matrix of untreated SKOV3 cells, cells treated with CPT for 14 days and SKOV3-R cells. While untreated cells and SKOV3-R cells proliferated and formed colonies under these conditions, no surviving cells were detectable in cultures with SKOV3 cells treated with CPT for 14 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). This indicates that (i) cell surviving a 14-day CPT treatment in &#8220;monolayer&#8221; cultures (as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) do not survive under anchorage-independent condition and (ii) SKOV3-R cells, on the other hand, have a similar capacity as the parental SKOV3 cells to survive in a collagen matrix, suggesting that this property is gained after day 14.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Polyploidy and senescence in CPT-treated SKOV3 cells</title><p>In view of the profound changes in cell size under CPT treatment and previous reported induction of DNA endoreduplication and polyploidy by chemotherapy we analyzed the DNA content in relation to the size at different times of exposure to the drug.

Thereafter, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression and the fraction of p21<sup>+</sup> cells sharply declined, the latter from 22% on day 14 to 1% on day 30. The early increase in p21 expression on day 8 was paralleled by a decrease in 5-bromo-2&#8242;-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into the cellular DNA, which thereafter continuously increased until reaching approximately the level seen in untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The increase in BrdU incorporation concomitantly with an augmented p21 expression on day 14 relative to day7/8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) clearly suggests that the former is an indicator not only of S-phase progression but also of DNA repair.</p><p>Immunostaining of individual cells on day 14 clearly showed that p21<sup>&#8722;</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup>, p21<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>&#8722;</sup>, double-positive and double-negative cells were found in cell populations of all three sizes at similar proportions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Previous studies have linked p21 to the butyrate-induced senescence of SKOV3 cells [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the ectopic expression of p21 induced a cell cycle arrest in SKOV3 cells [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is therefore likely that the four cell populations identifies in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> represent cycling cells (p21<sup>&#8722;</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup>), senescent cells (p21<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>&#8722;</sup>) and cell cycle arrested cells undergoing DNA repair (p21<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup>). The nature of p21<sup>&#8722;</sup>BrdU<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells representing a major fraction in each size group is unclear. These cells are apparently cell cycle-arrested in the absence of high p21 levels, and may have entered a senescence-related state that mechanistically differs from the p21-dependent pathway. The data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> (blue bars) also demonstrate that cycling cells are at readily detectable in each size group (27&#8211;47%).</p><p>On day 14, cells with increased lysosome &#946;-galactosidase activity (&#946;-gal<sup>+</sup>) were also detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), confirming the morphological observation of a substantial fraction of senescent cells at this time. In SKOV3-R cells, the fraction of p21<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells was decreased to 1.5% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). However, &#946;-galactosidase activity was strongly increased in the mitotically active SKOV3-R4 cells, and there was no obvious morphological difference between &#946;-galactosidase positive and negative cells.

These studies identified three outcomes of treatment irrespective of cell size: death, division and no visible change (&#8220;resting&#8221;). Cell death was the main fate on giant cells on day 14 (60%), but clearly decreased on day 30 and thereafter, concomitantly with an increase in cell divisions exceeding that of cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In small and medium size cells, differences in fate and time-related changes were less pronounced, suggesting an initial <italic>status quo</italic>, followed by an increase in cell number. Mitosis of mononuclear giant cells was usually followed by cytokinesis, and only rarely (&lt;2%) resulted in the formation of multinuclear cells. However, ~17% of daughter cell underwent cell fusion immediately after cytokinesis, thereby creating new polyploid cells. Cell division of giant cells either resulted in two daughter cells or, less frequently, in &#8805; 3 daughter cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>) with a ratio of approximately 25:1 on day 14 and 10:1 after 49 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Furthermore, giant cells were able to generate daughter cells by budding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). Importantly, cells generated by multi-daughter division were able to undergo subsequent bipolar divisions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Time-lapse life cell imaging of CPT-treated SKOV3 cells</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Quantitation of cell fate on day 14, on day 30 and on day &#8805;49 of CPT treatment for small, medium and giant cells.

Between day 14 and 30 the balance is clearly shifted to survival and proliferation, consistent with the disappearance of p21<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The drop in p21<sup>+</sup> cells is followed by a clear increase in depolyploidizing cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), suggesting that p21<sup>&#8722;</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells rather than senescent cells are undergoing depolyploidization.</p><p>Obviously, cells of all sizes can divide and thus have the potential to contribute to the subsequent development of chemoresistant, stably proliferating cells. However, in view of the low fraction of small cells present on day 14, a prominent role for the giant cells in the later emergence of SKOV3-R cells is very likely. This is supported by the microscopic observation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, showing rapid clonal growth of small cells in regions previously occupied by giant cells.</p><p>To assess the validity of the hypothesis that giant cells substantially contribute to the generation of SKOV3-R cells we modeled a mathematical simulation, which estimates the relative contribution of giant cells to the subsequent generation of small cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). The most crucial parameters of this simulation are the relative fractions of different size groups at different time points and the fractions of dividing and dying cells. These parameters can be extracted from the data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. Another important, albeit less decisive parameter is the average number of progeny per depolyploidizing cell. Evaluation of the video recordings showed that approximately 1/3 of these cells yielded 4 daughter cells and 2/3 gave rise to 3 daughter cells. Taking into account that additional cells were also generated by budding, we estimated the average total number of daughter cells generated per observation period (70 hours) as 3.7. A simulation performed on the basis of these parameters clearly shows the expected (see above) initial decline of giant cell numbers between day 14 and 29 and a more or less static situation for small cell numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Furthermore, simulating the generation of small cells during the subsequent 30 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>) suggests that SKOV3-R cells originate to a considerable extent from giant cells, but also predicts a major contribution by small cells. However, it is likely that the latter are, at least in part, descendants of giant cells, pointing to an even greater contribution by the latter.</p><p>Taken together with the flow cytometric analyses of PI-stained cells described above, our observations reveal a ploidy conveyer, where the para-diploid cells undergo a G<sub>2</sub> arrest, accumulate there, enter aberrant mitosis, by-pass mitotic catastrophe and then re-enter the cell cycle.

RNA-Seq analyses identified 314 genes upregulated in the latter (fold change &gt; 10; Dataset S1). Diseases and functions annotation of these genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) showed a strong positive association (z-score &gt; 2) with: (i) migration, cell movement and chemotaxis; (ii) inflammatory response; (iii) cell proliferation and (iv) cell viability, while an inverse association was seen for apoptosis (z-score &lt; &#8722;2). Analysis of the known upstream regulators of these genes (signaling molecules and transcription factors) identified three main groups, i.e. TGF&#946;, pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1B and TNF, and p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). As SKOV3 cells are <italic>TP53</italic>-deficient (homozygous deletion), the overlap of the latter group of genes with a subgroup of p53 target genes probably results from the induction of target genes by the DNA damage response through a p53-independent pathway. The genes of the IL1B and TNF networks partially overlap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and indicate the upregulation of pro-inflammatory (e.g., <italic>IL6, IL11, CXCL2</italic>) and EMT markers (e.g., <italic>SNAI2, TGFB2, RUNX3</italic>).

Consistent with the RNA expression data, flow cytometry showed an increase in the fraction of intracellular IL-1&#946;<sup>+</sup> cells on day 14 and a decline thereafter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Gating of cells according to forward and sideward scatters showed that small and large cells only slightly differed in the levels of intracellular IL-1&#946;, indicating that the expression of pro-inflammatory marker genes in SKOV3-R cells do not result from a small subpopulation of giant cells. The induction of a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype was also functionally confirmed by demonstrating an increased phosphorylated STAT3 in a human macrophage cell line (differentiated THP-1 cells) by supernatant from SKOV3 cells treated with CPT for 14 days or 21 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Induction of a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype after CPT treatment of SKOV3 cells</title><p><bold>A&#8211;E.</bold> RT-qPCR expression analysis of the indicated pro-inflammatory marker genes at the indicated times of CPT treatment (sample size: <italic>n</italic> &#8805; 3).

In contrast to replicative senescence responsible for the limited lifespan of normal cells, drug-induced senescence occurs in replication-competent cells and induces a prolonged, but not necessarily permanent cell cycle block. This response, also referred to as accelerated senescence, is associated with the formation of polyploid giant cells that are endowed with the potential to form para-diploid progeny. Several studies have shown the upregulation of stemness markers in giant cells, pointing to cancer-initiating properties of these cells or their descendants. Giant cells thus might provide a mechanism by which cancer cells can escape therapy-induced cell death and contribute to relapse of the disease by converting to proliferating cells after depolyploidization.</p><p>DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs can also trigger other processes linked to senescence, such as SASP and EMT. However, prior to the present study it was unclear how these events are temporally and spatially linked to each other and to the development of CPT resistance, and to what extent giant and non-giant cells contribute to this process. We have addressed these question using ovarian cancer cells as a model. Our data (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>) show that after the acute induction of cell death by mitotic catastrophe in the majority of the cell population, cells of different sizes and ploidy, including giant and para-diploid cells, survive. These cells show cell cycle perturbations resembling accelerated senescence, which is accompanied by the persistent expression of the stemness marker OCT4 and the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory status. At the same time cells begin to undergo EMT, which progressively increases thereafter and is maintained in the cells finally emerging from this multi-stage process. CPT thus triggers a sequence of partially reversible events, including the transient formation of polyploid giant cells. This integrated picture of events leading to the emergence of proliferative chemoresistant cells is summarized in the scheme depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. Several key issues in the context with this model are discussed in detail below.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Summary scheme</title><p>After the acute induction of cell death in most of the cells, CPT triggers a sequence of partially reversible events, including polyploidization and accelerated senescence.

At least two observations argue in favor of the first possibility. In day 14 cultures the number of small cells is very low and the rates of cell division and death are similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), making an expansion of these cells in the following days unlikely. Giant cells are present at much larger numbers at the same time, but their death rate exceeds the rate of division. This results in a scenario on day 28 where small and giant cells are present at similar numbers, as suggested by the microscopic evaluation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C and 1D</xref>. On day 30 and thereafter, the death rate of giant cells is strongly decreased and falls below the rate of division, while the fate of small cells remains largely unchanged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Between day 14 and 30, giant cells already undergo multi-daughter divisions into more than two daughter cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which presumably results in their depolyploidization. Thus, small cells present on day 30 but generated from giant cells before day 30 will contribute to the expansion of the pool of small cells. This is consistent with the simulation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>, which suggests that giant cells present on day 30 contribute to the subsequent generation of small cells, making it very unlikely that the selection of preexisting small cells in the original SKOV3 population are the origin of the small SKOV3-R cells eventually emerging at later stages. The possibility that preexisting giant cells are selected is similarly unlikely in view of their dramatic increase between day 10 and 14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), in spite of their low rate of division and a high rate of cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which strongly suggests that these cells arise from smaller cells by endoreduplication and/or cell fusion. Another finding arguing against the selection hypothesis is the fact that cells surviving a 14-day drug treatment are unable to seed in a collagen matrix, indicating that cells with the properties of SKOV3-R are not present at this stage.</p><p>While these observations assign an essential role to giant cells in the formation of SKOV3-R cells, a significant contribution by medium-size cells is less likely. This is suggested by the absence of any detectable depolyploidizing events in day 14 and day 30 cultures, indicating that multi-daughter divisions occur less frequently in these cells than in giant cells. At later stages, divisions of medium-size cells into more than two daughter cells are observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Although these still occur at a lower frequency than in giant cells, it is likely that medium-size cells contribute to the emergence of SKOV3-R cells at later stages. Taken together, these observations point a key role of polyploid cells, in particular giant cells, in the generation of proliferating, chemoresistant SKOV3 cells.</p><p>Another critical issue concerns the role of senescence. Previous studies have provided evidence that DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs induce polyploidy, which is reversible in a small subpopulation of these cells, resulting in the emergence of resistant, clonogenic malignant cells (reviewed in [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). The same studies also suggested that polyploidization and depolyploidization are linked to the induction and reversion of accelerated senescence. Our own data suggest that senescence and polyploidy are not necessarily linked in a large fraction of the cells. Thus, p21<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells occur to a similar extent in large, medium-size and giant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), indicating that senescence occurs irrespective of ploidy, including small para-diploid cells. Furthermore, we identified a large fraction of giant cells that undergo regular cell division into two daughter cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), presumably representing the p21<sup>&#8722;</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>. In addition, only about 5% of the cells on day 14 are positive for &#946;-galactosidase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), although giant cells prevail at this time. These observations suggest that: (i) the induction of polyploidy in SKOV3 cells by CPT is not strictly dependent on the induction of senescence; and (ii) small, para-diploid cells can originate from replication-competent polyploid giant cells. This certainly does not exclude the possibility that rejuvenating senescent giant cells also generate para-diploid, cycling cells, as previously described in other experimental systems [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], perhaps through a replicating giant cell as an intermediate. This matter is very complex and needs more research to be able to draw definitive conclusions as to the role of senescent cells in reversible polyploidization.</p><p>Our data also show that the combination of CPT treatment with hypoxia produces a cooperative effect with respect to the generation of giant cells. A recent publication described the induction of giant SKOV3 by hypoxia mimetics [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but the observed cooperative effect with a chemotherapeutic agent has not been reported to date. Several previous studies have addressed the link between hypoxia and senescence, which is also relevant for the present study. While an inhibitory effect of hypoxia on senescence has been observed with most experimental models, there are also opposing findings with other systems, making this a highly controversial issue [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the linkage of senescence and hypoxia is dependent on p53, at least in some experimental systems [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], making it difficult to extrapolate the published findings to SKOV3 cells lacking <italic>TP53</italic> genes. However, if hypoxia indeed suppresses senescence of SKOV3 cells as in the majority of experimental systems, this would support the conclusion that senescence is not a prerequisite for giant cell formation.</p><p>Our data also show the upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers on day 14 of CPT treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, at least in the case of IL-1&#946; this occurs in the majority of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>) and therefore does not appear to be restricted to senescent cells. It thus seems appropriate to refer to this status as pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype rather than SASP. Intriguingly, these markers remain upregulated in SKOV3-R cells, both with and without ongoing CPT treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>), indicating that the pro-inflammatory secretory status triggered around day 14 is maintained in the cycling resistant cells emerging at later stages. It is likely that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines has no direct impact on the multi-stage process described, but rather contributes to drug resistance and an increased malignancy of the resulting cells. A striking feature of the finally emerging SKOV3-R cells is their high &#946;-galactosidase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), a hallmark of senescent cells in other systems. It thus appears that SKOV3-R combine features of senescence, including a pro-inflammatory phenotype and &#946;-galactosidase activity, with low p21 expression and a high mitotic activity.</p><p>EMT is another process previously linked to chemoresistance, but its relationship to other events has not been systematically addressed. In the model system investigated in the present study, EMT temporally differs from all processed analyzed and discussed above, since it progressively increases after day 14. EMT thus appears to parallel the emergence of SKOV3-R cells. This is suggested by an up-regulation of EMT marker genes concomitantly with the repression of the E-cadherin encoding gene <italic>CDH1</italic> in SKOV3-R cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), a dramatic increase of SMA-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), the occurrence of actin stress fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>) and the loss of tight junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). The data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> also show that multiple epithelial marker genes are strongly repressed in SKOV3-R cells, indicating that these cells are dedifferentiated, which is consistent with the occurrence of EMT. Flow cytometry of SMA expression also showed that EMT was not restricted to a small subpopulation of the heterogeneous SKOV3-R cell population, but occurred in the vast majority of these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Furthermore, increased SMA and IL-1&#946; expression were found in the same cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), indicating that EMT occurred in cells with a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype.</p><p>Finally, our data show that four stemness markers were up-regulated during the observed multi-stage process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). OCT-4, CD44, CD117 and CD133 showed a clear increase on day 14. While expression of the latter two was elevated transiently and coincided with the maximal occurrence of polyploid and giant cells, OCT-4 and CD44 remained elevated at later stages, including SKOV3-R cells. It is thus possible that CD117 and CD133 play a role in polyploidization, which would be in line with the previously proposed link of stemness to the transient formation of polyploid giant cells [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast to OCT-4, expression of the functionally related transcription factors NANOG and SOX2 did not change, consistent with a previous report on etoposide-treated PA-1 cells [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. This suggests that OCT-4 fulfills a function unrelated to self-renewal in drug-treated cancer cells. In the PA-1 model alluded to above, OCT-4 was associated with the up-regulation of p21 expression. It appears that this does not apply to our experimental system, since <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and p21 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) is inversely correlated with OCT-4 levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Nevertheless, OCT-4 appears to be of particular interest, since its expression and activity are elevated in SKOV3-R cells, raising the possibility that it plays a role in conferring CPT resistance, as reported for drug-treated hepatoma cells [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We therefore attempted to analyze the function of OCT-4 in CPT-treated SKOV3 cells by silencing of <italic>POU5F1</italic> mRNA, but were unable to obtain SKOV3 cells with substantially reduced level of OCT-4 protein after lentiviral shRNA transduction (not shown), suggesting that OCT-4 plays an essential role in these cells.</p><p>Collectively, these findings led to the model in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, depicting the time course of events eventually leading to cycling, chemoresistant SKOV3 cells that are capable of growing in an anchorage-independent manner and display a dedifferentiated and pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype. Importantly, key events of these hallmarks of malignancy were also seen in IGROV-1 cells and in SKOV3 cells exposed to cyclic CPT treatment, including a regimen of 1 day exposure and 21 days recovery, mimicking the clinical application of chemotherapy. It is thus possible that the multi-stage process described here also occurs in a clinical setting and contributes to the emergence of chemoresistant cells and perhaps the generation of dormant cells that escaped drug-induced death by polyploidization and subsequently rejuvenate to cause relapse of the disease long after the initial therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>SKOV3 cells were obtained from the ATCC.
