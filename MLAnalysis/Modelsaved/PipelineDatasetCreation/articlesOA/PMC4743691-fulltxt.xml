Most EAs arise in a metaplastic epithelium, Barrett's esophagus (BE), which is associated with greatly increased risk of EA. One of the key risk factors for both BE and EA is chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study used the linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and genomic profile risk scoring approaches to investigate the contribution of multiple common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the risk of GERD, and the extent of genetic overlap between GERD and BE or EA. Using LD score regression, we estimated an overall phenotypic variance of 7% (95% CI 3&#8211;11%) for GERD explained by all the genotyped SNPs. A genetic correlation of 77% (s.e. = 24%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0012) between GERD and BE and 88% between GERD and EA (s.e. = 25%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004) was estimated using the LD score regression approach. Results from the genomic profile risk scoring approach, as a robustness check, were broadly similar to those from the LD score regression. This study provides the first evidence for a polygenic basis for GERD and supports for a polygenic overlap between GERD and BE, and GERD and EA.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>National Cancer Institute <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01CA136725</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source>National Health and Medical Research Council <named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-4"><funding-source>NHMRC</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-5"><funding-source>Australian NHMRC Fellowship</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-6"><funding-source>Swedish Esophageal Cancer Study</funding-source><award-id>R01 CA57947-03</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-7"><funding-source>the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-8"><funding-source>National Cancer Institute, and the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-9"><funding-source>Swedish Cancer Society</funding-source><award-id>4559-B01-01XAA</award-id><award-id>and 4758-B02-01XAB</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-10"><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R01DK63616</award-id><award-id>and</award-id><award-id>R01CA59636</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-11"><funding-source>the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-12"><funding-source>California Tobacco Related Research Program</funding-source><award-id>3RT-0122</award-id><award-id>and</award-id><award-id>10RT-0251</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-13"><funding-source>the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-14"><funding-source>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-15"><funding-source>Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-16"><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R01CA100264, P30CA016672</award-id><award-id>and</award-id><award-id>R01CA133996</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-17"><funding-source>the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-18"><funding-source>UTMDACC</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-19"><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>2P50CA093459</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-20"><funding-source>the</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-21"><funding-source>Marit Peterson Fund for Melanoma Research</funding-source><award-id>HHSN268200782096C</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) (OMIM: 614266) is a rapidly fatal cancer with rising incidence in the developed world.

Every year 0.3% of patients with BE develop EA (<xref rid="DDV512C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). BE has prevalence of 1.6% while EA has a lifetime risk of 0.25% (<uri xlink:href="http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/csr/1975_2009_pops09/">http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/csr/1975_2009_pops09/</uri>, 1 March 2015, date last accessed) (<xref rid="DDV512C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDV512C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Frequent and chronic gastroesophageal reflux (hereafter referred to as gastroesophageal reflux disease or &#8216;GERD&#8217;) (OMIM: 109350) is the strongest known risk factor for both BE and EA (<xref rid="DDV512C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="DDV512C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). GERD has a prevalence of 18% in Western countries (<xref rid="DDV512C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Genetic predisposition to GERD, BE and EA is incompletely understood. Previous twin studies estimated a heritability of 30&#8211;40% for GERD (<xref rid="DDV512C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Some other studies had suggested involvement of genetic factors in development of GERD, BE and EA (<xref rid="DDV512C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV512C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). GWAS studies have identified four loci associated with development of BE and four additional loci associated with development of both BE and EA (<xref rid="DDV512C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV512C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). GWAS studies have not identified genome-wide significant hits for GERD to date.</p><p>Some investigators have inferred a shared genetic basis between GERD, BE and EA because the risk for these diseases is increased when a relative is affected with any of these three diseases (<xref rid="DDV512C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV512C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Our recent study using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found a significant genetic overlap between BE and EA, but not between GERD and BE or EA (<xref rid="DDV512C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, while that study reported a significant contribution of common variants to BE and EA (array heritability 35 and 25%, respectively), the contribution of common genetic variants to risk of GERD was not significantly different from zero (<xref rid="DDV512C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, that study was limited by small numbers of patients with GERD, which may have resulted in false-negative findings with regards to the genetic contribution to GERD and to the overlap between GERD and BE/EA. Thus, whether common genetic variants make any contribution to GERD predisposition and the extent of any genetic overlap between GERD and BE/EA remains open to question.</p><p>Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the contribution of common genetic variants to risk of GERD. Further aims were to estimate polygenic overlap and genetic correlation between GERD and BE or EA. Moreover, we aimed to examine for overlaps between the top loci associated with BE/EA and GERD and to investigate novel shared genetic loci between these diseases using meta-analysis of the GWAS results in the cohorts available for this study. In addition to the meta-analysis of the three diseases together, we also aimed to investigate whether meta-analysis of the GWAS results from the large GERD cohorts available for this study can help us identify novel genetic loci associated with GERD alone. Finally, we investigated whether there are any pathways enriched for GERD that are also enriched for BE or EA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Common SNPs contribute to the genetic basis of GERD</title><p>We used the linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression approach (<xref rid="DDV512C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="DDV512C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to estimate the overall phenotypic variance for GERD explained by cumulative effects of all the SNPs used in this study (SNP heritability) using 8 743 GERD cases and 43 932 controls from 23andMe.

Similarly, 910 EA cases and 2323 controls for the analysis without GERD (including 1384 with unknown GERD status), and 600 EA cases and 880 controls for the analysis with GERD were used. The results of these analyses (data not shown) were consistent with those obtained for BE and EA regardless of the GERD status.

Although the other six odds ratios (ORs) were weak, seven of the eight known BE/EA loci show the same direction of effect on GERD (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04 for exact binomial test for seven out of eight having the same direction of effect). However, the risk estimates were generally small for GERD (OR close to 1) and the 95% confidence intervals for ORs do not overlap with the estimates of the effects on EA/BE (Table&#160;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV512TB1">1</xref>).

Firstly, for the first time, we showed that GERD has a polygenic background. The top 1% of SNPs associated with GERD in a discovery cohort significantly predicted the risk of GERD in an independent target cohort. Previous studies have not been able to detect any genome-wide significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>) hits for GERD. However, despite us demonstrating a significant polygenic basis to GERD, our analysis of the BEACON and 23andMe data (either taken individually or combined) failed to clearly identify (at genome-wide significant levels) any specific SNPs conferring GERD susceptibility. However, we estimated an overall phenotypic variance of 7% in GERD explained by the SNPs used in this study using the LD score regression approach. This explains a proportion of the heritability estimated from twin studies of GERD (<xref rid="DDV512C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). As with other complex traits for which a polygenic basis has been established, ever larger sample sizes will enable identification of increasing numbers of genome-wide significant SNPs (<xref rid="DDV512C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="DDV512C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>The second significant finding of this study is that GERD appears to have a significant genetic overlap with BE and EA. Using the LD score regression approach, we estimated a considerable genetic correlation between GERD and BE/EA, consistent with a significant polygenic overlap between GERD and BE/EA using the polygenic risk scoring approach. The overlap seems to involve large numbers of loci with small effects rather than small numbers of loci with large effects.</p><p>We used the profile risk scoring approach in this study as a robustness check to ensure that the findings are consistent with those obtained from the LD score regression approach. This is because the profile risk scoring approach uses the raw data for the target sets when compared with the LD score regression approach that uses only summary statistics. In addition, profile risk scoring is useful to infer what proportions of SNPs better explain the genetic overlap between the discovery set and the target set. The results obtained from both approaches were consistent with a polygenic background for GERD and a significant genetic overlap between GERD and BE and GERD and EA.</p><p>We previously showed that combined GWAS analysis for BE and EA [which have a high genetic correlation (rg = 1)] increased the statistical power to detect novel loci for those diseases (<xref rid="DDV512C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As we identified a considerable polygenic overlap and genetic correlation between GERD and BE or EA in this study, combined GWAS analysis or meta-analysis for these diseases may increase the statistical power to detect loci with pleiotropic effects. Despite this, combined GWAS analysis may not always result in increased statistical power, especially when the genetic correlation between the traits is not high, and for loci without pleiotropic effects. We did not detect any shared loci at genome-wide significance level in a meta-analysis between the GWAS results for BE/EA combined, and GERD. This might be explained, at least in part, by the polygenic basis of these three diseases where large numbers of loci contribute to their development, each with a small effect size. More powerful meta-analyses with larger sample sizes will be required to unambiguously identify specific loci at genome-wide significance level for these diseases.</p><p>Although the polygenic nature of these traits has made it difficult to identify specific loci, rs10419226 on chromosome 19 was genome-wide significant in the multivariate GWAS for correlated traits using GWAS summary statistics (<xref rid="DDV512C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This locus was previously identified as a risk locus for BE and EA (<xref rid="DDV512C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although not associated with GERD at genome-wide significant level in the single trait GWAS, multivariate GWAS in this study suggests that this locus may also be a risk factor for GERD.</p><p>While we used estimates of the prevalence of BE and GERD in general population to estimate SNP heritability of these diseases on liability scale, the lifetime risk was used for EA. This is because prevalence is a suitable measure of case burden in the general population for conditions that are not fatal. As EA is a fatal cancer with a low survival rate, the prevalence of the disease in general population is low; hence, we used estimates of lifetime risk for EA in this study.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that our previous study, in which we did not detect a significant genetic overlap between GERD and BE or EA (<xref rid="DDV512C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), was adversely affected by the small sample size available for GERD in that study.</p><p>Shared genetic background between GERD, BE and EA has also clinical implications. For example, it shows that people suffering from GERD may have a genetic architecture that puts them in a higher risk of developing BE or EA. A recent study showed that using multiple correlated traits could significantly increase risk prediction accuracy (<xref rid="DDV512C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Dissecting the genetic overlap between these diseases can also be helpful in increasing our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases and in future treatments targeting shared molecular pathways involved in pathogenesis of these diseases.</p><p>Epidemiological studies show that frequent gastroesophageal reflux is associated with BE and EA (<xref rid="DDV512C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="DDV512C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Mendelian randomization approaches may be useful to help determine whether the association is causal. Our data showing genetic overlap between GERD, BE and EA are consistent with causality; however, our sample size here is not large enough to enable robust conclusions to be drawn using Mendelian randomization.</p><p>The combined pathways analysis in this study suggested that &#8216;TGF-&#946;-activated receptor activity&#8217; might be a common pathway involved in the development of GERD and BE. This pathway involves combining with and transmitting signal from TGF-&#946; for subsequent catalytic activities within cells (<uri xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0005024">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=GO:0005024</uri>, 1 May 2015, date last accessed). Several studies have shown that changes in the expression of TGF-&#946; and its signaling mediators are involved in the BE carcinogenesis and EA progression (<xref rid="DDV512C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="DDV512C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). On the other hand, it has been suggested that esophageal exposure to gastric acid in GERD promotes tissue remodeling through TGF-&#946;1 stimulation of the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (<xref rid="DDV512C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Increased expression of TGF-&#945; and epidermal growth factor receptors have also been reported in rat chronic reflux esophagitis (<xref rid="DDV512C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These findings suggest that changes in the expression of TGF-&#946; and its signaling mediators could play an important role in the development of GERD and BE, and progression to EA.</p><p>In summary, we showed that GERD has a polygenic basis with a significant genetic overlap with BE and EA. These results suggest that combining data from GERD, BE and EA will help in future identification of shared genetic loci between these diseases. Our work has increased our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases and in the future this may inform development of treatments targeting the shared molecular pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>23andMe cohort</title><p>The 23andMe discovery cohort included summary statistics from a GWAS of 8743 GERD cases versus 43 932 controls of European ancestry.
