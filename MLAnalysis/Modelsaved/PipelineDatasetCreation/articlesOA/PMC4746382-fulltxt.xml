Introduction</title><p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of highly toxic and persistent organic pollutants that are widely distributed in the environment worldwide [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PAHs are ubiquitous, very stable in the environment [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are potentially dangerous due to their carcinogenicity and mutagenicity [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; thus, their removal is an issue of great interest.</p><p>Microbial biodegradation is an attractive option for PAHs removal. The PAHs degradation can be quantified by luminescence techniques such as fluorescence, due to their high quantum yield [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and relatively easy analysis, since fluorescence methods do not require extensive pretreatment of the sample and can be used with conventional instrumentation (spectrofluorometer).</p><p>One of the compounds used as model in studies of PAHs degradation by microorganisms is anthracene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon of three rings, which has been listed as one of the priority environmental pollutants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. There is insufficient information to classify the anthracene as a substance that causes cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/priority.htm">http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/priority.htm</ext-link>) but causes concern due to the fact that their structure is resemblant to carcinogenic PAHs such as benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]anthracene [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, anthracene is usually used as a PAH model in studies of degradation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Traditional fluorescence collects a spectrum by scanning the excitation wavelength (<italic>&#955;</italic>
<sub>exc</sub>) while the emission wavelength is fixed (<italic>&#955;</italic>
<sub>em</sub>) (excitation spectrum). The emission spectrum is obtained in a similar manner; in this case, the excitation wavelength is constant (<italic>&#955;</italic>
<sub>exc</sub>), and the emission wavelength is scanned (<italic>&#955;</italic>
<sub>em</sub>). This method is known as excitation-emission fluorescence or excitation fluorescence and emission fluorescence. Both techniques are extensively used for individual PAHs analysis due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, speed, and relatively low cost [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This fluorescence method is not useful in the multicomponent analysis of PAHs because these compounds have similar structures and there is overlapping of the spectral bands, which are generally wide [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Synchronous fluorescence is another method of fluorescence spectroscopy that emerged in 1971 [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In one of its variants, the excitation and emission monochromators are scanned simultaneously with a constant &#916;<italic>&#955;</italic> between them. It has been reported that this technique increases the selectivity (the broad excitation-emission fluorescence bands are better defined) and maintains the high sensitivity [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], resulting in the possibility of analysing multicomponent samples (which surpasses conventional excitation-emission fluorescence method). This is the main advantage and the reason for its increasing popularity.</p><p>The bioremediation of PAHs contaminated environments is possible with halotolerant or alkalitolerant actinomycetes such as<italic> Arthrobacter crystallopoietes</italic>,<italic> Arthrobacter arilaitensis</italic>,<italic> Micrococcus</italic> sp.,<italic> Dietzia</italic> sp., and<italic> Rhodococcus</italic> sp. [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there are no reports about the use of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes (polyextremophile microorganisms able to live in either the absence or presence of salt, and in presence of pH values in the range 8&#8211;11) which were able to grow in PAHs polluted environments. The use of these microorganisms in bioremediation processes is more convenient because unlike halophilic or alkalophilic ones (which grow at a specific NaCl and pH value), haloalkalitolerant grow within a range of NaCl and pH.</p><p>A general method for studying the PAHs bioremediation capacity of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes is by preparing culture media containing PAHs and measuring the residual anthracene concentration in the cultures, by fluorescence, for instance, at different times. One of the culture media used to grow bacteria, when fluorescence measurements are going to be carried out, is the minimal salt medium (MSM) because it is considered a transparent medium from the fluorescence point of view [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, these haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes require NaCl concentration for growing, and it is already known that fluorescence signal is affected by the salinity of the sample regardless of the fluorescence method employed.</p><p>The main question of this work is as follows: Would it be adequate to use excitation fluorescence, emission fluorescence, or synchronous fluorescence to study the biodegrading capacity of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes requiring high NaCl concentration for their growth (halotolerant bacteria)? And the objective is carrying out a comparative study based on the sensitivity, linearity, and detection limits of the excitation, emission, and synchronous fluorescence methods during the quantification of the residual anthracene concentration from haloalkalitolerant cultures in order to establish the most proper fluorescence method to study the PAHs biodegrading capacity of these kind of bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Strains</title><p>Seven strains of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes from soda soils were studied.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> also displays the signals of the 22.5&#8201;ng/mL anthracene standard solutions prepared from ANTH-0.5%, ANTH-3%, and ANTH-10%. The only difference among these solutions is the NaCl concentration (%) present. If there is no effect of the NaCl concentration on the excitation fluorescence signal, it is expected that there are no differences in the (i) shape, (ii) position, and (iii) intensity of the bands from these solutions.</p><p>(i) Shape: this parameter in the three excitation spectra was maintained. (ii) Position: the lower wavelength bands (252&#8201;nm, 294&#8201;nm, 324&#8201;nm, and 340&#8201;nm) coincide in position for the three solutions. The bands at higher wavelength are slightly shifted (taking as reference the 0.5% spectrum); 358&#8201;nm band is present in the 0.5% and 3% NaCl media but is shifted to 352&#8201;nm in the 10% NaCl medium. The 376&#8201;nm band appears in the 0.5% medium; in the 3% medium, it is located at 378&#8201;nm, and in the 10% medium, it appears at 374&#8201;nm. (iii) Intensity: anthracene bands in 0.5% are more intense than those in 3%, and both are much more intense than those in 10% (340&#8201;nm band in 10% NaCl is 50% less intense than that in 0.5% NaCl).</p><p>To quantify anthracene in saline solutions the 340&#8201;nm band is very convenient because its position is not shifted with salinity. However, high %NaCl reduces band intensity; therefore the final selection depends on the concentration to measure and the background signal. In this work, to quantify anthracene by excitation fluorescence, the 340&#8201;nm band was used for samples in 0.5% and 3% of NaCl and the 378&#8201;nm band was employed for samples in 10% NaCl.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Selection of the Emission Band for Quantifying Anthracene by Emission Fluorescence</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> presents the emission spectra corresponding to the same samples presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, all excited at 340&#8201;nm. As in the previous case, the (i) shape, (ii) position, and (iii) intensity of the band spectra are analysed. (i) There are no changes in the shape of the emission spectra; this means that the number of emission bands is the same in all spectra. (ii) There is not shifting in the anthracene emission bands in the 0.5% and 3% NaCl media. The three emission maxima are at 381&#8201;nm, 401&#8201;nm, and 425&#8201;nm. The position of these maxima is shifted in the 10% NaCl medium, the maxima are at 385&#8201;nm, 403&#8201;nm, and 419&#8201;nm. (iii) Band intensities are similar for anthracene solutions prepared in 0.5% and 3% NaCl media (425&#8201;nm &#8810; 381&#8201;nm &lt; 401&#8201;nm) but different for the 10% media (385&#8201;nm &lt; 403&#8201;nm &#8810; 419&#8201;nm).</p><p>The ideal situation for quantifying anthracene by emission fluorescence is to choose an emission <italic>&#955;</italic> at which the matrix components have little or no emission and the anthracene has an intense band. Therefore, the quantification of anthracene in the ANTH-0.5% and ANTH-3% media was performed with the 401&#8201;nm band, which was only slightly affected by the matrix signal and had a good intensity. In the case of samples in ANTH-10% the band used was 419&#8201;nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6. Selection of Emission Bands for Anthracene Quantification by Synchronous Fluorescence</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> displays the synchronous fluorescence spectra with &#916;<italic>&#955;</italic> = 150&#8201;nm of the 180&#8201;ng/mL anthracene standard solution prepared from CC-0.5%, CC-3%, and CC-10%, as well as the net background spectra. It can be observed that the shape of the spectrum of the anthracene from CC-0.5% and CC-3% standard solutions is very similar but varies in the CC-10% solution. The first two spectra have more bands than the last one. Band intensity in this fluorescence method behaves in contrast to fluorescence excitation and emission. In this case, band intensity increases with the increasing NaCl concentration.</p><p>In contrast with the excitation and emission fluorescence spectra of anthracene, which are well known, the synchronous fluorescence spectrum varies with the instrumental conditions used during acquisition (&#916;<italic>&#955;</italic>), and some bands are influenced in a greater or lesser degree by the solvent. In order to determine the bands that proportionally change and do not vary their position with the anthracene concentration, the synchronous fluorescence spectra of the standard solutions prepared from CC-0.5%, CC-3%, and CC-10% were graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> it can be noticed that the 22.5&#8201;ng/mL anthracene standard solutions in the three media under study have the 250&#8201;nm band, but it gradually decreases until disappearance with an increasing anthracene concentration, suggesting that it is associated with or very influenced by the medium. Given that the only difference between the three ANTH media is the NaCl concentration, then the intensity of this band is influenced by the medium salinity. Our initial idea was to use this band for quantification, because Cai et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated that at &#916;<italic>&#955;</italic> = 150&#8201;nm it is optimal for obtaining good sensitivity and selectivity. In our case however, the 250&#8201;nm band was not useful probably because although our matrix is aqueous like the one they used, it is not exactly the same.</p><p>A decision had to be made regarding which signal of the synchronous fluorescence spectrum to use for the anthracene quantification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4(a)</xref> shows bands at 296&#8201;nm, 300&#8201;nm, 306&#8201;nm, 310&#8201;nm, and 314&#8201;nm which correspond to anthracene concentrations (ng/mL) 22.5, 45, 90, 180, and 360, respectively. They could be considered shifting of the same band, but there is not proportionality between band intensity and anthracene concentration; therefore they should be associated with the solvent. This same effect is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref> with the 300&#8201;nm band corresponding to the 22.5&#8201;ng/mL concentration, which shifts with the increased anthracene concentration to reach a value of 316&#8201;nm for 360&#8201;ng/mL. This feature is also observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref> with the 294&#8201;nm band, corresponding to the 22.5&#8201;ng/mL concentration, which shifts as the anthracene concentration increases up to 308&#8201;nm at a concentration of 360&#8201;ng/mL. None of these bands are useful for quantifying anthracene.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a band at 322&#8211;324&#8201;nm in the three media under study; this band does not shift with an increasing anthracene concentration, and its intensity varies proportionally with the concentration. Therefore, this band is useful for anthracene quantification. In the spectra corresponding to the ANTH-0.5% and ANTH-3% media, the same behaviour described previously is observed with the bands at 340&#8201;nm, 358&#8201;nm, and 378&#8201;nm. The spectra of anthracene in the ANTH-10% medium do not present the bands at 340&#8201;nm and 378&#8201;nm, and the 358&#8201;nm band is shifted to 352&#8201;nm. This difference between the spectra is attributed to the different concentrations of NaCl present in the three media. As the 340&#8201;nm band is most intense for the ANTH-0.5% and ANTH-3% media and the 322&#8201;nm band is most intense for the ANTH-10% medium these bands were chosen for anthracene quantification by synchronous fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7. Sensitivity, Linearity, and Detection Limit</title><p>The absorbance measured for all anthracene standard solutions at their respective excitation and emission wavelengths were in the range 0.041&#8211;0.066, and the ratio <italic>F</italic>
<sub>obs</sub>/<italic>F</italic>
<sub>corr</sub> was 0.9 for the three fluorescence methods. We do not attribute this attenuation in the fluorescence signal to an inner-filter effect because the correction factor was the same in all solutions, and this value changes in the inner-filter effect, being higher at higher concentrations [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, our calibration curves were linear in the whole concentration range. The maxima absorbance value was slightly over 0.06, being the inner-filter effect negligible. The corrected fluorescence values from the anthracene standard solutions give a calibration curve as linear as the one obtained from the observed values, demonstrating an attenuation effect but not inner-filter effect. Since this attenuation effect is present in all samples equally, it does not affect quantification.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref> shows the calibration curves obtained from a weighted regression using the least square model. The sensitivities are the slope of the curves, and ideally they should have the same value for the ANTH-0.5%, ANTH-3%, and ANTH-10% media, within the same fluorescence method. Sensitivities values were always different for the three media in the three analysed methods. This result corroborates the salinity effect on the fluorescence mechanism. Among the methods, excitation fluorescence is 1.1&#8211;1.3 times more sensitive than emission, and 22&#8211;52 times more than synchronous fluorescence. These results agree with other studies reporting that excitation fluorescence and emission fluorescence are extremely sensitive and that synchronous fluorescence is less sensitive but more selective [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our case, however, synchronous fluorescence was not more selective, because band definition was better in excitation and emission fluorescence.</p><p>From the sensitivities values, it seems that excitation fluorescence is the one less affected by salinity. The sensitivity reduction from ANTH-0.5% to ANTH-10% was 20%. In emission fluorescence, this reduction was 30%; and unexpectedly in synchronous the sensitivity value was not reduced but increased in 188%.</p><p>Calibration curves for excitation and emission fluorescence do not have statistically significant intercept at 95%, meaning that there is not a matrix effect on the analyte fluorescence signal. This is a very important point for a quantification method. In synchronous fluorescence however, the intercept was always statistically significant, meaning that at zero analyte concentration there is a fluorescence signal attributed to the matrix. Therefore in this study under our conditions the matrix, unlike excitation and emission fluorescence, has effect on the synchronous signal. The intercept was not constant for the three ANTH media, indicating that NaCl concentration is also contributing to matrix effect.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref> also shows the determination coefficient and the linear regression coefficient. The first one indicates how well the model fits the data. In our case, the model is a straight line. It is a measure that allows us to determine how certain one can be in making predictions from a certain model/graph. The second one measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, both coefficients are higher than 0.997, indicating that a straight line is a very adequate model to fit our data (anthracene concentration<italic> versus</italic> fluorescence intensity) for the three fluorescence methods in the concentration range studied and that this linear relationship is strong and positive (increasing the concentration increases the fluorescence signal). In addition, the dilution factor among the standard solutions employed in the calibration curves (1&#8201;:&#8201;16, 1&#8201;:&#8201;8, 1&#8201;:&#8201;4, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1.3) coincides with the reduction in the fluorescence intensity. Therefore, linearity is assured in the anthracene determination in all cases for all methods in the concentration range studied.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref> also shows the detection limits for anthracene in the three media studied by the three fluorescence methods. The detection limit is an order of magnitude lower in excitation and emission fluorescence than in synchronous fluorescence because the net maximal matrix signal does not vary in intensity in the three methods at the wavelengths selected for quantification (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), while the anthracene sensitivity decreases between 20 and 50 times from excitation-emission fluorescence to synchronous fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><title>3.8.

A bivariate analysis showed statistical differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the fluorescence methods and for the strains. Statistical differences among strains mean that the biodegrading capacity of all these strains is not alike. Statistical differences among the methods indicate that the performance of the three fluorescence methods is not statistically similar. These differences are specifically between excitation and synchronous and emission and synchronous. There is not statistical difference between excitation and emission. Other reports have demonstrated that results obtained by excitation and emission fluorescence (in the PAHs determination) do not differ from results obtained by other techniques such as gas chromatography or HPLC [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>Fluorescence is a very convenient method to study PAHs biodegradation because it is simple, easy, fast, inexpensive, very sensitive, and reproducible. For these reasons fluorescence was our method of choice for studying the capabilities of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes for degrading PAHs. These bacteria require NaCl for growing; therefore our study was focussed to investigate the performance of excitation, emission, and synchronous fluorescence in the determination of anthracene in the presence of different NaCl concentrations in order to stablish the most proper fluorescence method to study the PAHs biodegrading properties of these bacteria.</p><p>Our results show that anthracene excitation fluorescence spectrum in MSM (called ANTH) does not change in shape, relative band intensity, or band position with the increasing %NaCl. The calibration curves for the three NaCl concentrations indicate that there is not background signal in the fluorescence response (equation does not have a statistically significant <italic>y</italic> intercept); the sensitivity is very high, and it is only reduced 20% from the medium containing 10% NaCl respective to the one with 0.5% NaCl; the straight line is a very good fitting model for the calibration curves (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.998); and fluorescence signal<italic> versus</italic> concentration is linear in the studied range (22.5&#8211;360&#8201;ng/mL). The inner-filter effect present in the fluorescence signal of the three calibration curves is negligible. The detection limit obtained, by using culture without anthracene as matrix background, is 11, 13, and 20&#8201;ng/mL for the media with 0.5%, 3%, and 10% NaCl, respectively.</p><p>In the case of the anthracene emission fluorescence spectra in MSM and different NaCl concentration, most of the features found in excitation fluorescence are similar with the following differences: the spectrum does not change in shape or band position but the relative band intensity changes, and the sensitivity is reduced 30% when NaCl concentration is increased from 0.5% to 10%.</p><p>The synchronous fluorescence spectra features of anthracene contained in MSM with different NaCl concentrations quite differ from the previous cases. The spectrum changes the shape and band position with the increasing NaCl concentration. The <italic>y</italic> intercept in the calibration curves was statistically significant; therefore at zero anthracene concentration there is a fluorescence signal most likely coming from the matrix. Unlike excitation and emission spectra where the sensitivity was reduced with the increasing NaCl concentration, in synchronous fluorescence the sensitivity was increased 188% when NaCl concentration was increased from 0.5% to 10%. This result clearly shows that, in this fluorescence method, under the conditions used in this work the anthracene signal is overestimated due to matrix contribution. Detection limits are worse than those from excitation and emission methods, being one order higher. Selectivity was not improved in the anthracene determination using &#916;<italic>&#955;</italic> = 150&#8201;nm, in comparison to excitation and emission fluorescence.</p><p>Despite the fact that the three fluorescence methods indicate anthracene biodegradation, the results described above demonstrated that synchronous fluorescence is not the most adequate method (among fluorescence methods) to determining anthracene in haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes cultures with NaCl concentrations as high as 10%, when &#916;<italic>&#955;</italic> = 150&#8201;nm is used. Although excitation and emission fluorescence behave very similarly, excitation fluorescence performs slightly better, being our proposed fluorescence method for determining the residual anthracene concentration present in cultures of haloalkalitolerant actinomycetes potentially degraders of PAHs, as long as standards and samples are prepared exactly in the same manner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance from the Secretary of Research and Advanced Studies of Universidad Aut&#243;noma del Estado de M&#233;xico (UAEMex) through the research grants: (i) &#8220;Estudio bioqu&#237;mico y molecular de actinomicetos presentes en suelos contaminados con hidrocarburos&#8221; 3690/2014/CID and (ii) the network &#8220;Microbiolog&#237;a y qu&#237;mica en las ciencias de la salud&#8221; 1039/2014RIF.
