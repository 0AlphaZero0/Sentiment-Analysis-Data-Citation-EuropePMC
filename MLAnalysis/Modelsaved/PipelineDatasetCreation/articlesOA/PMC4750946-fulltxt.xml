Weltevreden) is an emerging cause of diarrheal and invasive disease in humans residing in tropical regions. Despite the regional and international emergence of this <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar, relatively little is known about its genetic diversity, genomics or virulence potential in model systems. Here we used whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to define the phylogenetic structure of a diverse global selection of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 100 isolates demonstrated that the population of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden can be segregated into two main phylogenetic clusters, one associated predominantly with continental Southeast Asia and the other more internationally dispersed. Subcluster analysis suggested the local evolution of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden within specific geographical regions. Four of the isolates were sequenced using long read sequencing to produce high quality reference genomes. Phenotypic analysis in Hep-2 cells and in a murine infection model indicated that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden were significantly attenuated in these models compared to the classical <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium reference strain SL1344. Our work outlines novel insights into this important emerging pathogen and provides a baseline understanding for future research studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Organisms belonging to the species <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> are a major cause of infection globally. Such infections can be zoonotic in origin or transmitted between humans. One of the most notable features of the genus <italic>Salmonella</italic> is that the dominant serovars that cause human infections change over time, with new threats periodically emerging. These trends often go unnoticed and are underreported in low-income locations. There is good evidence that <italic>Salmonella</italic> Weltevreden is emerging (particularly in low-income countries in the tropics) as a significant cause of diarrhea and sometimes invasive bacterial disease in humans. However, little is known about the phylogenetic structure or virulence potential of this unstudied serovar. Here, we provide a detailed phylogenetic analysis of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden through whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools. We identify that specific phylogenetic clusters are associated with geographical regions, providing novel data regarding the global distribution of different clades and high quality reference genomes to facilitate future work. We additionally show that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden has a distinct virulence-associated phenotype in conventional laboratory <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity assays that will guide future investigations on this serovar.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The PhD of CM was supported by the Novartis Institute.

Typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> are typically adapted to cause systemic disease in humans e.g. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<italic>S</italic>. Typhi) the cause of the typhoid fever [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, NTS are more frequently, but not exclusively, associated with localized gastroenteritis and are more promiscuous and zoonotic than typhoidal serovars, and can infect multiple hosts e.g. <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genetically, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> is regarded as a broad and ancient species; different serovars/isolates can vary by 100,000s of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and contain a variable array of genomic islands and prophages [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Further, many <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars are monomorphic or clonal [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], however, there can be significant genetic diversity within a specific serovar e.g. <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and generally studies on genetic diversity within a particular serovar are scarce, particularly using newer high-throughput approaches such as whole genome sequencing.</p><p>Most human NTS infections are commonly regarded as having a zoonotic source, at least in developed countries [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some serovars, such as <italic>S</italic>. Cholerasuis, are predominantly associated with a particular mammalian host (pigs in the case of <italic>S</italic>. Cholerasuis) whereas others are more promiscuous. Indeed, the sources of many outbreaks of human salmonellosis are difficult to trace and often remain unidentified. In cases where the source is known, these have commonly been associated with raw or undercooked meat, eggs, vegetables or contamination has occurring during processing [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, the frequency of outbreaks associated with particular serovars can vary in terms of source, incidence and geographical distribution. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Weltevreden (<italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden) is being increasingly reported as a cause of diarrheal disease in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This little described serovar is emerging as a significant food-borne pathogen in Asia where it is reported to be associated with fish or aquatic food production systems [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden has also been reported in Europe; an outbreak of diarrhea in Scandinavia was linked to alfalfa sprouts contaminated with <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been used to define structure within various populations of bacterial pathogens, including some of the key serovars of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Here, we report a phylogenetic analysis of a global collection of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden; additionally providing complete reference genomes to facilitate future analysis.

For each genome, the <italic>de novo</italic> short-read assembler Velvet [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (1.2.09) was used to generate multiple assemblies by varying the k-mer size between 66% and 90% of the read length using Velvet Optimiser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tseemann/VelvetOptimiser">https://github.com/tseemann/VelvetOptimiser</ext-link>). From these, the assembly with the highest N50 was chosen. Contigs were excluded from the assembly if they were shorter than the target fragment size (400 bases). A scaffold assembly of the contigs was built by iteratively running SSPACE [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (version 2.0) beginning with the contigs which were predicted to map next to each other. The reads were then mapped again to the scaffold assembly and perfect pairs were excluded. Next, gaps identified as one or more N&#8217;s, were targeted for closure by running 120 iterations of GapFiller [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (version 1.11), using a decreasing read evidence threshold. Finally, the reads were aligned back to the improved assembly using SMALT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/">https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/</ext-link>) and a set of statistics was produced for assessing the quality of the assembly. PacBio raw read data for each sample was manually assembled using the PacBio SMRT analysis pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis/">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis/</ext-link>) (2.2). The raw unfinished assemblies all produced a single non-circular chromosome plus some other small contigs, some of which were plasmids or unresolved assembly variants. If the ends of a contig overlapped, they were identified as candidates for circularization using a protocol recommended by PacBio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/Bioinformatics-Training/wiki/Circularizing-and-trimming">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/Bioinformatics-Training/wiki/Circularizing-and-trimming</ext-link>). A virtual break was manually introduced into the chromosome sequence at the <italic>thrA</italic> gene, to match the starting point of other published <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> references. Plasmids were also artificially broken at the replication gene. The sequences were then circularized using the genome assembler, Minimus [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (version 2 part of AMOS version 3.1), which removed the overlapping sequence. Quiver was then used by the circularized sequence and the raw reads to correct errors in the circularized region. As high quality short read data from Illumina were available, ICORN2 (version 0.97) was used to correct minor errors in the assembly, providing a very high quality reference sequence, as assessed by REAPR [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] assembly was subsequently annotated with Prokka [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The raw SNPs were then passed into BCFtools and were filtered into a higher quality set. A virtual pseudo-genome was then constructed by substituting the base call at each site (variant and non-variant) into the reference genome. For a SNP to be called the depth had to be greater than 4 reads, and be present on both strands, with at least 75% of reads containing the SNP at that position. The mapping quality had to be greater than 30 (less than 1 in 1000 probability that the mapping was incorrect). If a SNP failed to meet these criteria it is substituted with an &#8216;N&#8217;. Insertions with respect to the reference genome were ignored. Deletions with respect to the reference genome were filled up with &#8216;N&#8217; characters in the pseudo-genome in order to keep it aligned and at the same length relative to the reference genome. Heterozygous sites were turned into homozygous alleles by selecting the first allele in the BCF file. However, if the first allele was an insertion or deletion (indel), the second allele in the BCF file was taken. If the second allele was also an indel, a single &#8216;N&#8217; character was used. All of the pseudo-genomes were then merged into a single multi-FASTA alignment file, including the reference sequence.</p><p>Since the median fragment size for the isolates sequenced on Illumina was 400 bases, the reference genome was blasted against itself (2.2.31) in order to identify repeats larger than 400 bases. All bases falling within these regions were replaced with &#8216;N&#8217; in the multi-FASTA alignment file and therefore not included in the analysis. The filtered multi-FASTA alignment was then checked for recombination using Gubbins [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (1.3.4). Five iterations of Gubbins were run and in each iteration a phylogenetic tree was constructed with RAxML [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with the GAMMA GTR model, and internal ancestral sequences were inferred using FastML [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (version 3.1). Recombinant sequences were detected and a multi-FASTA alignment with the recombinant regions was masked out. This data was then used as the input to the next iteration. RAxML with 100 bootstraps was then run over the final multi-FASTA alignment to provide a high quality phylogenetic tree in newick format.</p><p>The population structure of the phylogenetic tree was validated using a Bayesian statistical approach. Hierarchical BAPS [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (version 6.0) was used to perform a hierarchical clustering of the multi-FASTA alignment to reveal a nested genetic population structure. Once the clusters were identified, SNPs, which uniquely defined each of the clusters (in 100% of isolates in a cluster) were extracted using BioPericles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/BioPericles">https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/BioPericles</ext-link>) (version 0.1.0). Exploiting the multi-FASTA alignment with recombination removed, a consensus sequence was generated for each cluster and any bases which varied or contained missing data were replaced by &#8216;N&#8217;. The consensus sequences were merged into a single multi-FASTA alignment file and SNP locations were identified using snp sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp_sites">https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp_sites</ext-link>) (version 2.0.1). Each SNP was then annotated using the reference annotation (10259) GFF3 file. An annotated VCF file was produced with VEP syntax [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] listing the type of change (intergenic/ synonymous/ nonsynonymous), the amino acid (before and after) and the amino acid position in the gene, along with the coordinates of each SNP relative to the reference genome, the reference base, the allele base and the presence and absence of the variant in each cluster. These cluster defining SNPs were then further annotated with the functional annotation of the gene they occurred in.</p><p>Antimicrobial resistance was predicted from each sample&#8217;s raw sequencing reads using ARIBA [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (version 0.4.1), which performs antibiotic resistance identification by assembly and alignment. A manually curated input database of known resistance genes in FASTA format was used as input along with the paired end sequencing reads in FASTQ format. The resistance gene sequences were first clustered using CD-hit [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (4.6). The raw reads were then aligned to a representative sequence for each resistance cluster. Reads which mapped and their complimentary strand equivalents were extracted. A local assembly was performed on the reads for each cluster (version 3.5), where the resistance genes for the cluster were used as &#8216;untrusted contigs&#8217;. This generates a candidate gene along with sequence on either side if the gene is present in the reads. MUMmer [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (3.23) was then used to identify differences between the assembled contig and the known resistance gene and the results were reported along with any variation found and quality flags. These were manually inspected and samples with 100% matches to resistance genes and with a complete open reading frame were flagged as being potentially candidates for visual inspection.</p><p>A pan genome was constructed using Roary [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (version 3.2.5) from the annotated assemblies of the sample set with a percentage protein identity of 95%. The protein sequences were first extracted and iteratively pre-clustered with cd-hit (version 4.6) down to 98% identity. An all against all blast (version 2.2.31) was performed on the remaining non-clustered sequences and a single representative sequence from each cd-hit cluster was selected. The data were used by MCL [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (version 11&#8211;294) to cluster the sequences. The preclusters and the MCL clusters were merged and paralogs were split by inspecting the conserved gene neighborhood around each sequence (5 genes on either side). Each sequence for each cluster was independently aligned using PRANK [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (version 0.140603) and combined to form a multi-FASTA alignment of the core genes.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Hep-2 cells invasion assay</title><p>To facilitate the analysis of invasion assays, <italic>S</italic>.

Weltevreden. Additionally, four reference genomes (and corresponding reference strains) that will be of value for further genetic and genomic work on this increasing important serovar were generated. Our analysis revealed that the <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden genome is larger than those of many other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> serovars with a mean size over five million basepairs. Much of this additional genetic material was attributed to the accessory genome, where complete prophage and additional prophage-related elements were found to be common. Another little known serovar&#8212;<italic>S</italic>. Elisabethville, was found to be phylogenetically closest <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar to <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden. Remarkably, <italic>S</italic>. Elisabethville shares core serological properties with <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden, but <italic>S</italic>. Elisabethville is not a common pathogen in humans. It will be interesting to see if this related serovar emerges in humans in the future, as has been the case for <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden.</p><p>Our analysis additional found that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden is monophyletic serovar with two major phylogenetic clusters consisting of a largely &#8220;Continental&#8221; isolates and &#8220;Island&#8221; isolates. Thus, there is evidence of a significant degree of geographical structuring within the <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden population. Some geographical clustering is also detectable within the subphylogeny, suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden continues to evolve within a specific geographical region, as opposed to frequently spreading from one location to another. Geographical subclustering has been detected in other serovars, including <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium ST313 clades within sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These data suggest that after introduction <italic>Salmonella</italic> clades can become established in a specific environment or a human population where they can start to persist and evolve in an isolated manner. We found that 112 SNPs were cluster-specific; these could be of value for future epidemiological tracking studies. For example, it may be possible to determine if these SNPs can be used map potential transmission routes within and between different human and animal populations. Previous links have been described between seafood and <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden causing human disease [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Here, some of the cluster-associated (or private SNPs) could be exploitable in SNP-based assays for the rapid identification of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden isolates in the field. Such approaches have been developed for other <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovars, including <italic>S</italic>. Typhi, for the urban and international tracking of typhoid fever [<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004446.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>It is meaningful that the phylogenetic structure of the <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden sequenced here did not correlate with date of isolation, disease type or source (environment, animal, human). Therefore, it was not possible to link particular genotypes to disease syndromes. The inability to link genotype to human disease is suggestive, implying that factors such as infectious dose, host susceptibility and immune status or the local environment may be influencing the patterns of disease. More thorough epidemiological studies of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden are required to identify environment-to-human, animal-to-human, or human-to-human transmission routes. Notably, AMR was found not to play a big influence in shaping the molecular epidemiology of with <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden, as AMR genes were found in very few isolates. The relatively rare AMR isolates harbored several plasmids comprised of structures that have been previously described in other Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden clearly has the capacity to acquire AMR genes, however they were rare. We speculate that the lack of AMR genes in this relatively submissive genome is related to the ecology of the organism, the it will be important to maintain surveillance on the serovar in order to actively detect any increasing AMR trends.</p><p>Phenotypic characterization of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden showed an overall attenuated virulence potential in different models of disease when compared to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium SL1344. <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden isolates were significantly less invasive in terms of their ability to enter and replicate in Hep-2 cells. Similar to <italic>in vitro</italic> observations in Hep-2 cells, <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden isolates were moderately attenuated in both the mouse in both intravenous and oral streptomycin treated infection models, than <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium SL1344. In fact, mice intravenously infected with <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden were able to survive four days post infection. However, despite this attenuation in Hep-2 cells and mice <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden can clearly cause significant human disease and other approaches will be required to define virulence mechanisms associated with this emerging pathogen.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time we have studied the phylogenetic structure and aimed to define the virulence potential of <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden, an emerging cause of <italic>Salmonella</italic> induced infections in tropical regions. Our data show that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden is complex serovar and whilst we did observe geographical clustering this pathogen appears to have a more permeable genome that many other <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The acquisition of horizontally acquired DNA appears to be the main evolutionary driving force within the serovar, however AMR genes are rare. We additionally can show that <italic>S</italic>. Weltevreden has a distinct virulence-associated phenotype in conventional laboratory <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence assays, which clearly suggests attenuation in comparison to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium SL1344. Our study provides new insights into this organism and will serve as a platform for future research on this emerging <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004446.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The strains and sequence accession numbers of the <italic>S</italic>.
