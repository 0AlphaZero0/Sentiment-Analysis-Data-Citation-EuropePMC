To obtain some hints involved in sex expression and provide the basis for further insight into the molecular mechanisms of castor plant sex determination, we performed DGE analysis to investigate differences between the transcriptomes of apices and racemes derived from female (JXBM0705P) and monoecious (JXBM0705M) lines. A total of 18 DGE libraries were constructed from the apices and racemes of a wild monoecious line and its isogenic female derivative at three stages of apex development, in triplicate. Approximately 5.7 million clean tags per library were generated and mapped to the reference castor genome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that identical dynamic changes of gene expression were indicated in monoecious and female apical bud during its development from vegetation to reproduction, with more genes expressed at the raceme formation and infant raceme stages compare to the early leaf bud stage. More than 3000 of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in <italic>Ricinus</italic> apices at three developmental stages between two different sex types. A number of DEGs involved in hormone response and biosynthesis, such as auxin response and transport, transcription factors, signal transduction, histone demethylation/methylation, programmed cell death, and pollination, putatively associated with sex expression and reproduction were discovered, and the selected DEGs showed consistent expression between qRT-PCR validation and the DGE patterns. Most of those DEGs were suppressed at the early leaf stage in buds of the mutant, but then activated at the following transition stage (5-7-leaf stage) of buds in the mutant, and ultimately, the number of up-regulated DEGs was equal to that of down-regulation in the small raceme of the mutant. In this study, a large number of DEGs and some suggestions involved in sex expression and reproduction were discovered using DGE analysis, which provides large information and valuable hints for next insights into the molecular mechanism of sex determination. It is useful for other further studies in <italic>Ricinus</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>castor bean</kwd><kwd>digital expression profile</kwd><kwd>pistillate</kwd><kwd>sex determination</kwd><kwd>transcriptome analysis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="84"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="9548"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Castor (<italic>Ricinus communis</italic> L.), an important industrial oilseed crop belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, grows as an indeterminate annual or perennial depending on climate and soil types in tropical, sub-tropical, and warm temperate regions (Anjani, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Because of the high fatty acid content in its seeds (more than 45%) and the rich ricinoleic acid content in its oil (80&#8211;90%), castor is a versatile raw material in industrial chemistry: for example, castor oil can be used for the production of lubricants, nylon, hydraulic and brake fluids, paints, dyes, coatings, inks, cold resistant plastics, waxes and polishes, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and biodiesel (Jeong and Park, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Halilu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To date, several high-yield varieties and hybrids have been developed (Baldanzi and Pugliesi, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Amaral, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Savy Filho, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Pranavi et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), but to meet the tremendous global demand for castor oil, cultivars with even higher yield and oil content are needed (Anjani, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, hybrid breeding for improved yield and high purity in <italic>Ricinus</italic> is still constrained by the genetic instability of females and the unknown mechanism of sex expression.</p><p>In castor plant, the standard type of inflorescence is gradient monoecious raceme (female flowers at the apex and staminate flowers on the lower portion) (Shifriss, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>). However, a wide variation of inflorescence patterns occurs in natural cultivation, including other kinds of racemes such as strictly pistillate (bearing only female flowers), male (only staminate flowers), apically interspersed (monoecism with interspersed male flowers in the apical pistillate region), and entirely interspersed (female and male flowers uniformly interspersed) (George and Shifriss, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). In addition, inflorescence setting with one or a few hermaphrodite flowers occurs occasionally (Jacob, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>). Accordingly, for castor individuals, there are several sex models, including normal monoecism, sex reversal, interspersed sexuality, and strictly female (Shifriss, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Jacob and Atsmon, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>; George and Shifriss, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>).</p><p>In the past, scientists focused on the sexuality of <italic>Ricinus</italic> to interpret the inheritance and instability of sex variation. Shifriss (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>) described the sex tendency, sex patterns, inheritance and reversion of <italic>Ricinus</italic>, and proposed a hypothesis: Gene <italic>F</italic> controls a genetically stable series of sex variants ranging from female (<italic>f</italic>) to strongly male inbreds, and an unknown factor could affect male tendency, sex reversion, and sex instability by suppressing gene <italic>F</italic> or mutating itself. Later, he described sex variations of <italic>Ricinus</italic> in two genetic systems, which he tentatively named as &#8220;conventional&#8221; and &#8220;unconventional&#8221; (Shifriss, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>). Monoecious variants and rare recessive female mutants were ascribed to the conventional form, sex reversals and non-reverted females belonged to the unconventional form. Monoecism is governed by two major groups of genes: qualitative genes that determine flower type, and polygenes regulating gradient differentiation and racial differences in sex tendency. In addition, gene modifiers such as <italic>id</italic> and <italic>th</italic> were also considered to affect the pattern of sex differentiation. He postulated that genetic instability of spontaneous mutants, so-called position-effect variegation, may result from a rearrangement undergoing two basic kinds of genetic changes: mutation into new hereditary potentialities, and transformation between an &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;inactive&#8221; state. Moreover, further evidence regarding the former findings (Shifriss, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>) revealed that femaleness transmits more effectively to progeny through female inflorescences of sex-reversal plants than through reverted monoecious inflorescences of the same plant (Jacob and Atsmon, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). With regard to interspersed sexuality, Shifriss (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>) believed that the interspersed pattern of sex differentiation is determined by hereditary factors for femaleness and genes for interspersed staminate flowers (<italic>id</italic>). George and Shifriss (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>) investigated more deeply into the inheritance of interspersed inflorescence patterns, and concluded that the level of expressivity of interspersed staminate flowers depends on the dosage of two independent genes (<italic>id1</italic> and <italic>id2</italic>), their loci, and the environment.</p><p>In addition to genetic regulation, sex expression or variation of <italic>Ricinus</italic> is simultaneously affected to some degree by fluctuations in the environment, including temperature, vegetative activity, nutrition level, pruning, and seasonal variations (Shifriss, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>), as well as by plant hormones (Shifriss, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>; Philipos and Narayanaswamy, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Kumar and Rao, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Mohan Ram and Sett, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Varkey and Nigam, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Tan et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Despite a great deal of progress, the hypotheses described above are vulnerable in the absence of cytological information, and the molecular mechanisms of sex variation and genes determining sex expression in <italic>Ricinus</italic> remain poorly understood.</p><p>Genome-wide analyses have dramatically improved the efficiency of gene discovery. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide new approaches for global measurements of gene expression. Due to its high efficiency and low cost, NGS has become an attractive alternative method for more efficient study of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome (Oshlack et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; McIntyre et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Many plant species have benefited from this technology, and large-scale genome sequences and transcriptome data are available in both model and non-model species (Goff et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Yu et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Kaplan et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ramsey et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Huang et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Cucumber, as a model plant for study of floral sex expression, its sex-controlling genes, sex-modifying plant hormones, and interactions with environmental conditions are clearly understood (Galun, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>; Trebitsh et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Malepszy and Niemirowicz-Szczytt, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Yin and Quinn, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Yamasaki et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Kater et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Mibus and Tatlioglu, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>), and a number of candidate genes required for sex determination have been identified by transcriptome profile analysis (Guo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In <italic>Ricinus</italic>, however, a gap still exists between interpreting the molecular mechanism of sex expression and isolating the sex-determining genes. The complete sequencing of the castor bean genome (Chan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) provides tremendous opportunities for genomic analysis and facilitates identification of genes of biological interest. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis, a powerful and recently developed tool, is based on ultra-high-throughput sequencing of millions of signatures in the genome, allowing identification of specific genes and direct quantitation of transcript abundance (Bentley, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Hong et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). DGE analysis detects gene expression more quantitatively than microarray assays ('t Hoen et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) while providing similar assessments of relative transcript abundance. In comparison to high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), DGE more accurately detects expression differences in poorly expressed genes and exhibits much less transcript length bias (Hong et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Thus, DGE has been widely utilized to discriminate differences in transcriptional responses among different tissues and organs in plants in the contexts of biotic and abiotic stress, metabolite biosynthesis, and developmental biology (Tian et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Guo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Yu et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed DGE using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to investigate the differences between the transcriptomes of apices and racemes from female (JXBM0705P) and monoecism (JXBM0705M) of <italic>Ricinus</italic>. In an attempt to get some hints associated with sex expression in <italic>Ricinus</italic>, we conducted (after high-throughput tag sequencing) an integrated bioinformatic analysis to identify expression patterns of genes and critical pathways in the female and monoecious lines at three stages of apex development. Assessment of the changes in gene expression between female and monoecious apices yielded sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes associated with sex expression. Based on these differentially regulated genes (DEGs), some DEGs putatively related to sex expression were selected to confirm by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Thus, comparison of gene expression patterns at three developmental stages of monoecious and female apices provides important hints for further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Ricinus</italic> sex variation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Seeds of nearly isogenic monoecious (JXBM0705M) and female (JXBM0705P) castor lines were kindly provided by Professor Huang (Castor Oil Research Institute of Jiaxiang, Zibo, Shandong Province). JXBM0705M is a wild monoecious line that bears male and female flowers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and JXBM0705P, a pistillate line that bears only female flowers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), was developed by consecutively selecting spontaneous mutants of JXBM0705M. Seeds were sown and cultivated in the Yangluo experimental field of the Oil Crops Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, under standard field conditions, from spring to autumn of 2012. A previous study revealed that apices are leaf buds prior to the 5-leaf stage (i.e., five fully expanded leaves) and change to floral buds during the 6&#8211;9-leaf stage (Wang et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). According to this criterion, and combined with anatomical observation of a series of apical buds of the cultivar, in order to investigate global changes in the transcriptome during the development of buds from leaf apices to racemes, apical buds at the 3&#8211;4-leaf stage (ABML1 for monoecism and ABPL1 for female) and the 5&#8211;7-leaf stage (ABML2 for monoecism and ABPL2 for female) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and small racemes 2&#8211;3 cm in size (RML for monoecism and RPL for female, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), were collected in triplicate to construct 18 DGE libraries.

RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and stored at &#8722;70&#176;C. The quality of total RNA was checked on 1% agarose gels, and purity was evaluated by OD260/280 ratio using a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). Concentration and integrity of RNA were verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The extracted RNA was prepared for next sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR validation.</p><p>A total of 8 &#956;g of total RNA was subjected to oligo (dT) magnetic bead adsorption to purify mRNA. Oligo (dT) was then used as a primer for the synthesis of first- and second-strand cDNA. The 5&#8242;-ends of tags could be generated using two types of endonucleases, namely, <italic>Nla</italic>III or <italic>Dpn</italic>II. Bead-bound cDNA was subsequently digested with the restriction enzyme <italic>Nla</italic>III, which recognizes and cleaves CATG sites. Fragments other than 3&#8242;-cDNA fragments connected to oligo (dT) beads were washed away, and Illumina adaptor 1 was ligated to the sticky 5&#8242;-end of the digested bead-bound cDNA fragments. The junction of the Illumina adaptor 1 and the CATG site constitutes the recognition site for <italic>Mme</italic>I, an endonuclease with separate recognition and cleavage sites. <italic>Mme</italic>I cleaves 17 bp downstream of the CATG site, yielding tags with adaptor 1. After removing 3&#8242; fragments by magnetic bead precipitation, adaptor 2 was ligated to the 3&#8242;-ends of tags, yielding tags with different adaptors at both ends to form a tag library. After linear PCR amplification, fragments were purified by PAGE gel electrophoresis. During the quality control steps, the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and ABI Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System were used for quantitation and quality verification of the sample library. Finally, the library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis and mapping of DGE tags</title><p>Millions of raw 49 bp sequences were generated. Image analysis, base calling, generation of raw tags, and tag counting were performed using the Illumina pipeline ('t Hoen et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Prior to mapping of tags to the reference database, empty tags (i.e., those with no tag sequence between the adaptors), adaptors, low-quality tags (tags containing one or more unknown nucleotides &#8220;N&#8221;), and tags with a copy number of 1 were removed from raw sequences to obtain clean tags.</p><p>To evaluate the normality of the entire DGE dataset, the distribution of clean tag expression was analyzed. The saturation analysis of the 18 libraries was also performed to estimate whether sequencing depth was sufficient for transcriptome coverage. To identify the gene expression patterns in apical buds and small racemes of two Ricinus lines, all clean tags were annotated by mapping to the castor genome (Chan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) using the SOAP2 software (Li et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>), with a maximum of one nucleotide mismatch allowed. All tags mapped to reference sequences were filtered, and the remaining tags were designated as ambiguous tags. Mapping events on both sense and antisense sequences were included in data processing. For gene expression analysis, in order to identify genes that were differentially expressed between monoecious and female apices at the same developmental stages, as well as genes that exhibited distinctive expression between different developmental stages in the same line, we converted the number of raw clean tags in each library to TPM (number of transcripts per million tags) ('t Hoen et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Morrissy et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) to obtain normalized gene expression levels. Then, nine pairs of DGE profiles of different sample libraries (ABML1 vs. ABPL1, ABML2 vs. ABPL2, RML vs. RPL, ABML1 vs. ABML2, ABML2 vs. RML, ABML1 vs. RML, ABPL1 vs. ABPL2, ABPL2 vs. RPL, and ABPL1 vs. RPL, where a is the control and b is the experimental group in &#8220;a vs. b&#8221;) were compared to assess the diversity of gene expression. A rigorous algorithm for identifying DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between two samples, false discovery rate (FDR), was applied to determine the threshold <italic>P</italic>-value in multiple tests and analyses. Criteria for DEGs were as follows: FDR, &#8804;0.001, and |log<sub>2</sub>Ratio|, &#8805;1 (Audic and Claverie, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Benjamini and Yekutieli, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Following, we performed functional annotation to assign the unambiguously mapped genes identified in all libraries to Gene ontology (GO) terms. Gene annotation was conducted using Blast2GO (Conesa et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) was used to determine the possible functions of all DEGs by searching the GO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>), and Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO) was also used for GO classification of genes identified in each DGE library (Ye et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Moreover, the GO distribution of DEGs in comparisons of each pair of libraries was determined and compared. To further characterize gene function, pathway enrichment analysis of the DGE results was conducted by BLAST search of the KEGG database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/">http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/</ext-link>). Clustering analysis of differential gene expression patterns was also performed using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) (Chu et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Howe et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 was selected as the threshold for a gene set to be considered significantly enriched.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to verify the DGE results. The RNA samples used for the qRT-PCR assays were identical to those used for the DGE experiments. Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were performed for each sample. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA (1 ug) from each sample using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, RR047A). The primers designed for qPCR analysis was listed in Additional File S1. <italic>Actin</italic> gene (forward primer: 5&#8242;-TGCTGACAGAATGAGCAAGG-3&#8242;; reverse primer: 5&#8242;-AATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGG-3&#8242;) was used as an internal control gene for normalization. Quantitative PCR reactions used ABI7500 quantitative PCR, which was performed using SYBR&#174; Premix Ex Taq&#8482; II(Tli RNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa, RR820A) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In cucumber, ethylene, a true sex hormone, was proven to be a &#8220;female&#8221; hormone that exerts a strong feminizing effect (Dellaporta and Calderon-Urrea, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>); Auxin also promotes cucumber femaleness, potentially playing an indirect role in sex determination by promoting the action of ethylene (Yamasaki et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The level of gibberellic acid (GA), which acts downstream of ethylene or through a parallel pathway (Ainsworth, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), is correlated with male tendency. Sex expression in castor bean is also regulated by plant hormones (Shifriss, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>; Tan et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), but in contrast to cucumber, ethylene and ethylene-like substances (NIA 10637) result in masculinization and can transform female flowers into male ones in monoecious plants (Philipos and Narayanaswamy, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>); moreover, GA causes feminization in castor, and spraying monoecious inbreds with GA can markedly increase female tendency (Shifriss, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>). In addition, previous work showed that the activity of auxin-like substances causes feminization of castor bean, a process influenced by kinetin and morphactin (Kumar and Rao, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). Morphactin causes maleness in <italic>R. communis</italic> (Rkey, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Varkey and Nigam, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>), whereas daminozide promotes femaleness with reduction in the position of bearing the first female flower and the ratio of male and female flowers (Chauhan et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). To date, however, the key sex hormone in castor bean remains unknown. In this study, we identified several genes involved in the response to hormone stimulus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), including auxin transport and auxin response factor genes and other genes involved in plant hormone-mediated biosynthetic and metabolic process, such as polyamine biosynthesis and abscisic acid and carotenoid metabolism. In the pistillate line, three genes (<italic>auxin response factor, spermidine synthase</italic>, and <italic>Xaa-Pro amino peptidase</italic>) related to auxin response and transport, were down-regulated in early leaf apices and young racemes, but up-regulated during the transformation from leaf apices to floral buds. In addition, the result of hormone measurement detected that auxin level in the female was higher than that in the monoecism at each of the three development stages and extremely significant higher at the 5&#8211;7-leaf stage. The levels of JA, ABA, and GA in the apices also displayed significant differences between the pistillate line and the monoecious line, except the GA and ABA level in the infant racemes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Our results suggested that DEGs involved in the pathways of plant hormone response and hormone-mediated biosynthetic and metabolic processes, may participate in or affect the regulation of sex expression and reproduction by changing the hormone level and transport, which will be elucidated in further research. Our result was consistent with previous reports (Heslop-Harrison, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>; Rkey, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>). Those authors showed that variation in sex expression in plants is associated with variations in the hormone level (Heslop-Harrison, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1957</xref>), and that auxins promote femaleness (Wittwer and Hillyer, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>). Interference in auxin transport, or quick degradation of the hormone, can decrease the auxin level, resulting in altered sex expression (Thomson and Leopold, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Gaganias and Berg, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). The fact that lateral branches of castor bean plants produce only male flowers after decapitation supports the view that inhibition of auxin transport can result in maleness (Rao, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>). Furthermore, our previous research (Wang et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) demonstrated that IAA and ABA levels in the inflorescence and flower vary remarkably between the pistillate and the monoecism, also suggesting that some phytohormones such as IAA etc. and related genes are important for sex determination in <italic>R. communis</italic>. In plants, phytohormones modulate various growth and developmental events through signal transduction pathways (Bleecker and Kende, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Davies, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Notably, in this study, three genes involved in signal transduction exhibited expression patterns similar to those of genes involved in auxin response and transport (i.e., down-regulated in early leaf apices and small racemes, but up-regulated during the transformation stage from leaf to floral bud) in the pistillate line. However, other genes involved in signal transduction were down-regulated throughout all three stages. Subsequent investigations of these genes and crosstalk between other hormones and auxin may reveal their specific roles in sex expression or sex determination.</p><p>Castor is a monoecious species, with pistillate flowers borne on short pedicels along the upper portion of the raceme and staminate flowers borne similarly on the lower portion (Brigham, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). Castor flowers are unisexual and lack petals. Male and female flowers differ radically in general morphology and size: male flowers are devoid of rudiments of organs of the opposite sex, whereas pistillate flowers occasionally exhibit vestiges of stamen (Wu et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The occasional appearance of rudimentary androecium in <italic>Ricinus</italic> female flowers suggests that like unisexual flowers of other species (Atsmon and Galun, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>; Cheng et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Bracale et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Malepszy and Niemirowicz-Szczytt, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Veit et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), castor flowers (especially pistillate flowers) pass through a &#8220;bisexual stage&#8221; during which development of all floral organs is initiated. Castor sex determination probably involves PCD of opposite sex organs in the flower and inflorescence, similar to what is observed in several other plant species such as maize, cucumber, and campion (Ye et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Dellaporta and Calderon-Urrea, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Kater et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>); these plants follow a sex determination pathway involving arrest of preformed sexual organs in bisexual primordia in which some PCD-related genes participate (DeLong et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). In this study, we detected a PCD-related gene (cysteine protease) that was significantly up-regulated in female apices at the 5&#8211;7-leaf stage, but obviously down-regulated at the two other stages (early leaf apices and initial inflorescence). This result was consistent with recent findings that PCD-related genes, including cysteine protease, are more highly expressed at the peak of anther abortion in CMS and GMS lines of cotton (Lorrain et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Wei et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is possible that the cysteine protease might play a role in <italic>Ricinus</italic> apical development, and thus be associated directly or indirectly with sex expression. Our study identified hundreds of genes potentially involved in sex determination, including one (<italic>arginine/serine-rich splicing factor</italic>) associated with sex differentiation; this gene was up-regulated during apical transformation and initial raceme formation in female apical buds.</p><p>Transcription factors such as the maize DELLA protein D8 and the melon zinc finger protein CmWIP1 have been functionally associated with the sex determination process (Peng et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Martin et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Moreover, several transcription factors were identified as differentially expressed during sex determination in cucumber (Guo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), including zinc finger transcription factors, Aux/IAA transcription factor, auxin-induced protein, BRI1, BRI1-associated receptor kinase, MYC transcription factor, BEL1-like homeodomain protein, bHLH proteins, WRKY DNA-binding protein, and NAC domain protein, <italic>IF-2</italic>, and so on. Consistent with the results in cucumber, we identified eight DNA-dependent transcription genes in castor bean that were significantly differentially expressed between the three apical developmental stages in the pistillate line. Of these, auxin response factor, MADS box protein, <italic>IF-2</italic>, and two DNA-binding proteins were also confirmed to be differentially expressed during sex determination. These transcription factors detected in this study were mainly binding proteins, response factors, initiation and regulation factors, and even MADS box proteins; the relationship between these transcription factors and plant sex determination remains to be determined, and should be investigated in future work. In addition, we also identified a few genes involved in histone demethylation/methylation and reproductive processes. DNA methylation and histone modification play essential roles in genome management and control gene expression or silence (Cheng and Blumenthal, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). DNA methyltransferase, the main enzyme involved in DNA methylation, was detected in female apices; it was obviously up-regulated at the stage of transformation from leaf to floral apices, and down-regulated at the other two developmental stages, relative to monoecious apices (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). DNA methyltransferase is not only associated with DNA methylation, but is also associated with many important biological activities, including cell proliferation and senescence (Berger, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The increase in methyltransferase gene expression during the transitional stage may change the level of DNA methylation, leading to the subsequent repression of male flower gene expression and the appearance of only female flowers in female racemes. Genes associated with the reproduction process, identified as DEGs here and in future research, will contribute to elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Ricinus</italic> sex determination and sex patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data deposition</title><p>The Illumina pair-end reads of <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> L. obtained in the study are available at NCBI SRP064760.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>YX conceived and designed the study, amended the manuscript.
