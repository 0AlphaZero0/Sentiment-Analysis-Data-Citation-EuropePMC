Aspirin induces demethylation of the FOXD3 promoter and promotes expression of the FOXD3 gene. Subsequently, upregulated FOXD3 protein transcriptionally activates lncRNA OLA1P2 expression. OLA1P2 upregulation markedly affects STAT3 signaling pathway activity by inhibiting the nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT3. The phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 of STAT3 is the first step in OLA1P2 binding, and the formation of phosphorylated STAT3 homodimers is subsequently blocked. OLA1P2 interacts directly with STAT3 due to OLA1P2 sharing the same conservative STAT3 transcription response element as STAT3 targets. Regular use of aspirin dramatically decreases the number of metastatic nodules of cancer cells in immunodeficient mouse lungs, and OLA1P2 silencing markedly weakens the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin in the lungs. Additionally, low OLA1P2 levels are associated with malignant transformation and lower overall survival in cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study finds that the aspirin-FOXD3-OLA1P2-STAT3 axis exhibits exciting anticancer effects and provides new insights into the chemopreventive mechanisms underlying aspirin use.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0892-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Aspirin</kwd><kwd>FOXD3</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>lncRNA OLA1P2</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81472572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jianjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81201912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91229103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wantao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that aspirin can protect against different types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Daily use of aspirin at moderate doses markedly reduces the risk of CRC and is associated with decreased risk of new CRC in patients with a personal history of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even the lowest daily dose of aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The effects of aspirin on inhibiting COX-1-dependent platelet function represent an important mechanism for preventing carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, by inhibiting PP2A enzymatic activity, aspirin causes the degradation of phosphorylated &#946;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Aspirin may act through inhibition of the Ras/c-Raf interaction and upregulation of MKPs to suppress ERK-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by aspirin could make human colon cancer cells more susceptible to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Aspirin also reduces mTOR signaling by inhibiting the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although the anticancer molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of aspirin have been extensively investigated, the involvement of a large number of cell components, such as long non-coding RNAs, is still not completely understood.</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators involved in controlling fundamental biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. lncRNA HOTAIR expression is associated with genome-wide reprogramming of PRC2 function in CRC, in which upregulation of HOTAIR is a critical element in metastatic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A high expression level of the lncRNA-CLMAT3 is significantly associated with liver metastasis of CRC and is an independent prognostic indicator of survival for patients with CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The lncRNA MYCLos could function in CRC cell proliferation by regulating MYC target genes, such as p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The lncRNA CCAT1-L, which is transcribed specifically in human CRC, plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The lncRNA MALAT1 could promote cell proliferation and metastasis in CRC by binding to SFPQ and releasing the proto-oncogene PTBP2 from the SFPQ/PTBP2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The lncRNA CCAT2 is highly overexpressed in CRC, and this lncRNA promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and chromosomal instability through TCF7 L2-mediated transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, little is known about the regulation and functions of lncRNAs in the treatment of CRC with aspirin.</p><p>In this study, we investigated global lncRNA expression profiles using microarray analysis of CRC cells treated with aspirin, and we identified the profiles of transcription factors interacting with the lncRNA OLA1P2 (HGNC: 45277) promoter via mass spectrometry. We fully analyzed the mechanisms underlying altered OLA1P2 levels and the effects on the phenotypes of CRC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings suggested that aspirin could suppress cancer cell growth and metastasis through the induction of lncRNA OLA1P2 transcription and the subsequent blocking of phosphorylated STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) homodimers formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aspirin-induced lncRNA OLA1P2 upregulation in cancer cells</title><p>To identify the lncRNA profiles of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells treated with aspirin, we performed microarray analysis using primary cultured cancer cells obtained from eight clinical CRC tissues. After the cells were treated with aspirin, 28 lncRNAs were statistically upregulated more than two-fold (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). OLA1P2 (HGNC: 45277) was the most changed lncRNA among these upregulated lncRNAs (fold change &gt;20) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We validated the expression level of OLA1P2 by qRT-PCR analysis in all eight pairs of CRC cells with or without aspirin treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Using northern blot analysis, we also identified OLA1P1 upregulation in primary cultured CRC cells treated with aspirin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Considering that many digestive system cancers could possess similar characteristics, we assessed OLA1P2 expression in other types of cancer cells. OLA1P2 expression was dramatically induced after aspirin treatment in oral cancer, gastric cancer, and colon cancer cell lines, but not in esophageal cancer, liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Aspirin-induced lncRNA OLA1P2 upregulation in cancer cells. <bold>a</bold> Primary cultured colon cancer cells were treated with aspirin (100 &#956;M) for 48 h and then evaluated to determine their lncRNA profiles using an lncRNA expression microarray.

Nuclear proteins of CRC cells were incubated and pulled down by biotin-labeled OLA1P2 promoter. One-shot mass spectrometry analyses were then performed to analyze the purified nuclear proteins. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, 19 proteins were specifically identified in the aspirin-treated group, and eight of the proteins (blue-labeled) were previously confirmed to be transcription factors or nuclear receptor coactivators. Using immunoblot analysis, we found that the SMAD3, FOXD3 (forkhead box D3), NCOA1, and MEF-2 proteins were dramatically increased in the nucleus following aspirin treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). After these transcription factors were silenced individually (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), only FOXD3 dysregulation obviously affected OLA1P2 expression under aspirin treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Both <italic>FOXD3</italic> mRNA and FOXD3 protein levels in the whole cell lysate of CRC cells were upregulated under aspirin treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that part 1 (P1) of the OLA1P2 promoter exhibited a strong binding affinity with the FOXD3 protein (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f, g</xref>). We then analyzed the nucleic acid sequence in greater detail and identified two transcriptional response elements for FOXD3 in part 1 of the OLA1P2 promoter (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).

In this study, we investigated lncRNA expression profiles in response to aspirin treatment in CRC cells and identified an aspirin-induced upregulated lncRNA, OLA1P2. Importantly, lower levels of OLA1P2 correlated with more advanced pathology grade and lower overall survival of patients with CRC. Within the first 2 years after surgery for patients with CRC, the majority of residual cancer cells often undergo a period of dormancy, a stage in cancer progression in which residual disease is present but remains asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Regardless of high or low OLA1P2 expression, the survival curve did not differ within the first 2 years due to the lower probability of cancer recurrence for all patients with CRC. More than 2 years after surgery, OLA1P2 overexpression may suppress cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, thus resulting in a lower rate of cancer recurrence. In addition to CRC, OLA1P2 was also markedly induced by aspirin in oral cancers and gastric cancers. These results indicated that aspirin might share the same chemotherapy mechanism involving OLA1P2 induction in oral cancer, gastric cancer, and CRC. However, OLA1P2 was not found to serve as a key mediator of aspirin treatment in esophageal cancer, liver cancer, or pancreatic cancer, although clinical trials have indicated that aspirin significantly reduces the risks of these cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our research indicated that different anticancer mechanisms likely underlie the chemoprotective effects of aspirin use on digestive system cancers.</p><p>We found that aspirin induced OLA1P2 expression through FOXD3 upregulation. FOXD3 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors. Its role in tumorigenesis has recently attracted attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the FOXD3 tumor-suppressive cascade was downregulated in human cancers mainly due to DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results confirmed that demethylation of the <italic>FOXD3</italic> promoter induced by aspirin might be responsible for the overexpression of FOXD3 in CRC cells. Aspirin dramatically increased FOXD3 concentrations in the nuclei of cancer cells and effectively promoted FOXD3 interaction with OLA1P2 promoter regions, providing convincing evidence that FOXD3 is a new aspirin target that could function in the control of lncRNA transcription. In addition, given that FOXD3 is critical for the maintenance of self-renewal, survival, and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], investigating the roles of aspirin in embryonic organ development may be valuable.</p><p>Many new functions have been assigned to non-coding RNAs in the cytoplasm. A muscle-specific lncRNA, linc-MD1, displays decoy activity for two specific miRNAs (miR-133 and miR-135) and regulates the expression of MAML1 and MEF2C in a molecular circuitry affecting the differentiation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. All MRE (microRNA response element)-containing transcripts in the cytoplasm, including lncRNA, transcribed pseudogenes, and even protein-coding RNA, are capable of regulating each other through ceRNA (competing endogenous RNAs) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our results confirmed that aspirin-induced OLA1P2 was mainly enriched in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic OLA1P2 affected the STAT3 signaling pathway activity by inhibiting the nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT3. The accumulation of STAT3 in the nucleus was tightly controlled. A number of factors regulate the phosphorylation status of STAT3 and alter its nuclear import-export dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Cao <italic>et al.</italic> determined that the lncRNA lnc-DC could bind directly to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine-705 by preventing STAT3 from binding to and being dephosphorylated by SHP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We found that the phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 of STAT3 was the first step in OLA1P2 binding and that the formation of phosphorylated STAT3 homodimers was subsequently blocked by OLA1P2. OLA1P2 directly interacted with STAT3 due to OLA1P2 sharing the same conservative STAT3 transcription response element as STAT3-activated targets. Given that inhibition of STAT3 homodimers formation diminished STAT3 activity, STAT3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for OLA1P2 in cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>Our results established a new link between FOXD3, STAT3, and OLA1P2. FOXD3 is an important tumor suppressor that suppresses the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Aberrant activation of STAT3 has been reported in many types of tumors; STAT3 plays an oncoprotein role in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Maintaining cellular homeostasis by balancing these counter-signaling pathways is important for cell survival. Our results showed that overexpression of FOXD3 induced by aspirin could indirectly suppress STAT3 signaling pathway activity, which is mediated by the lncRNA OLA1P2. Here, lncRNAs represent a new layer of regulatory circuitry in which different types of cell components (both proteins and non-coding RNAs) can exhibit cross-talk and determine cell fates.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the lncRNA expression profiles associated with aspirin treatment and showed that lncRNA OLA1P2 could be dramatically induced by aspirin in cancer cells.

Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were then added and incubated for 4 h at 4 &#176;C. Magnetic beads were pelleted, washed, and re-suspended in 1 mL TRIzol. The isolated RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and then analyzed by qRT-PCR. The PCR cycle parameters for OLA1P2 enrichment were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 &#176;C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 &#176;C for 10 s and 65 &#176;C for 40 s, with a final extension at 72 &#176;C for 10 min.

The JAK2 protein (2 &#956;g) was then incubated with the purified STAT3 protein (4 &#956;g) and 250 &#956;M adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Purified STAT3 protein was used as a substrate for each assay. The reaction system was incubated for 120 min at room temperature. After incubation, serial dilutions of purified lncRNA OLA1P2 or total RNA extracted from COLO205 cells were then added to the reaction mixture at room temperature for 120 min. Each reaction was then divided into three parts: the first part was used as an input, the second part was used for immunoprecipitation assay with Flag beads, and the third part was used for immunoprecipitation assay with HA beads. Eluted proteins were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis</title><p>Immunodeficient mice were pretreated with aspirin via oral administration (40 mg/kg) for 8 weeks, after which cancer cells (1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup>) stably silencing OLA1P2 were injected into the tail veins of immunodeficient mice (n&#8201;=&#8201;6).
