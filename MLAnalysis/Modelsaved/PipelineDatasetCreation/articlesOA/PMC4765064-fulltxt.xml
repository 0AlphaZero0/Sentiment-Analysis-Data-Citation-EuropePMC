Popular applications of ChIP-seq include identifying binding sites of a TF in one or more samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], comparing histone modifications across two or more samples, and detecting binding differences between alternative alleles (allele-specific binding) when SNP data is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ChIP-seq experiments start with shearing DNA cross-linked with the protein of interest into short fragments. Then, fragments associated with the protein or modification of interest are enriched by immunopreciptitation using an antibody specific to the protein or modification of interest. After purification and size selection, the remaining fragments are sequenced. Currently, the most widely used sequencing platform for ChIP-seq experiments is Illumina. This platform offers many options for experimental design; however, the impact of these design parameters are not well understood. The two key design parameters are read length and read type, i.e., single-end (SE) in which only one end of the fragments are sequenced or paired-end (PE) whereby both ends are sequenced. Intuitively, long PE reads should capture more information than the short SE reads; however, they can cost up to 1.5&#8211;2 times more (e.g., one lane of 100 bps PE sequencing costs about 67 % more than one lane of 50 bps SE sequencing at the Biotechnology Center at UW Madison at the time this paper was submitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, understanding design differences is critical for the cost-effectiveness of genomic research. More importantly, since different designs may be powered differently for various types of discoveries, a comprehensive understanding of design implications is crucial for comparing and integrating ChIP-seq data with different designs.</p><p>Recent works on the design of ChIP-seq experiments did not adequately address the performance of PE and SE designs and long and short reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Instead, these studies discussed systematic biases in data generation, sequencing depths of the control and ChIP samples, redundancy of reads, and the impacts of downstream data analysis algorithms. For <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, they also investigated a limited comparison of PE and SE designs with the exact same read lengths in terms of the library complexity and coverage in repetitive regions using very high depth samples. The human genome has much more repetitive DNA and a greater genome size, and although the sequencing depths of human samples have also been increasing over time, they are still lagging far behind the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> study. Therefore, it remains largely unclear how the PE and SE designs and long and short reads influence the alignment rates and accuracy, coverage of various repetitive elements, sensitivity and specificity in peak calling and in allele-specific binding detection.</p><p>In this paper, we systematically and quantitatively investigated the impact of ChIP-seq read parameters on the alignment, peak identification, and allele-specific binding detection. We first generated PE ChIP-seq data for CTCF, BHLHE40 (also called DEC1), and NONO from the human GM12878 cell line and MAFK from the human MCF7 cell line, as well as the control Input data from these two cell lines, with a read-length of 101 bps at typical depths (15&#8211;80 million reads per replicate). We generated data with other read parameters <italic>in silico</italic> from these full data, and evaluated short (36 and 50 bps) and long (75 and 101 bps) PE and SE read designs for their impact on alignment, peak calling, and allele-specific binding (ASB) detection. We complemented these comparisons with evaluations on simulated data where the underlying truth was known and established advantages and disadvantages of different designs in terms of accuracy and power. Our study deepens the understanding on the impact of design in transcription factor ChIP-Seq experiments, and is likely to provide insights on other types of ChIP-Seq experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ChIP-seq data</title><p>We generated ChIP-seq datasets for CTCF, NONO, and BHLHE40 (DEC1) in GM12878 cells and MAFK in MCF7 cells as part of the phase 3 of the ENCODE project (released at the ENCODE portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in 2014). The information on the antibodies used for ChIP is available at the ENCODE portal and can be accessed using the following accession numbers CTCF (ENCAB000AXU), BHLHE40 (ENCAB000AEK), NONO (ENCAB134GSH) and MAFK (ENCAB000AIJ). A detailed protocol for the ChIP-seq can also be downloaded from the ENCODE portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Among these factors, CTCF, BHLHE40, and MAFK are sequence specific transcription factors with known motifs while NONO does not have a well-defined motif. These data sets were chosen based on the availability within the ENCODE community at the time of the research and their ENCODE quality measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In particular, we excluded data with severe bottlenecking in library complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to our interests in motif analysis and allele-specific binding, we largely focused on sequence-specific transcription factors, and the cell line with the most complete diploid sequences available at the time of the research (GM12878), but also included MCF7 as a second cell line. We used CTCF, MAFK, and NONO in read alignment comparisons, CTCF, MAFK, and BHLHE40 in peak detection comparisons, and CTCF and BHLHE40 datasets in the ASB detection comparisons.

We used HOMER software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to trim the original reads to 75, 50, and 36 bps for generating designs with shorter read lengths. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 provides the number of fragments, reads, and sequenced base-pairs in each design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Alignments by Bowtie and BWA</title><p>We initially compared the alignment results of both Bowtie -v mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Bowtie can be set to report only uniquely mapped reads (uni-reads), whereas BWA also reports reads that can be mapped to multiple locations (multi-reads). Our simulation results show that Bowtie and BWA have almost identical coverage and accuracy when their alignment rules are comparable and if the multi-reads in BWA output are filtered. However, if the multi-reads are kept, the alignment accuracy of BWA could be low (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S15&#8211;S16). Thus we resorted to using only Bowtie alignments for other comparisons. There are many other different alignment tools, such as Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and GEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, since alignments with BWA and Bowtie dominate the ChIP-seq applications, we focused our attention to these two aligners. In our study, we used Bowtie with the command &#8220;Bowtie -v <italic>&#120599;</italic> -I 100 -X 700 -a &#8211;best &#8211;strata -m 1&#8221;, where <italic>&#120599;</italic>=0, 1, 2, 3 and &#8220;-I 100 -X 700" only applies to PE. Here, <italic>&#120599;</italic> denotes the number of mismatches allowed in each read, and 100 and 700 the allowed range of the fragment lengths in PE alignments. These upper and lower bounds were chosen based on BWA estimates of the fragment length from the CTCF dataset to make this parameter comparable between the two aligners. We considered four different options for BWA: &#8220;BWA -q 0 -o 0 -n 0.04", &#8220;BWA -q 20 -o 0 -n 0.04", &#8220;BWA -q 20 -o 1 -n 0.04", and &#8220;BWA -q 20 -o 1 -n 8", where -q 0, -o 1 and -n 0.04 are default options of BWA. The option -q allows trimming the low quality base-pairs from their 3<sup>&#8242;</sup> ends, option -o allows user-specified numbers of gaps in the alignment, and option -n controls the number of allowed mismatches. Specifically, when -n is an integer, it denotes the number of allowed mismatches. When -n is between 0 and 1, the number of allowed mismatches is set to the quantile of a Poisson distribution with mean 0.02 &#215;read-length (after trimming by option -q) with tail probability -n. We used &#8220;BWA -q 20 -o 1 -n 8" to generate a relaxed alignment set. After the BWA alignment of the PE designs, we considered keeping all aligned pairs with both ends uniquely mapping (Uni) and additionally kept those with one uniquely mapping end (UR). For SE designs, we kept all the reads that are uniquely mapped (Uni/UR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Abbreviations of designs and the design-alignment combinations</title><p>For simplicity, we introduced some abbreviations for the designs and the design-alignment combinations in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3&#8211;S7. Some illustrative examples of these abbreviations are as follows. We denoted PE data with read-length 36 bps as PE36, SE data with read-length 75 bps as SE75; the Bowtie alignments in -v mode allowing one mismatch as BOWTIEv1, BOWTIEv1 alignment on PE36 data as PE36v1, and the BOWTIEv2 on SE75 as SE75v2. We used BWAq20o1UR to denote the alignment strategy where we first ran BWA -q 20 -o 1 -n 0.04 and only kept reads that uniquely mapped to the reference genome (SE). For PE, we kept the read pairs with at least one uniquely mapping end.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>ENCODE uniform ChIP-seq processing pipeline</title><p>We utilized the uniform ChIP-seq processing pipeline developed and benchmarked by ENCODE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This pipeline utilizes SPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] for calling peaks and generates a relaxed peak list with both true peaks and some regions with little or no enrichment of the ChIP-seq signal (3 &#215;10<sup>5</sup> by default). Then the irreducible discovery rate (IDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] is applied to threshold the relaxed peak list and generate an optimal peak set for a given IDR level (default 0.02). IDR also accounts for the randomness between replicates. Calculation of the average fragment length is also provided within this pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Coverage analysis</title><p>We used SPP to estimate the average fragment length for SE designs, and extended the SE reads to this length as their full length. The two ends of the PE reads were connected to form full length fragments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Coverage of repetitive elements</title><p>We calculated the coverage for each type of repeat element by summing over the fragment lengths of all reads overlapping with the instances of the repeat element and then normalizing the resulting sum with the total length of this type of repetitive element. For both the alignments and the peaks, we only counted those with at least 30 % overlap with repeat elements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measuring alignment accuracy of ChIP-seq data using the relaxed alignment set</title><p>We used BWAq20o1n8 results of PE101 as a &#8220;gold" standard relaxed set for benchmarking alignment accuracy in real ChIP-seq data analysis where the true origins of the reads were not available. This alignment rule is very relaxed and the alignment locations under this rule are not necessarily accurate. However, if a read cannot be mapped by this rule, it probably should not be mapped by any. Thus, we marked those reads that cannot be aligned in this setting as &#8220;unmappable". If an unmappable read was mapped under another design and using another alignment rule, we labeled it as a &#8220;false positive" alignment. We then compared the false positive rates in the set differences of the alignments by the two designs. Details of these calculations are illustrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1, e.g., the false positive alignment rate of Design-Alignment 1 is <italic>A</italic>/(<italic>A</italic>+<italic>B</italic>) when it is compared with Design-Alignment 2. In our simulation study, we found that BWAq20o1n8 results of PE101 has very high coverage (median in 5 replicates is 99.15 %), and accuracy (median in 5 replicates is 99.84 %). Even though the simulation settings can never be as complex as the real data, the above results give us confidence about the sensitivity and specificity of BWAq20o1n8 alignment on PE101.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Motif analysis</title><p>For CTCF and MAFK, we used ENCODE defined motifs and corresponding positions weight matrices (PWMs) from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Transcription factor BHLHE40 was not profiled in GM12878 previously and did not have a PWM; therefore, we estimated its PWM from the top 500 peaks of the analysis of PE101v3 data using MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The peaks were scanned with these position weight matrices using FIMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] for all the motif analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>ChIP-seq peak calling by MOSAiCS + IDR pipeline</title><p>Mosaics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is a model-based approach for the analysis of ChIP-seq data. We combined it with IDR to get a set of optimal peaks. The pipeline parameters were set as follows: thres: 99th percentile of the bin-level ChIP read count distribution; FDR: 1.0 for generating the set of relaxed peaks. The relaxed peak set was filtered so that the ChIP read counts at the summit were at least as large as the sequencing depth normalized input read counts and the IDR optimal peak set was filtered to contain peaks with at least 10 read counts at the summit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Minimax summit distance of the identified peaks</title><p>We define minimax summit distance <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>(<italic>j</italic>) to measure the spatial distance of the rank <italic>j</italic> peak among the top <italic>M</italic> peaks of the peak lists in the worst-case scenario across all replicates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).

In the coverage comparisons of peaks, we only considered the peaks whose surrounding &#177; 500 bps windows contained no other peak summits from the other peak list, so that the closely-spaced binding events for which the coverage comparisons were difficult were excluded.

It aligns reads to the paternal and the maternal sequences of the sample to be analyzed and assigns each read to one allele based on the number of mis-matches with the ties broken by random assignment. During this process, it discards the reads with ambiguous base <bold>N</bold>, and those that align to both alleles but at different locations. It then applies the binomial test at the phased heterozygous SNPs with at least 5 reads to test the null hypothesis of no allelic imbalance and achieves FDR control via simulation. In our actual data analysis, we set FDR level to 0.1. AlleleSeq was originally designed for SE reads. We adapted it to the PE setting with the following modification. After the reads were aligned to both alleles by Bowtie, we calculated the number of mis-matches of each fragment by summing the mis-matches from both ends, and then assigned the fragment to one allele based on this total number of mis-matches. We also discarded the reads that were aligned to both alleles with equal number of mis-matches. In both cases, we ran AlleleSeq without a specific peak set, and then overlapped the output with the optimal peak set of PE101v3 for detecting ASB events. AlleleSeq aligns the reads using Bowtie in v mode.

Thus we started with a detailed comparison of data alignments with different read parameters, and throughout this paper, we paid attention to matching designs and analysis protocols so that the read error rates, the numbers of reads, and the numbers of sequenced bases were comparable when necessary. For simplicity, we introduced some abbreviations for the designs and the design-alignment combinations in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3&#8211;S7 (See also the corresponding section in &#8220;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#8221;). We also summarized the major comparisons of the design and alignment combinations and the rationale for these comparisons in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For example, we compared PE36v1 with SE75v2 and also PE50v1 with SE101v2 for a fair comparison of PE and SE designs with similar numbers of sequenced bases and read error rate in alignment. PE designs interrogate the same number of ChIPed fragments with twice as many reads compared to the SE designs. We controlled the numbers of reads by randomly sampling half of the pairs from PE designs, and denoted such designs as PEhalf (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7). At fixed read-lengths, PEhalf designs have the same number of reads and the number of sequenced bases as their SE counterparts, but they could potentially contain less biological information since the paired reads are representing information from the same DNA fragment.

Our comparison in alignment rates revealed a complex interplay between the read parameters, alignment rules, and other biological factors (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S9&#8211;S14. The alignment of PE requires both ends of each pair to be mapped. This is more stringent than its SE counterpart, but also improves the uniqueness in alignment. As a result, SE designs with longer reads (50, 75, and 101 bps) usually had higher alignment rates than the PE designs with the same read-length, but PE36 had higher alignment rates than SE36 in most cases due to its higher uniqueness in alignment. For example, the alignment rates of SE75v2 were 2&#8211;7 % higher than PE75v2, but those of SE36v1 were 1&#8211;7.5 % lower than PE36v1 for most data except one replicate of CTCF. The effect of read length is more complicated. Longer SE reads had higher alignment rates than short SE reads in most cases due to their higher sequence uniqueness. In contrast, median read lengths seemed to improve alignment rates for PE, and in most cases, PE50v1 and PE75v2 outperformed PE101v2 and PE36v1 in alignment rates, respectively. The observed lower alignment rates of PE101v2 may be largely due to the lower quality near the 3 <sup>&#8242;</sup> end of long reads, a phenomenon commonly observed and well characterized for Illumina platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, how much lower it could be depends on the specific quality profile. When the number of sequenced bases was also controlled (e.g., PE36v1 vs. SE75v2), SE designs had 0&#8211;5 % higher alignment rates than their PE counterparts. In fact, for all datasets and all the Bowtie alignment settings considered, we found that (1) SE75v3 yielded the highest alignment rates for all except one replicate of CTCF where it was 0.05 % less than SE50v3; and (2) PE50v3 yielded the highest alignment rates in PE for CTCF and BHLHE40, and the second highest in PE for MAFK, where it was 0.11 % and 0.04 % less than PE75v3. The results on the simulated CTCF data showed similar patterns (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S15).

We evaluated how the designs differed in coverage, and found that it heavily depended on data quality. In detail, we compared the designs in terms of multi-coverage that we defined as the sizes of the genomic regions (number of bases) covered by at least five reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3).</p><p>We used the peak finder SPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] to estimate fragment sizes for the SE designs. We observed that PE designs had higher multi-coverage than the comparable SE designs for MAFK and NONO, but not for CTCF. We conjectured that such disagreement is likely due to the antibody quality. We concluded that all the designs might have similar coverage for data with good antibody such as CTCF. However, for typical TFs, PE designs do provide better coverage. We did not find apparent pattern of differences between different read lengths for either the PE or the SE design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Repetitive element coverage of Bowtie alignments of different designs</title><p>Repetitive elements are DNA sequences that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. These copies can be either adjacent to each other or interspersed. Repetitive genomic elements are important for many biological processes including regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We evaluated the coverage of different designs over the repetitive genomic elements, and found that both PE designs and long reads had higher repetitive element coverage in most cases. We specifically focused on satellite DNA, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, and segmental duplication regions (SDR) in our evaluation. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">a</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3 report the coverage (number of mapped bases) in these repetitive regions. For NONO and MAFK, we found that (1) PE designs had up to 46 % higher coverage over the repeats than SE with the same read length; (2) doubling the read-length (from 36 to 75 bps or from 50 to 101 bps) improved coverage for up to 35 % depending on the TF, read-length, and the type of repeats; and (3) the effect of long reads was larger for SE than PE. As an example, for one replicate of MAFK, the coverage over LINE elements of PE36v1 and SE75v2 were 11 % and 10 % more than that of SE36v1, respectively, and the coverage of PE75v2 was 3.9 % more than that of PE36v1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">a</xref>). For CTCF, PE designs and the long reads had much less or even no advantage, e.g., the coverage over LINE elements for SE75v2 was only 4.3 % more than that of SE36v1, and that of PE36v1 was even 2.3 % less than SE36v1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4a). We observed a trade-off between longer SE reads and short PE reads when comparing PE36v1 and SE75v2 at fixed number of sequenced bases. PE designs had higher (0&#8211;27 %) coverage over most repetitive elements for MAFK and NONO but not for CTCF (from 8.5 % lower to 2.6 % higher). On the other hand, SE designs had higher (up to 27 %) coverage over SDRs.

Our results agreed with and complemented similar comparisons in the literature (e.g., Figure 2a in Chen et al. 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). One reason for higher coverage of PE designs in repetitive regions is the increased mappability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] of their reads. From this point of view, our results were consistent with the above numerical study, and also revealed that the tradeoff between read length and PE design in real data depends on the types of repetitive elements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Accuracy of Bowtie alignments</title><p>False positives in alignment may cause false positives in detecting enrichment regions. We evaluated the alignment accuracy using both experimental data and fully simulated data, and found that both PE designs and longer reads improved alignment accuracy. We devised a strategy for evaluating alignment accuracy with the experimental data, even though the true origins of the reads were unknown. We used a relaxed alignment set, BWAq20o1n8 with the PE101 data as the &#8220;gold" standard, and labeled those reads that could not be aligned by this relaxed rule as false positives. Then we compared the false positive rates of the sequencing designs in pairs (e.g., SE36v1 vs PE36v1) and assessed the false positive rates in their alignment set differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). For example, the false positive rate of the reads that were aligned under SE36v1 but not PE36v1 was 5.47 %, and that of the reads aligned under PE36v1 but not SE36v1 was only 0.33 %. Our results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref> showed that PE designs and longer reads led to lower false positive rates, and the advantage of longer reads was smaller for PE than for SE. Our simulation results, where the true origins of the simulated reads were used for measuring the accuracy, were consistent with the real data analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S15&#8211;S16). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref> also highlighted a trade-off between the alignment rate and accuracy. Designs with 101 bps reads might have low alignment rates if the quality at the ends of the long reads are low, and the alignment rate of SE36 reads might be also low due to the lack of uniqueness. Other SE designs had high alignment rates, but low accuracy, and PE36, PE50, and PE75 had both high alignment rates and accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Coverage and accuracy of BWA alignments</title><p>BWA is also one of the most popular aligners for ChIP-seq data. Compared to Bowtie -v mode, it allows more flexible error control, and trimming of the poor terminal bases (option -q). It also reports one selected alignment location for reads aligned to multiple locations (multi-reads). While the majority of our analysis is based on Bowtie -v mode, we investigated a comprehensive set of alignment strategies based on BWA and compared them to the Bowtie -v mode in this section. This investigation also led to many practical suggestions on trimming (option -q) and filtering multi-reads in BWA alignment. In Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, where trimming of poor terminal bases was applied (option -q 20), we observed that the alignment rates under all designs were similar when all the multi-reads were kept. In contrast, when only the uniquely aligning reads were retained, both PE designs and long reads led to higher alignment rates. In our simulation study where we conducted a more comprehensive comparison, we observed a similar pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S15&#8211;S16). Additionally, our comparisons of Bowtie and BWA alignments indicated that they had almost the same coverage and accuracy when their alignment rules were comparable (e.g., for SE50, BOWTIEv3 and BWAq0o0n04Uni are essentially identical rules). In summary, both our data analysis and simulation experiments led to the following observations. Discarding multi-mapping reads in BWA output improved alignment accuracy, especially for SE designs. When such reads are retained, their inaccurate alignments were enriched in many regions with a potential impact on the downstream analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). When filtering multi-mapping reads from BWA output of PE data, only those pairs with multiple alignment locations for both ends needed to be removed, and those with one uniquely aligned end could be kept without loss in accuracy. Properly trimming by the -q argument in BWA increased coverage without loss in accuracy, especially for long SE reads. For example, trimming increased the alignment rate of SE101 from 88.41 % (BWAq0o0Uni) to 96.42 % (BWAq20o0Uni), while the accuracy remained almost the same (slight decrease from 99.35 % to 99.32 %) in the simulated data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>The effect of read parameters on peak calling</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Number of peaks by SPP+IDR</title><p>We next evaluated the impact of designs on the number of detected protein-DNA interactions, i.e., peaks.

This was largely driven by the number of reads because SPP treats the two ends of PE reads as two SE reads, instead of processing the pairs as pairs. When the numbers of reads were controlled (e.g., PE36v1half versus SE36v1), the two designs resulted in comparable numbers of optimal peaks. Furthermore, read length had no noticeable impact on the numbers of peaks.

The ChIP-seq uniform processing pipeline of ENCODE uses IDR to capture the reproducibility of the peaks between two replicates. In our simulations, we compared the designs using the reproducibility of the peaks across five replicates, and found that PE designs had better reproducibility. We measured the reproducibility by the minimax summit distances of the highest ranked peaks, which can be viewed as the maximal distance between the estimates of the same target in the five replicates. We labeled a peak as reproducible if its minimax summit distance was less than 200 bps, and higher proportion of reproducible peaks among the top peaks indicated better reproducibility. Overall, PE peaks were more reproducible than the SE peaks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), which further elucidated why PE designs led to more peaks for fixed IDR levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Peaks in repetitive elements</title><p>In the previous section, we compared the designs in terms of their alignment coverage of repetitive elements. In this section, we revisited the repetitive regions, and investigated their peak coverage (percentages of peaks) under different designs. We overlapped the top peaks of each design with satellite DNA, LINE, SINE, LTR elements, and SDRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). We compared these observations with those at the alignment level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">a</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4), and found that the two did not necessarily exhibit the same pattern. For example, PE designs yielded higher coverage of MAFK reads in SINE elements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S4e,f) but smaller portion of MAFK peaks within the same type of repeats (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5o).

We remark that, since PE designs identified more optimal peaks, they also yielded more peaks overlapping with repetitive elements than their SE counterparts, even if the overall proportion was slightly smaller.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Evaluation of the peak sets by motif occurrence and motif-to-summit resolution</title><p>The peaks of a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor typically harbor DNA motifs that the TF binds to. A commonly used metric for the quality of the peak lists is the proportion of the reported peaks with at least one motif. We found that a slightly higher proportion of the SPP peaks from PE designs harbor a motif than the SE peaks for MAFK, but not for CTCF or BHLHE40 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7).</p><p>Another commonly used criteria for evaluating peak quality is their resolution, the distance between the summit of the peak and the nearest motif. A shorter distance between the motif and the summit indicates better resolution in peak calling. In our motif analysis, PE designs yielded slightly better resolution than SE for peaks of similar ranks for CTCF and MAFK (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8). The parameters that impact the peak-summit resolution include fragment size and numbers of correctly aligned reads. SPP estimates the fragment size with the same procedure for both SE and PE designs and utilizes a single estimated fragment size for all the reads. Although Chen et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that the SPP estimates of the fragment sizes are within 10&#8211;20 bps of the average value obtained from PE data, the use of a single fragment size discards the variation in the estimated fragment size, and SPP does not fully utilize the information of individual fragment lengths available in PE reads.</p><p>The majority of the currently available peak callers are developed for SE data, and only few of them are readily adapted for PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To evaluate the gain due to using read-specific fragment sizes which are readily available in PE data, we re-analyzed CTCF and MAFK datasets with MOSAiCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and MACS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. MOSAiCS processes PE reads by acknowledging that every read pair represents a single fragment. We combined MOSAiCS with IDR to make the error control compatible with the uniform processing pipeline. For each peak, MOSAiCS has the capability of reporting two types of summits: a ChIP-seq signal-based summit and a sequence-based summit which incorporates sequence information into summit detection. We focused on the resolution analysis of the signal-based summit because these summits were more comparable to the summits reported by SPP. As expected, we observed a larger advantage of PE over SE in terms of motif-to-summit resolution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">e</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9). MACS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] also processes PE reads properly. We ran a similar analysis using MACS2 output with default parameters without IDR control, because we did not have a reliable pipeline that combines IDR and MACS2. Nevertheless, the MACS2 results were consistent with MOSAiCS results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">f</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10).

Such consistency indicated that all designs targeted the same overall signal pattern. In this section, we focused on the peak set differences, and investigated to what extent the differences could be attributed to the change in the ranking of the relaxed peaks and the alignment differences that led to significant changes in coverage. We first used SE36v1 as the baseline and investigated the changes in peak ranking and peak region coverage when switching to PE36v1 or doubling the read-length (SE75v2). Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S17&#8211;S19 summarize the results of these comparisons. For each pair of designs under investigation (e.g., PE36v1 vs. SE36v1), we overlapped their top <italic>M</italic> peaks, i.e., two peaks were declared as overlapping if their summit-to-summit distance &#8804; 200 bps, treated the overlapping peaks as the estimates of the same target, and compared their ranks. For each TF, we chose nine M values ranging from 12 % to 120 % of the size of its optimal peak list. For example, among the top 80,000 CTCF peaks under PE36v1, 75,354 of them overlapped with the top 80,000 SE36v1 peaks, another 3,181 peaks overlapped with the the SE36v1 peaks ranked between 80,000 and 1.2 &#215;80,000, another 767 overlapped with SE36v1 peaks ranked between 1.2 &#215;80,000 and 3 &#215;10<sup>5</sup>, and the remaining 48 did not overlap with any of the SE36v1 relaxed peak. This comparison indicated that the ranks of the 75,354 of the top 80,000 PE36v1 peaks effectively remained unchanged under SE36v1 (still among the top 80,000 peaks under SE36v1), 3,181 of them underwent moderate rank change (still in the top 1.2 &#215;80,000), 767 of them suffered from large changes in rank, and at most 48 of them were specific to PE36v1, and could not be recovered under SE36v1. In summary, we observed that (1) more than 80 <italic>%</italic> of the ranks effectively remained unchanged in any comparison; (2) the majority of the rank changes were moderate; and (3) only a small portion (usually less than 2 %) of the peaks seemed specific to one design, with the exception of BHLHE40, where 10&#8211;15 % of the SE peaks were specific to the SE designs. We focused on the peaks in the last category (specific to one design), and further examined their ChIP and Input coverage. Surprisingly, we found that even for these peaks, the coverage around the summits were usually similar in different designs, and only a small percentage (&#8804;50 % except for one case) exhibited a fold-change of at least 1.5 in any replicate of ChIP or Input samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S20). Thus, if more than 3&#215;10<sup>5</sup> peaks were included in the relaxed peak list, an even larger portion of peak set differences could be explained by rank change. We next investigated the motif occurrence and repetitive element coverage of the design-specific peaks with at least 1.5 fold-change in coverage between the designs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S21&#8211;S23). We observed that there were barely any motifs except in one case (SE75v2 specific peaks when comparing with PE36v1), and SDR were enriched for all the peaks that were specific to PE or long read designs. We visualized two such BHLHE40 peaks with motifs in the UCSC Genome Browser, and found that both were in low mappability regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>,<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">h</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>The effect of read parameters on allele-specific binding detection</title><sec id="Sec33"><title>Allele-specific binding detection by AlleleSeq</title><p>Allele-specific binding (ASB) detection searches for differences in TF binding between the two alleles of the same individual at a given set of loci (SNPs).

In these two figures, some reads were only mapped and covered the SNP under one design (blue rectangles). Others were mapped in both designs and covered the SNP (yellow rectangles). Although both designs had low coverage in this example, low coverage was not generally correlated with the differences in ASB detection. In fact, the overall read counts at the ASB loci that were identified only by PE50v1 (or SE101v2) were comparable to all ASB detected under each design (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S24).

Specifically, we compared the <italic>p</italic>-values of the FIMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported matches to the CTCF motif in the winning, and losing alleles. If the <italic>p</italic>-value of the motif match in the winning allele was smaller than that of the losing allele, this ASB loci was deemed more likely to be a true positive because the winning allele supported binding with a better motif match. However, we did not expect the ASB loci without this property to be false positives because ASB might be manifesting itself through other factors such as open chromatin structure and binding of co-factors. We considered the intersection and set differences of the ASB loci for each pair of designs under investigation (e.g., PE50v1 and SE101v2) and compared FIMO <italic>p</italic>-values of the motif matches in both alleles (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S13). We further reported the number of ASB loci with a motif in both alleles, only in the winning, only in the losing allele, and in neither of the alleles in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S25 using the default threshold for the FIMO <italic>p</italic>-values (&lt;0.0001). In summary, we concluded that SE75v2 design was better than PE36v1 in ASB detection accuracy. This is largely because, for the ASB loci only identified under SE75v2 but not PE36v1, the overall improvement of the motif score in the winning allele over the losing allele was larger than those that were only identified under PE36v1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S12a). Furthermore, 11 of the ASB loci that were only identified under the PE36v1 design but not SE75v2 design had a motif only in the winning allele, and 8 of them had one only in the losing allele. In contrast, the set of ASB loci specific to SE75v2 had 15 loci with motif only in the winning allele and one locus with motif only in the losing allele (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S25). These analysis further indicated that (1) for the same read-length, PE designs performed better than SE; (2) long reads performed better than short reads for both PE and SE, with a possible exception of PE101v2 vs. PE50v1; and (3) when the number of sequenced bases were controlled, PE36v1 under-performed compared to SE75v2, but PE50v1 was better than SE101v2. Overall, the best design from this perspective was among PE50v1, PE75v2, and PE101v2; and in each pairwise comparison, the ASB loci identified under both designs were better than the others that are specific to one design in terms of accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Consistency between DNase-seq and ChIP-seq in allele-specific behavior</title><p>DNase-seq experiments elucidate broader regions of open chromatin which often exhibit transcription factor occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, it is natural to expect interactions between allele-specific open chromatin (ASOC) structure and ASB. Towards this end, we examined the consistency between the detected allele-specific behavior from DNase-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and ChIP-seq data from the same cell line. We identified a conservative list of loci with allele-specific behavior in DNase-seq as high confidence allele-specific open chromatin (ASOC) regions. We expected these loci to be ASB loci in favor of the same allele if they also overlapped ChIP-seq peak regions. There were 94 and 153 loci with ASOC in CTCF and BHLHE40 peaks, respectively. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>,<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">d</xref> evaluate the sensitivity of ASB detection by the number of loci with both ASOC and ASB in favor of the same allele, and the detection errors by the number of loci with ASOC and ASB in favor of different alleles. For the same read-length, PE designs had higher sensitivity than SE designs, at the expense of slightly elevated error levels. The sensitivity gain for CTCF ranged in 3&#8211;22 % for CTCF, and in 32&#8211;88 % for BHLHE40. In both cases, the gain was driven by the number of sequenced bases. When the number of bases were controlled (e.g., PE36v1 vs. SE75v2), PE and SE designs performed similarly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Allele-specific co-binding of CTCF and BHLHE40</title><p>We defined allele-specific co-binding (ASCB) events as the peak regions where two or more TF bound in favor of the same allele.

Partially due to the interaction between binding and open chromatin structure, we expected ASCB to be more common than BiASB. We then investigated ASB behaviors of CTCF and BHLHE40 in their co-binding regions. Similar to the last section, we adopted a more conservative criteria for ASB detection. We observed that the designs with similar amounts of sequenced bases yielded similar numbers of ASCB and BiASB, and the numbers of BiASB were much smaller than the numbers of ASCB as expected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The impact of sequencing design on the downstream analysis is profound and complicated. It relies heavily on research goals, data quality, and the computational tools chosen for the analysis. Our results suggest that both PE designs and long reads improve the alignment accuracy of Bowtie and coverage in repetitive regions. The trade-off between PE designs and long reads depend on the expected data quality. For peak calling, PE designs yield more peaks with comparable quality (in terms of motif occurrence and resolution) to their SE counterparts, and the quality of PE peaks can be further improved if the peak caller is able to properly process PE information. On the other hand, read-length does not have much effect in peak calling. For ASB detection, both PE designs and long reads lead to more detected ASB with higher accuracy.</p><p>Our computational and data-driven experiments support PE designs for their higher alignment accuracy and higher coverage in repetitive elements especially for TFs where the antibody or other experimental conditions are far from ideal. We did not observe a clear advantage of read length of 101 bps. PE36 worked as good as other PE designs for peak calling and PE50 and PE75 worked best for ASB. One reviewer suggested that the observed design differences may depend on the particular error profiles of the data used. While this could be true, the typical error profiles from Illumina platforms have been well characterized and lower quality near the 3<sup>&#8242;</sup> end of reads is commonly seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus the insights we learned in this study could be generalized with reasonable caution. In addition, variation in read error profiles is not the only factor that may affect the generality of the studies on sequencing design. Numerous technical and human factors are potential contributors.</p><p>While it is up to the individual investigator to decide whether the potential improvement in biological findings is worth the costs of the more expensive designs, this study provides a computational perspective and highlights the importance of using appropriate computational tools to maximize the power of the chosen design. For BWA alignments, we found that filtering improves the alignment accuracy, especially for SE and short reads, and trimming by option -q improves the coverage in aligning the long reads. However, despite the evidence presented in this paper and in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we acknowledge that trimming could be a contentious topic due to the potential bias it introduces in read density. When identifying peaks from PE designs, we suggest using a peak caller that fully leverages the paired-end information of the data. Without using appropriate computational tools in the analysis protocol, the extra cost of paired-end ChIP-Seq experiments may not be justified.</p><p>We systematically investigated the design effects using <italic>in silico</italic> data generated from ChIP-seq experimental data, instead of comparing publicly available ChIP-seq experiments using the same antibody and the cell line, but different designs. This is because our approach avoids the unnecessary variations in ChIP-seq experiments performed by different investigators using different facilities at different times. For example, ENCODE PE data are generally two to three years newer than their SE counterparts. In addition, generating <italic>in silico</italic> data via subsampling and trimming methods is common practice in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence it is reasonable to expect similar conclusions being drawn from the comparisons of the ChIP-seq experiments performed in exactly the same way except the read designs. We only considered Bowtie and BWA as aligners in our current study because they are currently the most commonly used read mappers in ChIP-seq analysis. We mainly used SPP for peak calling, because it works well with IDR, which allowed us to assess reproducibility. The majority of the popular peak detection tools (including SPP) do not process PE information appropriately. Thus we only included MOSAiCS and MACS2, two representative peak callers with such capability, instead of comparing all popular peak-calling tools. We focused on ChIP-seq experiments for transcription factors, and designed and adopted systematic evaluation criteria. Interesting extensions include cross-species comparisons of the design effects, and investigating the sequencing design effects on ChIP-seq experiments for histone modifications, and other experiments such as Bisulfite sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and 5-hmC sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>The impact of sequencing depth on the detection of enrichment regions and many other factors that affect alignment and peak calling in the context of ChIP-seq have been investigated by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our work extends the current literature in multiple important perspectives by focusing on the sequencing design parameters, considering multiple alignment strategies and evaluating the combinations of design and alignment strategies. Most importantly, our study represents the first systematic evaluation of the impact of ChIP-seq designs on ASB detection and highlights the power of PE designs for ASB detection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec41"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12859_2016_957_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
