A high root bark percentage (the percentage of the whole root area constituted by root cortex) has previously been associated with rootstock-induced dwarfing in apple. In this study, the root bark percentage was measured in a full-sib family of ungrafted apple rootstocks and found to be under the control of three loci. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root bark percentage were found to co-localize to the same genomic regions on chromosome 5 and chromosome 11 previously identified as controlling dwarfing, <italic>Dw1</italic> and <italic>Dw2</italic>, respectively. A third QTL was identified on chromosome 13 in a region that has not been previously associated with dwarfing. The development of closely linked sequence-tagged site markers improved the resolution of allelic classes, thereby allowing the detection of dominance and epistatic interactions between loci, with high root bark percentage only occurring in specific allelic combinations. In addition, we report a significant negative correlation between root bark percentage and stem diameter (an indicator of tree vigour), measured on a clonally propagated grafted subset of the mapping population. The demonstrated link between root bark percentage and rootstock-induced dwarfing of the scion leads us to propose a three-locus model that is able to explain levels of dwarfing from the dwarf &#8216;M.27&#8217; to the semi-invigorating rootstock &#8216;M.116&#8217;. Moreover, we suggest that the QTL on chromosome 13 (<italic>Rb3</italic>) might be analogous to a third dwarfing QTL, <italic>Dw3</italic>, which has not previously been identified.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Apple</kwd><kwd>grafting</kwd><kwd><italic>Malus &#215; domestica</italic></kwd><kwd>root anatomy</kwd><kwd>root bark percentage</kwd><kwd>root cortex</kwd><kwd>rootstock</kwd><kwd>rootstock-induced dwarfing</kwd><kwd>scion.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The technique of grafting has been practised for hundreds of years in order to maintain, crop and propagate many different fruits (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Feree and Carlson, 1987</xref>). Grafted trees are typically composed of two parts, the rootstock and the scion. The rootstock contributes the root system and the base of the stem while the scion is grafted on top of the rootstock and is the part of the tree that produces the fruit. The point of grafting between the two plant parts is known as the graft union (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mudge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). All temperate tree fruit crops grown commercially throughout the developed world are grafted onto rootstocks selected for specific traits such as growth control and early fruit production. Growth-controlling rootstocks have enabled the transition of low-yielding traditional orchards to high-density modern fruiting orchards, mainly through the vigour control they impart to the scion to produce compact trees (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mudge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This vigour control is gradual and cumulative, and interactions between rootstock, environment and scion can introduce variation into the growth of the composite tree. Rootstocks can also influence precocity and yield efficiency in addition to controlling some diseases (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Rom and Carlson, 1987</xref>). Between 1913 and 1915, researchers at the Wye College Fruit Experiment Station at East Malling collected a range of clonally propagated apple rootstocks used by nurseries in the UK and continental Europe and embarked on a process of detailed phenotypic characterization. This led to the description of the first nine &#8216;Malling&#8217; series of apple rootstocks (&#8216;M.1&#8217; to &#8216;M.9&#8217;), which included both dwarfing (&#8216;M.8&#8217; and &#8216;M.9&#8217;) and non-dwarfing types (&#8216;M.1&#8217; and &#8216;M.2&#8217;; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hatton, 1917</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Hatton, 1918</xref>). Breeding programmes in Europe, North America and New Zealand have since used the &#8216;Malling&#8217; series to develop novel apple rootstocks with improved pest and disease resistance that are better adapted to their local conditions (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Cummins and Aldwinckle, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Webster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Most commercially available dwarfing apple rootstocks can be traced to just one or two original sources, namely &#8216;M.9&#8217; and &#8216;M.8&#8217; (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Russo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which have been found to be closely related to <italic>Malus &#215; domestica</italic> using molecular analysis (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Oraguzie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A practical problem when using invigorating genotypes as a source of pest or disease resistance in breeding programmes is that the dwarfing effect of one parent is frequently lost in the first generation. As a result of this, dwarfing genotypes only reappear when F1 genotypes (derived from a dwarfing and a non-dwarfing parent) are crossed again to another dwarfing genotype. This is a serious limitation for breeding programmes because of the long generation cycles required to confidently evaluate rootstock performance and its effect on the scion. Robust molecular markers strongly linked to rootstock-induced dwarfing are a much-needed tool to hasten rootstock breeding.</p><p content-type="indent">Assessment of vigour control by a rootstock is not easy and earlier work to determine the genetic basis of vigour control in apple rootstocks has focused on above-ground traits such as trunk cross-sectional area, or visual assessment of growth habit and internode length (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Seleznyova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Rusholme-Pilcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Previous studies by <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Rusholme-Pilcher <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> identified two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with rootstock-induced dwarfing: <italic>Dwarfing 1</italic> (<italic>Dw1</italic>), at the top of linkage group/chromosome 5 (LG05) between markers CH03a09 and NZraAM18-700, and <italic>Dwarfing 2</italic> (<italic>Dw2</italic>), on linkage group/chromosome 11 (LG11) between markers CH02d08 and C13243 (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Rusholme-Pilcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The second QTL, <italic>Dw2</italic>, was initially identified assuming an additive model with <italic>Dw1</italic>, but was proposed to have non-additive effects after further analysis. The genetic model put forward by <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> was more predictive where either of the dwarfing loci was homozygous, and gave less accurate predictions of phenotype where either or both loci were heterozygous (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). A recent study by <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Foster <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> identified <italic>Dw2</italic> as an additive QTL, and they suggested that &#8216;<italic>Dw1</italic> has a stronger effect on rootstock-induced dwarfing than <italic>Dw2</italic>, and that <italic>Dw2</italic> may act as an enhancer of <italic>Dw1</italic>&#8217; (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Foster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

Both studies reported cases where <italic>Dw1</italic> was present yet the expected phenotype did not behave as predicted.</p><p content-type="indent">While many previous studies on dwarfing apple rootstocks have concentrated upon measuring a secondary conferred trait (i.e. the manifestation of vigour control in the scion), this study focuses on a primary rootstock trait known as root bark percentage. A high proportion of root cortical cells (hereafter termed root bark percentage) in the root of an apple rootstock has previously been associated with the ability of the rootstock to reduce the vigour of a grafted scion (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beakbane and Thompson, 1947</xref>). The aim of the present study was to identify QTLs for root bark percentage and to confirm whether there was an association with rootstock-induced dwarfing in the M432 mapping population.

The M432 family originally comprised 257 individuals of which 120 (population A) were maintained as low hedges (ungrafted and cut hard to encourage shoot production) for 10 growing seasons.

The roots were then carefully washed using a nailbrush to remove all the soil. For each root segment, a scalpel or a utility knife was used to remove a ring of bark (cortex) approximately 2&#8211;3mm in length, leaving behind the stele of the root. Digital calipers were used to make pairs of measurements of the root with and without the bark. The cross sectional area of the root and the percentage of total area occupied by the root bark were calculated for each sample, assuming that the root section was a perfect cylinder.

The most significant SNP linked to <italic>Rb2</italic> maps to 8.4Mb along the physical map of chromosome 11, while the most significant SSR is CH03d08, which maps &lt;1 cM away from CH02d08 in our map, confirming that <italic>Rb2</italic> and <italic>Dw2</italic> co-locate.</p><p content-type="indent">The third QTL, <italic>Rb3</italic>, was located on chromosome 13, a region that has not been previously identified in association with any important rootstock trait. <italic>Rb3</italic> is positioned approximately 2.2Mb along the physical map of chromosome 13 and does not co-localize with any known dwarfing locus. To our knowledge, this region on chromosome 13 has not been associated with any scion tree architecture phenotype. Through the use of a clonally propagated subset of the mapping population, a link between the effects of all three root bark loci and that of scion dwarfing was established.</p><p content-type="indent">The identification of eight genotypic classes (under a two-locus model) using a combination of SNP and microsatellite markers led to the clear observation that <italic>Rb2(b</italic>) on LG11 was absolutely required for the effect of <italic>Rb1(a</italic>) on LG05 to be expressed, demonstrating that there are non-additive effects of allelic combination upon the phenotype and that there is negative epistasis acting between the two loci. Furthermore, depending upon the allelic combination and allelic dosage at <italic>Rb2</italic>, the effect of <italic>Rb1(a</italic>) varied, indicating that some <italic>Rb2</italic> alleles were better able to compensate for the effect of <italic>Rb1(a</italic>) than others. The effect of <italic>Rb3(c</italic>) on root bark percentage appears in most situations to require <italic>Rb1(a</italic>) or <italic>Rb2(b</italic>) to be present to have a large effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw001/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>). Furthermore, when <italic>Rb3(c</italic>) was analysed in relation to stem dwarfing, it was found to interact significantly with <italic>Rb2(b</italic>) to alter stem diameter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw001/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw001/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>)&#8212;note that a full three-way analysis could not be performed in this experiement. In this study, the model of rootstock-induced dwarfing presented by <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, could not distinguish genotypically between the dwarfing &#8216;M27&#8217; rootstock and the semi-invigorating &#8216;M.116&#8217; rootstock (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The new three-locus model developed in this study provided resolution between the two closely related genotypes and, in addition, increased the percentage variance accounted for to 84%, significantly improving the total variance accounted for by 31% (<italic>P</italic>=0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>A central role for <italic>Rb2/Dw2</italic>
</title><p>Previous studies have emphasized the dominant role of <italic>Dw1(Rb1</italic>) in rootstock-induced dwarfing (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Rusholme-Pilcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Foster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), although these same studies reported cases where <italic>Dw1</italic> was present yet the expected phenotype did not behave as predicted. In addition, Foster and co-workers state: &#8216;<italic>Dw1</italic> has a stronger effect than <italic>Dw2</italic>&#8217; and that &#8216;<italic>Dw2</italic> alone cannot induce dwarfing&#8217;, and furthermore, Fazio <italic>et al</italic> reported peculiarities in that &#8216;homozygous individuals for non-dwarfing alleles at either <italic>Dw2</italic> or <italic>Dw1</italic> invalidate the effect of the dwarfing ability of the other dwarfing locus&#8217;. Our approach in this study has enabled us to identify epistatic interactions between all three <italic>Rb/Dw</italic> loci, and furthermore, determine that <italic>Rb2/Dw2</italic> plays a significant role in rootstock-induced dwarfing. Previous reports that several rootstocks contain <italic>Dw1</italic> yet have vigorous phenotypes, can now be explained in the light of our findings that <italic>Rb2/Dw2</italic> or <italic>Rb3/Dw3</italic> would need to be present for the dwarfing phenotype to manifest itself. Through a marker screen of selected rootstocks, we found the dwarfing rootstocks &#8216;Polish 22&#8217; and &#8216;Mac 9&#8217; only contain markers for <italic>Rb2/Dw2.</italic> This provides support for a central role for <italic>Dw2/Rb2</italic>, and as previously mentioned, also raises the possibility of other interacting loci that are yet to be determined. In addition, the dwarfing rootstock &#8216;Ottawa 3&#8217; does not have any of the markers linked to the three <italic>Rb</italic> QTLs, suggesting the <italic>Rb</italic> markers are unlinked to the QTLs in this genotype or that the dwarfing QTLs, previously identified by <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fazio <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>, have arisen independently, though this is unlikely with the dwarfing &#8216;M.9&#8217; as a parent.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Root bark percentage and rootstock-induced dwarfing</title><p>It cannot be stated that the amount of root bark directly affects dwarfing, as this could be the result of a pleiotropic effect of an as-yet-unidentified molecular process. However, vigour control over the scion is still observed with dwarfing rootstocks when they are used as an interstock (a stem piece of dwarfing rootstock grafted in between the rootstock and the scion to create a three-part composite tree), with the degree of dwarfing related to the length of the interstock such that a longer interstock confers a greater degree of dwarfing (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Feree and Carlson, 1987</xref>). In addition, bark grafts have also been shown to reduce tree vigour, whereby a ring of bark from a tree is removed and replaced with the bark of a dwarfing rootstock (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lockard and Schneider, 1981</xref>). In both cases, the bark is implicated in the process of vigour control to the scion; in the latter case, the causative agent is reduced to a far simpler component. However, if constituents within the bark are responsible for rootstock-induced dwarfing, there is currently little information to suggest the identification of the genes responsible or the primary mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, although key hormones such as auxin, abscisic acid and cytokinins, as well as chemical compounds including phenolic acids and flavonoids, have all been implicated (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Beakbane, 1956</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Yadava and Lockard, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Kamboj <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Van Hooijdonk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In woody perennial systems, there is a paucity of information on the development of the secondary vascular cambium and the cellular processes involved in the determination of cambial cell fate. The vascular cambium of trees undergoes asymmetric cell division to differentiate into secondary phloem and xylem cells. It is the cambium that is responsible for the secondary growth leading to the radial thickening of trees (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Esau, 1965</xref>). The developmental and regulatory networks of vascular cambium differentiation are little understood, yet vascular cellular organization and ontogeny are central to all plant functions, playing a vital role in plant growth and development. Fundamental studies into root bark development and the genetic mechanisms underlying the determination of cambial cell fate in the developing stem and root system would provide important insights into many aspects of woody perennial development. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of high root bark percentage in apple rootstocks and how these cellular mechanisms may interact with the scion, including the correlation between root bark percentage and rootstock-induced dwarfing. An alternative explanation for the tight linkage between <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>Dw</italic> loci might be that they are a consequence of linkage drag (high root bark percentage being unintentionally selected alongside rootstock-induced dwarfing) in breeding programmes. However, it is unlikely that QTLs for root bark variation and scion dwarfing would be genetically linked to all three rootstock dwarfing loci without a mechanistic explanation.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated a link between root bark percentage and rootstock-induced dwarfing in a rootstock mapping population. Through the identification of three QTLs for root bark percentage, a three-locus model for predicting rootstock-induced dwarfing to the scion has been developed. The rootstocks &#8216;M.27&#8217; and &#8216;M.116&#8217; confer different levels of vigour control towards the scion, and with the identification of 24&#8211;64 genotypic classes, we are now able to differentiate genotypically between &#8216;M.27&#8217; and &#8216;M.116&#8217; allowing resolution of dominance effects. In addition, we can use the information provided by the development of a three-locus model to further our understanding of rootstock-induced dwarfing by developing new mapping populations that will enable fine mapping of each QTL to identify the genes underlying it and to study the effects of individual QTL. Furthermore, this model can now be incorporated into rootstock breeding programmes to aid marker-assisted breeding strategies. This study is an important step towards the understanding of the genetic mechanism(s) underlying an important rootstock trait and has provided useful molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s29"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw001/-/DC1">Figure S1</ext-link>.
