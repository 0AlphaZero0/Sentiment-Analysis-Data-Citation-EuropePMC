The genus <italic>Macroorchis</italic> was erected by Ando [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> in Japan, and 3 additional species have been reported in Japan [<xref rid="b3-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The adults of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> were collected from the small intestine of mammals, infected naturally or experimentally, such as dogs, cats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and albino and house rats [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, human infections have never been reported. Freshwater crabs, <italic>Potamon dehaani</italic> and <italic>Potamon obrusipes</italic>, and crayfish, <italic>Cambaroides similis</italic> were known as intermediate hosts of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Chai et al. [<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] redescribed <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> in Korea based on adult worms because some morphological features of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> were different from the original descriptions by Ando [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>As other species, <italic>Macroorchis himizu</italic> [<xref rid="b3-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], <italic>Macroorchis chimarrogalus</italic>, and <italic>Macroorchis elongatus</italic> [<xref rid="b4-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have been described as new species in Japan according to recognition of one or more morphological differences, distinctive intermediate hosts, and geographical distribution. However, identification of trematodes with similar morphology is at times difficult and needs decision of a specialized person. In this case, molecular studies may be helpful for their identification as well as understanding the genetic relationships. However, no molecular information of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> has been available to date. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed genetic characteristics of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> on the basis of the sequences of ITS1 region in 18S ribosomal RNA.</p><p>A total of 10 crayfish, <italic>Cambaroides similis</italic>, were caught in the streams in Isipgokri, Hwasun-eup, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do Province, Korea from March to May 2015 (<xref rid="f1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The crayfish were crushed with a mortar and a pestle, and washed with physiological saline. <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> metacercariae were collected from the sediment under a dissecting microscope. Two female ICR mice at 6 weeks of age were orally fed each with 150 metacercariae. The mice were sacrificed at 4 days after the infection. The small intestine of mice was resected out and divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Intestinal contents were washed in physiological saline, and <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> flukes were recovered from the sediments under a dissecting microscope. The recovered metacercariae (excysted under cover slip pressure) and adult flukes were washed with cold physiological saline 3 times and fixed with 10% formalin, and stained with Semichon&#8217;s acetocarmine. Both fresh and stained specimens were observed under light microscopy.</p><p>In order to characterize the worms genetically, nucleotide sequences of 18S ribosomal RNA (ITS1 region) genes from adult worms were analyzed. The total genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted by DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The DNA region comprising 18S rRNA, ITS1, and 5.8S rDNA was amplified by PCR using primers BD1 (forward: 5&#180;-GTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTA-3&#180;) [<xref rid="b3-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 5.8S_R1 (reverse: 5&#180;-CGATGTTCAAAGCAGTATGC-3&#180;) designed in this study. PCR was carried out in 25 &#956;l of total volume, which contained 3 &#956;l of DNA solution (20-40 ng), Smart 2&#215; PCR premix Taq (Solgent, Daejeon, Korea), and 2 &#956;l of each primer. The mixture was undergone initial denaturation at 94&#730;C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94&#730;C for 40 sec, annealing at 55&#730;C for 45 sec, and extension at 72&#730;C for 1 min with a final extension at 72&#730;C for 5 min [<xref rid="b5-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The products were then separated by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels containing 1 &#181;g/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. Sequencing was carried out using a capillary automated ABI PRISM 3700 DNA sequencher (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea). The GenBank Blast program was used for ITS sequences comparisons. After alignment of the sequences by ClustalW (Free Software Foundation, Boston, Massachusetts, USA), a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method.</p><p>A total of 355 <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> metacercariae were collected from 10 crayfishes. The metacercariae were round, 180 &#956;m in average diameter, encysted with 2 layers of thick walls, but their stylet on the oral sucker was not distinctly seen (<xref rid="f1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The oral sucker was large. The acetabulum was smaller than the oral sucker and was located in mid-body. The excretory bladder was eccentric and contained numerous dark excretory granules. When the adult flukes were harvested from mice at 4 days post-infection, the overall recovery rate was about 30% (99/355). The adult flukes were oval in shape and 760-820 &#956;m long and 320-450 &#956;m wide, with anterolateral location of 2 large testes. The large testes occupied the mid-lateral regions of the body. Vitelline glands were follicular and distributed superficially from the posterior end of the body to the level of the pharynx. The uterus was convoluted in the portion of the body posterior to the ovary (<xref rid="f1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p>Six randomly selected <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> adult specimens were undergone sequencing of the ITS region. All of the samples revealed 82% identity with <italic>Paragonimus ohirai</italic> (GenBank no. AF040930), 82% identity with <italic>Paragonimus kellicotti</italic> (no. HQ900670.1), 81% identity with <italic>Paragonimus westermani</italic> (no. AF040933, AF040932, AF040928), 79% identity with <italic>Paragonimus</italic> macrorchis (no. AF040936), 76% identity with Metagonimus yokogawai (no. KJ631740.1), and 75% identity with <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> (no. KJ137226.1). The phylogenetic tree based on the ITS1 sequences showed a single clade of the 6 <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> samples analyzed in this study. However, they were distinguished from <italic>Paragonimus</italic> species and other trematodes (<xref rid="f2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Although discrimination of different parasite species conventionally has been mainly based on morphological difference, limitation always exists due to subjective features according to the inspector. In addition to morphological characteristics, intermediate hosts, and regional distribution should also be considered in the proposal of the species. In Korea, <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> was redescribed by Chai et al. [<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as follows: oval body, ovary in variable position, median or shifted to the right or left side, apparently bilobed seminal vesicle, absence of seminal receptable, and vitellaria extending from the level of the pharynx, presence of a stylet on the oral sucker in about 1/4 of the specimens, nearly equal size of the acetabulum and oral sucker, ceca terminating near 1/5-1/6 body portion from the posterior extremity, genital pore just behind the ventral sucker, and more posterior location of the seminal vesicle.</p><p>Our specimens were consistent with these amended morphological descriptions. We also support that the crayfish is a second intermediate host for <italic>M. spinulosus</italic>, caught from a stream in the southwestern area of Korea. Thus, in addition to Gangwon-do [<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Gyeongsangnam-do [<xref rid="b6-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] we suggest that Jeollanam-do Province should also be recognized as an ecological focus of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> in the Korean peninsula. Adult flukes of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> were collected from the small intestine of naturally or experimentally infected mammalian animals in Japan and Korea [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b6-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, humans may possibly be a natural definitive host which should be clarified in the future.</p><p>Interestingly, intermediate hosts of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> are different according to the region; in Japan, freshwater crabs, <italic>P. dehaani</italic> and <italic>P. obrusipes</italic>, were reported [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, in Korea, crayfish, C. similis, is known [<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Until now, only 4 English literature about <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> are available [<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b6-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is noted that this is the first molecular work which can be a cornerstone of phylogenic studies. Considering that there are some discrepancies in morphological features of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> between Japanese and Korean study [<xref rid="b1-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the use of molecular methods may be helpful for species confirmation and understanding their genetic relationships. Although there are 3 other species of <italic>Macroorchis</italic> (<italic>M. himizu</italic>, <italic>M. chimarrogalus</italic>, and <italic>M. elongatus</italic>) [<xref rid="b3-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-kjp-54-1-109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we could not evaluate their genetic relationship with <italic>M. spinulosus</italic>, because their molecular sequences have never been reported.</p><p>In the current study, a relatively close genetic relationship was found between <italic>M. spinulosus</italic> and <italic>Paragonimus</italic> spp. rather than the other trematodes. This finding is interesting and supported by that they share the same intermediate hosts, and also present morphological similarities in their eggs, cercariae, metacercariae, and adult worms, albeit their habitats were different (lung vs small intestine).</p><p>The present study is the first molecular characterization of <italic>M. spinulosus</italic>, allowing a reliable approach for genetic differentiation of <italic>Macroorchis</italic> spp. and providing basis for further studies on trematode fauna in Korea. We suggest that further studies using more polymorphic genetic markers such as mitochondrial DNA may be necessary for wider range of molecular analysis of <italic>Macroorchis</italic> and other related trematode species.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>We have no conflict of interest related to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-kjp-54-1-109"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="paper"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ando</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>On a new trematode with the freshwater crab as its intermediate host</article-title><comment>Tokyo Iji Shinshi 1918; no. 2081: 10-17 (in Japanese)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-kjp-54-1-109"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Sohn</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Huh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Redescription of <italic>Macroorchis spinulosus</italic> Ando, 1918 (Digenea: Nanophyetidae) encysted in the fresh water crayfish, <italic>Cambaroides similis</italic></article-title><source>Korean J Parasitol</source><year>1996</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8820735</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-kjp-54-1-109"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Machida</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Some helminth parasites of the Japanese shrew mole from the Izu Peninsula</article-title><source>Memo Nat Sci Museum</source><year>1982</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>149</fpage><lpage>154</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-kjp-54-1-109"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Two new intestinal trematodes, <italic>Macroorchis chimarrogalus</italic> n. sp. and <italic>Macroorchis elongatus</italic> n. sp. from Japanese water shrew and others, with a description of the metacercaria of <italic>Macroorchis chimarrogalus</italic> n. sp.
