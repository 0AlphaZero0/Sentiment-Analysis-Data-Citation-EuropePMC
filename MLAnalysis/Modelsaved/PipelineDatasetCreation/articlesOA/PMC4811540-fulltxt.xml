However, little is known about the role of FN during viral infection. In the present study, we found significantly higher levels of FN in sera, and liver tissues from hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients relative to healthy individuals. HBV expression enhanced FN mRNA and protein levels in the hepatic cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. HBV infection of susceptible HepG2-sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide cells also increased FN expression. We also found that transcriptional factor specificity protein 1 was involved in the induction of FN by HBV. Knockdown of FN expression significantly inhibited HBV DNA replication and protein synthesis through activating endogenous IFN-&#945; production. In addition, FN interacted with the transforming growth factor &#946;-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein complex and attenuated interferon signaling by inhibiting TAK1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B/p65 was found to be inhibited by FN. We also observed that FN promoted HBV enhancers to support HBV expression. These results suggest novel functions of endogenous FN involved in immune evasion and maintenance of HBV replication.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by research grants from the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (2013CB911102), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81461130019, 81271821 and 31570870), National Mega Project on Major Infectious Diseases Prevention (2012ZX10004503-004).

Approximately one-third of the world&#8217;s population has serological evidence of past or present infection with HBV, and 240 million people are chronic HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with 500,000 to 1.2 million deaths per year caused by HBV infections [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, the immunomodulator IFN-&#945; is one of the few antiviral agents licensed for the treatment of chronic HBV infection[<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Fibronectin (FN) exists as a protein dimer, consisting of two nearly identical polypeptide chains linked by a pair of C-terminal disulfide bonds [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Each FN monomer has a molecular weight of 230&#8211;250 kDa and contains three types of modules: type I, II, and III. Two types of FN are present in vertebrates: soluble plasma FN is a major protein component of blood plasma (approximately 300 &#956;g/ml) and is produced in the liver by hepatocytes; insoluble cellular FN is a major component of the extracellular matrix that binds to the membrane-spanning receptor proteins, integrins. Similar to integrins, FN binds extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibrin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. FN is secreted by various cells, primarily fibroblasts, as a soluble protein dimer and is then assembled into an insoluble matrix in a complex cell-mediated process. FN plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation, as well as wound healing and embryonic development [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Altered FN expression, degradation, and organization has been associated with a number of pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Type I IFN (mainly IFN&#945;/&#946;) are expressed in response to the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors produced by viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Depending on TLRs, the IFN signal pathway can be classified as TLR-dependent and TLR-independent signal pathway. In the TLR-dependent signal pathway, viral DNA was sensed by TLR9 and then recruits MyD88, IRAKs and activation of TRAF6, an ubiquitin E3 ligase. On the one hand, TRAF6 ubiquitination activates IRF7 mediated IFN production; on the other hand, TRAF6 interacts with TAK1-TAB complex to activate the phosphorylation of TAK1 and then induces the activation of the transcription factors NF-&#954;B and AP-1 to induce type I IFN production, respectively[<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that FN can facilitate the entry of gammaretrovirus, influenza A virus, and rhabdovirus [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Regarding HBV, FN was found to bind HBsAg [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152721.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], is capable of accelerating HBV infection in primary cultured fetal hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and may be important for HBV propagation [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, HBV X antigen up-regulates FN expression and is co-expressed with FN mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All these studies imply that FN may play a role during HBV replication and expression, but the detailed molecular mechanisms by which FN affects HBV replication remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying the essential role of FN in HBV replication and expression and identified two previously unrecognized functions of endogenous FN during HBV replication. Firstly, HBV upregulated the expression of FN in both clinical samples and cultured cells. In turn, the increased FN antagonized the endogenous interferon pathway, leading to enhanced HBV DNA replication and protein synthesis. Secondly, FN promoted HBV replication and expression by strengthening the recruitment of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4&#945;) to HBV enhancer II (EII). Our results reveal the importance of liver-specific host factors that contribute to HBV maintenance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Clinical Samples and Human Subjects</title><p>Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) admitted to Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University (33 males and 17 females, with a mean age of 48.1&#177;11.6 years).

HBV promoter reporter constructs EI and EII were transfected into Huh7 cells along with pFN. Results from the luciferase activity assays indicated that FN activated both HBV EI and EII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). After screening the effects of FN on the expression of seven transcriptional factors (HNF-4&#945;, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#945; (PPAR&#945;), retinoid X receptor &#945; (RXR&#945;), farnesoid X receptor &#945; (FXR&#945;), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), estrogen-related receptor (ERR)&#946;, and ERR&#947;) which are known to support HBV transcription, we found that only HNF-4&#945; was regulated by FN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152721.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, wild-type HBV EI and EII, and HNF-4&#945;-mutant EI and EII constructs (EI HNF-4&#945;-Mut and EII HNF-4&#945;-Mut) were co-transfected into Huh7 cells along with shNC or shFN. Subsequent luciferase activity assays showed that knockdown of FN reduced the activity of both wild-type EI and EI HNF-4&#945;-Mut significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of FN only inhibited the activity of wild-type EII but not EII HNF-4&#945;-Mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). These data suggest that FN may selectively enhance HNF-4&#945;-mediated HBV EII activity.</p><p>We then examined HNF-4&#945; expression by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis before and after the knockdown of FN to verify our previous results. We found that knockdown of FN reduced HNF-4&#945; mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). In addition, NC-KD cells and FN-KD cells were transfected with pHBV, and ChIP assays were then performed to test the binding capability of HNF-4&#945; to HBV EI and EII. The results showed that binding of HNF-4&#945; to HBV EII decreased significantly in FN-KD cells compared with NC-KD cells. In contrast, binding of HNF-4&#945; to HBV EI showed scarcely any change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). These results demonstrate that FN promotes HNF-4&#945;-mediated HBV EII, but not EI, activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are few studies regarding the relationship between FN and HBV, but it is suggested that human liver sinusoid FN binds to HBV [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, asialoglycoprotein receptor, FN, and HBsAg were found to bind to each other. Both asialoglycoprotein receptor and FN could promote the binding of HBsAg to several cell types [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other studies found that FN accelerates HBV infection in primary cultured fetal hepatocytes in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and that protease cleavage or anti-sense oligonucleotide treatment indicate that FN is important for HBV propagation [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152721.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These previous studies indicate that FN may be involved in HBV expression and replication; however, a detailed mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we found novel roles for FN in facilitating HBV expression and replication. Firstly, HBV upregulated FN expression in both clinical samples and cultured cells. The increased FN then antagonized the endogenous IFN pathway, leading to enhanced viral protein synthesis and HBV DNA replication. Secondly, FN promoted HBV replication and expression by strengthening the recruitment of HNF-4&#945; to HBV EII. Our results reveal the important contributions of host factors to HBV maintenance.</p><p>Considering that FN expression is elevated in HBV patients, we used different types of hepatic cell cultures to verify whether the up-regulation of FN was induced by HBV. HBV enhanced FN expression at both mRNA and protein levels <italic>in vitro</italic>, as similar as in HBV patients. Although the induction of FN was only about 2 to 3 folds, it has important physiological significance as FN is one of the most abundant proteins in the hepatocytes and serum[<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we constructed a stable FN-KD cell line to investigate the role of FN in HBV replication. HBV expression and replication declined in FN-KD cells, and HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA were rescued by exogenous FN. Interestingly, the rescued level of HBsAg was significantly higher than that of HBeAg and HBV DNA when compared with their corresponding controls. The HBsAg synthesis pathway is separated from the viral replication pathway, although it is synthesized from the same viral genome as HBV DNA [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This may explain why the rescued HBsAg level is not entirely in accordance with HBeAg or HBV DNA.</p><p>Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small satellite RNA virus of HBV and propagates only when coexisting with HBV. Viral hepatitis D is considered as one of the most severe forms of human viral hepatitis. Although some efforts were made, the mechanisms and therapies for HVD infection remains unclear [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152721.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. HDV markers may reflect the infection of HBV to a certain extent. In previous reports, seven days post HDV infected with Huh7, HepG2, Hepa1&#8211;6 and AML-12 cells expressed NTCP, HDAg can be evidently detected [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In Human NTCP transgenic mice, HDV RNA reached peak level around 6 day post infection [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The time of FN induction was day 9 post HBV infected HepG2-NTCP cells and it is comparable to the reported observation of HDV which may indicate the induction of FN was followed the production of HBV and HDV.</p><p>IFN-&#945; remains one of the most effective compounds in HBV therapy even though HBV is considered an immune-resistant virus. Previous study showed that HBV could inhibit the innate responses in HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the present study, we identified a previously undescribed role for FN in facilitating HBV expression and replication by hampering the production of IFN-&#945; and ISGs. The liver is not only an immune organ but also plays a role in immune tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and we found that FN inhibits IFN-&#945; and ISG production. In addition, the adaptor proteins in the IFN pathway, the TAK1-TAB complex, were found to interact with FN, and TAK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by FN. According to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g005">Fig 5D, FN</xref> did not significantly influence IFN-&#945; promoter activity without virus infection. Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, the interaction between FN and the TAK-TAB complex was much weaker before virus incubation, suggesting that HBV promotes the expression of FN and triggers the interaction between FN and the TAK1-TAB complex to maintain its expression and replication.</p><p>We found that the C-terminal domain of the FN functional domain had the strongest interaction with TAB3 in the TAK1-TAB complex. The other segments also had some interaction with the TAK1-TAB complex, possibly due to the peculiar structure of FN. Cellular FN has many repeating domains with many similarities and only few significant differences among the domains [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152721.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152721.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and it has also been suggested that more than one domain of FN binds to heparin and fibrin [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>As a general rule, host cells can sense the viral infection and activate innate/adaptive immue response. However, some virus including HBV do not trigger a strong immune response nor induce an obvious production of type I IFN [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Previous studies have showed that HBV inhibits antiviral immunity, induces immune tolerance as well as inhibits type I IFN production and signaling [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Besides, HBV protein components can impair type I IFN transcription in different ways [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].Because of these reasons, we used Sendai virus as an alternative agonist to stimulate IFN-&#945; production to study the mechanism of FN in interfering IFN signaling.</p><p>In addition to inhibition of IFN-&#945; production, HBV EI and EII were also activated by FN to facilitate HBV expression and replication. Interestingly, FN selectively influenced the HNF-4&#945; binding capacity to HBV EII but not HBV EI. This result may be partly attributed to the fact that there is only one transcriptional factor (HNF-4&#945;) binding site in the 1660&#8211;1680 bp region in HBV EII [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but there are a few transcription factor (HNF-4&#945;, PPAR&#945;, and RXR&#945;) binding sites in the HBV EI 990&#8211;1020 bp region [<xref rid="pone.0152721.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These other transcriptional factors may have an alternative role, which necessitates further investigation.</p><p>In the present study, we uncovered the mechanisms by which FN facilitates HBV replication. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152721.g009">Fig 9</xref>, HBV increased FN expression through activation of Sp1. In turn, the induced FN facilitates HBV expression and replication through two distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, FN binds to the TAK1-TAB complex, inhibits TAK1 phosphorylation and reduces the nuclear translocation of NF-&#954;B p65 to decrease IFN-&#945; production; on the other hand, FN increases HNF-4&#945;-mediated HBV EII activity. Together with those of previous studies, our results suggest that FN may be a potential and attractive target for HBV therapy.</p><fig id="pone.0152721.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0152721.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>A schematic figure shows the relationship between FN and HBV.</title><p>HBV increases FN expression through activation of Sp1.
