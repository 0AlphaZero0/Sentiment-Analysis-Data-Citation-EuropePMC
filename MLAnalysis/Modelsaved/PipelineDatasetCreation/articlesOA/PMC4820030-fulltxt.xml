The nature and causative relationship of DNA sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most TSS by RNA polymerase II remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) represents the most dramatic change of the transcriptome repertoire in vertebrate life cycle<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the 10<sup>th</sup> cell cycle, marking the <italic>midblastula transition</italic> (MBT)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of TSS selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed TSS usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We show that the transition from maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterised by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of TSS usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific TSS selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic TSS selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (+1) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveals their DNA sequence-associated positioning at promoters prior to zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription-independent adjustment to the final position downstream of zygotic TSS. The two TSS-defining grammars coexist often in physical overlap in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P8">Mapping of transcription start sites using CAGE<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> identified two major promoter classes with respect to the TSS precision<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>: &#8220;sharp&#8221; promoters with one predominant TSS often associated with a TATA-box that determines the TSS selection, and &#8220;broad&#8221; promoters with a wider distribution of TSSs often overlapping a CpG island. Even with recent reports of prevalence of known core promoter elements in human promoters<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, the actual mechanism for choosing TSSs within vertebrate promoters in various cell types and conditions remains unknown.</p><p id="P9">To address the developmental stage-specific promoter usage throughout early embryonic development, we analysed a nucleotide-resolution map of transcription initiation events in the zebrafish genome, generated by CAGE across 12 stages from unfertilised egg to organogenesis<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The data revealed numerous cases of promoter dynamics, where maternal mRNAs were initiated from different positions than zygotic transcripts, often with shifting of TSS positions within a single promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Clustering of individual TSSs by expression profile revealed several major classes of TSS dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>): TSSs present preferentially in maternal (pre-MBT) stages (blue) reflecting maternally inherited transcripts, as opposed to those activated in early (orange) or later (red) zygotic stage (post-MBT). Additional clusters included constitutively present TSSs (green) and TSSs with peak activity at the transitional stages (yellow), confirming major changes in the zebrafish transcriptome initiated at MBT<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. An equivalent clustering of entire promoters revealed a similar pattern (Extended Data Fig. 1a). However, promoters with no change in the overall expression level often contained population of TSSs with very heterogeneous relative usage during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 1b-d).</p><p id="P11">The observed differential TSS utilisation between inherited (maternal) and <italic>de novo</italic> transcribed (zygotic) mRNAs suggested distinct rules for TSS selection acting within the same promoter in the oocyte and the embryo. To reveal underlying signatures guiding differential promoter interpretation by the maternal and zygotic transcription machinery, we further dissected the maternal- and zygotic-specific promoter usage. We first identified a subset of promoters similar to the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, showing a significant degree of shifting between maternally and zygotically utilized TSSs (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Our set contained 911 &#8220;shifting&#8221; promoters whose CAGE signal in pre- and post-MBT stages overlapped by less than 40% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The TSS shift happened in either direction but mainly within a narrow window of up to 100 bp (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Their preferred maternal and zygotic TSS displayed antagonistic developmental dynamics, with degradation of inherited maternal transcripts and gradual activation of zygotic ones (Extended Data Fig. 2d).</p><p id="P12">Aligning sequences of shifting promoters by their maternal dominant TSS revealed a clear enrichment of T and/or A containing (WW) dinucleotides ~30 bp upstream of maternal TSS, hinting at the presence of a functional TATA-like element<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 2e). In contrast, zygotic TSS did not show TATA-like signal in the expected position, but a sharp SS&#8739;WW boundary in local C/G and A/T dinucleotide enrichment precisely aligned ~50 bp downstream of zygotic TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 2e). This suggests two fundamentally different sequence signals guiding transcription initiation in the oocyte and the embryo.</p><p id="P13">Only a small fraction of maternal TSSs (&lt; 10%) had a canonical TATA-box motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), whereas the majority contained other A/T-rich pentamers (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Motif discovery revealed the presence of an A/T-rich motif (<italic>W-box</italic>) with lower information content than canonical TATA-box, but equally positioned 30 bp upstream of the maternal TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, zygotic TSS did not show presence of TATA-box or W-box in the expected upstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). This reveals a shift from W-box motif-dependent TSS selection in the maternal transcriptome to zygotic W-box-independent TSS selection, <italic>i.e.</italic> the existence of two major, independent mechanisms for defining transcription initiation acting on the same core promoter.</p><p id="P14">We hypothesized that the uncovered rules for maternal and zygotic TSS selection may apply generally for all constitutively expressed genes, even in the absence of clear TSS shifting. The dinucleotide analysis on all 8369 constitutively expressed promoters showed the same precise positioning of the W-box signal upstream of the maternal dominant TSS, and the alignment of zygotic TSS with downstream SS&#8739;WW boundary, as seen in the &#8220;shifting&#8221; promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3a-c). This confirmed a promoterome-wide distinction between determinants that govern TSS selection in the oocyte and the embryo, and demonstrated that complex TSS patterns in constitutively expressed promoters represent readouts of two independent grammars intertwined in the same core promoter regions.</p><p id="P15">Finally, we showed that exclusively maternal and exclusively zygotic promoters also utilise the corresponding stage-specific TSS selection signals (Extended Data Fig. 3f-h). These results confirm a global change in promoter interpretation that constitutes a central part of maternal to zygotic transition, with fundamental difference in the TSS selection mechanism used by the transcription machinery in the oocyte and the embryo.</p><p id="P16">Fixed spacing between the motif and the TSS imposed by the W-box-dependent initiation in the oocyte predicts &#8220;sharp&#8221; TSS configuration<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The set of maternal broad promoters, which seemingly contradicted the imposed constraints, revealed a novel promoter architecture composed of multiple individual relatively sharp CAGE tag clusters (TCs), each with its associated W-box at fixed ~-30 bp position (Extended Data Fig. 4). On the other hand, the exclusively zygotic promoters showed a less constrained distribution of TSSs, revealing the familiar shape of a broad promoter<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, with majority (&gt;70%) containing only one broad TC (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). Constitutively used promoters changed their shape accordingly, from single or multiple &#8220;sharp&#8221; TSS configuration in the maternal stages, to &#8220;broad&#8221; in zygotic stages (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Thus, the switch between maternal and zygotic TSS is accompanied by a global change in the promoter architecture within the same region.</p><p id="P17">To functionally validate the observed TSS selection grammars, we identified the W-boxes and dinucleotide frequency patterns in a constitutively active promoter (<italic>sf3a2</italic>) and mutated all W-boxes associated with maternal TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) for analysis in transgenic zebrafish. Fluorescence reporter activity and 5&#8242; RACE assays demonstrated that removal of all W-boxes did not influence zygotic transgene activity or zygotic TSS selection (Extended Data Fig. 6), confirming W-box independent promoter usage in the embryo. To validate the W-box dependent TSS selection in the oocyte, we analysed maternal TSS selection in early F1 embryos from stable transgenic lines with wild type or mutated variant of the <italic>sf3a2</italic> promoter. We developed a novel method (single locus CAGE; SL-CAGE; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) for detection and relative quantification of TSS usage at 1 bp resolution within targeted promoter. TSS usage patterns of the wild type <italic>sf3a2</italic> transgene promoter in early embryos of several transgenic lines were highly reproducible and perfectly correlated with the maternal TSS usage of the endogenous <italic>sf3a2</italic> gene as well as with that seen by CAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7). The removal of W-boxes severely reduced the use of associated downstream positions as TSSs in the mutant transgenic lines compared to the wild type and led to an aberrant TSS usage pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7d; P &lt; 0.01), confirming that the selection of these TSSs depends on W-box signal in the oocyte. These results strongly support two independent TSS selection mechanisms used by the oocyte and the embryo within a single promoter.</p><p id="P18">To address the relationship between stage-specific TSS selection and chromatin configuration, we analysed the positioning of H3K4me3 and H2A.Z containing nucleosomes at core promoters by ChIP-seq. It was shown that H3K4me3 marking on promoter associated nucleosomes precedes gene transcription during zebrafish genome activation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The data revealed precise positioning of the first downstream (+1) nucleosome ~50 bp from the preferred zygotic TSS, but no fixed spacing to the maternal TSS for all constitutively active promoters in the zygotic (prim 6) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3d). We observed a less sharp nucleosome alignment to the zygotic TSS in earlier stages, including the 512 cells stage, which precedes the onset of zygotic transcription. In contrast, no alignment of H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes to the maternal TSS was detected in any stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These results revealed a positional interdependency between zygotic TSS and the +1 nucleosome in the embryo as a feature of zygotic TSS selection grammar, independent of the W-box motif-guided TSS selection in the oocyte. Promoter-associated nucleosome alignment corresponded with alternating WW&#8739;SS patterns downstream of zygotic TSS (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,c</xref>), providing internucleosomal position signal. At a higher resolution the nucleosome-occupied DNA downstream of zygotic TSS displayed a 10 bp periodicity in AA and TT dinucleotide enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3e), previously identified as intranuclesomal positioning signal<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The strong association of zygotic, but not maternal TSS, with these nucleosome positioning signals argues that TSS selection in a vertebrate oocyte is independent of inter- and intra-nucleosomal DNA signals.</p><p id="P19">Recent efforts to identify sequence-based signals for nucleosome positioning<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and dynamic nucleosome organisation at promoters<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> highlight the epigenetic and chromatin mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> that, together with DNA sequence, direct transcription initiation. The association of nucleosome positioning signals with zygotic promoter activity described here raises the question whether promoter-associated nucleosome positioning contributes to regulation of positioning of transcription initiation, or is merely a consequence of transcription at the predefined position. To investigate this relationship we analysed the DNA sequence underlying +1 nucleosome positioning in the transcriptionally silent pre- (512 cells) and active post-MBT (prim 6) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 8). In pre-MBT stage, H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes occupied CG/GC enriched region and centred at the peak of highest CG/GC enrichment, often directly overlapping the TSSs of the maternal transcripts, supporting the idea that H3K4me3 initially appears at CpG islands prior to transcription<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In the post-MBT stage the +1 nucleosome was positioned just downstream of the SS&#8739;WW enrichment boundary at ~50bp from the zygotic TSS, occupying a WW-enriched region, with a small local GC/CG peak at the nucleosome midpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 8b). Additional downstream nucleosomes followed a similar pattern of WW-enriched bound DNA alternating with internucleosomal SS enrichment. The local GC/CG enrichment at the nucleosome midpoints is in accordance with previously described nucleosome positioning preferences<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; however, the additional sequence preference complexity and its relation to TSS in different developmental stages were not reported so far. The results show that initial positioning of promoter-associated nucleosomes, which correlates with a broad internucleosomal phasing pattern, changes in later stages to final precise positioning, which correlates tightly with zygotic transcription initiation site and intranucleosomal phasing patterns, suggesting interdependence of final nucleosome positioning and transcription. To test this, we ranked throughout-active genes by the timing of onset of their zygotic transcription and analysed their H3K4me3-marked nucleosome positioning patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). No association between the timing of transcription activation and precision of nucleosome positioning was found, arguing against transcriptionally aided nucleosome readjustment and instead suggesting a pre-transcriptional process in repositioning of nucleosomes to their final position, in agreement with transcription-independent positioning of nucleosomes at promoters in human cells<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Consistently, H3K4me3 ChIPseq in TBP knock-down embryos (Extended Data Fig. 9) showed no change in the overall H3K4me3 recruitment and nucleosome positioning at TBP-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>), demonstrating that H3K4me3-marked nucleosome positioning at these genes does not require TBP-dependent recruitment of transcription initiation machinery or active transcription.</p><p id="P20">The absence of nucleosome-positioning sequence signature, as well as of precise nucleosome positioning at promoters with canonical TATA-box in other systems<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, together with narrow TSS peaks, argues in favour of the W-box as the overriding determinant of maternal TSS selection. The similarity of the W-box to TATA-box suggests that transcription initiation in the oocyte may be mediated by the oocyte-enriched transcription nucleating factor TBP2<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Conversely, early zygotic grammar prefers TSS position at a fixed range from the precisely positioned +1 nucleosome, suggesting a mechanism in which the initiation complex chooses initiator-like sequences within a &#8220;catchment area&#8221; determined by the nucleosome position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This model is compatible with motif-independent TFIID recruitment by H3K4me3-TAF3 interactions<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and emphasizes the interdependence of nucleosome configuration at promoters with promoter type and physiological state in vertebrates<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and yeast<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Different TSS selection grammars deployed at separate promoters have been associated with different types of genes<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and a handful of promoters were shown to switch between TATA-dependent and independent initiation<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Here we show for the first time that the two grammars co-exist in close proximity or in physical overlap genome-wide and are differentially utilised at thousands of promoters active in both the oocyte and the embryo. The multiple layers of information embedded in the same short sequence, each representing a different aspect of a complex regulation, are part of the reason why promoter codes have been so difficult to detect. Our findings on overlapping promoter grammars have implications for future analyses of promoter content and function.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>CAGE tags mapping and CTSS calling</title><p id="P24">Sequenced CAGE tags (27 bp) from Nepal <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were mapped to a reference zebrafish genome (Zv9/danRer7 assembly) using Bowtie<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> with default parameters allowing up to 2 mismatches and keeping only uniquely mapped reads.
