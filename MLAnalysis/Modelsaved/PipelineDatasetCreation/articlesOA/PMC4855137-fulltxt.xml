Treatments with antibiotics or biocides are often ineffective in eradicating biofilms. Promising alternatives to conventional agents are biofilm-inhibiting compounds regulating biofilm development without toxicity to growth. Here, we screened a biofilm inhibitor, raffinose, derived from ginger. Raffinose, a galactotrisaccharide, showed efficient biofilm inhibition of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> without impairing its growth. Raffinose also affected various phenotypes such as colony morphology, matrix formation, and swarming motility. Binding of raffinose to a carbohydrate-binding protein called LecA was the cause of biofilm inhibition and altered phenotypes. Furthermore, raffinose reduced the concentration of the second messenger, cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), by increased activity of a c-di-GMP specific phosphodiesterase. The ability of raffinose to inhibit <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation and its molecular mechanism opens new possibilities for pharmacological and industrial applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Most bacteria are able to live in two different states: planktonic and sessile. A biofilm is an assemblage of a single or multiple species that are encapsulated in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Notably, bacterial infections are frequently associated with biofilms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. For example, cystic fibrosis patients infected with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> show a progressive loss of pulmonary function due to its biofilm formation in the lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Moreover, biofilms tend to foul medical devices, contact lens, and artificial implants, which eventually lead to critical medicinal problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Beyond these, biofilms in the industrial settings (e.g. ship hulls, water pipes, and membrane filters) cause loss of performance and increased cost for maintenance and quality control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Nevertheless, biofilms formed on biotic and abiotic surfaces are notoriously difficult to eradicate, mainly because biofilm cells are insensitive to antimicrobial agents or biocides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Biofilm cells are known to be 10&#8211;1,000 fold more resistant to antimicrobial agents than planktonic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to traditional bactericidal or bacteriostatic approaches to inhibit biofilms, a recently developed control method is targeted at interference with biofilm development without affecting bacterial growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For example, bacterial cell-to-cell communication called quorum sensing (QS) is mediated by chemical signal molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and QS is known to be associated with biofilm maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These findings are used to develop strategies to disrupt biofilm maturation using structural analogues of QS signal molecules (e.g. furanone, azithromycin, and 4-nitro-pyridine-N-oxide) or enzymes degrading QS molecules (e.g. acylase and lactonase). Some molecules have been shown to enhance cell dispersion during biofilm development. Enzyme dispersion B showing EPS degradation has been applied for this purpose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Nitric oxide and cis-2-decenoic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, are also reported to induce biofilm dispersion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Various natural products are effective in regulating biofilm development. The advantages of using natural products in biofilm inhibition are their lower toxicity and higher specificity compared to synthetic compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Bean sprouts, chamomile, carrots, propolis, yellow peppers, water lilies, harbanero, garlic, fruit of a south-east Asian tree (<italic>Lagerstroemia speciosa</italic>), peas, medicinal plants from southern Florida (e.g. <italic>Conocarpus erectus</italic>), grapefruit, etc. have been shown to possess anti-QS activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and a few (e.g. garlic extract) show antibiofilm performance. We previously demonstrated that ginger extract had a capability to reduce biofilm formation for various bacteria including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by reducing cellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, but the active compound(s) associated with the finding has not been identified.</p><p>The goal of this study was to screen novel compound(s) of ginger extract that can inhibit <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation, and explore the biofilm inhibition mechanism. We identified raffinose, a galactotrisaccharide, which was effective in reducing biofilm formation by attaching to a carbohydrate-binding protein and by controlling c-di-GMP that affects the initial and probably, the dispersal stages of biofilm development.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Screening of biofilm inhibitors in ginger</title><p>Five putative ingredients frequently detected in ginger extract (6-gingerol, farnesol, L-ascorbic acid, myricetin, and raffinose, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) were tested for their potential to inhibit biofilm formation. Those ingredients were selected because they were identified in the ginger extract showing antibiofilm effect (data not shown). The degree of inhibition of biofilm formation by these candidates was evaluated using a static biofilm assay based on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 as a model bacterium in 96-well microtiter plates. Furanone C-30, a well reported biofilm inhibitor showing significant antibiofilm effect at 10&#8201;&#956;M via QS inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, was used as the positive control in this experiment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> shows that 6-gingerol and raffinose reduced biofilm formation by 39% and 43%, respectively, while farnesol, L-ascorbic acid, and myricetin did not significantly reduce biofilm formation. The biofilm inhibiting effects of 6-gingerol and raffinose were comparable to furanone C-30 which showed 46% inhibition. Since the effect of 6-gingerol on biofilm inhibition has been previously discussed by us<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, in this study, we report on the ability of raffinose to inhibit biofilm formation and the associated inhibitory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of raffinose on growth and biofilm formation</title><p>The growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was measured for batch cultures with 0&#8211;100&#8201;&#956;M raffinose. The growth curves for different raffinose concentrations were not significantly different in lag, exponential, and stationary phases during 14&#8201;h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The results suggested that the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was unaffected by the addition of raffinose up to 100&#8201;&#956;M.</p><p>A static biofilm assay was performed with different concentrations of raffinose (0&#8211;1,000&#8201;&#956;M). Biofilm formation was reduced gradually (17&#8211;58%) with increasing raffinose concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>), demonstrating that raffinose inhibited biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner. The biofilm inhibition capacity of the raffinose&#8217;s hydrolyzed products of &#945;-galactosidase (D-galactose and sucrose) was evaluated. &#945;-galactosidase is widely distributed in microorganisms, plants, and animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. D-galactose and sucrose did not reduce or increase the biofilm formation up to 1,000&#8201;&#956;M concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). There were no statistical differences in biofilm formation between control and D-galactose or sucrose treatment (P &gt; 0.05).</p><p>The effect of raffinose on biofilm formation was also tested in a flow reactor where growth medium with or without 10&#8201;&#956;M raffinose was continuously dripped on glass slides for 24&#8201;hours. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows typical biofilms. The biofilm formed with raffinose treatment showed relatively lower thickness (8.4&#8201;&#956;m) and smaller volume (4.8&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup>/&#956;m<sup>2</sup>) than that without raffinose treatment (35.2&#8201;&#956;m and 10.5&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup>/&#956;m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Although the biofilm formed without raffinose treatment demonstrated a typical <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mushroom morphology, the biofilm formed with 10&#8201;&#956;M raffinose treatment was relatively flat. Interestingly, the biofilm with 10&#8201;&#956;M raffinose treatment showed hollow structures (1,210 &#177; 170&#8201;per mm<sup>2</sup>) (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) which were not evident in the biofilm without raffinose treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effect of raffinose on the other phenotypes</title><p>Congo-red containing plates were used to observe <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colony morphology and to evaluate the effect of raffinose on exopolysaccharide production. Congo red is a pigment that binds to the exopolysaccharide matrix of bacterial biofilms, and leads to rugose colony morphology in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, a typical pink rugose morphology was evident for the colony without raffinose treatment, while the colony with raffinose treatment (10&#8201;&#956;M) showed pink smooth morphology. This result is an indication of a reduction of exopolysaccharide production by raffinose treatment in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>The effect of raffinose on exopolysaccharide production was further evaluated by directly measuring total carbohydrate content in EPS from both planktonic and biofilm cells grown with 0&#8211;1,000&#8201;&#956;M raffinose in growth medium. Exoprotein (a component of the biofilm matrix) production was also analyzed. Both planktonic and biofilm cells treated with raffinose significantly reduced the total carbohydrate and protein content of the EPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). Total carbohydrate reduced by 21&#8211;53% and 22&#8211;48% (planktonic and biofilm cells, respectively), while total protein was reduced by 1&#8211;41% and 9&#8211;42% (planktonic and biofilm cells, respectively), in a dose-dependent manner, when treated with raffinose.</p><p>Biofilm formation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is reported to be inversely regulated by swarming motility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Effect of raffinose (0&#8211;1,000&#8201;&#956;M) on swarming motility was evaluated by growing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells on 0.5% soft agar plates and measuring the length of dendrites from the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The dendrite lengths of the cells grown with raffinose were 1.6&#8211;2.4 fold longer than those grown without raffinose treatment and the length increased with increasing raffinose concentration. This suggests that raffinose promoted swarming motility on the soft agar plates. However, there were no changes in swimming or twitching motility by raffinose treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding of raffinose to LecA</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> produces two carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins): LecA (PA-IL) and LecB (PA-IIL), which show a specificity for D-galactose and L-fucose, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Because LecA demonstrated high affinity to D-galactose and its derivatives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> as well as involvement in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, it is reasonable to hypothesize that raffinose, a D-galactose derivative, may bind to LecA and thereby to suggest a mechanism for affecting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm development. To test this hypothesis, we initially evaluated the binding of raffinose to LecA based on 1D relaxation-edited nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-binding experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> using raffinose and LecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). NMR signals of 0.1&#8201;mM raffinose were monitored in the absence and presence of 50&#8201;&#956;M LecA in buffer solution. In addition, 1&#8201;mM galactose was added to monitor the change of raffinose signals by competition at the same binding site. In the absence of LecA protein (third row spectra, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), indicative peaks for H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> signals of raffinose at 5.33 and 4.13&#8201;ppm were seen. These broadened and weakened in the presence of LecA protein (second row spectra, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and the signal intensities recovered with the addition of a 10-fold excess of D-galactose (first row spectra, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The results indicated that raffinose binds to LecA and its binding site overlaps with the galactose-binding site. Moreover, the signals for the protons at C-1 and C-6 of the galactose at 5.17 and 3.40&#8201;ppm in 50&#8201;mM LecA solution were also recovered by the addition of 1&#8201;mM raffinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Conversely, the galactose (0.1&#8201;mM) signals in LecA solution were also enhanced with treatment of a 10-fold excess of raffinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). These results suggest that raffinose and galactose compete for the same site of the LecA protein.</p><p>To confirm the direct binding of raffinose to LecA, the binding affinities of raffinose, D-galactose, and sucrose to LecA were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Raffinose showed a 1.5-fold increase in binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 32&#8201;&#956;M) to LecA as compared with D-galactose (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 47&#8201;&#956;M), while sucrose which lacks the galactose moiety did not bind to LecA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>), indicating that the galactose moiety of raffinose is a determinant of LecA binding. Binding enthalpies (&#916;<italic>H</italic>), entropies (&#916;<italic>S</italic>), and free energies (&#916;<italic>G</italic>) of raffinose and D-galactose are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>.</p><p>To better understand the binding of raffinose to LecA, <italic>in silico</italic> docking studies of raffinose were performed using the X-ray structure of LecA in complex with melibiose (PDB: 4AL9). Most of the docked raffinose poses showed common binding patterns in which the galactose moiety was projected toward the calcium ion of the LecA active site, while the glucose and fructose moieties were oriented toward the surface and the loop region of LecA. The best-docked pose of raffinose is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>. The galactose moiety of the raffinose interacted strongly with Tyr 36, His 50, Pro 51, Asp 100, Val 101, and Thr 104. The glucose and fructose regions also interacted by hydrogen-bonding with Gln 53, Gly 37 and Asn 107, respectively.</p><p>Binding of raffinose to LecA and its relevance to biofilm inhibition were further verified using <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains, one that cannot produce LecA and one that overproduces LecA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, the <italic>lecA</italic> knockout mutant (a strain not producing LecA) demonstrated reduced biofilm formation and, furthermore, the biofilm formation did not decrease with increases in the raffinose concentration (P &gt; 0.05). On the contrary, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, the <italic>lecA</italic> knockout mutant carrying pUCP18-LecA (a LecA overproducing strain) formed a biofilm similar to the wild-type strain carrying an empty vector (pUCP18). Additionally, the <italic>lecA</italic> knockout mutant carrying pUCP18-LecA showed a reduction in biofilm formation in the presence of raffinose, in a concentration-dependent manner (0&#8211;1,000&#8201;&#956;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These results confirm that LecA is essential to form a biofilm, and suggested that raffinose binding to LecA is required for biofilm inhibition.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Decrease in cellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) production</title><p>Cellular c-di-GMP plays important roles in the molecular determination between planktonic and sessile lifestyles, the regulation of motility, and the induction of virulence factor production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In our previous study, we reported that ginger extract reduced the cellular c-di-GMP levels in both planktonic and biofilm cells of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of raffinose on cellular c-di-GMP in both planktonic and biofilm cells. In general, biofilm cells exhibited higher c-di-GMP levels than planktonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), in agreement with other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Furthermore, treatment with 10&#8201;&#956;M raffinose reduced c-di-GMP levels in both planktonic (47%) and biofilm cells (59%).</p><p>In addition, to verify the relevance of raffinose treatment to cellular c-di-GMP regulation, a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutant which can overproduce c-di-GMP (&#916;<italic>wspF</italic>) was used. The <italic>wspF</italic> gene in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is reported to encode a methylesterase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The methylesterase is presumed to control the activity of WspR protein which contains a CheY-like receiver and a diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Because &#916;<italic>wspF</italic> shows constitutive activation of the WspR protein, &#916;<italic>wspF</italic> leads to elevation of cellular c-di-GMP level and EPS production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>&#916;<italic>wspF</italic> induced around a 2-fold increase in biofilm formation compared to the wild-type strain. However, biofilm formation of &#916;<italic>wspF</italic> was reduced 12&#8211;26% by raffinose treatment (0&#8211;100&#8201;&#956;M), although the reduction of biofilm formation did not reach that of the wild type strain. This might be due to the fact that raffinose treatment was not sufficient to reduce cellular c-di-GMP level of &#916;<italic>wspF</italic> mutant to the level of the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). Interestingly, raffinose enhanced the swarming motility of &#916;<italic>wspF</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>&#916;<italic>wspF</italic> showed limited swarming motility on a 0.5% soft agar plate, but &#916;<italic>wspF</italic> grown with 10&#8201;&#956;M raffinose clearly showed lengthened dendrites.</p><p>The above result appears to be related to a reduction of cellular c-di-GMP levels. One of the routes in reducing cellular c-di-GMP level is enhanced c-di-GMP specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This possibility was tested by measuring the PDE activity, by analyzing the degradation of a PDE-specific substrate, bis-p-nitrophenol phosphate (bis-pNPP), in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown with raffinose. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4d</xref> shows that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown with raffinose increased the activity of bis-pNPP degradation 1.1&#8211;2.3 fold, as compared with the same strain grown without raffinose. This result demonstrates that raffinose may reduce the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cellular c-di-GMP levels via induction of PDE activity.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Besides biofilm reduction, raffinose altered other phenotypes of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, such as inhibition of rugose colony formation in Congo-red plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), reduction of EPS production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>), and increasing swarming motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These altered phenotypes are typically observed when cellular c-di-GMP levels decrease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that raffinose triggered various phenotypic alternations by reducing cellular c-di-GMP. This speculation is confirmed by the experiments using a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutant that overproduces cellular c-di-GMP (<italic>&#916;wspF</italic>): raffinose reduced biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) concomitant with recovery of swarming motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p>C-di-GMP levels are regulated by two enzymes acting oppositely. C-di-GMP is produced from two GTPs by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and is degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) into two GTPs via pGpG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Two routes are possible for decreasing cellular c-di-GMP levels: decreasing the activity of DGCs with GGDEF domain or increasing the activity of PDEs with EAL and/or HD-GYP domains. The experimental results show that increasing concentrations of raffinose increase the PDE activity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting that the latter route was the mechanism decreasing c-di-GMP levels by raffinose. This hypothesis is supported by the study of Chung <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> who increased PDE activity by cloning <italic>pvrR</italic>, a PDE gene, in a plasmid vector using the <italic>P. aeruginosa &#916;wspF</italic> mutant. The transformed <italic>&#916;wspF</italic> mutant showed increased PDE activity along with decreased c-di-GMP levels and enhanced swarming motility. In explaining the decrease in c-di-GMP level by raffinose treatment, the possibility of a decrease in the activity of DGCs could not be excluded because of the lack of supporting evidence leaving the mechanism open.</p><p>On the other hand, a reduced level of cellular c-di-GMP is reported to be associated with the motile mode of growth and dispersal as well as reduced biofilm formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Biofilm dispersal is initiated by localized cell death and lysis, to provide nutrients for escaping cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. This entails hollowing of biofilm microcolonies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this study, hollow structures in the biofilm treated with raffinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) suggest that raffinose triggers biofilm dispersion as well as reduction in biofilm formation by reducing cellular c-di-GMP level. This speculation was further evaluated by measuring released planktonic cells from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms formed on glass slides. The number of released cells increased by 1.8&#8211;3.6 fold when treated with 100&#8201;&#956;M raffinose, as compared with untreated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrating the regulation of cellular c-di-GMP levels by raffinose have enhanced our understanding about galactosides binding to LecA and their inhibition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation (i.e., LecA-ligand competitive inhibition was not the sole mechanism for biofilm inhibition). Nevertheless, it is not clear whether LecA-raffinose binding caused the decrease in c-di-GMP or raffinose decreased c-di-GMP independent from LecA-raffinose binding, which will be investigated in the near future.</p><p>It is also important to note that LecA production is related to biofilm formation. Diggle <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> observed <italic>lecA</italic> gene expression in a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm, and showed enhanced biofilm formation by a LecA-overproducing strain, and reduction by a <italic>lecA</italic> mutant. We investigated a possible interference of <italic>lecA</italic> gene expression by raffinose treatment using RT-qPCR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>). The expression of the <italic>lecA</italic> gene was reduced by 50% in the wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by raffinose treatment. Interestingly, the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutant overproducing cellular c-di-GMP (&#916;<italic>wspF</italic>) demonstrated a 1.5-fold increase in <italic>lecA</italic> gene expression over the wild-type strain, with a 30% decrease in <italic>lecA</italic> gene expression after raffinose treatment. Furthermore, the <italic>P. aeruginosa lecA</italic> knockout mutant (&#916;<italic>lecA</italic>) showed a decrease in cellular c-di-GMP levels and a 1.5-fold increase in the activity of c-di-GMP specific PDE as compared with the wild-type strain. These results imply that binding of raffinose to LecA reduced <italic>lecA</italic> gene expression and in turn, decreased cellular c-di-GMP levels, which resulted in biofilm inhibition. Nevertheless, detailed molecular mechanisms should be investigated for a better understanding about LecA-mediated biofilm formation.</p><p>Raffinose is a common galactooligosaccharide found in various vegetables (e.g. beans, cabbage, and broccoli) and plant seeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, as well as in ginger. It is not clear why some plants produce bacterial biofilm inhibitors such as raffinose. It would be interesting to study whether such biofilm inhibitors are produced accidentally or via evolutionary processes. Whatever the reason, the production of biofilm inhibitors appears to provide survival benefits for the plants. For example, Austrian red algae are reported to produce halogenated furanones effective in inhibiting biofilm formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, which avoids colonization by microorganisms that, in turn, block light to the plant. Biofilm inhibitors could be potentially applied in various medical and industrial settings. Increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria cause difficulties in antibiotic therapy. For example, more than 95% <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains are reported to be resistant to gentamicin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazol, ceftizoxime, and tetracycline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Biofilm inhibitors that do not affect bacterial growth are an emerging alternative to antibiotics in treating infectious diseases involving biofilm formation. They can also reduce biofouling problems, replacing biocides used in membrane filters for water treatment, water distribution pipes, ship hulls, laundry machines, humidifiers, dishwashers, etc. We believe that the findings from this study will be helpful to design more potent LecA-mediated biofilm inhibitors for combating unwanted biofilms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial strains and chemicals</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 was used as a model biofilm-forming bacterium. <italic>wspF</italic> or <italic>lecA</italic> knockout mutant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> was used to test whether raffinose was also effective for bacteria that overproduce cellular c-di-GMP or could not produce LecA.
