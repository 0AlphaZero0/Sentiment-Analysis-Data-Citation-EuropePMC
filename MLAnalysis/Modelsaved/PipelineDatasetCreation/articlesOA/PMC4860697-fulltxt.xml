They play vital roles in the base excision repair pathway and might also function in DNA demethylation. At least three families of DNA glycosylases have been identified, which included 3&#8242;-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MDG) I, MDG II, and HhH-GPD (Helix&#8211;hairpin&#8211;Helix and Glycine/Proline/aspartate (D)). However, little is known on their genome-wide identification, expansion, and evolutionary history as well as their expression profiling and biological functions. In this study, we have genome-widely identified and evolutionarily characterized these family members. Generally, a genome encodes only one <italic>MDG II</italic> gene in most of organisms. No <italic>MDG I</italic> or <italic>MDG II</italic> gene was detected in green algae. However, <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes were detectable in all available organisms. The ancestor species contain small size of <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families. These two families were mainly expanded through the whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication. They were evolutionarily conserved and were generally under purifying selection. However, we have detected recent positive selection among the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus, which might play roles in species divergence. Further investigation showed that expression divergence played important roles in gene survival after expansion. All of these family genes were expressed in most of developmental stages and tissues in rice plants. High ratios of family genes were downregulated by drought and fungus pathogen as well as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) treatments, suggesting a negative regulation in response to drought stress and pathogen infection through ABA- and/or JA-dependent hormone signaling pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>DNA glycosylase</kwd><kwd>abiotic/biotic stresses</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>gene expansion</kwd><kwd>hormone signaling</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic DNA molecules continuously suffer damages due to their exposure to internal and external environment and man-made toxins, such as radiation, chemical mutagens, biotic and abiotic stresses. The effects of these damages on organisms were determined by the chemical nature of the lesion and reparability. Evidence from microorganisms and mammals suggested that some base modification, for example, 7-methylguanine (7-MeG) by methylating agents, might not be harmful as they did not inhibit or alter normal base pairing (<xref rid="evw067-B21" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al. 1985</xref>). Another class of damages is O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine, which is directly mutagenic and leads to mispairing with thymine (<xref rid="evw067-B25" ref-type="bibr">Loechler et al. 1984</xref>). The third class of lesions is 3-methyladenine (3-MeA), which acts as blocks to DNA replication and transcription (<xref rid="evw067-B21" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al. 1985</xref>) so is cytotoxic. 3&#8242;-Methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MDG) I specifically catalyzes the release of 3-methylated adenine and, to a lesser extent, guanosine bases from alkylated-DNA by hydrolysis of the deoxyribose <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond (<xref rid="evw067-B41" ref-type="bibr">Sakumi et al. 1986</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B8" ref-type="bibr">Drohat et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, the glycosylase plays a vital role in the base excision repair (BER) (<xref rid="evw067-B54" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>In addition to MDG I, MDG II catalyzes the release of not only 3-MeA but also a variety of other methylated bases including 3-MeG, 7-MeG, O<sup>2</sup>-MeT, and O<sup>2</sup>-MeC (<xref rid="evw067-B42" ref-type="bibr">Sakumi and Sekiguchi 1990</xref>). Both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>II</italic> have been cloned and functionally and structurally characterized from a variety of microbial and mammalian sources (<xref rid="evw067-B22" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B4" ref-type="bibr">Calvo et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B9" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimkhani et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B1" ref-type="bibr">Admiraal and O&#8217;Brien 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B50" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and O&#8217;Brien 2015</xref>). However, in plants, limited data are available on their characterization and biological functions. <xref rid="evw067-B43" ref-type="bibr">Santerre and Britt (1994)</xref> first cloned an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene encoding an MDG and it complemented the methyl methanesulfonate-sensitive phenotype of an <italic>E</italic><italic>scherichia coli</italic> double mutant deficient in 3-MeA glycosylases. This protein belongs to MDG II. Expression analysis showed that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> methyladenine DNA glycosylase gene is preferentially expressed in rapidly dividing tissues such as meristematic tissue, the developing embryo and endosperm, and organ primordial (<xref rid="evw067-B46" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 1997</xref>).</p><p>Besides MDG I and II, other DNA glycosylases have also been reported (<xref rid="evw067-B54" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al. 1999</xref>). These proteins belong to the HhH-GPD superfamily as they contain Helix&#8211;hairpin&#8211;Helix and Glycine/Proline rich loop followed by a conserved aspartate (one letter code is D) (<xref rid="evw067-B34" ref-type="bibr">Nash et al. 1996</xref>). The superfamily is the largest and most functionally diverse group of DNA glycosylases. In microorganisms and mammals, HhH-GPDs catalyze the release of 3-MeA, 3-MeG, and 7-MeG (<xref rid="evw067-B54" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al. 1999</xref>). In plants, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Repressor of Silencing 1 (<xref rid="evw067-B38" ref-type="bibr">Ponferrada-Mar&#237;n et al. 2011</xref>) showed the similarity to the HhH-GPD proteins. A few other members were also reported such as genes encoding methyl-binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) or MBD4-like (<xref rid="evw067-B39" ref-type="bibr">Ramiro-Merina et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B36" ref-type="bibr">Nota et al. 2015</xref>). Instead of 3-MeA, 3-MeG and 7-MeG in microorganisms and mammals, these DNA glycosylases excise 5-methylcytosine (<xref rid="evw067-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhu 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B38" ref-type="bibr">Ponferrada-Mar&#237;n et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B39" ref-type="bibr">Ramiro-Merina et al. 2013</xref>). Thus, these enzymes also function in DNA demethylation through the BER pathway (<xref rid="evw067-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhu 2009</xref>). DNA demethylation has been proved to be related to various abiotic stresses (<xref rid="evw067-B26" ref-type="bibr">Lukens and Zhan 2007</xref>). Recent studies showed that the glycosylases exhibited DNA-binding activities (<xref rid="evw067-B28" ref-type="bibr">Malhotra and Sowdhamini 2013</xref>).</p><p>Generally, only a few reports have been published on MDG I and II and little is known on their biological functions of these enzymes in plants. For the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> superfamily, only several members were cloned and functionally characterized. However, little is known on the genome-wide identification and characterization of these genes encoding methyladenine DNA glycosylases and their expansion and evolution. Here, we have genome-widely identified these three gene families in 15 genomes. They exhibited different expansion and evolution histories. Both the whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication significantly contributed to the expansion of both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH</italic>-<italic>GPD</italic> families. In the rice genome, we have identified 20 genes encoding methylation-related DNA glycosylases including 6 <italic>MDG I</italic>, 1 <italic>MDG II</italic>, and 13 <italic>HhH</italic>-<italic>GPD</italic> genes. All of these genes were expressed in most of stages of rice development with differential expression abundance. Their expression was also regulated by drought and hormone treatments. In general, our data suggested that both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family members might play a role in the drought stress and hormone signaling pathway in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>DNA/cDNA and Protein Databases for Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization</title><p>The all annotated rice gene and protein sequences were downloaded from the latest version (release 7) of the rice genome annotation database (<xref rid="evw067-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kawahara et al. 2013</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>, last accessed March 31, 2016).

We broke down the phylogeny tree into ancestral units according to the method described by <xref rid="evw067-B47" ref-type="bibr">Shiu et al. (2004)</xref> and then estimated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) among different species. As the lost genes and pseudogenes were not identified and were excluded for the phylogenetic tree construction, the MRCA members may be underestimated but the analysis could still be used to evaluate evolution histories. We first surveyed the <italic>MDG I</italic> family. As no member was detected in the green algae species <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, no MRCA exit among the 15 species as shown by the yellow hexagon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F1">fig. 1<italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). We have detected only one MRCA among the remaining 14 species as shown by the black pentagon. No MRCA was expanded during the divergence of <italic>Tracheophyta</italic> species from moss (brown squares). Two more members were required during the divergence of dicot and monocot plants from <italic>Lycopodiophyta</italic> (blue triangles). During the divergence between dicot and monocot plants, one additional member was added in the MRCA of either dicot or monocot plants (red circles and green stars). After that, no expansion occurred for some species such as <italic>R. communis</italic> and <italic>P. persica</italic>, or one to three members were required during species divergence for other species such as <italic>S. bicolor</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>B. rapa</italic>, and so on. For the remaining three species (<italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, <italic>M. domestica</italic>, and <italic>M. acuminate</italic>), relatively higher expansion occurred during their species divergence and these species required double or more numbers of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes.</p><p>Different from the <italic>MDG I</italic> family, at least five <italic>HhH</italic>-<italic>GPD</italic> genes were detected in all 15 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F1">fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).

To explore the mechanisms of the family expansion, we further surveyed the contributions of both duplication and mobile elements to the family expansion. We have investigated the contribution of tandem, segmental and the whole-genome duplication, transposition, and retrotransposition to the family expansion. We first surveyed the contribution of tandem duplication to the gene expansion. We identified tandemly duplicated genes according to the description in the Materials and Methods. The survey showed that no tandem duplication was detected for the <italic>MDG I</italic> gene family. For the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family, only one pair of tandemly duplicated genes was detected in four species. They were <italic>Bradi3g43692</italic> and <italic>Bradi3g43720</italic> from <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>LOC_Os05g37350</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os05g37410</italic> from <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>Sobic.001G262700</italic> and <italic>Sobic.001G262900</italic> from <italic>S. bicolor</italic>, <italic>Traes_1BL_263DE6AA9</italic> and <italic>Traes_1BL_05EB7AD97</italic> from <italic>T. aestivum</italic>. For the poplar species, the only tandem array was detected, which contained three genes including <italic>Potri.014G187000</italic>, <italic>Potri.014G187300</italic>, and <italic>Potri.014G187500</italic>. No tandemly duplicated genes were detected for the remaining ten species. We also surveyed the contribution of mobile elements to the family expansion. Similarly, for the 15 species, no gene was found to be expanded by mobile elements. Although one rice gene <italic>LOC_Os12g10900</italic> encodes the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> domain, which might be expanded by a retrotransposon, the gene was annotated as a retrotransposon coding gene. As a result, the gene was excluded in this study. Thus, both tandem duplication and mobile elements might not be regarded as a major contributor for the family expansion.</p><p>We then analyzed the contribution of the whole-genome duplication to the expansion of two gene families. As the studies on the whole-genome duplication events for many species were previously carried out, we collected these data and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree with these 15 species and their paleopolyploidy histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F2">fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). We then compared the duplication events (green stars for genome doubling or blue stars for tripling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F2">fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) with the size of <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families. The comparison implied that the whole-genome duplication events might have contributed to the expansion of these two gene families for some species. For example, <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> (poplar) underwent one more genome doubling event when compared with <italic>R. communis</italic> (castor) and as a result, the poplar genome encoded more than two times numbers of family members (12 <italic>MDG I</italic> and 18 <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> compared with 5 <italic>MDG I</italic> and 9 <italic>HhH-GPD</italic>, respectively, in the caster). In order to further confirm the contribution of genome duplication to the family expansion, we carried out the co-relationship analysis between rounds of genome duplication and encoded <italic>MDG I/HhH-GPD</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F2">fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). The correlation coefficient was calculated as 0.738 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) for the <italic>MDG I</italic> family and 0.662 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) for the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family. The data suggested that the whole-genome duplication significantly contributed to the gene expansion for both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families.

For the <italic>MDG I</italic> family, only ten species were selected for such analyses as the remaining five species showed no further expansion during species divergence from MRCA of monocots or dicots. Our data showed that segmental duplication significantly contributed to the expansion of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes in at least seven species including <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>B. rapa</italic>, <italic>M. acuminate</italic>, <italic>M. domestica</italic>, <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>, and <italic>Z. mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). In these seven species, 28.6&#8211;100% of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes were located on segmental duplication blocks. In contrast, for the species <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>S. bicolor</italic> and <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, no segmentally duplicated <italic>MDG I</italic> genes were detected. For the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> gene family, 13 species were selected for segmental duplication analysis as only five <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes were identified in the remaining two species including <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Among the selected 13 species, segmental duplication significantly contributed to the family expansion in ten species and their contribution rates ranged from 15.4% to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similar to the <italic>MDG I</italic> family, for three species <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>S. bicolor</italic> and <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, no segmentally duplicated <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes were detected. For both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families, up to 100% and 50% of <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes have been involved in segmental duplication, respectively, in the species <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>. For example, all the 12 <italic>MDG I</italic> genes in the species were located on segmental duplication region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). For most of these genes, they segmentally duplicated once. However, some of these genes segmentally duplicated two or three times. For example, the gene <italic>Potri.001G044400</italic> was segmentally related to <italic>Potri.003G182300</italic>, <italic>Potri.018G106900</italic>, and <italic>Potri.006G184700</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>).

To better understand their evolutionary history, we further identified all family members from 11 rice species/subspecies, which were from the same genus <italic>Oryza</italic>, where all of their genomes have been sequenced. The genome-wide searches showed that these 11 species/subspecies encoded 5&#8211;7 members of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). We then constructed the phylogenetic tree using domain region of these members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F4">fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, a total of four groups were clustered.

Similarly, group 2 also contained only one member in each species but no gene loss was observed for all species. For both groups 3 and 4, each species usually encodes two members. However, in the species <italic>O. brachyantha</italic>, only one member was clustered into the group 4, suggesting a gene loss event. In contrast, one additional member was required (gene gain) for the species <italic>O. glaberrima</italic>, as a result, three genes were detected in this group. Generally, for the <italic>MDG I</italic> gene family, 11 rice species/subspecies showed similar expansion and evolution history. However, these species exhibited the different patterns of gene gain and loss.

To test whether the divergence was due to reduced purifying selection or increased positive (or diversifying) selection, we evaluated the ratio of nonsynonymous distance (<italic>Ka</italic>) to synonymous distance (<italic>Ks</italic>) of these two families among 15 different species or 11 species/subspecies from the same <italic>Oryza</italic> genus. As we surveyed the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios among different species from single-cell green alga to multiple-cell higher plants, only conserved domain regions were achieved for sequence alignment followed by <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> estimation through the SLR program (<xref rid="evw067-B29" ref-type="bibr">Massingham and Goldman 2005</xref>, Materials and Methods). For the <italic>MDG I</italic> family, the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios among 15 species ranged from 0 to 0.53 with the average ratio at 0.13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios among 11 species/subspecies from the same <italic>Oryza</italic> genus ranged from 0 to 0.69 with the average ratio at 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, no significant difference was observed for the <italic>MDG I</italic> family between these two sets of data analysis. This result suggested the relatively consistent selection force under purifying selection during the long evolutionary history. We then analyzed the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios for the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family among the 15 species. The ratios ranged from 0 to 0.68 with the average ratio at 0.13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). The <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> distribution was similar to those from the <italic>MDG I</italic> family. Their divergence was subjected to purifying selection. Similar results were observed for the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> analysis among 11 rice species/subspecies for this gene family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). We further extended our analysis to the nondomain regions for the two families. For the <italic>MDG I</italic> family, many gaps were found during alignments among 15 species or 11 rice species/subspecies and the alignments were not suitable for <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> analyses. For the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family, many gaps were also found in the alignment among 15 species. However, the alignment among 11 rice species/subspecies was suitable for <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> analysis. Interestingly, positively selected sites were detected among 11 species/subspecies from the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus. We have detected a total of seven sites with positive selection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">Figure 5<italic>E</italic></xref> showed the five sites of them with <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios ranging from 1.50 to 3.55.

However, these positions were not regarded as positively selected positions as the alignment gaps might result in statistical bias or artifacts. Thus, we have detected a total of seven sites in the nondomain region under positive selection. The data suggested the different selection forces between domain and nondomain regions and also suggested the role of positive selection in the species divergence of the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family for the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus.

Furthermore, we detected the distribution of these three gene families by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches against all available protein sequences deposited in both Pfam and Interpro databases. Based on the searches, the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family generally presents in all types of organisms including higher plant, moss, algae, animal, fungi, bacteria, archaea, and virus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">supplementary table S8</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). The <italic>MDG II</italic> genes were detected all organisms except for green algae and generally only one <italic>MDG II</italic> gene was encoded in each genome. Interestingly, green algae genomes also do not encode any <italic>MDG I</italic> gene and this family gene does also not present in animals and virus. No evidence showed why neither <italic>MDG I</italic> or <italic>MDG II</italic> was required for green algae. However, evidence showed that the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> has the most unusual pattern of methylation (<xref rid="evw067-B11" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, our data might provide some implication underlying the unusual methylation in the green algae.</p><p>Although the <italic>MDG I</italic> gene family was detected in higher plants, mosses, red algae, fungi, bacteria and archaea, it presents in only one or a few species of mosses, red algae, fungi and archaea. For example, only one sequence from either fungi or red algae was detected to encode this family protein. Thus, the gene family only ubiquitously exists in both higher plants and bacteria. Similar situation was also observed in the <italic>MDG II</italic> gene family, which is ubiquitous in animals, plants, and bacteria. Different from both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>II</italic> families, the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family ubiquitously presents in most of organisms.

For the remaining two gene families <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic>, a genome from archaea, bacterium or fungus usually encodes only one member in each family and higher plant genomes encode various sizes of family members. At the early stage of evolutionary history, very low expansion occurred and a genome generally encodes one or a few members of these two gene families. This situation continuously existed until the divergence between monocots and dicots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F1">fig. 1</xref>). A large scale of expansion occurred only for some species during or after the divergence from one species to another in monocot and dicot plants. As a result, different species encode different sizes of family members ranging from 5 to 16 for <italic>MDG I</italic> and from 9 to 21 for <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families. However, in algae or moss, less expansion occurred during long evolutionary history. Thus, our data showed that these three gene families have gone through different origin and evolutionary histories.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Expansion and Inside Mechanisms in the <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> Families</title><p>In this study, we investigated a total of three families on a genome-wide level. Among them, the <italic>MDG II</italic> family contains only one member in all tested genomes. No expansion occurred during a long evolutionary history. For the remaining two families <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic>, they exhibited both similarity and difference in their family expansion. Before the divergence between monocot and dicot plants, two gene families experienced very low expansion and their MRCA genome encoded only four (for <italic>MDG I</italic>) and five (for <italic>HhH-GPD</italic>) genes. After the divergence between dicots and monocots, only one (for <italic>MDG I</italic>) or two (for <italic>HhH-GPD</italic>) more members were required for their ancestor species in this evolutionary stage. A relatively large scale of expansion of the <italic>MDG I</italic> family occurred during species divergence for some species of dicot and monocot plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F1">fig. 1</xref>). For some species, for example, <italic>R. communis</italic> and <italic>P. persica</italic>, no expansion was observed. However, for the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family, all genomes of monocot and dicot plants experienced a large scale of expansion during species divergence. These data suggested the recently expansion events for these two gene families. In addition, our data showed that the gene expansion and loss in the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family were also detected during the divergence of species from the same genus. We have investigated the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family in 11 different species/subspecies from the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus and the data showed that these species exhibited the difference in gene expansion and loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F4">fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, differentiated gene expansion and loss events were observed between indica and japonica rice genomes for the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F4">fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). For example no japonica ortholog was detected for the indica member <italic>BGIOSGA002516</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F4">fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Similarly, no indica orthologs were found for the japonica members <italic>LOC_Os02g29230</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os02g29380</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F4">fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To explore the mechanisms of gene expansion in these two families, we have investigated the contributions of multiple DNA/RNA duplication events to the family expansion. Previous studies showed that genome-wide duplication significantly contributed to gene expansion (<xref rid="evw067-B31" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Van de Peer 2003</xref>). Our data showed that rounds of genome duplication were co-related to either <italic>MDG I</italic> or <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family size in some species, suggesting the contribution of the whole-genome duplication to the family expansion. In addition to the whole-genome duplication, we have also surveyed the contribution of both tandem and segmental duplications to these two family expansions as previous data showed the contribution of tandem and segmental duplication to gene family expansion in some species (<xref rid="evw067-B12" ref-type="bibr">Flagel and Wendel 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B13" ref-type="bibr">Freeling 2009</xref>). Our survey showed that segmental duplication significantly contributed to the expansion of both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> families in most of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). However, tandemly duplicated genes were observed only in a few species, suggesting a limited contribution to the gene expansion. Additionally, we have also examined the contribution of DNA mobile elements to the expansion of <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes. We have examined the presence of various mobile elements in the flanking genomic sequences of the 50 kb upstream and downstream of <italic>MDG I/HhH-GPD</italic> genes in different genomes. We have identified <italic>LTR</italic> (long terminal repeat)-retrotransposons, <italic>MULE</italic>, <italic>hAT</italic>, <italic>CACTA</italic>, <italic>Helitron</italic>, and retrogene in these flanking genomic sequences. However, our detailed analysis showed that no gene was expanded by any mobile element in most of species, suggesting the limited contribution of transposons/retrotransposons to the family expansion. Generally, we have investigated multiple molecular mechanisms for the family expansion and our data showed that both the whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication significantly contributed to the expansion of these two gene families.</p><p>Evidence showed that gene duplications occurred frequently; however, gene loss was also frequently observed during long evolutionary history due to redundant functions (<xref rid="evw067-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Conery 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B12" ref-type="bibr">Flagel and Wendel 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B13" ref-type="bibr">Freeling 2009</xref>). In this study, we have detected gene duplication by the-whole genome duplication and segmental duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F2 evw067-F3">figs. 2 and 3</xref>). We have also detected gene loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F3">fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) in the rice <italic>MDG I</italic> family. The fact might explain why the size of the <italic>MDG I</italic> family was smaller than that of the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family in the same genome. After gene expansion, duplicated genes might evolve into new genes with subfunctions/novel functions and they might also become pseudogenes due to redundant functions. The <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> analysis among different species showed that the ratios were low and these two families were under purifying selection. The newly born genes might be retained with the similar or subfunctions and they might also be survived by expression divergence. We have analyzed the expression patterns of these two rice gene families among different tissues and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F6 evw067-F9">figs. 6 and 9</xref>). We have also investigated the expression regulation under various abiotic/biotic stresses or hormone treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F7 evw067-F8">figs. 7 and 8</xref>). Such analyses showed that no gene within the same gene family exhibited the same expression abundance or patterns. One gene differentiates from others by either expression abundance or patterns. Besides rice genes, we have also surveyed expression divergence of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes from both poplar and wheat, where higher rates of gene expansion were detected. We analyzed the expression divergence of 16 wheat and 12 poplar <italic>MDG I</italic> genes among different tissues or treatments. We first constructed phylogenetic trees and figured out closely related genes, which were used for investigating expression divergence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">supplementary fig. S2</ext-link><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Such an investigation showed that no similar expression patterns were observed among closely related <italic>MDG I</italic> genes in both wheat and poplar. In fact, these genes differentiated each other and no gene showed the same expression pattern to any other genes. These data suggested that expression divergence significantly contributed to the gene survival after duplication.</p></sec><sec><title>Positive Selection Occurred Only during Intragenus Divergence in the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> Family</title><p>We have analyzed the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios among 15 distantly related species using their domain regions for both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> gene families. Such analyses showed that the divergence of these genes among the 15 species was under purifying selection for both the <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> gene families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5</xref>). We have also investigated the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios within the rice <italic>Oryza</italic> genus and similar results were obtained for these two gene families. However, positive selection was detected among 11 rice species/subspecies from the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus for the nondomain region of the <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> family. Further analysis showed that positively selected sites were within the rice gene <italic>LOC_Os09g01290</italic> and its orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F5">fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>). As the positive selection was observed only in these species belonging to the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus, we further examined whether it occurred within subspecies such as indica and japonica rice accessions. We first examined the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratio between the gene <italic>LOC_Os09g01290</italic> (from Nipponbare) and its indica ortholog <italic>BGIOSGA030257</italic> (from the rice variety 93-11). The ratio was 0.72 and no positive selection was observed between indica and japonica species. We then analyzed a total of 1,402 rice accessions, whose genomes were genome-widely resequenced. Based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms and Indels (1&#8211;10 bp insertions and deletions) identified from the resequencing data, we calculated their <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> ratios by comparing with either indica genome 93-11 (first sequenced indica variety) or japonica genome Nipponbare (first sequenced japonica variety). However, our data showed that no positive selection was detected either within or among indica and japonica lines. Thus, positive selection was only detected among species within the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus. The data suggested that the positive selection might play a role in the species divergence within the genus. Previous data showed that some adaptive phenotypes were due to the gene variants referring to positive selection (<xref rid="evw067-B18" ref-type="bibr">Koester et al. 2013</xref>). Studies also showed that positively selected genes might play roles in multiple biological processes, such as signal transduction, sexual reproduction, transporters, and so on (<xref rid="evw067-B6" ref-type="bibr">Castillo-Davis et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B35" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B33" ref-type="bibr">Namroud et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B52" ref-type="bibr">Voolstra et al. 2011</xref>). We have further carried out the <italic>Ka/Ks</italic> analysis among rice lines from indica, japonica, and their intermediates. However, no positive selection was detected. Thus, positive selection in this gene might occur only during adaptive divergence within the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus.</p></sec><sec><title>Rice <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> Genes Might Play Roles in Abiotic/Biotic and Hormone Signaling Pathways</title><p>In this study, we have genome-widely identified a total of 6 <italic>MDG</italic> and 13 <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes in the rice genome. Full-length cDNA sequences have been detected in most of these 19 genes and all of them were expressed in multiple tissues or developmental stages, suggesting their roles in multiple tissues or stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F6">fig. 6</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of three of six <italic>MDG I</italic> genes was down- or upregulated by only drought but not high salinity or cold stress. On the other hand, 4 out of 13 <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes were downregulated by drought stress. These data suggested that both <italic>MDG I</italic> and <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> genes should play roles in the drought stress response. Drought response is a complex mechanism, which involves in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathway (<xref rid="evw067-B32" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al. 2014</xref>). In our study, two <italic>MDG I</italic> genes (<italic>LOC_Os01g58550</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os08g38170</italic>) and one <italic>HhH-GPD</italic> gene <italic>LOC_Os12g10850</italic> were coregulated by both drought stress and ABA treatment. Thus, they might play a role in an ABA-dependent pathway. Studies showed that besides ABA, both JA and auxin might also regulate drought responses (<xref rid="evw067-B7" ref-type="bibr">Divi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B37" ref-type="bibr">Peleg and Blumwald 2011</xref>). Thus, our data imply the roles of some of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes in the drought stress through ABA/JA-dependent signaling pathway. To our surprise, up to 80% of <italic>MDG I</italic> genes were downregulated and 42% <italic>of HhH-GPD</italic> genes were down- or upregulated by rice blast fungus pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F7">fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Most of them were also downregulated by ABA or JAs. More attention should be paid to the gene <italic>LOC_Os01g58550</italic>, which was highly expressed in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F6">fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), upregulated by drought stress, downregulated by both pathogens <italic>M. grisea</italic> and Xoo as well as by ABA and JA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evw067-F7 evw067-F8">figs. 7 and 8</xref>). ABA is a negative regulator of disease resistance (<xref rid="evw067-B30" ref-type="bibr">Mauch-Mani and Mauch 2005</xref>) and plays a key role in modulating diverse plant&#8211;pathogen interactions (<xref rid="evw067-B10" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al. 2009</xref>). JA plays a central node in plant defense signaling network (<xref rid="evw067-B40" ref-type="bibr">Robert-Seilaniantz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evw067-B5" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al. 2014</xref>). Thus, the gene <italic>LOC_Os01g58550</italic> might play a key role in drought and <italic>MG</italic>/<italic>XOO</italic>-related stress regulation through ABA/JA signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw067/-/DC1">Supplementary figures S1 and S2 and tables S1&#8211;S8</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
