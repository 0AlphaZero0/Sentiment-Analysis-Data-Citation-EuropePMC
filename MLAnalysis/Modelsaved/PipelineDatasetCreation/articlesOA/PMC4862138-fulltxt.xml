Recent data indicate that peripheral immune stimulation can significantly affect the CNS. But the mechanisms underpinning this relationship remain unclear. The standard approach to understanding this relationship has relied on systemic immune activation using bacterial components, finding that immune mediators, such as cytokines, can have a significant effect on brain function and behaviour. More rarely have studies used disease models that are representative of human disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Here we use a well-characterised animal model of psoriasis-like skin inflammation&#8212;imiquimod&#8212;to investigate the effects of tissue-specific peripheral inflammation on the brain.

However, we know very little about the mechanisms underpinning this relationship.</p><p>Increasingly compelling data have highlighted possible roles for a number of immune mediators, including inflammatory cytokines, in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Examples include (a) treatment of hepatitis C with IFN-&#945; results in the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) in around 50&#160;% of patients and is the most common reason for ceasing treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], (b) the treatment of psoriasis patients with the anti-TNF drug etanercept improved the clinical symptoms of depression independently of an improvement in psoriatic disease score in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and (c) patients suffering from long-term MDD or schizophrenia have an elevated inflammatory profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In essence these pathology-, or therapy-, associated depressive episodes represent exaggerated presentations of the so-called &#8216;sickness behaviour&#8217;, which is a recognised and normal response typically associated with microbial infection. Nonetheless, despite these correlations, it remains unclear how inflammation in the periphery relates to neuropsychiatric phenotypes.</p><p>One family of cytokines that might play a key role in this communication pathway is the chemotactic cytokine, or chemokine, family. The classical role of chemokines is in mediating cell trafficking and inflammatory chemokines are important for cell migration during immune and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many chemokines, such as CXCL12, are expressed in the brain in steady-state and play an important role in development and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, some inflammatory chemokines are also expressed in the brain and are upregulated during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We hypothesised that, in systemic inflammatory disease contexts, brain-expressed chemokines would drive immune cell infiltration into the brain, leading to the activation of local cells resulting in co-morbid psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used a well-characterised mouse model of skin inflammation. The topical application of Aldara&#8482;, a commercially available drug which contains the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 ligand imiquimod (IMQ), to the dorsal skin of mice, causes a psoriasis-like skin pathology. The ease and reproducibility of this model made it ideal for our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Here, we show that peripheral skin inflammation can induce a &#8216;remote&#8217; chemokine response in the brain that appears to be maintained independently of a response in the periphery. In addition, we show that this is associated with leukocyte infiltration into the brain parenchyma, a reduction in neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and behavioural alterations reflected in a suppression of burrowing behaviour. These findings highlight the impact of peripheral immune stimulation on homeostatic CNS function and implicate chemokines and their receptors as potential therapeutic targets for chronic inflammatory disease associated neuropsychiatric co-morbidities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 female mice (6- to 8-week old, 16&#8211;20&#160;g) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories.

Mice treated with Aldara lost a significant amount of body weight. This weight loss, shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, was apparent after just one application and was most pronounced between the third and fifth treatments. Aldara treatment also induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in the mice, causing visible erythema and flakiness. The psoriatic symptoms were confirmed in H&amp;E sections (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) taken 24&#160;h after the fifth application of Aldara, which show epidermal and dermal hyperplasia, keratosis and marked skin thickening. To test the hypothesis that peripheral inflammation induces inflammatory changes in the brain, we comprehensively evaluated alterations in gene expression in the brain in response to cutaneous Aldara treatment using a full genome microarray approach. When analysed using GeneSpring GX software, over 200 transcripts were significantly upregulated in the brains of Aldara-treated mice compared with control mice when a stringent fold-change cutoff of 3 or above was applied. DAVID software was used to determine the biological associations of the differentially expressed genes by grouping them based on their function (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This analysis highlighted immune, inflammatory and leukocyte-derived genes as being prominent within the differentially expressed functional gene groupings. Interestingly, amongst the top ten functional annotations, <italic>chemokine signalling pathway</italic>, <italic>inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signalling pathway</italic> and <italic>leukocyte transendothelial migration</italic> were enriched. As they play a critical role in homeostatic and inflammatory responses, both in the periphery and the CNS, we focused on chemokines as a potential mechanism of communication between the periphery and the brain. Amongst the subset of genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups, seven chemokines and one chemokine receptor were upregulated in the brains of Aldara-treated mice, with a fold-change induction ranging between 3-fold and 25-fold.

By day 3, all seven genes were significantly upregulated in the brains of Aldara-treated mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Strikingly, the expression of <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> was increased almost 1000-fold at this time point. With the exception of <italic>Ccl3</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, the expression of all genes remained significantly elevated at day 5. This was particularly notable for <italic>Ccl5</italic>, the expression level of which was approximately 900-fold greater than the control. Importantly, when comparing the fold induction in the brain to that of the PBL, expression of all chemokine/chemokine receptor target genes was increased to a significantly greater level in the brain than PBL at day 3 of the Aldara model (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Therefore, alterations to the transcriptional profile of the brain were not a consequence of residual peripheral blood contamination. Again, with the exception of <italic>Ccl3</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, the fold-change induction remains significantly greater in the brain than the PBL at day 5. <italic>Ccr5</italic> was the only gene that shows a significantly greater fold-change induction in the PBL than in the brain. However, this was only observed on day 1 of the Aldara model. Although the microarray data demonstrated a significant induction of the gene encoding CXCL9, this appeared to be below the detection limit of the QRT-PCR assay and could not be validated in the PBL and the brain (data not shown). It was therefore excluded from further analysis. Together, these data confirm that topical Aldara treatment triggers a large increase in chemokine transcription in the brain. Importantly, the response in the brain differs both in magnitude and temporal patterning to that in the PBL, with chemokine transcription remaining elevated throughout the model.</p><p>To investigate whether the transcriptional response in the brain was being driven by the presence of circulating inflammatory cytokines, protein levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-&#945;, CCL2 and CCL3 were assessed at different time points using luminex (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). IL-6 and CCL2 were the only proteins to be significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the control group, and this was only the case after the first treatment. None of the other inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the circulation at day 1, day 3 or day 5. Collectively, the results in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> demonstrate that the brain response to Aldara treatment differs from the peripheral blood response and does not appear to be associated with the expression of archetypal inflammatory cytokines in the circulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Topically applied soluble IMQ induces chemokine induction in the brain without causing overt skin inflammation</title><p>There are reports that, along with the active TLR agonist, imiquimod, Aldara cream contains another active component: isostearic acid. This component of the vehicle is thought to activate the inflammasome, induce keratinocyte cell death and stimulate the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To further explore the mechanisms by which the brain-specific chemokine response is induced following Aldara treatment, and to discriminate between the activities of the isostearic acid and IMQ, soluble IMQ was dissolved in isostearic acid-free aqueous control cream and applied topically to the dorsal skin. As before, mice treated with soluble IMQ lost a significant amount of weight after the first two treatments (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Their weights remained significantly lower than the control group throughout the model. In contrast to Aldara treatment, topical soluble IMQ treatment was not associated with significant skin inflammation. The skin sections, examined after five applications of IMQ cream, do not show any overt signs of epidermal hyperplasia, keratosis or erythema (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These data suggest that this aspect of the response may be independent of TLR stimulation and reliant instead on the actions of isostearic acid. Nonetheless, all chemokine/chemokine receptor target genes were significantly elevated in the brain following topical IMQ treatment, independently of alterations in PBL (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Of note, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Ccr5</italic> presented with a fold-change induction upwards of 1000-fold. In this model, all genes encoding chemokine ligands were downregulated in the PBL of treated mice compared with control mice. With regard to all genes, the fold-change induction in the brain following treatment was significantly higher than the fold change in PBL. These results demonstrate that, although the different active components of Aldara may be responsible for driving different aspects of the response, the actions of TLR ligand IMQ alone are sufficient to induce the remote differential chemokine response in the brain.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Topically applied imiquimod induces a transcriptional brain response but does not induce psoriasis-like skin inflammation.

In contrast to the previous models, this treatment did not induce any weight loss over the 5-day period and the weights of the treated mice increased gradually in line with the control group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2A). In stark contrast to the potent chemokine response that was induced in the brain following topical Aldara and/or IMQ application, only <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Ccr5</italic> were significantly elevated in the brain (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2B) and this induction was modest (approximately threefold and 1.2-fold, respectively). Further, the induction of <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Ccr5</italic> expression in the brain did not differ in magnitude to that of the PBL. These findings clearly demonstrate that injecting IMQ systemically does not generate a similar response to the topical application of IMQ. Thus, the induction of chemokines in the brain is likely dependent, at least in part, on the initial skin response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Topical application and TLR ligation are essential for the induction of chemokines in the brain</title><p>Having shown that the effects of cutaneous Aldara cream treatment are mediated primarily through the actions of the TLR ligand IMQ, we compared the response to a model which generates a similar skin phenotype without acting through TLRs. TPA is a chemical irritant which, when applied to the dorsal skin, generates a similar skin profile of epidermal and dermal hyperplasia and erythema. However, this model does not act through TLRs and is thus considered &#8216;sterile&#8217;. In contrast to both the Aldara and topical IMQ models, topical TPA treatment did not induce weight loss in the treated mice (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3A). However, TPA did cause a similar skin inflammation to that observed following topical Aldara treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3B). This was again characterised by skin thickening, epidermal and dermal hyperplasia, keratosis and erythema. Interestingly, none of the chemokine/chemokine receptor target genes were significantly altered in the brains or PBL of TPA-treated mice (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3C). Furthermore, in the plasma, only CCL2 was strongly and significantly differentially expressed, and this induction was restricted to day 1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3D). Circulating levels of all other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were comparable between the treatment and control groups. Together, these data suggest that the brain response that occurs following topical Aldara treatment is dependent on skin-specific TLR ligation and is not simply a generic response to skin inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Aldara treatment induces the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages into the brain</title><p>The most characterised role of chemokines is to coordinate leukocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we used flow cytometry to establish whether the transcriptional upregulation of chemokines in the brain following topical Aldara treatment was associated with an influx of leukocytes from the periphery. To exclude resident microglia that express intermediate levels of CD45, we only gated on live, single, CD45<sup>hi</sup> cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4A). The results show a significant increase in the number of CD45<sup>hi</sup> cells present in the brains at both day 3 and day 5 following Aldara treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4B). Thus, topical Aldara treatment results in leukocyte recruitment to the brain.</p><p>Monocytes are early responders to infection and have been shown to infiltrate the brain in peripheral inflammatory models and in response to viral infections that invade the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, several of the chemokine transcripts that are elevated in the brain in response to topical Aldara treatment, specifically <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Ccl9</italic>, are known to recruit monocytes to sites of inflammation. In addition, protein analysis from an independent experiment clearly demonstrates that levels of CCL2, a classic monocyte chemoattractant, are also elevated in the brain following Aldara treatment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). As shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4B, the treated brain appears to be devoid of infiltrating leukocytes at day 1. This prompted us to also analyse chemokine levels at two earlier time points, 4 and 12&#160;h after treatment in order to capture the protein signal before and after leukocyte infiltration. Interestingly, CCL2 was significantly elevated in the brain from as early as 4&#160;h following topical Aldara treatment and prior to leukocyte infiltration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) These data suggest that CCL2 is likely to be produced by brain-resident cells, rather than the infiltrating leukocytes themselves.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Aldara treatment induces the infiltration of monocytes, but not neutrophils, into the brain.

To determine whether the transcription of lymphocyte chemoattractants in the brain resulted in elevated protein production, we performed protein analysis of a key T cell-recruiting chemokine, CXCL10. Again, in an attempt to address whether the source of the chemokine signature we report in this journal is brain-resident or from infiltrating cells, we also analysed CXCL10 expression at 4 and 12&#160;h after treatment. CXCL10 protein expression was significantly induced in the treated brain as early as 4&#160;h after cutaneous Aldara treatment when compared with control brain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). CXCL10 remained significantly elevated throughout the model, with the highest expression level at day 3. Whilst we cannot comment on the source of the signal at day 3 and day 5, when there appears to be a mixed population of brain-resident cells and leukocyte infiltrate, we suggest it is unlikely that CXCL10 is being produced by infiltrating leukocytes at the earlier time points.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Aldara treatment induces the infiltration of a number of lymphocyte subsets into the brain.

As a behavioural read-out, a basic burrowing model, in which mice burrow for food pellets, was employed. The read-out is the weight of pellets remaining in the burrowing tubes, as opposed to that burrowed out of the tubes, after defined periods of time. Burrowing is an innately rewarding activity in rodents; thus, this model indicates the level of well-being in mice based on the amount of burrowing activity that they participate in. As such, this model has been used in various studies to identify a behavioural output following inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mice were acclimatised to the burrowing tubes prior to treatment, and baseline tests were performed. Whilst the baseline tests showed a wide range of burrowing activity, the Aldara-treated and control groups began to separate after only one treatment. Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> shows the weight of pellets left in the tube following a 2-h testing period after each application. The control mice had less weight left in the tubes than treated mice, meaning that burrowing activity was higher; whereas Aldara-treated mice burrowed less with each application. Unfortunately, this test could not be continued over the full duration of the treatment period as it has been reported that a decline in performance may occur due to over-exposure to the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These custom-made burrowing tubes were designed in such a way that they did not interfere with the area of treated dorsal skin; and it was observed throughout the model that the treated mice displayed a normal range of physical ability, for example climbing on the bars of the cage. Therefore, this significantly impaired burrowing activity indicates that cutaneous Aldara treatment has a negative effect on the well-being of the mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that peripherally induced, tissue-specific inflammation can &#8216;remotely&#8217; alter the transcriptional profile of the brain, independently of a similar response in the periphery. Topical Aldara treatment, which induces a psoriasis-like skin inflammation, causes the upregulation of a number of genes in the brain, including seven inflammatory chemokines and one chemokine receptor, a response that was not mimicked by PBL. This response peaks following the third application but persists beyond the fifth application suggesting a prolonged expression in the brain. That this response was also seen with topically applied reconstituted IMQ, but not with a sterile model of skin inflammation, implicates peripheral TLR ligation as an important mechanism in the induction of this response. In addition, the lack of a brain response following an I.P. injection of reconstituted IMQ suggests that the localised skin response is also an important factor in driving the brain response.</p><p>The use of reconstituted IMQ yielded an interesting result in that a significant brain response was observed in the absence of an overt skin inflammation, which is important when considering the mechanisms of communication between the periphery and the brain. Although the lack of cutaneous inflammation is reportedly due to the omission of isostearic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it is difficult to hypothesise how the effects of peripheral inflammation are being transmitted to the brain without the generation of a local inflammatory response or circulating inflammatory cytokines. It is also notable that neither induction of a &#8216;sterile&#8217; cutaneous inflammatory response nor intraperitoneal administration of IMQ resulted in the generation of a brain response in our study. One possibility that might unite these disparate observations is that the communication between the inflamed skin and the brain is not driven by inflammatory agents but by direct ligation of TLRs on sensory nerves within the skin which then transmit a response to the brain inducing transcriptional changes associated with &#8216;sickness behaviour&#8217;. A number of studies have shown TLR expression on peripheral nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and a further series of experiments is planned by our lab to specifically address this issue. An alternative hypothesis is that tissue-resident myeloid cells, or other leukocytes exposed to the inflamed environment in the skin, could transmit the signal to the brain directly, by migrating through the circulation to the brain. Alternatively, they could transmit inflammatory signals indirectly, by causing damage to peripheral nerves that is then sensed by the brain. Whilst we do not feel this provides a mechanistic explanation for our observations, due to the fact that TPA treatment induces a potent inflammatory response in the skin and is not associated with chemokine upregulation in the brain, further studies would be required to investigate this potential route of immune-to-brain communication.</p><p>Strikingly, in addition to triggering the expression of chemokines in the brain, topical Aldara treatment was associated with a sizable recruitment of several leukocyte populations to the brain, including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, NK T cells and monocytes. On day 3, the monocyte populations in the brain were Ly6C<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup> and Ly6C<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>, whereas by day 5, they were predominantly Ly6C<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup> monocytes and Ly6C<sup>-</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup> macrophages. This is likely indicative of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Although we cannot directly link enhanced chemokine production to leukocyte recruitment, the chemokine profile in the brain was highly specific to the cell populations recruited.</p><p>Several groups have shown that chemokine induction in the brain can induce leukocyte infiltration, both under neuroinflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], in response to peripheral inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and during CNS viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The brain specific chemokine profile that is triggered following topical Aldara treatment bears a notable resemblance to the array of chemokines that are induced in the brain following encephalitic virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, the leukocyte populations that infiltrate the brain following Aldara treatment: monocytes, effector memory T cells, NK cells and NKT cells, are populations that play a prominent role during viral infection and are often crucial for pathogen clearance. Furthermore, as would be expected during viral encephalitis, IMQ, the active component of Aldara, stimulates TLR7 to mimic a viral response. Thus, in response to TLR7 ligation in the periphery, the brain may specifically produce monocyte and lymphocyte chemoattractants to recruit the appropriate populations required to protect the brain against a potential viral infection.</p><p>The infiltration of immune cells into the brain following a remote immune challenge is both surprising and interesting. The generation of a cellular brain response following peripheral inflammation could indicate the presence of a protective surveillance mechanism initiated when a potential CNS insult is anticipated to &#8216;prime&#8217; the brain. However, further studies would need to be performed before we could begin to unpick the role of these infiltrating cells, and their fate beyond the time points examined.</p><p>A key question regarding this response relates to the temporal relationship between chemokine induction in the brain and leukocyte recruitment, as infiltrating leukocytes may either have responded to chemokines made in the brain prior to their recruitment, or may in fact have contributed to the expression of the detected chemokines. However, at least two key inflammatory chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL2, are upregulated in the brain at the protein level by 4&#160;h respectively following topical Aldara treatment, whereas immune cells are not recruited into the brain until 72&#160;h post-treatment. This leads us to propose that chemokine production within the brain parenchyma precedes, and is likely to be at least partially responsible for, the subsequent recruitment of immune cells.</p><p>In addition to immune cell infiltration, chemokines are also implicated in a number of neuromodulatory processes, including neurotransmission, development and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], indicating that changes in chemokine expression could disrupt essential homeostatic events in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In this study, we have been able to link peripheral cutaneous inflammation with two relevant functional outputs: an impairment in adult neurogenesis at the dentate gyrus and a reduction in burrowing activity of mice, a behaviour that has been shown to be a sensitive representation of neuropsychiatric imbalance in a number of inflammatory CNS disease models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It is worth noting that whilst food pellets were a convenient material to be used in large quantities, it is assumed that this model is not appetite-dependent and mice were not &#8216;food rationed&#8217; at any time. Nevertheless, it remains possible that an additional contribution to the lack of burrowing seen in the inflamed mice may come from a generalised lack of interest in food as a consequence of an impaired sense of well-being. Of course, to fully characterise the behavioural deficits in response to Aldara treatment, and to associate these with neuropsychiatric conditions, more sophisticated, impairment-specific behavioural tests should be performed. Nonetheless, our data suggest that inflammation generated at distant sites has the potential to negatively influence homeostatic brain function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study shows that peripheral, tissue-specific skin inflammation can remotely induce both transcriptional and functional responses in the brain, and it implicates inflammatory chemokines as potential mediators of the brain response to peripheral inflammation. This study has provided a comprehensive characterisation of the peripherally triggered, infiltrating leukocytes in the brain, which have the potential to exert a profound effect on CNS homeostasis. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the CNS to peripheral changes and offer a correlative insight into how chronic inflammatory diseases are commonly associated with the onset of neuropsychiatric co-morbidities. With further investigation, it is hoped that the intricate mechanisms can be unravelled and key mediators identified, thus allowing for better treatment strategies for these co-morbid disorders.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12974_2016_562_MOESM2_ESM.png" id="MOESM2"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Fluorescent antibodies used for lymphoid* and myeloid** cell flow cytometry analysis.
