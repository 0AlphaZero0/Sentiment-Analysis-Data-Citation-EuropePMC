</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the brain and the immune system has become increasingly topical as, although it is immune-specialised, the CNS is not free from the influences of the immune system. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia, are a significant and growing burden to society [1] and are also commonly associated with chronic inflammatory disorders [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, we know very little about the mechanisms underpinning this relationship. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Increasingly compelling data have highlighted possible roles for a number of immune mediators, including inflammatory cytokines, in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Examples include (a) treatment of hepatitis C with IFN-α results in the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) in around 50 % of patients and is the most common reason for ceasing treatment [3–5], (b) the treatment of psoriasis patients with the anti-TNF drug etanercept improved the clinical symptoms of depression independently of an improvement in psoriatic disease score in patients [6, 7] and (c) patients suffering from long-term MDD or schizophrenia have an elevated inflammatory profile [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In essence these pathology-, or therapy-, associated depressive episodes represent exaggerated presentations of the so-called ‘sickness behaviour’, which is a recognised and normal response typically associated with microbial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, despite these correlations, it remains unclear how inflammation in the periphery relates to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One family of cytokines that might play a key role in this communication pathway is the chemotactic cytokine, or chemokine, family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The classical role of chemokines is in mediating cell trafficking and inflammatory chemokines are important for cell migration during immune and inflammatory responses [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Many chemokines, such as CXCL12, are expressed in the brain in steady-state and play an important role in development and homeostasis [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, some inflammatory chemokines are also expressed in the brain and are upregulated during infection [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that, in systemic inflammatory disease contexts, brain-expressed chemokines would drive immune cell infiltration into the brain, leading to the activation of local cells resulting in co-morbid psychiatric disorders [14–16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we used a well-characterised mouse model of skin inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The topical application of Aldara™, a commercially available drug which contains the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 ligand imiquimod (IMQ), to the dorsal skin of mice, causes a psoriasis-like skin pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The ease and reproducibility of this model made it ideal for our study [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that peripheral skin inflammation can induce a ‘remote’ chemokine response in the brain that appears to be maintained independently of a response in the periphery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that this is associated with leukocyte infiltration into the brain parenchyma, a reduction in neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and behavioural alterations reflected in a suppression of burrowing behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the impact of peripheral immune stimulation on homeostatic CNS function and implicate chemokines and their receptors as potential therapeutic targets for chronic inflammatory disease associated neuropsychiatric co-morbidities. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the expression of Ccl3, Ccl5 and Cxcl10 was increased almost 1000-fold at this time point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>With the exception of Ccl3 and Cxcl10, the expression of all genes remained significantly elevated at day 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This was particularly notable for Ccl5, the expression level of which was approximately 900-fold greater than the control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Importantly, when comparing the fold induction in the brain to that of the PBL, expression of all chemokine/chemokine receptor target genes was increased to a significantly greater level in the brain than PBL at day 3 of the Aldara model (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Therefore, alterations to the transcriptional profile of the brain were not a consequence of residual peripheral blood contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Again, with the exception of Ccl3 and Cxcl10, the fold-change induction remains significantly greater in the brain than the PBL at day 5. Ccr5 was the only gene that shows a significantly greater fold-change induction in the PBL than in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>However, this was only observed on day 1 of the Aldara model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Although the microarray data demonstrated a significant induction of the gene encoding CXCL9, this appeared to be below the detection limit of the QRT-PCR assay and could not be validated in the PBL and the brain (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It was therefore excluded from further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Together, these data confirm that topical Aldara treatment triggers a large increase in chemokine transcription in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the response in the brain differs both in magnitude and temporal patterning to that in the PBL, with chemokine transcription remaining elevated throughout the model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the transcriptional response in the brain was being driven by the presence of circulating inflammatory cytokines, protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, CCL2 and CCL3 were assessed at different time points using luminex (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>There are reports that, along with the active TLR agonist, imiquimod, Aldara cream contains another active component: isostearic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This component of the vehicle is thought to activate the inflammasome, induce keratinocyte cell death and stimulate the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>To further explore the mechanisms by which the brain-specific chemokine response is induced following Aldara treatment, and to discriminate between the activities of the isostearic acid and IMQ, soluble IMQ was dissolved in isostearic acid-free aqueous control cream and applied topically to the dorsal skin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>As before, mice treated with soluble IMQ lost a significant amount of weight after the first two treatments (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Their weights remained significantly lower than the control group throughout the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Aldara treatment, topical soluble IMQ treatment was not associated with significant skin inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The skin sections, examined after five applications of IMQ cream, do not show any overt signs of epidermal hyperplasia, keratosis or erythema (Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this aspect of the response may be independent of TLR stimulation and reliant instead on the actions of isostearic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, all chemokine/chemokine receptor target genes were significantly elevated in the brain following topical IMQ treatment, independently of alterations in PBL (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Of note, Ccl3, Ccl5 and Ccr5 presented with a fold-change induction upwards of 1000-fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In this model, all genes encoding chemokine ligands were downregulated in the PBL of treated mice compared with control mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>With regard to all genes, the fold-change induction in the brain following treatment was significantly higher than the fold change in PBL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that, although the different active components of Aldara may be responsible for driving different aspects of the response, the actions of TLR ligand IMQ alone are sufficient to induce the remote differential chemokine response in the brain.Fig. 3Topically applied imiquimod induces a transcriptional brain response but does not induce psoriasis-like skin inflammation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the previous models, this treatment did not induce any weight loss over the 5-day period and the weights of the treated mice increased gradually in line with the control group (Additional file 4: Figure S2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In stark contrast to the potent chemokine response that was induced in the brain following topical Aldara and/or IMQ application, only Ccl5 and Ccr5 were significantly elevated in the brain (Additional file 4: Figure S2B) and this induction was modest (approximately threefold and 1.2-fold, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Further, the induction of Ccl5 and Ccr5 expression in the brain did not differ in magnitude to that of the PBL. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>To examine possible behavioural correlates of increased brain chemokine expression and T cell accumulation, we next undertook behavioural analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>As a behavioural read-out, a basic burrowing model, in which mice burrow for food pellets, was employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The read-out is the weight of pellets remaining in the burrowing tubes, as opposed to that burrowed out of the tubes, after defined periods of time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Burrowing is an innately rewarding activity in rodents; thus, this model indicates the level of well-being in mice based on the amount of burrowing activity that they participate in. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>As such, this model has been used in various studies to identify a behavioural output following inflammatory stimuli [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Mice were acclimatised to the burrowing tubes prior to treatment, and baseline tests were performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Whilst the baseline tests showed a wide range of burrowing activity, the Aldara-treated and control groups began to separate after only one treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Figure 7c shows the weight of pellets left in the tube following a 2-h testing period after each application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The control mice had less weight left in the tubes than treated mice, meaning that burrowing activity was higher; whereas Aldara-treated mice burrowed less with each application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, this test could not be continued over the full duration of the treatment period as it has been reported that a decline in performance may occur due to over-exposure to the procedure [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>These custom-made burrowing tubes were designed in such a way that they did not interfere with the area of treated dorsal skin; and it was observed throughout the model that the treated mice displayed a normal range of physical ability, for example climbing on the bars of the cage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this significantly impaired burrowing activity indicates that cutaneous Aldara treatment has a negative effect on the well-being of the mice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that peripherally induced, tissue-specific inflammation can ‘remotely’ alter the transcriptional profile of the brain, independently of a similar response in the periphery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Topical Aldara treatment, which induces a psoriasis-like skin inflammation, causes the upregulation of a number of genes in the brain, including seven inflammatory chemokines and one chemokine receptor, a response that was not mimicked by PBL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>This response peaks following the third application but persists beyond the fifth application suggesting a prolonged expression in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>That this response was also seen with topically applied reconstituted IMQ, but not with a sterile model of skin inflammation, implicates peripheral TLR ligation as an important mechanism in the induction of this response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>In addition, the lack of a brain response following an I.P. injection of reconstituted IMQ suggests that the localised skin response is also an important factor in driving the brain response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>The use of reconstituted IMQ yielded an interesting result in that a significant brain response was observed in the absence of an overt skin inflammation, which is important when considering the mechanisms of communication between the periphery and the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Although the lack of cutaneous inflammation is reportedly due to the omission of isostearic acid [25], it is difficult to hypothesise how the effects of peripheral inflammation are being transmitted to the brain without the generation of a local inflammatory response or circulating inflammatory cytokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>It is also notable that neither induction of a ‘sterile’ cutaneous inflammatory response nor intraperitoneal administration of IMQ resulted in the generation of a brain response in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>One possibility that might unite these disparate observations is that the communication between the inflamed skin and the brain is not driven by inflammatory agents but by direct ligation of TLRs on sensory nerves within the skin which then transmit a response to the brain inducing transcriptional changes associated with ‘sickness behaviour’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have shown TLR expression on peripheral nerves [37–39], and a further series of experiments is planned by our lab to specifically address this issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>An alternative hypothesis is that tissue-resident myeloid cells, or other leukocytes exposed to the inflamed environment in the skin, could transmit the signal to the brain directly, by migrating through the circulation to the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they could transmit inflammatory signals indirectly, by causing damage to peripheral nerves that is then sensed by the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Whilst we do not feel this provides a mechanistic explanation for our observations, due to the fact that TPA treatment induces a potent inflammatory response in the skin and is not associated with chemokine upregulation in the brain, further studies would be required to investigate this potential route of immune-to-brain communication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, in addition to triggering the expression of chemokines in the brain, topical Aldara treatment was associated with a sizable recruitment of several leukocyte populations to the brain, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, NK T cells and monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>On day 3, the monocyte populations in the brain were Ly6C+CD64- and Ly6C+CD64+, whereas by day 5, they were predominantly Ly6C+CD64+ monocytes and Ly6C-CD64+ macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>This is likely indicative of monocyte to macrophage differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot directly link enhanced chemokine production to leukocyte recruitment, the chemokine profile in the brain was highly specific to the cell populations recruited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Several groups have shown that chemokine induction in the brain can induce leukocyte infiltration, both under neuroinflammatory conditions [16, 40–43], in response to peripheral inflammation [44] and during CNS viral infection [16, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>The brain specific chemokine profile that is triggered following topical Aldara treatment bears a notable resemblance to the array of chemokines that are induced in the brain following encephalitic virus infection [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the leukocyte populations that infiltrate the brain following Aldara treatment: monocytes, effector memory T cells, NK cells and NKT cells, are populations that play a prominent role during viral infection and are often crucial for pathogen clearance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as would be expected during viral encephalitis, IMQ, the active component of Aldara, stimulates TLR7 to mimic a viral response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Thus, in response to TLR7 ligation in the periphery, the brain may specifically produce monocyte and lymphocyte chemoattractants to recruit the appropriate populations required to protect the brain against a potential viral infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>The infiltration of immune cells into the brain following a remote immune challenge is both surprising and interesting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>The generation of a cellular brain response following peripheral inflammation could indicate the presence of a protective surveillance mechanism initiated when a potential CNS insult is anticipated to ‘prime’ the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>However, further studies would need to be performed before we could begin to unpick the role of these infiltrating cells, and their fate beyond the time points examined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>A key question regarding this response relates to the temporal relationship between chemokine induction in the brain and leukocyte recruitment, as infiltrating leukocytes may either have responded to chemokines made in the brain prior to their recruitment, or may in fact have contributed to the expression of the detected chemokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>However, at least two key inflammatory chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL2, are upregulated in the brain at the protein level by 4 h respectively following topical Aldara treatment, whereas immune cells are not recruited into the brain until 72 h post-treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>This leads us to propose that chemokine production within the brain parenchyma precedes, and is likely to be at least partially responsible for, the subsequent recruitment of immune cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>In addition to immune cell infiltration, chemokines are also implicated in a number of neuromodulatory processes, including neurotransmission, development and neurogenesis [11, 46–48], indicating that changes in chemokine expression could disrupt essential homeostatic events in the CNS [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have been able to link peripheral cutaneous inflammation with two relevant functional outputs: an impairment in adult neurogenesis at the dentate gyrus and a reduction in burrowing activity of mice, a behaviour that has been shown to be a sensitive representation of neuropsychiatric imbalance in a number of inflammatory CNS disease models [24, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that whilst food pellets were a convenient material to be used in large quantities, it is assumed that this model is not appetite-dependent and mice were not ‘food rationed’ at any time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it remains possible that an additional contribution to the lack of burrowing seen in the inflamed mice may come from a generalised lack of interest in food as a consequence of an impaired sense of well-being. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Of course, to fully characterise the behavioural deficits in response to Aldara treatment, and to associate these with neuropsychiatric conditions, more sophisticated, impairment-specific behavioural tests should be performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, our data suggest that inflammation generated at distant sites has the potential to negatively influence homeostatic brain function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study shows that peripheral, tissue-specific skin inflammation can remotely induce both transcriptional and functional responses in the brain, and it implicates inflammatory chemokines as potential mediators of the brain response to peripheral inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>This study has provided a comprehensive characterisation of the peripherally triggered, infiltrating leukocytes in the brain, which have the potential to exert a profound effect on CNS homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the CNS to peripheral changes and offer a correlative insight into how chronic inflammatory diseases are commonly associated with the onset of neuropsychiatric co-morbidities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>With further investigation, it is hoped that the intricate mechanisms can be unravelled and key mediators identified, thus allowing for better treatment strategies for these co-morbid disorders. </plain></SENT>
