Surface active species of vehicle-emission soot can serve as electron transfer-mediators in mitochondrion. Revealing the role of surface oxidation state in particles-proteins interaction will promote the understanding on metabolism and toxicity. Here, the surface oxidation state was modeled by nitro/amino ligands on nanoparticles, the interaction with blood proteins were evaluated by capillary electrophoresis quantitatively. The nitro shown larger affinity than amino. On the other hand, the affinity to hemoglobin is 10<sup>3</sup> times larger than that to BSA. Further, molecular docking indicated the difference of binding intensity were mainly determined by hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds. These will deepen the quantitative understanding of protein-nanoparticles interaction from the perspective of surface chemical state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Epidemiologic research reveal the complexities and uncertainties in identifying the relationship of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>1, 2.5, 10</sub>) with various physiological dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Surface oxidation state of actual carbon soot would be more complex. In this study, the amino/nitro groups had been selected as an example to evaluate the impact on interaction with blood proteins from the perspective of molecular interaction. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be high-quality synthesized with controlled size and shape. They are stable enough in solution, and also can be decorated by different ligands to get desired surface properties. These advantages make it useful for biosensor or biomedicine. It is also an ideal material for the study of surface effect of nanoparticles with biomolecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

Here, AuNPs was synthesized and modified by 4-aminothiolphenol (ATP) and 4-nitrobenzenethiol (NBT) to model the surface oxidation state of carbon soot. Then, the interaction of particles with serum albumin (BSA) and bovine hemoglobin (BHb) were investigated by CZE and ACE quantitatively, giving the dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) and cooperativeness coefficients (n) according to the Hill equation. Further, the binding sites and force were evaluated by molecular docking. Results demonstrate the surface oxidation state can affect the intensity and mode of protein conjugation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Stability in solution</title><p>Firstly, the stability of thiophenol-capped AuNPs was investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra in the buffer solution. Five mole rate samples were prepared by mixing AuNPs and ligands stock solution in the range of 10:1, 10<sup>2</sup>:1, 10<sup>3</sup>:1, 10<sup>4</sup>:1 and 10<sup>5</sup>:1. The absorption spectra for each sample is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. Citrate AuNPs are stable in solution and have a characteristic plasmon band at 520&#8201;nm. The plasmon spectrum is sensitive to the nanoparticle surface charger, as the concentration of thiophenol increased, nanoparticles surface potential switched up to relatively positive (refer to the zeta potential date in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supporting information</xref>). The aggregation will lead to dipole coupling of the plasmon between neighboring particles, the color of the solution changes from wine red to blue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, the band of AuNPs shifted to a new longer wavelengths at 750&#8201;nm for ATP. No aggregation was observed as the concentration increased in NBT-AuNPs system, the nitro group could play the citrate role to stabilize the AuNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SERS of ATP/NBT capping AuNPs</title><p>The plasmonic coupling between the nanoparticles could result in strong electromagnetic enhancement for the ligand molecule. For more information about the surface chemical component on AuNPs, SERS spectra was employed to confirm the ATP and NBT ligands. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, the strongest band at approximate 1077&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is attributed to the stretching vibration of C-S, and the band at approximate 1580&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is C-C stretching vibration of benzene rings. In detail, the Raman spectra peak at 390&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were attributed to the a<sub>1</sub> model of the ATP, the peak at 1171 and 1489&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> belong to the b<sub>2</sub> model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), the peak at 1344 and 1636&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> are assigned to the a<sub>1</sub> model of NBT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Raman intensity increases with the increasing concentration of ligand, especially, the great Raman signal was observed at the critical concentration ratio of 10<sup>3</sup>:1. It is concluded that the thiophenol molecules bonded to the Au surfaces nearly vertically via formation of the Au-S bond. The maximum occupation number of thiophenol molecule on one gold nanoparticles could be calculated as 1380. At the concentration ratio of 10<sup>2</sup>:1, the surface of the nanoparticles was not wholly covered with thiophenol layer, the residual 2-hydroxypropane-1, 2, 3-tricarboxylate could protect the colloidal gold nanoparticles from aggregation in buffer solution. Therefore, the thiophenol capped nanoparticles will be stable over a wide range of ionic strength and pH for following CE analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BSA-ATP/NBT system</title><p>In CE process, no distinct complex peak was observed in interaction of NBT capping AuNPs with BSA, confirmed that their model was fast dissociation system. The interaction was investigated by ACE in phosphate buffer (20&#8201;mM, pH 7.5) with BSA concentration ranging from 10.0&#8201;nM to 10.0&#8201;&#956;M. The curve fitting results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. The first slight negative peaks were EOF maker and the migration peaks after the EOF marker were the AuNPs peaks. The AuNPs migrated faster in capillary as the BSA concentration increased gradually, then the retention time reached the minimum at 1.0&#8201;&#956;M (BSA). BSA were negatively charged under conventional neutral physiological conditions, the dynamic bound could speed up the migration of AuNPs. The peak broadening was also observed just the protein was injected, that indicating the absorption of BSA on capillary wall. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref> show the electropherograms of the interaction between ATP-AuNPs with protein, from that one can observe that a two distributions broad peak appear at the BSA concentration increased to 0.5&#8201;&#956;M, the prior slight peak was identified as the BSA-particles complex, the second was particles peak, and that the complex peak increased with the BSA concentration, while the AuNP peak decreased gradually and disappeared at 10&#8201;&#956;M finally. Therefore, interactions of ATP-AuNPs and BSA can be attributed to the quasi-slow dissociation model, the K<sub>D</sub> and n of particles-protein complex can be obtain according to the fitting of Hill equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>). The affinity decreased with the surface oxidation status of particles, the NBT have a K<sub>D</sub> value 0.138&#8201;&#956;M, the ATP have a K<sub>D</sub> value 1.57&#8201;&#956;M, the binding cooperativeness n value were 0.73 and 0.78 for the two types of AuNPs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BHb-ATP/NBT system</title><p>Interactions between BHb and the model particles were typical slow dissociation systems. The association endow the bound AuNPs with faster migration than that free one. The protein-particles complex can be successfully separated and the distinct bound AuNPs peaks were observed. After incubation, the solution was injected and resolved in the 20&#8201;mM pH 8.0 borate buffer solution. The broaden peak after the EOF maker was attributed to the complex, this peak increased with the protein concentration. For ATP-AuNPs, the bound AuNPs appeared at the BHb concentration 0.01&#8201;&#956;M, and the peak capacity reached the maximum at 0.08&#8201;&#956;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). For NBT-AuNPs, the bound peak were first detected at the protein concentration 50.0&#8201;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> and n of AuNPs-protein complex were calculated using the Hill equation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,h</xref>. The NBT capping AuNPs get a K<sub>D</sub> value 14.81&#8201;nM, the ATP capping AuNPs have a K<sub>D</sub> value 24.23&#8201;nM, the binding cooperativeness n value were 2.08 and 1.98, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding sites in BSA and BHb</title><p>The AS5 binding pocket of BSA is located at the interface between subdomains IIA and IIB. The bi-ATP molecule rotates to the vertical position with twin phenyl planar angle 92.3&#176; and then inserted the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). One amino of bi-ATP creates single hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of carboxyl group of Ala 209 in IIA/helix2, and the rings make hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding leucine (Leu303,Leu326, Leu480), alanine (Ala212, Ala349,), Lys350 and Val481 residues by CH-&#960; bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The bi-NBT molecule binds into the pocket with twin phenyl planar angle 89.9&#176;, one nitro group of ligand creates single hydrogen bond with the main-chain amides moiety of Lys350 in IIB/helix7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), the other interacts via &#960;-&#960; bond with the side-chain indole ring of Trp213 in IIA/helix2. The twin rings are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with surrounding Ala209, Ala212, Ala329, Leu326, Leu346, Leu480, Val481 and Ser343 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In the BHb system, the structure of tri-ATP molecule was optimized with two dihedral angle of tri-phenyl planar 56.6&#176; and 147.3&#176;, it bound into the central sulcus constituted by &#945;<sub>1</sub> and &#945;<sub>2</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). One amino make two hydrogen bonds with carboxyl group of Asn 131, another bond with hydroxyl group of Ser 138 in &#945;<sub>2</sub> subunit helix 9, the last one bond with main chain carboxyl group of Thr 134 in &#945;1 subunit helix 9. The tri-ATP ligands interactes with phenyl of Tyr 140 and pyrryl of Pro 77 by &#960;-&#960; bonds, make hydrophobic interactions with the leu2, leu346, Val1 and Thr134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In the BHb-NBT, the dihedral angle of tri-phenyl planar change to 50.6&#176; and 160.3, the first nitro group of ligands bind with carboxyl group of Thr 134, amides moiety of Val135, carboxyl group of Asn131 in &#945;<sub>1</sub> subunit and N-terminal of Val1 in &#945;<sub>2</sub> subunit by four hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The N and O of second nitro and third nitro group bound by two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Ser 138 and the carboxyl group of Asn 131 in &#945;<sub>2</sub> subunit, respectively. The phenyl rings is stabilized by &#960;-&#960; bonds with Tyr 140 and Pro 77, and make hydrophobic interactions with the Leu 2, Leu 76 and Val 135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The conjugation of proteins mainly depends on the surface properties of nanoparticles at the bio-nano interface. It is believed that different affinity of proteins are mainly caused by the binding ability of two types of ligands. Molecular docking study have been used for evaluating the interaction force and dissociation constant of the two ligands. The larger size of both AuNPs and protein makes the ligands to only interact with the surface active site of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. AS5 binding site, located at the interface between subdomains IIA and IIB of BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), had been proved as the pocket for small molecule, such as fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In this study, the AS5 site was selected as the potential binding sites for docking. Likewise, a surface pocket at the central cavity of the &#945;<sub>1</sub> &#945;<sub>2</sub> subunits is selected as potential binding sites for BHb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. According to their corresponding pocket size, 4-aminothiophenol/4-nitrobenzenethiol were reconstructed into bi-amino/nitro ligands by ethynyl and tri-amino/nitro ligands by ternary heterocycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,d</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Size and surface properties are important determinant factors for affinity and cooperativity of particles-protein interaction. Those forces determine the nano-bio interaction in water solution involves van der Waals, electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, solvation forces. In this study, the binding of particles-protein was carried out at the certain pH, ionic strength and solvent properties. The physical size was 15&#8201;nm from TEM date (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The hydrodynamic diameter of nitro-AuNPs and amino-AuNPs were measured by DLS methods in PBS buffer solution, the value were 35.08&#8201;nm (nitro-AuNPs) and 29.25&#8201;nm (amino-AuNPs), the zeta potential of two particles were &#8722;62.8&#8201;mV and &#8722;58.9&#8201;mV, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), this attributed to the partially substitution of thiophenol on particles surface. These results indicate that the size of two particles are similar, the surface charge are both negatively. On the other hand, the results shown high affinity interactions between model particles and protein, the K<sub>D</sub> values for amino mode (ATP-BSA) was 1.57&#8201;&#956;M and for the nitro mode (NBT-BSA) was 0.138&#8201;&#956;M. The affinity decreases as the ligand nitro reduced to amino, the oxidation state was 10 times larger than the reduction one, and the corresponding scoring results from docking also proved the tendency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The cooperativeness coefficient n were calculated as 0.73 and 0.78, indicated the negative cooperativity effects for both of the model particles. BSA was composed of three homologous domains (I&#8211;III) and each domain in turn is the product of two sub-domains (A, B)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The primary binding site is situated in the hydrophobic core of sub domain IIA and IIIA, which bound mostly with neutral heterocyclic compounds and aromatic compounds by electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, or van der Waals interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. According to the literature reported, the isoelectric point of BSA and BHb are 4.9 and 6.8 at 25&#8201;&#176;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In pH 7.5 buffer solution, the two proteins can also get the negatively surface charge. Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion between particles and proteins will oppose their binding. On the other hand, previous studies suggested that the hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds played major roles in the binging between nitrobenzene compounds and serum albumin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. As the docking results indicated, the oxygen atoms of -NO<sub>2</sub> group have more electronegativity than the nitrogen atom of -NH<sub>2</sub> which can form more hydrogen bonds with the residue in binding sites. Likewise, the electron-withdrawing power of -NO<sub>2</sub> group make the aromatic ring get relative positive electrostatic potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. It is believed that the interaction between nitro/amino-AuNPs with ptoteins are mainly influence by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. In BHb system, the distinct peaks of bound particles were detected in electrophoresis, and the calculation results shown high binding propensities between protein with both of the two particles and had average K<sub>D</sub> values 10<sup>3</sup> times lower than that of BSA system. The cooperativeness coefficient were also obtained as the value of 2.08 and 1.98, revealed the positive cooperatives effects. According to the binding pocket size, the central cavity of BHb can bind with three ligands at the same time, which is larger than the AS5 of BSA. The docking results also indicated that any one of ligands can make more hydrogen bonds with residues in BHb than that in BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). These may be responsible for the highly strong affinity between BHb and model particles.</p><p>The effect of surface oxidation state on particles-protein conjugation intensity and model were quantitatively evaluated by CZE and ACE methods. The oxidation state determined the conjugation intensity and model, towards BSA, the nitro-particles shown larger affinity than amino-particles, the accumulation would resist the transportation and make metabolism difficult in the vascular system. For BHb, both of the two particles shown very high binding tendency, indicated the positive cooperatives effects. The binding with hemoglobin may influence the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. These will promote the understanding for PM-related cardiovascular effects from the perspective of chemical molecular interaction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of Model Particles</title><p>The morphology of AuNPs were obtained using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200&#8201;kV.

The 75&#8201;&#956;m i.d. fused-silica capillary (60&#8201;cm total length, 50&#8201;cm effective length, Polymicro Technologies) was sequentially rinsed with 0.1&#8201;M NaOH solution for 1&#8201;h, deionized water for 1&#8201;h, and the running buffer for 30&#8201;min before analysis. Electrophoresis was conducted with a constant voltage of 20&#8201;kV for 9&#8201;min at 25&#8201;&#176;C using ethanol as the EOF marker. All solutions were degassed under sonication just before use. Capillary zone electrophoresis was performed in 20&#8201;mM borate buffer at pH 7.5, protein-conjugated particles were injected at 20&#8201;kV for 5&#8201;s before separation. In affinity capillary electrophoresis, the running buffer was 20&#8201;mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 with the protein in concentrations ranging from 10.0&#8201;nM to 100&#8201;&#956;M for BSA, a solution of 10.0&#8201;nM NBT-AuNPs were inject at 20&#8201;kV for 5&#8201;s.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular docking and scoring</title><p>Molecular docking was performed to obtain the binding affinity and the binding sites were analyzed. Molecular docking calculations were performed with the AutoDock 4.0 package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The Gasteiger partial charges were assigned to the ligand and the receptor using AutoDock tools 1.52. AutoDock generates different ligand conformers using a Lamarkian genetic algorithm (LGA). All single bonds of the ligand were treated as rotatable during the docking calculation, and altogether 12 flexible torsions were defined. The structure of bi-amino/nitro ligands and tri-amino/nitro ligands was obtained by ChemAxon software, optimized by OpenBabel 2.3.0 using MMFF94 force field model and then used for the docking studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The center of the grid box was set to the center of complex of ligands and protein, the box size was set to 60&#8201;&#215;&#8201;60&#8201;&#215;&#8201;60 with grid spacing 0.375&#8201;&#197; in each dimension, which is large enough for the free rotation of the ligand. Each docking calculation generated 100 structures. The AutoDock scoring function includes terms accounting for short-range van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, and dissociation constant and hydrogen bonding were selected according to the size of clusters RMSD and the estimated free energy of binding (FEB). The PDB structure of BSA (PBD ID: 4JK4, 4OR0) was used for searching the potential binding sites and docking. PDB structure of bovine hemoglobin (PBD ID: 3CIU) was used for docking assessment, human hemoglobin structure (PDB ID: 3R5I) was served as a template for the binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Liu, Z. <italic>et al</italic>.
