The genomic annotation of Jumbo phage is often disappointing because most of the predicted proteins, including structural proteins, failed to make good hits to the sequences in the databases. In this study, 23 proteins of a novel <italic>Bacillus</italic> Jumbo phage, vB_BpuM_BpSp, were identified as phage structural proteins by the structural proteome analysis, including 14 proteins of unknown function, 5 proteins with predicted function as structural proteins, a glycoside hydrolase, a Holliday junction resolvase, a RNA-polymerase &#946;-subunit, and a host-coding portal protein, which might be hijacked from the host strain during phage virion assembly. The glycoside hydrolase (Gp255) was identified as phage virion component and was found to interact with the phage baseplate protein. Gp255 shows specific lytic activity against the phage host strain GR8 and has high temperature tolerance. <italic>In situ</italic> peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activities analysis revealed that the expressed Gp255 and phage structural proteome exhibited glycoside hydrolysis activity against the tested GR8 cell extracts. This study identified the first functional individual structural glycoside hydrolase in phage virion. The presence of activated glycoside hydrolase in phage virions might facilitate the injection of the phage genome during infection by forming pores on the bacterial cell wall.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>jumbo bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>structural proteome</kwd><kwd>glycoside hydrolase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31500155</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">31170123</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Chinese Academy of Sciences<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002367</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">KSZD-EW-Z-021-2-2</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6992"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria and exhibit extremely high abundant and diversity (Rohwer, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mizuno et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Tailed phages with genomes larger than 200 kbp are known as &#8220;Jumbo phages&#8221; or &#8220;giant phages&#8221; (Hendrix, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Although the Jumbo phage was discovered 47 years ago (<italic>Bacillus</italic> phage G), they have rarely been isolated, and so far, only the genomes of 82 Jumbo phages have been deposited in the GenBank database. The newly isolated Jumbo phages usually exhibit low genome similarity to the previously isolated ones and contain numerous genes of unknown function (Lecoutere et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Abbasifar et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Hence, genomic annotation of Jumbo phages is often disappointing. Structural proteome analysis of phages has been proved to an effective approach for identifying unknown phage structural proteins and for discovering new phage structural proteins. Proteomic analysis of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> Jumbo phage 201&#981;2-1 virions revealed that the RNA polymerase &#946; or &#946;&#8242; subunit is component of phage virions and this phage contains more structural proteins than the smaller phages (Thomas et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In our lab, a novel <italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic> Jumbo phage, vB_BpuM_BpSp, was isolated and sequenced. The phage exhibits extremely low genome similarity to the existing biological entities and its virions contain several unique substructures, including the curly tail fibers (unpublished data). Genomic annotation of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KT895374">KT895374</ext-link>) identified eight phage structural proteins, including four proteins with no exact function assigned. In this study, we analyzed the structural proteome of the Jumbo phage vB_BpuM_BpSp, and our results show that an individual glycoside hydrolase is component of the phage virion and it was found to interact with the baseplate protein. The existence of a glycoside hydrolase as phage structural component might facilitate the infection of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp to the host strain <italic>B. pumilus.</italic></p><p>Glycoside hydrolases are encoded by microbes and plants to catalyze the hydrolysis of polysaccharides (Bissaro et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The function of glycoside hydrolase is similar to that of phage endolysin, which degrades the bacterial cell wall and facilitate the release of mature progeny phages (Hermoso et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Several phages employ cell wall hydrolases to facilitate infection. The tail fiber protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phage T5 acts as a peptidoglycan hydrolase to form pores on the bacterial cell wall to transfer phage genome DNA (Boulanger et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The tail spike proteins of <italic>Salmonella</italic> phage P22, <italic>Shigella</italic> phage Sf6, <italic>E. coli</italic> phage HK620 and K5A all exhibit glycoside hydrolase activity (Chen and King, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Bhardwaj et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Phage Basilisk contains a chitinase as a virion structural component. However, the function of the chitinase is unknown (Grose et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The existence of the glycoside hydrolase domains on phage tail fiber and tail spike proteins could facilitate host recognition and infection of phages, through the binding and degradation of host lipopolysaccharides (Thompson et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Genes encoding glycoside hydrolases have been found in several phage genomes (Maaroufi and Levesque, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These discovered glycoside hydrolase domains all are the part of phage structural proteins, and to our knowledge, no individual glycoside hydrolase that might benefit the phage infection has been found. Comparison to phages with small genomes, the Jumbo phages contain large dsDNA genomes. Thus, the injection of Jumbo phage genomes is much more difficult and time consumption. To date, no mechanism that facilitates Jumbo phage genome injection and phage infection has been reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

To identify the structural proteins in the mature phage virion of vB_BpuM_BpSp, purified phage virions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by HPLC-MS/MS.

The curly tail fibers have also been observed on the virions of <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> phage 0305&#981;8-36, and the proteins ORF119, ORF129, and ORF131 of phage 0305&#981;8-36 have been speculated to be candidate curly tail fiber proteins (Thomas et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, such candidates for other phages remain unknown. Comparative proteomic analysis of the phages, vB_BpuM_BpSp and 0305&#981;8-36, revealed that two of the identified structural proteins (Gp25 and Gp133) of the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp are similar to the proteins, ORF154 and ORF129, of phage 0305&#981;8-36, respectively. Protein ORF154 was also identified as the associated tail protein in phage 0305&#981;8-36, although its exact function is unknown. Though the phages, vB_BpuM_BpSp and 0305&#981;8-36, exhibit extremely low similarity in genome sequences, they have similar tail fiber structures. The homologous structural protein coding genes, <italic>gp</italic>25 and <italic>gp</italic>133, might be candidate genes for curly tail fiber protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Candidate genes for phage capsid protein</title><p>Previous analysis of phage virion proteomes has revealed that the major capsid protein and tail sheath protein are the most abundant proteins in phage virions (Miller et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Lecoutere et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Chan et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Genome annotation of the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp revealed that its capsid proteins are unknown. In this study, the most abundant protein bands on the SDS-PAGE were identified to that of Gp196 and Gp197 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). By analyzing these two proteins using HHpred, we found that Gp197 contains head vertex protein domain, whereas no functional domain was found in protein Gp196.

Genes with related functions usually form gene clusters in phage genomes (Thomas et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Considering the location of these two genes in the phage genome and the results of their bioinformatic, we postulate that <italic>gp</italic>197 might be the major phage capsid protein gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatic features of Gp255</title><p>Structural proteomic analysis of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp virion revealed that six peptides were mapped to the glycoside hydrolase (Gp255), suggesting Gp255 is the structural component of the phage virion and it is located in the third gene subcluster of the structural protein-associated genes in the phage genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The G+C content of gene <italic>gp</italic>255 is 30.27%, which is a little higher than that of the phage genome (25.9%). Structural analysis of the proteins indicates that protein Gp255 contains a N-terminal glycosyl hydrolase catalytic domain, with four of the six peptides identified by MS mapped to this domain, and three LysM peptidoglycan binding domains, with one peptide identified by MS mapped to the first LysM domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Though only low similarity was observed, the catalytic domain contain conserved catalytic site residues as the endolysin of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> phage phiSM101 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) (Tamai et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All three LysM domains have 43 amino acid residues and the first one differs from the second one by only three amino acid residues, whereas the third one shows low similarity to the first and the second ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Compared to the LysM domains of fungal effector Ecp6, the three LysM domains of Gp255 contain conserved chitin-binding sites for peptidoglycan binding (S&#225;nchez-Vallet et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A BlastP search of the protein in the NR database in NCBI revealed that Gp255 exhibits only 23.7% similarity to the endolysin of the <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> phage &#981;PYB5 (Wang et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), but the protein has higher similarity to bacterial glycoside hydrolases. Based on the similarities of Gp255 to other glycosyl hydrolases, Gp255 belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 25 (GH25). Among the glycoside hydrolase of GH25 family, 128 proteins encoded by the phage genome were found in the CAZy database and these protein have been annotated largely as phage endolysins. Other than Gp255, there are two more genes that encode polysaccharide hydrolases in the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp genome. These two polysaccharide hydrolases are N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (Gp019) and spore cortex-lytic enzyme (Gp067). The N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase could be the phage endolysin that lyse the host cell to release mature progeny phages, while the function of spore cortex-lytic enzyme to phage vB_BpuM_BpSp is unknown.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram of Gp255 and amino acid sequence alignment of the LysM domains.

The results indicate that labeled Gp255 possibly interacts with a unique protein with a molecular weight of 16 kDa in the structural proteome of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp, and the protein was identified as the phage baseplate protein (Gp287) by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

The genomic annotation of Jumbo phage genome is often disappointing because most of the predicted proteins, including the structural proteins, fail to make good hits to the sequences in the databases. The genomic annotation of Jumbo phage vB_BpuMP_BpSp only revealed eight predicted phage structural proteins, and the genes encoding other phage structural proteins remain unknown. Structural proteomic analysis combined with bioinformatic analysis of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp identified 22 phage-coding structural proteins, including 14 proteins with unknown function, a glycoside hydrolase, a Holliday junction resolvase, a RNA polymerase (RNAP) &#946; subunit, and five other annotated structural proteins. Among the 14 proteins of unknown function, the candidates for the curly phage tail fiber protein and the major capsid protein were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. To our knowledge, glycoside hydrolase, Holliday junction resolvase, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) &#946; subunit are rarely found in phage virions. Our findings of new structural proteins of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp suggests that structural proteomic analysis of phage virions is a promising approach for the identification of unknown phage structural components.</p><p>Besides the identified structural proteins encoded by phage vB_BpuM_BpSp genome, a portal protein encoded by the host strain genome was found. Either the host-coding portal protein, instead the phage-coding portal protein, is hijacked by the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp to assemble progeny phage particle, or the portal protein is packaged into the phage virion by mistake in some non-function way. Besides the identified portal protein, the genome of the host strain GR8 also encode 15 more phage portal protein homologs, which were not identified by proteomic analysis of phage virions, further supporting the speculation that the identified portal protein might be a functional component hijacked by phage vB_BpuM_BpSp from the host strain.</p><p>The RNA polymerase &#946; subunit was identified as one of the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp structural proteins. It was also found in the virion proteome of phage 201&#981;2-1, and possibly in that of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phage PBS2 as well, and is thought to be phage virion-associated RNAP, which might be injected into the host cell during phage infection to facilitate the synthesis of phage proteins at the early stage after infection, including the genome replication-associated proteins and phage specific proteins, before the expression of other phage RNAPs (Clark et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Thomas et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Another identified structural protein, the Holliday junction resolvase, binds and cleaves the junction in the phage genome to further facilitate the replication of phage genome, the packaging of circular genome during phage assembly, and the release of condensed genome during phage infection by localizing at portal of the phage head (Golz and Kemper, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Dixit et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Green et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The Holliday junction resolvase in phage virion might be the remnant of the phage genome package device or the facilitating mechanism for the translocation of large, condensed phage genome to host cell during infection. Phage vB_BpuM_BpSp has a large genome, and the packaging and release of the phage genome is an energy consuming process. The structural RNA polymerase &#946; subunit and Holliday junction resolvase identified in the vB_BpuM_BpSp proteome might be components of an adaption mechanism to overcome these problems. Further confirmation of these findings and functional analysis of these two proteins would shed more light on their roles in phage virions.</p><p>Phages recognize host cell by the &#8220;walk&#8221; of the tail fiber on the cell surface (Hu et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The reversible binding of phage tail fibers to bacterial cell wall leads the phage to the optimal site for irreversible absorption and subsequent infection. Jumbo phage vB_BpuM_BpSp has a fragile head, and the tail sheath substructure is easily separated. The curly tail fiber of vB_BpSp_BpSp is longer than the tail fiber of myovirus with smaller genome (Hu et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and it swing more easily. The long, flexible tail fiber might lead the phage vB_BpuM_BpSp to optimal infection site quickly and reduce the damage of phage virion during recognition. Similar helical tail fibers have only been observed in the <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> phage 0305&#981;8-36 (Serwer et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phage AR9 (Belyaeva and Azizbeky, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>), <italic>B. subtilis</italic> phage PBS1 (Eiserlin, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>), <italic>B. cereus</italic> phage Bace-11 (Ackermann et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), and <italic>Salmonella</italic> phage c (Schade et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). Among these six known phages, the hosts of five are strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> and only phage 0305&#981;8-36 is a Jumbo phage. Proteomic analysis and comparative genomic analysis revealed that Gp133 of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp is a phage structural protein with similarity to the predicted curly tail fiber protein ORF129 of phage 0305&#981;8-36, suggesting that Gp133 might be a component of the curly tail fiber. Further functional analysis of the protein will provide more understanding to the function of curly tail fibers in <italic>Bacillus</italic> phage virion.</p><p>The Jumbo phages have huge phage virions and large genomes, which results in high energy consumption during infection. Several genes in the vB_BpuM_BpSp genome exhibit potential functions for facilitating phage infection, such as the genes of glycoside hydrolase and Holliday junction resolvase. The peptidoglycan lytic enzyme domain has been found to be a part of the phage tail fiber and tail spike with function of benefiting infection (Boulanger et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Thompson et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, no individual protein with identified glycoside hydrolase activity has been found in phage virion. This study identified the first functional individual phage glycoside hydrolase with a structural function. This glycoside hydrolase, Gp255, was found to interact with the baseplate protein of the phage, but not with the tail spike protein or the tail fiber protein. The infection of myovirus undergoes a series of structural and conformational changes and the changes of baseplate conformation leads to the release of short tail fiber, which interacts with the cell wall (Hu et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). During this process, the glycoside hydrolase of phage vB_BpuM_BpSp might be released and it may catalyze the pore formation for phage genomic DNA injection. This mechanism might reduce the lytic time of the glycoside hydrolase to the cell wall, and the damage of the glycoside hydrolase to cell wall, and is helpful for maintaining conducive intracellular environment for phage propagation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>MG and YY conceived and designed the work; YY performed the experiment and analyzed the data.
