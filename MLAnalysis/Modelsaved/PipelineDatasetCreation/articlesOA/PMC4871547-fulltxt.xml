In total, 28 patients (19 boys, 9 girls) with CLP who were scheduled to undergo alveolar bone grafting for the first time were recruited. According to the clinical examination of operative sites at the third month after the operation, the individuals were divided into a non-inflammation group (n = 15) and an inflammation group (n = 13). In all, 56 unstimulated saliva samples were collected before and after the operation. The v3-v4 hypervariable regions of the <italic>16S rRNA</italic> gene were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Based on the beta diversity of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the inflammation and non-inflammation samples, the microbial variation in the oral cavity differed significantly between the two groups before and after the operation (P &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the relative abundances of pre-operative OTUs revealed 26 OTUs with a relative abundance higher than 0.01%, reflecting a significant difference of the relative abundance between groups (P &lt; 0.05). According to a principal component analysis of the pre-operative samples, the inflammation-related OTUs included <italic>Tannerella sp</italic>., <italic>Porphyromonas sp</italic>., <italic>Gemella sp</italic>., <italic>Moraxella sp</italic>., <italic>Prevotella nigrescens</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>, most of which were enriched in the inflammation group and showed a significant positive correlation. A cross-validated random forest model based on the 26 different OTUs before the operation was able to fit the post-operative status of grafted sites and yielded a good classification result. The sensitivity and specificity of this classified model were 76.9% and 86.7%, respectively. These findings show that the oral microbiota profile before alveolar bone grafting may be related to the risk of post-operative inflammation at grafted sites.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data are available from the Short Reads Archive database (Accession number SRP064362).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data are available from the Short Reads Archive database (Accession number SRP064362).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alveolar cleft, a symptom often occurring with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) with a frequency of 1.0&#8211;2.21 per 1000 live births [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], can cause collapse of the upper arch and influence tooth development [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Secondary alveolar bone grafting to repair the alveolar cleft was first described by Boyne and Sands [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and focuses on stabilizing the dental arch, supporting the periodontal tissue, closing residual oronasal fistulae, and improving speech and appearance [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is important for patients with CL/P to achieve success in alveolar bone grafting. However, an &#8216;ideal&#8217; result is not always obtained. Retrospective studies showed that grafted cancellous bone was completely absorbed in 2&#8211;7.4% of grafted sites, and appropriate vertical bone formation was obtained only in 60&#8211;70% of cases by alveolar bone grafting [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The outcome of alveolar bone grafting is influenced by many factors, such as the operation timing, grafted bone sources, oral health status, and post-operative infection or inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to previous studies, post-operative surgical wound inflammation and infection are major factors that can contribute to a greater incidence of the graft absorption, with an approximately 30% failure rate [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The opportunistic infection of surgical wounds results primarily from pathogenic bacteria or common pathogens.</p><p>Intraoral surgery, including alveolar bone grafting, should be considered a &#8216;clean-contaminated operative procedure&#8217;, because intraoral surgical access inevitably suffers contamination of the surgical wound with the facultative pathogenic mixed flora of the oral cavity [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The bacteria most frequently isolated in post-operative infections for the most part are believed to originate from the bacteria constituting the endogenous microflora of the oral cavity [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, gingivitis or periodontitis before the operation has been considered to contribute to the failure of alveolar bone grafting. In previous case series, approximately 20% of the failures were attributable to infection of the graft surgeries as a result of gingivitis [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It suggests that the oral bacterial microenvironment may be related to the post-operative inflammation of alveolar bone grafting.</p><p>In the recent studies about the cleft lip or palate repair, Rennie et al. found no significant association between immediate preoperative culture findings and the incidence of fistula formation in primary cleft palate or cleft palate fistula repair [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thomas et al. also thought the preoperative microbiological culture results did not correlate with postoperative outcome [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These contrast with the findings of previous retrospective series, which indicated the wound infection associated with operative site colonization was an important cause of wound dehiscence and fistula formation following cleft repair [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the extent to which the preoperative microbiota in fact influences operative outcomes remains a subject of debate. However, among approximately 600 predominant bacterial species in the oral cavity, about 35% are unable to be grown in culture [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The <italic>16S rRNA</italic> gene sequencing can detect the broad spectrum of both culturable and non-culturable microbiota in the oral cavity, providing insight into the diversity and community structure of the oral microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Given the difficulties in studying the oral microbiome using conventional, culture-based techniques, we applied <italic>16S rRNA</italic> gene sequencing to provide detailed insight into the oral microbiome of children with CL/P.</p><p>In recent years, next-generation sequencing is anticipated to transition from basic genomic research to clinical applications [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Changes in the microbiota can contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases and reflect the health or disease state of the host [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, monitoring the changes in the oral microbiota via the high-throughput sequencing is a promising potential new process for use in evaluating oral disease and prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate oral microbiome profiles in children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and to explore the pre-operative oral bacterial composition related to the prognosis of alveolar bone grafting.

Post-operative surgical wound inflammation or infection is an important factor influencing the outcome of alveolar bone grafting and leads to a greater incidence of absorption of the graft [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In previous reports, about one-third of patients with failed grafts had local infection or wound dehiscence [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Post-operative wound inflammation or infection is caused by many reasons. As an intraoral surgery, alveolar bone grafting is considered a clean-contaminated surgical procedure because of the facultative pathogenic mixed flora of the oral cavity [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, poor oral hygiene is one of the reasons for surgical wound infections [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pre-operative gingival health has been considered a major factor determining surgical success [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The aforementioned factors concerning post-operative inflammation/infection are also associated with the oral microbiota. This study attempted to investigate oral microbiome profiles in children with the alveolar bone grafting and identify microbial indicators for prognosis evaluation.</p><p>Based on the beta diversity of the OTU level between the non-inflammation and inflammation samples, microbial variation in the oral cavity differed significantly between the two groups both before and after the operation. The oral bacteria structure in the inflammation samples was significantly more similar than the non-inflammation samples. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to alpha diversity of oral microbiota before the operation. We suggest that the variation of bacterial OTU profiles in the pre-operative saliva may contribute to the post-operative inflammation of grafted sites.</p><p>We further compared the oral microbial composition of the non-inflammation group with inflammation group both before and after the operation. Twenty-six pre-operative OTUs with a relative abundance higher than 0.01% differed significantly between the two groups before the operation. Among these OTUs, <italic>Veillonella parvula</italic>, two <italic>Streptococcus sp</italic>., and one <italic>Porphyromonas sp</italic>. displayed significant difference in their post-operative relative abundance between the two groups. Only the OTU corresponding to <italic>Porphyromonas sp</italic>., however, was observed in a higher proportion of inflammation subjects than non-inflammation subjects both before and after the operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155683.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Our data suggests that the same surgery by same surgeon has different effects on the oral microbial composition from different individuals. When the oral microbial compositions before the operation differ between the inflammation and non-inflammation samples, the alveolar bone grafting could discriminatively influence the salivary microbial community from the different groups, which respectively shift to another ones. Thus, we emphasized the analysis of the pre-operative microbiota in the oral cavity of the children with CLP.</p><p>Our analysis revealed that the inflammation-related OTUs included <italic>Tannerella sp</italic>., <italic>Porphyromonas sp</italic>., <italic>Gemella sp</italic>., <italic>Moraxella sp</italic>., <italic>Streptococcus sp</italic>., <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nigrescens</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>intermedia</italic>, most of which were enriched in the inflammation group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155683.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These enriched microbial species are most likely residents of normal oral flora, many of which are potential opportunistic pathogens, and could contribute to the post-operation inflammation and infection.</p><p><italic>Prevotella</italic> species are part of the human oral microbiota and play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and some extraoral infections, such as nasopharyngeal and odontogenic infections [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic pathogenic bacterium, which is often found in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. It is commonly isolated from dentoalveolar abscesses, where obligate anaerobes predominate [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. <italic>Prevotella nigrescens</italic> is part of the normal oral flora and leads to oral disease when the local tissue is infected. When <italic>Prevotella nigrescens</italic> colonize, they trigger an over-aggressive response from the immune system and increase the incidence of many diseases and infections [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>Gemella</italic> and <italic>Moraxella</italic> functioning as opportunistic pathogens, are primarily found in the mucous membranes, particularly in the oral cavity, where they are capable of causing severe localized or generalized infection in previously damaged tissue [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the previous studies about human microbial ecosystems, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the role of indigenous bacteria in controlling pathogenic colonization involves preventing pathogen expansion rather than retarding exogenous acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is also widely believed that environmental perturbations shift the balance of the oral microbiota and eventually lead to a predominance of pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, we suggest that a balanced oral microbiome is crucial in inhibiting the expanding of opportunistic pathogens and maintaining the stability of the microbial community, while destabilized microbial environment could potentially result in over-growth of these bacterial species and leads to increased risk of developing post-operative inflammation and infection.</p><p>Based on the co-occurring network modules in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155683.g004">Fig 4</xref>), OTUs corresponding to <italic>Tannerella sp</italic>., <italic>Porphyromonas sp</italic>., <italic>Gemella sp</italic>., <italic>Moraxella sp</italic>., <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nigrescens</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus sp</italic>. were enriched in the inflammation subjects versus the non-inflammation subjects, and there were significant positive correlations between them. Furthermore, a cross-validated random forest model based on the pre-operative saliva OTUs was able to classify the post-operative status of grafted sites with high sensitivity and specificity (76.92% and 86.67%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155683.s007">S3 Table</xref>).</p><p>Microbiota communities in the oral cavity are polymicrobial and exist principally as biofilms on the surfaces of the teeth, gums, mucosa, and tongue [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Because of metabolic inter-dependencies in the oral microbial ecosystem, many oral diseases are polymicrobial infections [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although we recognize individual bacteria as potentially pathogenic factors that modulate or damage human cells in models of infection in vivo or in vitro, a more accurate perspective is one of a pathogenic community [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recent studies on the behavior of multispecies communities have shown that the presence of one or more bacteria can change virulence and gene expression in other pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p><italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, as one species of the genus <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, is detected in low abundance in the oral cavity. However, it can cause a microbial shift in the oral cavity, allowing for uncontrolled growth of the commensal microbial community [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It has been proved that <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is related to increasing the virulence of other commensal bacteria both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.

These studies indicate that the diseases associated with the human oral cavity may result from the activities of microbial communities and not only from certain individual microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0155683.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Although we have not determined that the measured saliva OTUs in this study could be used to predict the clinical status of grafted sites after the alveolar bone grafting because of the small sample size used in the classified model, our results do indicate that the pre-operative OTUs should be involved as a whole for the risk evaluation of the post-operative inflammation of the grafting. It is important to explore the relationship between the oral microbiota as a community and the prognosis of alveolar bone grafting. In the future, it is necessary to collect more saliva samples to confirm the accuracy of the random forest model predicting the post-operative status of grafted sites. Additionally, we will use genetic-level and metabolic-pathway analyses to explore the mechanism by which the oral microbiota profile influences the prognosis of alveolar bone grafting in further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study indicates that the oral bacterial community before alveolar bone grafting is related to the post-operative inflammation of grafted sites.
