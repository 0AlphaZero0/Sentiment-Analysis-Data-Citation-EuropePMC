In this study, we successfully produced semi-preparative amounts of soluble bioactive human VEGF165 (hVEGF). We created seven N-terminal fusion tag constructs with hexahistidine (His6), thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA), human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and the b'a' domain of PDI (PDIb'a'), and tested each construct for soluble overexpression in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. We found that at 18&#176;C, 92.8% of the MBP-tagged hVEGF to be soluble and that this tag significantly increased the protein's solubility. We successfully purified 0.8 mg of pure hVEGF per 500 mL cell culture. The purified hVEGF is stable after tag cleavage, contains very low levels of endotoxin, and is 97.6% pure. Using an Flk1<sup>+</sup> mesodermal precursor cell (MPC) differentiation assay, we show that the purified hVEGF is not only bioactive but has similar bioactivity to hVEGF produced in mammalian cells. Previous reports on producing hVEGF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> have all been based on refolding of the protein from inclusion bodies. To our knowledge, this is the first report on successfully expressing and purifying soluble hVEGF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Medical Research Center Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2008-0062286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Asan Institute for Life Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015-219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2015K1A4A3046807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Medical Research Center Program (2008-0062286) and a grant (2015K1A4A3046807) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning, and a grant (2015-219) from the Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in the formation of new blood vessels [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Deletion of one or two VEGF alleles in mice results in impaired vasculogenesis or death at the mid-gestation stage [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hypoxia is a strong trigger for the production of VEGF and induces angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. VEGF can be highly expressed in multiple normal physiological states, such as wound healing and the normal female menstrual cycle [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, aberrant angiogenesis from overexpression of VEGF results in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerotic plaque formation, visual loss in diabetic retinopathy, and tumor angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Four VEGF homologs, VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, and VEGFD, have been described in the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several splicing variants of VEGFA, such as VEGF121, VEGF121b, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF165b, VEGF189, and VEGF206, have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among these, VEGF165 is the most abundant and the predominantly active VEGF isoform. It consists of two 165-amino acid monomers, each containing a single glycosylation site and a cysteine knot motif that drives the folding kinetics [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The active form of VEGF is a homodimer, and thus, many studies have attempted to obtain a recombinant bioactive homodimer of VEGF.</p><p>VEGFs are synthesized and secreted by various cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, T cells, neutrophils, platelets, keratinocytes, renal mesangial cells, and many tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several strategies have been used to heterologously express and produce VEGFs in various eukaryotic expression host systems such as yeast [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], insect [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], rice [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], silkworm [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and mammalian cells [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the production of VEGF in these systems can lead to impaired hyper-glycosylation and is limited by requiring strict cultivation conditions and specialized equipment.</p><p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is a convenient platform for protein expression. However, attempts to express VEGF in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> result in low levels of soluble protein expression or protein misfolding and aggregation into inclusion bodies, hampering purification [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Soluble protein expression is favorable compared to refolding protein from inclusion bodies as the overall yield of biologically active protein from inclusion bodies is low [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, the need for extensive optimization of the protein refolding conditions makes the refolding process cumbersome. To our knowledge, all biologically active VEGF165 produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to date have been obtained from inclusion bodies.</p><p>Protein tags such as thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA), human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and the b'a' domain of PDI (PDIb'a'), have been used to enhance the soluble expression of recombinant proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

However, in the case of the former study, the VEGF was refolded from inclusion bodies, while in the latter studies, expression and purification conditions were not optimized. There is a paucity of comprehensive studies that compare the solubility and expression levels of VEGF fused with protein tags. Many proteins lose their solubility or activity after tag cleavage, and the biological activity of VEGF proteins expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> compared to mammalian expression systems after tag cleavage is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we created different human VEGF165 (hVEGF) tag fusions and compared their expression levels and solubility in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.

The tobacco etch virus recognition site (TEVrs), ENLYFQ/G, was also introduced at the N-terminus of hVEGF oligonucleotide. The whole synthesized DNA sequence was then transferred into donor vector pDONOR207 by BP recombination reaction to obtain entry clone named pENTR-hVEGF. Subsequently, LR recombination reactions between the pENTR-hVEGF and the seven pET22b-based destination vectors, pDEST-HGWA (His6), pDEST-HXGWA (Trx), pDEST-HGGWA (GST), pDEST-HMGWA (MBP), pDEST-HNGWA (NusA), pDEST-PDI (PDI) and pDEST-PDIb'a' (PDIb'a') were performed.

The overnight culture was then transferred ata1:200 ratio into fresh LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and tetracycline and grown in a shaking incubator at 37&#176;C with shaking at 200 rpm. To induce the protein expression, 0.5 mM IPTG was added into culture batch when the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.7 and then, the temperature was maintained at 37&#176;C for 4 h or decreased to 18&#176;C for 18 h.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mL buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v)) and disrupted by ultrasonic cell disruptor JY99-IIDN (Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology, Guangdong, China) until the lysate was completely homogenized. The supernatant from the lysate was collected by centrifugation at 23,000 &#215; g for 30 min and it was used as a crude sample for further purification.</p><p>The MBP-hVEGF protein from prepared crude sample was initially purified by MBP chromatography. Filtered supernatant was loaded onto a 2 &#215; 5 mL MBP Trap HP column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Column was washed with 10&#8211;15 column volume (CV) of buffer A to remove excessive non-specifically bound impurities and then protein samples were completely eluted with 5 CV of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol (v/v)) containing 50 mM maltose.</p><p>Total 20 mL of partially purified MBP-hVEGF protein was treated with TEV protease which was purified as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) for proteolytic cleavage. Since the TEV activity might be inhibited by the high salt concentration, protein sample was dialyzed against buffer B to remove remaining salt before the cleavage. The sample was then diluted with buffer B to final volume of 150 mL and reaction was carried out at 18&#176;C for overnight. The cleaved sample was mixed with 50 mL of buffer B containing 4 M NaCl to give the final concentration of 1 M NaCl. After incubation for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 23,000 &#215; g for 20 min and 0.2 &#956;m Acrodisc Syringe Filters, Supor Membrane, was used to remove partial aggregation. The clarified sample was immediately applied to 2 &#215; 5 mL HisTrap HP column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. At this step, hVEGF was eluted along with partial MBP tags by washing the column with buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole whereas remaining MBP tags and TEV protease were washed out of the column with buffer A containing 1 M imidazole. The total 30 mL mixture fraction of hVEGF and MBP was desalted by dialyzed against buffer B followed by additional purification with HiTrap Heparin HP column to exclusively remove residual MBP tags. The 5 mL column was pre-equilibrated with buffer B before sample was loaded onto column resulting in efficient separation as followed: MBP tag was removed in flowthrough step but hVEGF was later eluted with buffer B containing 1 M NaCl.

The MBP tag has a high affinity for the dextrin ligand column resins, making it relatively easy to isolate MBP-hVEGF. However, in some cases MBP-fused proteins are not able to bind to the resin due to interactions between the target protein and the MBP tag at the binding site of the tag with dextrin group on the resins [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], leading to protein loss in the purification process.

This suggests that the hVEGF does not occupy the MBP-resin binding site, and thus allows for single-step purification of MBP-hVEGF. TEV protease was used thereafter to cleave the tag off of the partially purified MBP-hVEGF. The tag removal efficiency plays an important step which potentially affects further purification [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Since both the MBP tag and the TEV protease contain a His6 tag in their constructs, a HisTrap HP column was added to the procedure to facilitate the separation of the cleaved tag and the protease from hVEGF. During this step, TEV protease tightly bound to the column and was eluted with high concentration of imidazole; however, partial MBP tag and hVEGF were together eluted earlier.</p><fig id="pone.0156296.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156296.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of hVEGF purification from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</title><p>(A) Schematic overview of hVEGF purification.

NaCl and glycerol also prevent weak electrostatic interactions as well as nonspecific hydrophobic protein interactions between the target protein and column with other impurity proteins [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A key difficulty during purification reported by many authors is protein aggregation, especially after tag cleavage [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For disulfide-rich proteins, the aggregation could be caused by self-association of single protein particles or by newly formed intermolecular disulfide bonds during expression and purification of the target protein [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We overcame part of this difficulty by keeping sample preparations at a low concentration to eliminate non-covalent interactions of proteins. The cytoplasmic reducing environment of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells does not promote the formation of correct disulfide bonds in the target protein. Hence, we used the Origami cell line, which has mutations in thioredoxinreductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase genes [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] that facilitate the formation of correct disulfide bonds. In its active native conformation, hVEGF is a dimer. Our results show that higher order oligomers are also present during purification. These oligomers are prone to aggregate and are likely unstable when on the column, which could harm the heparin resin and affect to the purification. Thus we attempted to remove most of them using a short-term incubation with a high concentration of NaCl followed by Ni-NTA purification. In contrast to the dimer form which was eluted with 100 mM imidazole, the oligomers did not bind to the IMAC column and remained in the flowthrough fraction (data not shown). The overall purification yield after the Heparin column was 2.9% (<xref rid="pone.0156296.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The low final yield comes from the loss of unstable oligomers during purification.

In addition, the SHuffle strain [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which has proven to be useful in cytoplasmic synthesis of disulfide bond proteins could be used for expression.

The industrial production of hVEGF from inclusion bodies has also been reported with a yield of 30 &#177; 6% [<xref rid="pone.0156296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, this method requires large industrial refolding instrument, such as a fermenter, as well as, multiple concentration steps after renaturation. In contrast, our method utilizing the MBP fusion tag and standard purification buffer components allows for rapid soluble expression and purification of pure and bioactive hVEGF, without the need for refolding from inclusion bodies.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we assessed the effect of various tags on the expression level and solubility of hVEGF. We created seven fusion protein constructs with N-terminal His6, Trx, GST, MBP, NusA, PDI, and PDIb&#8217;a&#8217; tags and compared their expression and solubility levels at 18&#176;C and 37&#176;C. Both expression level and solubility varied markedly based on tag and temperature (<xref rid="pone.0156296.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based on the protein expression level, solubility, and size of the fusion protein, we selected the MBP fusion for further purification. Using the MBP fusion construct, we are able to purify 0.8 mg of pure and bioactive hVEGF after tag cleavage from an initial 500 mL of cell culture. Previous reports have focused on either refolding the protein from inclusion bodies or have stopped short at purifying a fusion protein without cleaving the fusion partner. To our knowledge, this is the first report on successfully expressing and purifying hVEGF as soluble form in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156296.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>SEC-HPLC analysis of the final hVEGF.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156296.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156296.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting Information.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156296.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Medical Research Center Program (2008&#8211;0062286) and a grant (2015K1A4A3046807) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning, and a grant (2015&#8211;219) from the Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0156296.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Embryonic and adult vasculogenesis</article-title>. <source>Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today</source>. <year>2003</year>;<volume>69</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>73</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>82</lpage>.
