Intermittent energy restriction (IER) reduces weight to the same extent as, or more than equivalent continuous energy restriction (CER) but the effects of IER on normal breast tissue and systemic metabolism as indicators of breast cancer risk are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We assessed the effect of IER (two days of 65&#160;% energy restriction per week) for one menstrual cycle on breast tissue gene expression using Affymetrix GeneChips, adipocyte size by morphometry, and systemic metabolism (insulin resistance, lipids, serum and urine metabolites, lymphocyte gene expression) in 23 overweight premenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer. Unsupervised and supervised analyses of matched pre and post IER biopsies in 20 subjects were performed, whilst liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry assessed corresponding changes in serum and urine metabolites in all subjects after the two restricted and five unrestricted days of the IER.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Women lost 4.8&#160;% (&#177;2.0&#160;%) of body weight and 8.0&#160;% (&#177;5.0&#160;%) of total body fat. Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)) reduced by 29.8&#160;% (&#177;17.8&#160;%) on the restricted days and by 11&#160;% (&#177;34&#160;%) on the unrestricted days of the IER. Five hundred and twenty-seven metabolites significantly increased or decreased during the two restricted days of IER. Ninety-one percent of these returned to baseline after 5&#160;days of normal eating. Eleven subjects (55&#160;%) displayed reductions in energy restriction-associated metabolic gene pathways including lipid synthesis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis. Some of these women also had increases in genes associated with breast epithelial cell differentiation (secretoglobulins, milk proteins and mucins) and decreased collagen synthesis (TNMD, PCOLCE2, TIMP4). There was no appreciable effect of IER on breast gene expression in the other nine subjects. These groups did not differ in the degree of changes in weight, total body fat, fat cell size or serum or urine metabolomic markers. Corresponding gene changes were not seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The transcriptional response to IER is variable in breast tissue, which was not reflected in the systemic response, which occurred in all subjects.

In the Iowa Women&#8217;s Health Study, &#8805;5&#160;% maintained weight loss resulted in 20&#8211;40&#160;% reduction in postmenopausal breast cancer risk compared with women who continued to gain weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Multiple studies in rodent models also indicate that energy restriction reduces the risk of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This effect appears to be mediated by changes in a number of systemic factors and also local factors within breast cells. For example, systemically, energy restriction is associated with reductions in insulin, leptin and inflammatory markers. Within the breast, in general there is downregulation of metabolic pathways associated with anabolism and upregulation of pathways associated with catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The aforementioned data suggest energy restriction would be useful for breast cancer prevention in overweight and obese women. However, poor adherence to continuous energy restriction (CER) means energy restriction is difficult to implement.</p><p>We previously reported that daily 60&#160;% (3350&#160;kJ) CER for one menstrual cycle (four to five weeks) reduced weight, biomarkers of breast cancer risk and altered gene expression in breast and abdominal adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Daily 60&#160;% energy restriction is not a viable strategy for risk reduction in the general population as it is difficult to sustain. We demonstrated that intermittent energy restriction (IER), which involves strict 65&#160;% energy restriction for two days and normal healthy eating with a Mediterranean diet for five days each week is achievable and is associated with reduction in weight, body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] amongst overweight/obese women. IER is an increasingly popular approach for weight loss but little is known about its systemic effects on metabolism or on the breast itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the study reported here we examined the effects of IER within the breast by gene expression analyses and assessment of breast adipocyte size. Systemic effects were assessed by measuring insulin, lipids and serum and urinary metabolites. We also assessed the effects of IER on gene expression in lymphocytes to determine whether this could be used as an accessible surrogate of changes in breast gene expression. The gene expression and metabolomics findings with IER were compared to a previous study of daily 60&#160;% CER for one menstrual cycle at our centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study, IER for two days per week resulted in marked weight loss over four to five weeks and in multiple systemic metabolic alterations which changed most at the end of the two restricted days and predominately returned towards baseline at the end of the five unrestricted days of IER. Gene expression analysis of breast tissue identified two distinct groups of participants; 11 out of 20 women displayed changes involving downregulation of epithelial mRNAs associated with aspects of breast metabolism, whereas the remaining 9 women did not have these consistent changes. Gene expression changes in breast tissue did not correlate with those in lymphocytes. Changes in breast gene expression with four to five weeks of IER (two days of 65&#160;% energy restriction per week, which achieved an overall 45&#160;% energy restriction) appeared to vary between women and were not as consistent as changes observed previously after daily 60&#160;% CER for one menstrual cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-four premenopausal overweight or obese women (body mass index (BMI) 24&#8211;34&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and body fat percentage 30&#8211;42&#160;%), aged 35&#8211;45 years, and at increased risk of breast cancer (greater than one in six lifetime risk) were recruited from the Genesis Family History Clinic at the University Hospital of South Manchester, UK. In addition to the above, entry criteria included a normal mammogram within 12&#160;months, estimated visual assessed breast density &#8805;30&#160;% to ensure epithelium was obtained in the core biopsy, stable or increasing weight, and sedentary lifestyle (participating in &#8804;40&#160;minutes of moderate activity per week) and regular menstrual cycles. Exclusion criteria included; restrictive, or high phytoestrogen-supplemented diets, previous use of tamoxifen, regular use of anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, anti-platelet or oral contraceptive medication, pregnancy or planning a pregnancy, hysterectomy, co-morbid conditions such as a previous diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, ischaemic vascular disease, thyroid disease or psychiatric disorders that would limit adherence to the dietary programme and factors that may affect lymphocyte function, i.e. underlying autoimmune, inflammatory or allergy conditions, inoculations or blood donation within the past two months.</p><p>The study was reviewed by the North West 10 Research Ethics Committee, Greater Manchester North (09/H1006/33).

The IER included two consecutive days of 65&#160;% energy restriction (approximately 2700&#160;kJ, 100&#160;g carbohydrate and 50&#160;g of protein per day) and a Mediterranean-type diet that met subjects&#8217; estimated energy requirements for the remaining five days of the week (range 7300&#8211;9500&#160;kJ/day). Each energy-restricted day included four 80-g portions of vegetables and one 80-g portion of fruit, and six portions of low-fat dairy produce, e.g. 2 pints of semi-skimmed milk or equivalent low-fat yoghurt or cottage cheese. On the five subsequent days the women were asked to consume a Mediterranean style diet, which provided 45&#160;% of energy from low-glycaemi-index carbohydrates, 30&#160;% from fat (15&#160;% monounsaturated fat, 7&#160;% from saturated fat, 8&#160;% from polyunsaturated fat) and 25&#160;% energy from protein as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Women commenced the diet within two days of their baseline assessment and followed the diet for one menstrual cycle (four to five weeks). Timing of trial assessments was standardised to one phase of the menstrual cycle. Of the 24 women who entered the study, 23 completed the energy restriction for one menstrual cycle. Nineteen of these started and finished in the follicular phase of their cycle, and four started and finished in the early luteal phase. Diets were not provided to participants but were self-selected, guided by detailed individualised food portion lists, meal plans and recipes. Participants were asked to keep daily food diaries throughout the study period and were monitored weekly by the study dietitians to maximize compliance. Participants were asked to maintain their sedentary lifestyle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial assessments</title><p>Weight and anthropometric measurements, breast biopsy (breast gene expression, breast adipocyte size), blood and urine samples (serum hormones, lipids and serum and urine metabolic markers) were conducted after an overnight fast at baseline before starting the diet (time point 1 (TP1)) and after four to five weeks of the diet on the morning immediately after the two day 65&#160;% dietary restriction (time point 2 (TP2)).

Between seven and nine biopsy samples were obtained through the same skin incision and the direction of the needle was similar for each sample. The TP1 biopsies were taken from either the left or right breast side, which was chosen independently by computer randomisatio,n and the final TP2 biopsies were taken from the opposite side to eliminate potential gene expression changes related to the healing process.

A possible explanation for the lack of consistency between participants was that changes in expression were highly variable between participants. To examine this further, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the 100 genes with the highest variance of change in expression across the 20 participants (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and identified two groups of participants: a group with breast tissue which appears to respond to IER (green) (n&#8201;=&#8201;11) with expected downregulation of metabolic genes associated with energy restriction, i.e. reduced lipid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis, and a group with breast tissue that does not appear to respond (grey) (n&#8201;=&#8201;9). Some of the responders also had increased expression of genes associated with breast epithelial cell differentiation (milk proteins, secretoglobulins and mucins). Other transcripts with highly variable changes in expression in the breast tissue after IER included leptin, adiponectin, chemokines, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and ACVR1C receptors, heat shock protein and reduced collagen synthesis and breakdown (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

All women had marked changes in weight, adiposity, systemic hormones, lipids and metabolites. However, only half of the women had breast gene expression changes associated with decreased anabolism, i.e. decreased fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis. The inconsistent breast tissue gene expression changes with IER did not correlate with compliance, or the changes in weight or systemic metabolism, thus appear to be participant-specific. This requires further study to determine the underlying mechanism. The changes in metabolic gene expression profiles in the 11 responders to IER resembled changes in women undertaking a 60&#160;% CER for one menstrual cycle from our previous study whilst the 9 non-responders resembled the non-dieting controls in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, we acknowledge that differences in entry criteria and sample processing between the studies may have affected these results. Some of the women following IER also appeared to have had increases in epithelial cell differentiation (i.e. increased lactalbumin caseins, mammoglobins and mucins) and decreases in collagen synthesis (TNMD, PCOLCE2, TIMP4), which was less evident in women on CER and may be specific to IER.</p><p>We studied IER because previous short-term randomised trials in women have reported greater reductions in weight and adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compared with CER. Part of the reported superiority of IER may be because of greater energy restriction than CER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the study reported here the two-day IER was designed to produce an overall 25&#160;% ER, but a carry-over effect after the two-day restriction (average 38&#160;% reduction) meant that intake was also reduced during the next five days of the standard Mediterranean diet. Thus, the participants undertook an overall 45&#160;% energy restriction rather than the projected 25&#160;%. Our findings with IER do not necessarily inform what would happen with just two days of restriction and five days of completely normal intake on the other days of the week. This pragmatic study is instead reporting the breast and systemic effects of a two-day IER regimen, with the magnitude of restriction that we have found occurs with this pattern of eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>IER induced large fluctuations in insulin, with the greatest reductions seen after the two 65&#160;% energy restriction days (&#8211;30&#160;% from baseline) and lesser reductions on unrestricted days (&#8211;10&#160;% from baseline) as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Likewise, IER induced large changes in metabolites after the two restricted days, which reflects a switch to fat oxidation and reduced glycolysis and TCA activity. The two-day restriction was also associated with increased urine levels of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and increased TCA metabolites, which have both been linked to improved mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity and reduced risk of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly the potentially beneficial changes in metabolism reported in the restricted days of IER were not seen after the five days of the moderately energy-restricted (38&#160;%) Mediterranean diet with IER. A 38&#160;% energy restriction is at the limits of what can be achieved with standard continuous energy-restricted diets (typically 25&#8211;40&#160;%). Thus, this raises the possibility that standard daily dieting may not elicit shifts in metabolism and increased fat oxidation, which can only be achieved during spells of a more severe restriction (&#8805;65&#160;%) with IER.</p><p>Whether such profound cyclical changes in the serum metabolites between restricted and non-restricted days are beneficial or harmful to health is not known, The ability to switch from fat oxidation in an energy-deficient state and carbohydrate metabolism in a post-prandial state is considered important for metabolic health and to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. IER also led to sustained reductions in the amino acids glutamic acid and tyrosine during the restricted and the normal healthy eating days. These reductions may indicate improved insulin sensitivity and reduced muscle proteolysis or increased oxidative metabolism of amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>IER was originally introduced in rodent experiments to make overall energy restriction easier to administer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Subsequent rodent studies indicate IER is equivalent or superior to CER in terms of weight loss, improving insulin sensitivity, preventing tumours, increasing resistance to neuronal damage, reducing cognitive impairment, protecting the heart and increasing the lifespan of rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the safety of IER in the long term is not established, even in rodents. The metabolomics data link IER to marked acute increases in ketones and some fatty acids. There are potential concerns that a rise in circulating fatty acids could promote tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Ketones have been related to both reduction and increases in tumour cell proliferation and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The ketone sodium butyrate has been linked to increased breast cell differentiation as assessed morphologically and by lactalbumin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which may have a role in the increased expression of differentiation genes we reported in some of the patients on IER.</p><p>Gene expression changes in lymphocytes were not consistent with changes in the breast, and so are not likely to be a useful biomarker of changes in the breast with energy restriction. In contrast, previous dietary intervention studies have found that lymphocytes can reflect liver and adipose transcriptomics and are useful for studying genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>This is the first study to report changes in breast adipocyte cell size with energy restriction and weight loss in humans. Breast adipocytes were smaller than abdominal adipocytes amongst the obese subjects studied in our previous CER trial. This contrasts to previous reports of comparable fat cell size and lipolytic responses between breast and subcutaneous abdominal fat cells amongst normal and overweight subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The CER group experienced significant reductions in abdominal fat size (&#8211;11&#160;%) with weight loss as previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Reduced fat cell size is believed to mediate improved insulin sensitivity rather than reductions in fat cell numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and is likely to account for the reduced abdominal fat mass. Reductions in breast fat indicated by reduced bust measurements with CER did not occur alongside significant reductions in breast adipocyte size suggesting that reduced fat in the breast may result from reduced fat cell numbers, rather than reduced fat cell size. The modest reduction in breast adipocyte size with IER (6&#160;%) alongside a 7&#160;% reduction in total body fat is likely to reflect acute lipolysis on the preceding two energy-restricted days. The failure of CER and IER to significantly impact on breast adipocyte size in the premenopausal at-risk breast is intriguing. Large breast adipocytes have been found to be associated with increased inflammation and aromatase expression, mainly amongst obese postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Further data on weight loss on breast adipocyte size and number in premenopausal and postmenopausal women are required.</p><p>Changes in breast and systemic metabolism seen after four to five weeks of IER were brought about by effects of diet-induced weight loss, reduced energy intake or modifications of diet composition, i.e. reductions in energy, carbohydrate, fat and protein with IER. There were no reported increases in physical activity. Pre and post study IPAQ physical activity scores both reflect relatively high levels of activity but are assumed to be overestimates, which is well-known with physical activity questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Future trials should assess physical activity using direct assessment methods such as accelerometry.</p><p>The strength of this study is the good compliance with the IER with completion of restricted days immediately prior to post-diet assessments in all subjects and near complete assessment of study endpoints amongst our cohort. Weaknesses include the relatively small numbers of subjects and lack of a direct randomised comparison to a non-diet or CER group. Some of our conclusions depend on case study comparisons between the current IER and a previous CER study. Women in both the IER and CER cohorts had regular cycles, were premenopausal, and at increased risk of breast cancer, but there were key differences between the groups. Women in the CER study had a greater starting weight than the IER cohort (mean (SD) BMI 33.9 (3) kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 28.1 (3.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 independent samples <italic>t</italic> test). In addition, CER breast biopsies were not targeted to stroma and thus, had a higher fat content compared with the IER biopsies; CER (87&#160;% fat, 10&#160;% stroma and 3&#160;% epithelium) vs. IER (35&#160;% fat, 55&#160;% stroma and 10&#160;% epithelium) (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 Mann-Whitney test).</p><p>We aimed to standardise biopsy and metabolic measurements in the first week of the menstrual cycle to avoid confounding hormonal effects. This proved difficult within our cohort due to clinical logistics. On average women were reassessed three to four days later in their cycle than baseline assessments, but remained in either the follicular or luteal phase and this did not explain the gene expression responder and non-responder groups identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion we have demonstrated that IER is associated with marked weight loss and reductions of insulin and lipids. A large number of serum and urine metabolites fluctuate in the restricted and unrestricted phases of the diet. IER by a 65&#160;% energy restriction on days per week (overall 45&#160;% energy restriction) had a variable effect on breast gene expression. Only half of the participants had gene expression evidence characteristic of anabolism (downregulation of lipogenesis and glycolysis), whereas a more consistent response was observed with a continuous 60&#160;% energy restriction. Further investigations of the effects of an intermittent energy restriction (two days/week of 65&#160;% energy restriction) and identifying women who may respond to this pattern and level of energy restriction are warranted, as this represents an effective and potentially feasible method of energy restriction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALDOC aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate; BMI, body mass index; CER, continuous energy restriction; DAVID, Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery; FDR, false discovery rate; GCMS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; HOMA, homeostatic model assessment; IER, intermittent energy restriction; LCMS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MB-ML-PLS-DA, multi-block multi-level partial least squares for discriminant analysis; PAM, prediction analysis of microarrays; SAM, significance analysis of microarrays; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; TP, time point</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13058_2016_714_MOESM1_ESM.pptx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Dietary intake at baseline and after four to five weeks of IER, during restricted and unrestricted days of IER (n&#8201;=&#8201;23).
