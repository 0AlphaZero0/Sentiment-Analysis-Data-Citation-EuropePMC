These conditions share the common feature that endogenous molecules associated with injury, known as alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), converge upon TLR4 and initiate potentially deleterious inflammatory cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Detrimental effects of chronically activated microglia, which constitutively express TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have been identified in these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory actions of microglia following chronic TLR4 activation has the potential to transform the treatment of a variety of degenerative CNS diseases.</p><p>A key element in the harmful effects of chronic microglial activation is peroxynitrite-mediated protein radical formation, which is attributable, in part, to de novo upregulation of microglial inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Notably, NOS2 expression in various cell types is dichotomously determined by two factors whose activities are regulated by the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>): (i) calcineurin, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive phosphatase that, by dephosphorylating nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), promotes its nuclear translocation to induce <italic>Nos2</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and (ii) Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII), the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive kinase that, by phosphorylating calcineurin, inhibits its phosphatase activity, thereby preventing NFAT nuclear translocation and <italic>Nos2</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, mechanisms regulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may be crucial for nitrosative injury induced by activated microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the microglial plasma membrane can occur by multiple mechanisms, including [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (i) voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (VOCE) channels, which are activated by depolarization of the plasma membrane; (ii) store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) channels, which are opened upon depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; and (iii) receptor-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (ROCE) channels, which are triggered by extracellular ligand binding events. Available data on VOCE channels in microglia are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In &#8220;electrically non-excitable&#8221; cells that do not generate all-or-none action potentials, such as microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], SOCE and ROCE channels serve as the major routes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into a cell is governed by the electrochemical gradient for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with the electrical gradient being determined by the cell membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (Sur1)-regulated ion channels have been shown to play critical roles as negative regulators of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In cells that utilize VOCE channels, the opening of Sur1-Kir6.2 (ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>)) channels hyperpolarizes the cell, thereby inactivating VOCE channels and reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Conversely, in cells that utilize predominantly non-voltage-operated SOCE and ROCE channels, such as microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the opening of transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Trpm4) or Sur1-Trpm4 channels depolarizes the cell, thereby reducing the inward driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Notably, Trpm4 and Sur1-Trpm4 channels are activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> linked directly to membrane depolarization, thereby providing negative feedback to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through SOCE or ROCE channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence indicates that Sur1 inhibition results in robust anti-inflammatory effects in CNS injury. In models of cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury, glibenclamide inhibition of Sur1 is associated with enhanced microglial phagocytosis and improved neurological function, with these effects attributed to inhibition of microglial Sur1-Kir6.2 (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Importantly, inhibition of <italic>Abcc8</italic>/Sur1 does not distinguish between Sur1-Kir6.2 (K<sub>ATP</sub>) and Sur1-Trpm4 channels.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that microglia activated by TLR4 ligation upregulate Sur1-Trpm4 channels and that, in TLR4-activated microglia, Sur1-Trpm4 channels play a central role in regulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and thus the expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive genes such as <italic>Nos2</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [from <italic>E. coli</italic> R515 (Re), TLR<italic>grade</italic>&#8482;] and FK506 were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY, USA).

First, we showed that Sur1-activation by diazoxide has opposite effects in TLR4-activated microglia compared to quiescent microglia. In quiescent microglia, Sur1 activation <italic>increases</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, consistent with Sur1-Kir6.2 activation hyperpolarizing the cells and increasing the inward driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In TLR4-activated microglia, Sur1 activation <italic>decreases</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, consistent with Sur1-Trpm4 activation depolarizing the cells and decreasing the inward driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Second, blockade of Sur1 in TLR4-activated cells increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increases pCaMKII, consistent with involvement of Sur1-Trpm4 and ROCE/SOCE channels. Blockade of Sur1-Kir6.2 could explain the latter finding, but only if VOCE channels were mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, Trpm4 blockade, which hyperpolarizes the cell and should deactivate VOCE channels, led to an increase, not a decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, consistent with the absence of involvement of VOCE channels. The most parsimonious explanation for our combined observations is that Sur1-Trpm4 channels are the dominant contributors to the effects of Sur1-modulation in TLR4-activated microglia. Sur1-Kir6.2 channels also may present, but the net effects of Sur1-modulation in TLR4-activated microglia appear to be determined by Sur1-Trpm4.</p><p>Alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis contribute to microglia-mediated progression of CNS disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is critical for the initiation and maintenance of distinct transcriptional programs underlying potentially harmful microglial phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our data indicate that Sur1-Trpm4 channels are an important mechanism for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling in TLR4-activated microglia. Sur1-Trpm4 channels are activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> linking directly to membrane depolarization, providing negative feedback that opposes additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Co-assembly with Sur1 increases the apparent sensitivity of Trpm4 to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thereby strengthening Trpm4&#8217;s role as a negative regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The Sur1-Trpm4 channel thus may be an important treatment target in degenerative diseases of the CNS mediated by TLR4-activated microglia.</p><p>Calcineurin is a critical mechanism by which activated microglia shape their response to TLR4-ligation and control their phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The activation of CN/NFAT depends on the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in combination with other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signals that may provide negative feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. NFAT is said to function as a &#8220;working memory&#8221; of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that is more efficiently activated by low-amplitude, repetitive oscillations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> than by continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. In accord with this, we observed that TLR4 activation for 24&#160;h in N9 microglia led to oscillations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> accompanied by manifestations of the activated phenotype, including morphological changes, Sur1-Trpm4 upregulation, and <italic>Nos2</italic>/NOS2 induction.</p><p>The paradoxical observations that inhibition of Sur1-Trpm4 caused an elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> but that it significantly reduced activation of NFATc1 led us to consider alternative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms regulating CN. Importantly, sustained elevations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> result in autonomous, persistent activation of CaMKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. When CaMKII activity is augmented in vascular smooth muscle cells or in cardiac myocytes, the effects of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> on NFAT nuclear translocation are significantly attenuated, due to direct inhibition of CN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. CaMKII-dependent processes were described recently in microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], although CaMKII regulation of CN was not investigated. Inhibition/gene suppression of Sur1-Trpm4 following TLR4 activation resulted in significant increases in phosphorylated CaMKII (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>) and in phosphorylated CN (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>), consistent with this mechanism accounting for the attenuated NFATc1 translocation and reduced <italic>Nos2</italic>/NOS2 induction that we observed.</p><p>Glibenclamide is not the only treatment to reduce NOS2 expression by activated microglia. Pretreatment of primary cultured neonatal microglia or BV2 cells with diazoxide prior to exposure to LPS&#8201;+&#8201;IFN&#947; reduces NOS2 expression and nitrite production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Since diazoxide <italic>opens</italic> Sur1-regulated channels, whereas glibenclamide inhibits the same channels, our findings, as reported here, may seem to contradict published findings. However, our data showing that pharmacological inhibition of Sur1 reduces NOS2 were confirmed by similar results obtained with genetic inhibition of Sur1 via silencing of <italic>Abcc8</italic>, both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the molecular mechanism proposed for the anti-inflammatory effect of diazoxide involves a general reduction in the overall microglial response to activation signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], whereas the molecular mechanism that we propose for the anti-inflammatory effect of glibenclamide involves blockage of CN/NFAT-signaling <italic>after</italic> microglial activation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Thus, Sur1-active drugs with different mechanisms of action may affect different aspects of the overall microglial inflammatory response, yet bring about a similar endpoint.</p><p>An important property of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel is that both subunits, Sur1 and Trpm4, are required for the manifestation of its pathological effects. This pathognomonic property was first described in an animal model of traumatic spinal cord injury, where pharmacological blockade of Sur1 (glibenclamide, repaglinide) or of Trpm4 (flufenamic acid, riluzole), gene suppression (antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against <italic>Abcc8</italic> or <italic>Trpm4</italic>), and gene silencing (<italic>Abcc8&#8722;/&#8722;</italic> or <italic>Trpm4</italic>&#8722;/&#8722;), all were shown to result in exactly the same phenotype&#8212;educed microvascular dysfunction and capillary fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Similarly, in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, silencing of <italic>Abcc8</italic> or of <italic>Trpm4</italic> results in the same phenotype, with reduced neuroinflammation and preservation of white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Our present findings extend these previous observations, showing that in TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation, silencing <italic>Abcc8</italic> or <italic>Trpm4</italic> results in the same phenotype&#8212;preferential activation of CaMKII over CN/NFATc1 and reduced induction of <italic>Nos2</italic>/NOS2.</p><p>Our findings indicate that Trpm4 is the major molecular partner of Sur1 following TLR4 activation in microglia and that the beneficial effects of glibenclamide in the setting of TLR4-induced neuroinflammation may be due, in part, to augmented CaMKII signaling in microglia. Blockade of Sur1-Trpm4 by glibenclamide previously was shown to be protective in models of ischemic and traumatic CNS injury, where the activity of Sur1-Trpm4 in neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells can result in excess Na<sup>+</sup> influx leading to catastrophic cell swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In microglia, however, the activity of Sur1-Trpm4 is deleterious for a different reason&#8212;namely, it aids in the dynamic regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that is required for a sustained neuroinflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sur1-Trpm4 channels constitute a novel mechanism by which TLR4-activated microglia regulate pro-inflammatory, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive gene expression, including <italic>Nos2</italic>/NOS2. Glibenclamide blockade of Sur1-Trpm4 is promising for the future treatment of CNS diseases involving neuroinflammation and nitrosative/oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, intracellular concentration of calcium; aCSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#8242;,<italic>N</italic>&#8242;-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; CaMKII, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein kinase II; Cd11b, cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD68/ED1, cluster of differentiation molecule 68; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CN, calcineurin; CNS, central nervous system; DAMP, danger-associated-molecular pattern; DAPI, 4&#8242;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DIG, digoxigenin; DMEM, Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle&#8217;s medium; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Gfap, glial fibrillary acidic protein; HBSS, Hank&#8217;s balanced salt solution; HDAC1, histone deacetylase 1; Iba1, ionized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding adapter molecule 1; IMDM, Iscove&#8217;s modified Dulbecco&#8217;s medium; IP, immunoprecipitation; ISH, in situ hybridization; K<sub>ATP</sub>, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NO, nitric oxide; NOS2, inducible nitric oxide synthase; NS, normal saline; PPI, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail; qPCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; RIPA, radio-immunoprecipitation assay; ROCE, receptor-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; ROI, region of interest; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SIP, standard isotonic Percoll; SOCE, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; Sur1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; Trpm4, transient receptor potential melastatin 4; VOCE, voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; WT, wild type</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We extend our warmest thanks to Dr. Alexander Ivanov, Neurosurgery Department, University of Maryland School of Medicine, for his excellent technical support.
