In the present study, we investigated the effect of DYT-40, a novel synthetic 2-styryl-5-nitroimidazole derivative, on cell growth and invasion in glioblastoma (GBM) and uncovered the underlying mechanisms of this molecule. DYT-40 induces the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of GBM cell lines. Furthermore, DYT-40 deactivates PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, suppresses AEG-1 expression, and inhibits NF-&#954;B nuclear translocation. DYT-40 reduced the tumor volumes in a rat C6 glioma model by apoptotic induction. Moreover, HE staining demonstrated that the glioma rat model treated with DYT-40 exhibited better defined tumor margins and fewer invasive cells to the contralateral striatum compared with the vehicle control and temozolomide-treated rats. Microscopic examination showed a decrease in AEG-1-positive cells in DYT-40-treated rats compared with the untreated controls. DYT-40-treatment increases the <italic>in vivo</italic> apoptotic response of glioma cells to DYT-40 treatment by TUNEL staining. In conclusion, the inhibitory effects of DYT-40 on growth and invasion in GBM suggest that DYT-40 might be a potential AEG-1 inhibitor to prevent the growth and motility of malignant glioma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), are the most common primary brain tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. GBMs are aggressive and destructive tumors that attack cerebral hemispheres with high frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. GBMs rapidly invade the surrounding brain parenchyma and contribute to gliomagenesis and resistance to traditional therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although multimodal therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation have been applied, the median survival of patients with GBMs is only 12&#8211;15 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. GBMs continuously develop because the multiple genetic alterations accumulate step by step, followed by the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Thus, to determine a more effective targeted therapy for GBMs, the molecules critical for glioma progression should be determined, and the most effective inhibitors against these carcinogenic molecules should be identified.</p><p>Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1, also known as MTDH, Lyric/3D3), a novel HIV-1- and TNF-&#945;-inducible gene in primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFA), was originally cloned in Fisher&#8217;s laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

The DYT-40-treated animals showed a dramatic reduction in the tumor volume at 14 days of treatment compared with vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Vehicle-treated animals exhibited a median tumor volume of 530.08&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup>&#8201;&#177;&#8201;43.99, whereas 5, 10 and 20&#8201;mg/kg DYT-40-treated animals revealed tumor volumes of 447.38&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup>&#8201;&#177;&#8201;62.75, 254.61&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup>&#8201;&#177;&#8201;55.55, 190.08&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup>&#8201;&#177;&#8201;64.01, reflecting 16%, 52% and 64% reduction, respectively. Temozolomide treatment reduced tumor volumes 36% after 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the results of H&amp;E staining revealed that the glioma model rat treated with DYT-40 exhibited better defined tumor margins and fewer invasive cells to the contralateral striatum compared with vehicle control and temozolomide-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, the microscopic examination of AEG-1-stained tumor sections shows a decrease in AEG-1-positive cells in DYT-40-treated rats compared with the untreated controls. The <italic>in vivo</italic> apoptotic response of glioma cells to DYT-40-treatment was investigated by TUNEL staining. The microscopic examination of the tumor sections showed that compared with the untreated controls, DYT-40-treatment increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the discovery of AEG-1, many studies have focused on AEG-1 to expand the knowledge of this important molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The crucial role of AEG-1 ranges from cancer biology to the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions. AEG-1 can be defined as a multifunctional oncogene that is over-expressed in complex types and progressive human cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The elevated expression of AEG-1 in tumor cells enhanced the phenotypic characteristics of malignant aggressiveness, including increased robust proliferation, migration and invasion to surrounding tissues, neovascularization, and enhanced chemoresistance. The diverse functions of AEG-1 during tumor progression in various cancers including brain tumorigenesis have been elucidated. However, studies of AEG-1 inhibitors are urgently needed for clinical therapy. Recent studies have provided definitive evidence that elevated AEG-1 expression is a common event in brain tumors of diverse origin, including GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In the present study, we focused on the regulatory mechanism of AEG-1/MTDH-mediated autophagy during malignant glioma EMT and invasion. An associated study has been published online in <italic>Oncotarget</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The results provided evidence that AEG-1 enhances human malignant glioma susceptibility to TGF-&#946;1-triggered EMT via autophagy induction, which is associated with glioblastoma development and progression.</p><p>Several groups have demonstrated the diverse function of AEG-1 during the development and progression of cancers. The generalization of the signaling cascades associated with AEG-1 includes (1) the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B), partially through direct interaction with p65, a TNF-&#945; downstream signaling component, is associated with several human diseases, including cancer, and NF-&#954;B controls the expression of multiple genes involved in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>; (2) enhancement of phosphorylation of MAPK molecules, including ERK1/2 and p38, which subsequently activates Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling and consequently results in tumor angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>; (3) suppressing apoptosis through a systematic mechanism that up-regulates apoptosis inhibitors via the indirect activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>; (4) recruitment of oncogene C-myc to the AEG-1 promoter region resulting from the activation of the Ras oncogene, which consequently activates AEG-1 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; (5) interaction with staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) and enhancing the activity of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which leads to degradation of target of onco-miRNAs tumor suppressor mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>; and (6) triggering protective autophagy, which is a common mechanism employed by tumor cells to adapt with metabolic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, we examined the mechanism that AEG-1/MTDH enhances human malignant glioma susceptibility to TGF-&#946;1-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition via autophagy induction.</p><p>The inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs is normally attributed to apoptosis, which is characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Apoptosis is an active form of programmed cell death that occurs in response to specific treatment, including mitochondria-mediated endogenous apoptosis and death receptor-mediated exogenous apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. As a consequence of adduct formation, DNA repair was simultaneously activated with cell cycle arrest. The failure to repair DNA led to cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Mitochondria-mediated endogenous apoptosis is characterized by the decreased expression of apoptosis inhibitor proteins of the Bcl-2 gene family, including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increases in the expression of the apoptotic protein Bax<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The involvement of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in apoptosis has been demonstrated by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and the fragmentation of the caspase-3 substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Thus, the members of both caspases and the Bcl-2 family as well as other proteins and events, such as oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest, could be defined as determinants of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.</p><p>EMT is a complex biologic reprogramming that is considered a crucial event in metastasis and tumor progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. At the early metastatic stage of tumors, the main feature of EMT occurrence is characterized by the loss of epithelial phenotype (E-cadherin) and acquisition of motility, invasive potential and mesenchymal characteristics (N-cadherin and vimentin)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. In addition, &#946;-catenin, which originally combines with E-cadherin at the intracellular C-terminus, exhibits nuclear translocation and release from the membrane to promote a series of invasive molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Simultaneously, AEG-1 activates Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling, which triggers EMT in some malignant tumors. As a result of the crucial role for the EMT in metastasis, suppressing the EMT checkpoint and progression in cancers has been recently considered a promising strategy to inhibit metastasis and prolong the survival of patients undergoing cancer.</p><p>The results of the present study have designed DYT-40, a novel synthetic (E)-2-(2-(4-chlorostyryl)-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl-2-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl) acetate, which significantly blocks malignant glioblastoma growth and invasion via the inhibition of AEG-1 expression. Moreover, the inhibition of AEG-1 expression significantly induces the apoptosis and suppresses the invasive ability of human malignant glioblastoma U251 and U87 cells by modulating MMP-2, MMP-9 activity and EMT characteristics. The activation and translocation of p65, the functional active subunit of NF-&#954;B, were analyzed in U87 cells treated with DYT-40. The nuclei were isolated, and the amount of NF-&#954;B p65 in the nuclear fraction was quantified by western blotting. The level of NF-&#954;B p65 protein in the nucleus was evidently decreased after treatment with 10&#8201;&#956;M DYT-40 for 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#8201;h. DYT-40 treatment decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK kinase, with no change in the total steady state protein level. Furthermore, PI3K (p110) and PI3K (p85) and the tumor gene C-myc were down-regulated when treated with DYT-40, suggesting that DYT-40 inhibited AEG-1 expression, which is involved in the suppression of the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK.</p><p>In summary, these results indicated that DYT-40 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of malignant glioblastoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. AEG-1 inhibition by DYT-40 was involved in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT-NF-&#954;B signal transduction pathway and led to DYT-40-induced apoptosis and DYT-40-inhibited EMT in U251 and U87 cells. The inhibition of AEG-1 expression induced by DYT-40 resulted in the down-regulation of NF-&#954;B expression, which exhibits a key molecular mechanism in which DYT-40 inhibits cell growth and invasion in malignant glioblastoma cells. To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the central nervous system (CNS) or be actively transported. Lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate into the CNS because they can dissolve in the membrane of the endothelial cells (Page 554 of Lippincott&#8217;s Illustrated Reviews Pharmacology). DYT-40 is a synthetic derivative of nitroimidazole that can cross blood brain barrier because of its lipid-solubility. Accordingly, DYT-40 could penetrate the blood brain barrier following intravenous administration. In addition, DYT-40 with a low molecular weight of 455.85 has an enhanced ability to cross the blood-brain barrier even in the presence of meningeal inflammation. Actually, transport experiment of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled DYT-40 on rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (rBMEC) would be more meaningful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the inhibition of AEG-1 by the designed compound DYT-40 molecular targeting to AEG-1 might provide a novel strategy for the treatment of malignant glioblastoma cells. The results of the present study produced several important conclusions to further investigate the more potential role of AEG-1 in physiological or pathological processes and the sensitivity of cancer cells in response to clinically chemotherapeutic agents.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Zou, M. <italic>et al</italic>.
