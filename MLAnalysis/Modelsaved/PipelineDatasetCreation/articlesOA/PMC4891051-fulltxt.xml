However, their clinical roles in different stages of natural chronic HBV infection remained unclear. To address this issue, HBV core genes were sequenced in three gender- and age-matched patient groups diagnosed as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. Functional analysis of the identified mutants was performed. A novel type of large-fragment core gene deletion (LFCD) was identified exclusively in HCC patients and significantly associated with unfavorable postoperative survival. The presence of LFCDs resulted in generation of precore-polymerase fusion protein or brought the polymerase reading frame under direct control of HBV precore/core promoter, leading to its over-expression. Enhanced cell proliferation and increased tumorigenicity in nude mice were found in hepatoma cells expressing LFCDs. Because of the epsilon-binding ability of HBV polymerase, we hypothesized that the over-expressed polymerase carrying aberrant amino-terminal sequence could bind to cellular microRNAs. Screening of a panel of microRNAs revealed physical association of a precore-polymerase fusion protein with microRNA-100. A binding inhibition effect on microRNA-100 by the precore-polymerase fusion protein with up-regulation of its target, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), was discovered. The binding inhibition and growth promoting effects could be reversed by overexpressing microRNA-100. Together, HCC patients carrying hepatitis B large-fragment core gene deletion mutants had an unfavorable postoperative prognosis. The growth promoting effect was partly due to polymerase overexpression, leading to binding inhibition of microRNA-100 and up-regulation of PLK1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>molecular oncology</kwd><kwd>mutation screening</kwd><kwd>microRNA-100</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Over 350 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, resulting in about one million deaths per year due to acute liver failure, decompensated liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During acute and chronic infection, genomic mutations develop in HBV viral sequences. Several of these mutations have been extensively studied, including precore-stop-codon, pre-S deletion, X truncation and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. However, there remain some mutations, which are less well characterized. Distinct types of naturally occurring HBV core gene deletion mutants have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infection [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Persistence of such mutants may contribute to the chronicity of diseases [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous studies showed that these mutants could develop in some special patient populations. For example, core gene deletion mutants accumulated in kidney transplantation recipients and their persistence led to accelerated liver disease progression [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A -1G precore/core deletion mutation emerged in human immunodeficiency virus/HBV co-infected patients, which was associated with high serum HBV DNA concentrations [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HBV core gene deletion mutants were also found in children younger than 5 years of age, who acquired HBV through horizontal transmission [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite these studies, the prevalence and clinical roles of core gene deletions in different stages of chronic HBV infected adults have never been carefully investigated.</p><p>The HBV core gene encodes a 25-kDa precore precursor protein and a 21-kDa core protein with overlapping reading frames. The signal peptide at the amino-terminus of precore protein is cleaved off and the carboxyl terminal portion is removed to generate a 17-kDa product, named HBV e antigen (HBeAg). The secreted HBeAg accumulates in serum to modulate the immune response to the nucleocapsid [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The core protein assembles into core particles. It contains nuclear localization and nuclear export signals, which assist HBV DNA shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, the core protein is highly immunogenic during chronic HBV infection [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The deletion variants of core gene themselves were defective for HBV replication [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and a longitudinal study from chronic hepatitis B patients receiving interferon-alpha treatment suggested that the core gene deletions might inhibit HBV replication [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mosaic core particles were found when co-expressing wild type and deletion variants [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A novel human protein is interacting with only the core deletion mutant but not the wild type [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Finally, emergence of core gene deletion variants was likely due to enhanced replication mediated at the level of encapsidation or reverse transcription [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the first stage of this study, we analyzed HBV core gene sequences in three sex- and age-matched chronic hepatitis B patients diagnosed as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC to search for core gene deletion mutations. Strikingly, a novel type of large-fragment core gene deletions (LFCDs) was found exclusively in the HCC patients. In such mutants, &gt; 3/4 of the whole core coding region was deleted. To understand whether this type of mutants was associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, a cohort of 179 HBV-related HCC patients receiving surgical removal of HCCs were included for survival analysis. A novel oncogenic mechanism involving physical interaction between HBV polymerase and microRNAs (miRNAs) was proposed and examined in cell-based experiments as well as xenograft mice models.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Identification of LFCDs in HCC patients</title><p>To investigate the prevalence of core gene deletions in the natural courses of adult chronic hepatitis B patients, the coding regions of precore/core genes including part of the X and polymerase gene (nt. 1557 to 2542) were amplified from the serum samples of chronic hepatitis B patients for sequence analysis.

The clinical associations of these nucleotide changes were likely due to genotype C association with HCC. Two substitutions at A2144 and C2304 were related to C2 and B4 subgenotype, respectively. The remaining 14 mutations were not related to genotype difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).

To understand the effect of core deletion-associated polymerase overexpression in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, HepG2 and Huh7 cells stably transfected with pRc/CMV (-neo), pCMV-pol and pCMV-HBV, respectively, were treated with TRAIL. By use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, apoptotic cells were increased by TRAIL treatment (3.2%) in HepG2-neo cells as compared with untreated control (1.3%) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

However, the percentages of apoptotic cells had no significantly change by TRAIL treatment (0.6%) in HepG2-pol cells as compared with untreated control (0.4%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Similarly, miRNAs were processed from a &#8764;70 nt-length of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) folding into a stem-loop structure [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In view of the structure similarity between the &#949; and pre-miRNA, we hypothesized that some pre-miRNAs might interact with HBV polymerase. To investigate this possibility, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HBV polymerase antibody for protein extracted from Huh7 cells transfected with or without pCMV-pol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Total RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates to search for polymerase-interacting pre-miRNAs. A panel of 270 miRNAs was selected for subsequent screening experiment because their abundance in liver tissues was high enough for reliable quantification [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pilot screening was performed by multiplex RT-qPCR method using 6 RT primer mixture sets (each set containing 45 miRNA RT primers) to perform stem-loop RT-qPCR. Forty-two miRNAs had a level &#8805; 1.5-fold when compared with the mock control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, upper panel). Further quantitative assays focusing on these 42 miRNAs was performed by real-time RT-qPCR using 2 RT primer mixture sets (each set with 27 and 15 miRNA RT primers respectively) after they were brought down by immunoprecipitation. Of them, 4 miRNAs (miR-9, miR-10b, miR-124 and miR-100) remained to have a &#8805; 1.5-fold difference (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, lower panel). After three steps of screening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information</xref>), only three of them (miR-100, miR-10b and miR-9) remained significantly enriched in the polymerase immunoprecipitates. The amounts of miR-100, miR-10b and miR-9 in the immunoprecipitates were 35.5-, 3.6- and 2.3-fold enriched, respectively, compared with the mock control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

When preC-pol was overexpressed, PLK1 was also up-regulated in Huh7 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, lane 1 vs. lane 2), mimicking the miR-100 silencing effect.

The large fragment core gene deletions can also be generated through RNA splicing to generate defective HBV genomes [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The donor sites of splicing could be located at the carboxyl terminus or at the middle part of core reading frame [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By analyzing HBV core gene sequences in the HBV-infected patient groups, we identified two short CID (&lt; 120 nt.) in the cirrhotic patients (2/33, 6.06%) and a novel core gene deletion (LFCD, &gt; 450 nt.) in HCC patients (5/33, 15.1%). Presumably, these deletions could be generated through mis-splicing with a new donor site located at the precore region. A recent longitudinal analysis discovered the HBV splicing events increased prior to development of HCC [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This could be the reason why the LFCDs were only found in HCC patients. To date, 14 different HBV splicing variants (Sp1 to Sp14) have been identified [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the precore/core coding area, splicing donor sites were found in 5 of the 14 known variants. None of these variants are the same as LFCD mutants discovered in this study. It can be speculated that there are novel aberrant splicing events. Three patients with LFCD had intact polymerase coding sequence in this study. Of them, two patients had an in-frame precore/core deletions and one patient had an out-of-frame deletion. The other two patients with LFCD had out-of-frame precore/core deletions, resulting in partial deletion of the amino-terminal portion of the polymerase gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In out-of-frame deletions, an internal start codon located at nt. 331 of the polymerase gene was found. To our knowledge, core gene deletions of such a long fragment have never been reported. The longest documented core gene deletion was 381 nucleotides in length discovered in a patient receiving kidney transplantation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most core deletions in chronic HBV-infected patients ranged from 24 to 250 nucleotides in length [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The BCP, located at nt. 1744 to 1804 of HBV genome, is a major promoter controlling the transcription of the precore/core gene [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Following generation of the core-polymerase transcripts, a large amount of the core proteins are translated from the transcripts, whereas only a small amount of polymerase is produced by a ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Subsequently, the polymerase together with the pregenomic RNA is immediately encapsidated by the core proteins, allowing for reverse transcription inside the nucleocapsids. As such, few polymerase protein molecules can be detected in the cytosol during normal HBV replication cycles [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In LFCD mutants carrying in-frame precore/core deletions (patient &#8722;4 and 11), fusion occurred between a short precore sequence (6-7 a.a.) and the polymerase reading frame. As such, the polymerase is no longer generated by the ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism, but is now under direct control of HBV precore/core promoter. Alternatively, in LFCD mutants which out-of-frame deletions (patient &#8722;9, 15 and 16), it was likely that translation of these pol-N-mut still relied on the ribosomal scanning mechanism but with the initiation codon far closer to the 5&#8242; end of the transcripts. As a result, the production of pol-N-mut was higher than the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). Furthermore, because of the absence of intact core protein, the polymerase is freely released into cytosol, allowing for its interaction with cytosolic cellular content. At present, the physiological role of the LFCD in HBV life cycle is unknown. However, our results showed that HBV genome carrying LFCD promoted HCC cell growth (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>), suggesting a survival benefit for HCCs carrying the LFCD mutants. The results were consistent with the postoperative prognostic analysis indicating that HCC patients with LFCDs had shorter recurrence-free and overall survivals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B and 4C</xref>). When combined with the effect of HBV polymerase, the HCC patients with both LFCD (+) and HBV polymerase (+) exhibited the poorest survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), suggesting that hepatic HBV polymerase overexpression caused by LFCDs might exert a stronger growth enhancing effect on HCC, when compared with HBV polymerase derived from other possible sources, for example, the aberrant integrated HBV genomes.</p><p>Although suppression of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Huh7-pol and HepG2-pol cells was observed, a lower baseline Bcl-xL level was observed when compared to that of the other two controls (-neo and -HBV) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). We speculated that it was due to a compensatory regulatory effect. In this view, Huh7-pol and HepG2-pol cells had an increased cell proliferation rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and therefore an increased cell turnover rate (increased cell necrosis due to environmental limiting factors). As a result, the apoptosis rate was reduced (not needed), accompanied by a decreased Bcl-xL level (anti-apoptosis no longer required). Additionally, cyclin E expression was higher in HepG2-pol cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) compatible with the increased growth rate in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. However, the level was lower in Huh7-pol cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>), suggesting that the increased growth rate in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> was likely due to further decrease of cell death rate (either from decreased apoptosis or necrosis or other unrecognized causes).</p><p>The preC-pol might be able to bind miRNAs was hypothesized because the structural similarity between &#949; element and miRNAs. Indeed, the miR-9, miR-10b and miR-100 were discovered physically interact with preC-pol. The greatest abundance of miR-100 in the immunoprecipitate implied that polymerase-miR-100 interaction might exert a biological effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The miR-100 was able to suppress tumor growth in several cancers, including HCC. Furthermore, it was known that PLK1 was an important target of miR-100 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that PLK1 frequently overexpressed in HCC tissues and its overexpression was associated with hepatocarcinogenesis as well as unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our data indicated that preC-pol overexpression in the LFCD mutant could exert an effect mimicking that of anti-miR-100, resulting in PLK1 up-regulation to promote tumor growth. This phenomenon could be reversed by overexpression of miR-100 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). According to these results, the preC-pol-induced PLK1 overexpression was likely mediated through its binding to miR-100 to inhibit its function. Clinical analysis showed that miR-100 level was associated with postoperative prognosis in HBV-related HCCs. However, when PLK1 was examined, the clinical correlation was not statistically significant. Combined analysis showed that HBV polymerase (+) was modifying the clinical predictive effect of miR-100. Moreover, patients with HBV polymerase (+) and high PLK1 level had the worst postoperative survival, suggesting that HCCs in which miR-100 was greatly inhibited by HBV polymerase overexpression, resulting in higher level of PLK1, had the greatest growth advantage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>PLK1 has been proposed to be a new therapeutic target for HCC recently [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Several PLK1 inhibitors such as GSK461364A, BI2536 and ZK-Thiazolidinone were designed to deplete or inhibit PLK1 kinase activities. Clinical trails are undergoing to evaluate their efficacies. Based on our data, HBV-related HCC patients, who have LFCD mutants accompanied by increased PLK1 expression, may be a suitable group for anti-PLK1 therapy.</p><p>In summary, a novel type of HBV core gene deletion mutant was identified. The LFCD led to generation of pol-N-mut, resulting in its overexpression and release into cytosol. The cytosolic HBV preC-pol physically interacted with miR-100 to inhibit its normal function, leading to PLK1 overexpresssion, promoting HCC cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was conducted under the approval of Institutional Review Board, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
