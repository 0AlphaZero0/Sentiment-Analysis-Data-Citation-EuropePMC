In this study we developed a complete open reading frame alignment-based rRT-LAMP method for the universal detection of TUMV. To prevent false-positive results, the reaction was supplemented with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) to eliminate carryover contamination. The detection limit of the newly developed UDG-rRT-LAMP for TMUV was as low as 100 copies/reaction of viral RNA and 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>0.89</sup>&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>1.55</sup> tissue culture infectious dose/100&#8201;&#956;L of viruses. There were no cross-reactions with other viruses, and the reproducibility of the assay was confirmed by intra- and inter-assay tests with variability ranging from 0.22&#8211;3.33%. The new UDG-rRT-LAMP method for TMUV produced the same results as viral isolation combined with RT-PCR as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; in 96.88% of cases for 81 clinical samples from subjects with suspected TMUV infection. The addition of UDG can eliminate as much as 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>&#8201;g/reaction of contaminants, which can significantly reduce the likelihood of false-positive results during the rRT-LAMP reaction. Our result indicated that our UDG-rRT-LAMP is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable method that can effectively prevent carryover contamination in the detection of TMUV.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tembusu virus (TUMV) belongs to the Ntaya virus group in the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The TMUV particle is approximately 50&#8211;60&#8201;nm in diameter and a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is packaged by the capsid protein into a nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope from host cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The 5&#8242; capped TMUV genome is approximately 11&#8201;kb in length and has one open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single 3410-amino acid residue polyprotein. ORF is flanked by approximately 145- nucleotide (nt) 5&#8242; and 618-nt 3&#8242; non-translated regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The N-terminus of the genome encodes three structural proteins, namely capsid, envelope (E), and precursor of membrane. Seven non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, which are essential for viral replication, are encoded by the remainder of the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Among these proteins, NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein and it plays essential roles in viral genome capping and replication processes through its N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domain, respectively. NS5 has been popular for the universal detection of many other flaviviruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>TMUV was first reported and named during an arbovirus surveillance study in the 1970s in Malaysia, and the main virus vector was found to be <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Humans and birds were considered to be infrequently infected with TMUV at that time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Subsequently, a TMUV strain (designated as Sitiawan virus) was isolated from sick broiler chicks in chicken embryos, and it was found to cause encephalitis, growth retardation, and increased blood glucose levels in infected chickens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Since 2010, a highly contagious disease has spread throughout most breeder, layer, and meat-type duck farms in China, causing significant economic losses in the Chinese duck industry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In addition to ducks, TMUVs are commonly detected in other domestic and wild avian species including geese<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, layer chicken<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, pigeons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and house sparrows<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. TMUV-infected birds exhibit various disease conditions as documented in the literature; in particular, high fever, loss of appetite, severe reduction in egg production, and/or severe neurologic disorders were commonly observed in TMUV-affected flocks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Our previous study indicated that TMUV-specific antibodies and viral RNA could be detected in duck farm workers in China during the disease outbreak in ducks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although TMUV has not been reported to cause illness in humans, TMUV still has a high potential to evolve into a zoonotic pathogen that threatens public health as a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Therefore, a rapid and accurate method for diagnosing TMUV infections is important for disease control measures.</p><p>In general, TMUV is isolated using embryonated duck/chicken eggs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, primary duck/chicken embryo cell cultures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, mammalian cell lines, and mosquito cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> for initial virology diagnosis purposes. Serological methods of virus neutralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, ELISA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and fluorescent antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> tests are also commonly used for the detection of TMUV antigens or specific antibodies. These TMUV routine virology and serology tests are useful, but they are time-consuming and have low-sensitivity issues. The nucleic acid amplification tests of conventional RT-PCR (cRT-PCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, nested RT-PCR, and semi-nested RT-PCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> for specific TMUV genes have been effectively used for the rapid diagnosis of TMUV infection since their development during the TMUV-related disease outbreak in the late 1990s and in recent years. Furthermore, SYBR<sup>&#174;</sup> Green and TaqMan<sup>&#174;</sup> real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> targeting specific TMUV genes were reported for more rapid and sensitive detection of TMUV infections. The advantages of RT-LAMP assays for TMUV detection in field situations or poorly equipped laboratories were previously reported by our group and other groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, there were two main limitations of the application of RT-LAMP for TMUV detection: i) most of these developed RT-LAMP assays were based on the sequences of historical TMUV strains, and thus, they were limited to TMUV reference strains of similar origin (duck, goose, or chicken), making them unsuitable for detecting divergent TMUV strains from various hosts or genotyping groups; and ii) the high sensitivity of RT-LAMP assays can easily lead to false-positive results due to carryover contamination caused particularly by aerosol droplets generated during the assay process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Fortunately, carryover contamination in the nucleotide amplification reaction could be eliminated using uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) to process the dUTP-incorporated amplicons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, there is no report describing the integration of RNA template-based RT-LAMP amplification with UDG digestion in a one-pot reaction to eliminate carryover contaminants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a carryover contamination-free rRT-LAMP assay for the rapid and universal detection of various TMUV strains.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The rRT-LAMP primer set for the universal detection of TMUVs</title><p>The current UDG-rRT-LAMP assay was designed to detect all TUMV genotype groups/sub-groups. We identified a conserved region among all representatives from different TMUV genotypes corresponding to the 3&#8242; end of the NS5 gene using the mVISTA method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This conserved region was located in the RdRP domain from genome position 9,793 to 10,003 (numbering corresponds to the complete genome of strain YY5, GenBank accession No. JF270480) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The 210-bp conserved region alignment of different TMUV strains was conducted using the ClustalW method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), resulting in an overall alignment score exceeding 99%. Based on the complete ORF and NS5 conserved region alignment results, four primers targeting six different regions in the NS5 gene RdRP domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) were designed, and the six primer-targeted regions were 100% conserved among different TMUV reference strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UDG-rRT-LAMP reaction</title><p>The developed UDG-rRT-LAMP is a one-pot, two-step assay for the specific detection of TMUV and elimination of carryover contamination.

As a result, the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay for the universal detection of TMUVs detected a minimal of 100 copies of transcribed NS5 gene RNA per reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>0.89</sup>&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>1.55</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of different Shandong TUMV field variant strains from different hosts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). The detection limit of the cRT-PCR for TMUV was determined on the same viral RNA samples in UDG-rRT-LAMP tests for comparison between the two assays.

In addition, triplicate sensitivity tests of UDG-rRT-LAMP were performed, and the average Tt values of different dilutions were used to generate the standard curve plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). An extremely close linear correlation was observed between the Log of the NS5 gene copy numbers and the Tt values (R<sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.998), with a regression line revealing an average intercept of 50.46&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.32 and an average slope of &#8722;4.23&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.06.</p><p>To determine the specificity of UDG-rRT-LAMP in detecting TMUV, six other avian pathogens and negative control samples (allantoic fluid from SPF duck embryo) were included in specificity tests.

To further confirm the developed assay have no cross-reactions with non-TMUV flaviviruses, the synthesized last 1500&#8201;bp NS5 gene of Bagaza virus (BAGV), Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus (ITV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) in pUC57 vector were also included in specificity test and no amplification signal was observed with these simulated viral nucleic acid samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, lower).

In both intra- and inter-assay analyses, all of the samples yielded a positive result, and the proportion of each dilution yielding a positive result was 1.00. All triplicate amplifications of each dilution resulted in minor differences in Tt values but the standard deviation did not exceed 0.80 for any replicate. The coefficients of variation for the Tt values determined for each viral RNA concentration varied from 0.22 to 1.08% in the intra-assay analysis and from 1.06 to 3.33% in the inter-assay analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP detect simulated carryover contamination</title><p>To confirm that simulated carryover contamination from dUTP-incorporated RT-LAMP amplicons is sufficient to contaminate new reactions, we compared the detection limits of the rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP methods using serial diluted rRT-LAMP amplicons with concentrations ranging from 0.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;19</sup> to 0.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;14&#8201;</sup>g/&#956;L. In the absence of UDG treatment, rRT-LAMP can detect as little as 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;18&#8201;</sup>g of simulated carryover contamination per reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which is equivalent to an aerosol droplet diameter size of approximately 0.124&#8201;&#956;m. This result indicated that even at extremely low concentrations or small particle sizes, carryover contamination can cause false positive results.

These results demonstrated that UDG prevented the amplification of up to 1000-fold higher concentrations of carryover contaminant DNA and 1000-fold smaller sizes of aerosol droplets generated by UDG-rRT-LAMP products which significantly reduce the likelihood of false-positive results of TMUV diagnosis. A UDG concentration of 0.01&#8201;U/&#956;L in the UDG-rRT-LAMP reaction mixture is sufficient to eliminate as much as 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;16&#8201;</sup>g of dUTP-incorporated carryover contamination per reaction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>UDG-rRT-LAMP can avoid false-positive results</title><p>To confirm that UDG-rRT-LAMP can reduce the likelihood of false-positive results due to carryover contaminants, we performed sensitivity testing of rRT-LAMP and UDG-rRT-LAMP reactions with 10-fold serial dilutions of the transcribed NS5 gene and added 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;18&#8201;</sup>g of simulated carryover contamination to each reaction tube. Without UDG treatment, we could not determine the detection limit of the assay, and all tested samples displayed positive results (Tt value of 30.8&#8211;37.4), including samples with undetectable levels of viral RNA (less than 0.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>2&#8201;</sup>copies/&#956;L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Severe diseases with mortality caused by the infection of birds with TMUV were indicated for the first time in chickens during the 1990s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and subsequently studied in ducks in the early 2010s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Our recent study reported a potential case of human infection with TMUV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, highlighting the urgent need for effective TMUV infection control and prevention methods, particularly detection methods. Several studies reported molecular methods for the detection of TMUV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Nevertheless, those PCR-based assays require significant time, multiple steps, expensive instruments, and well-trained personnel to perform the experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The use of LAMP technology is increasing in popularity for detection of TMUV and other viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> because of its rapid, simple, sensitive, specific, and isothermal reaction capacity without the need for a specialized thermal cycler. In this study, we applied an advanced UDG-rRT-LAMP method to the detection of all recognized TMUV-related viruses.</p><p>Unlike RT-PCR or rRT-PCR, which requires one pair of primers or one pair of primers and a probe, RT-LAMP requires at least four primers that recognize six regions of the target RNA sequence, and thus, its specificity is extremely high<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. On the contrary, to achieve high specificity, the LAMP primers must have a strict match with their target sequences, or failure of amplification will occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Thus, to develop a universal TMUV detection assay, identifying conserved regions in the TMUV genome sequence is a critical step in RT-LAMP primer design. Recently, Dai <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> provided evidence of natural recombination in TMUV and genetic divergence between various TMUV strains isolated in different years. Therefore, in the present study, we selected the complete ORFs of 13 representative TMUV reference strains from genotyping groups 1 and 2 (including subgroups 1&#8211;3) to screen highly conserved regions among these strains for UDG-rRT-LAMP assay development. Based on the visible alignment result, we found few regions in the TMUV ORFs that were sufficiently conserved for designing the LAMP primers for the universal detection of different TMUV strains. A TMUV variant, CQW1 (KM233707), was identified to be extremely different from other reference strains concerning its E, NS3, and NS5 genes, which were commonly used in detection assay development in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Fortunately, we identified a 210-nt candidate region with relatively high sequence conservation in the 3&#8242;-terminus of the NS5 gene, which corresponds to the RdRP domain with &gt;99% nucleotide identity. The size of this region was sufficient to meet the requirement of LAMP primer set designing. The highly conserved features of this region distinguished our NS5 RdRP domain-based UDG-rRT-LAMP assay from other published assays.</p><p>Although LAMP has been revealed to be a highly sensitive and specific assay in the clinical diagnosis of many pathogens, it was also found to be highly susceptible to carryover contamination due to its high sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The LAMP result is commonly confirmed by DNA electrophoresis and direct observation after adding a fluorescent dye. In these processes, both observation methods require the opening of reaction tubes, easily generating aerosol droplets of different sizes that contain high concentrations of amplicons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our present study revealed that an extremely small amount of amplification products (1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;18&#8201;</sup>g/reaction) from previous LAMP reactions could serve as carryover contamination templates for re-amplification, resulting in false-positive results. When converting the minimum contaminants dose that can cause false-positive results to the size of aerosol droplets, the particle diameter was found to be extremely small (approximately 0.124&#8201;&#956;m). This could not be filtered by most routine processing methods in the laboratory. Importantly, due to the current lack of an effective strategy for eliminating LAMP carryover contamination, preventing carryover contamination relies solely on careful operation of the LAMP experiment. Once contamination occurs in the laboratory, the procedure for eliminating or reducing contamination is usually complicated, costly, time-consuming, and sometimes requires moving the experiment to a new laboratory room or designing a set of primes targeting different genomic regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>Although there were some pre- and post-amplification strategies for preventing or eliminating carryover contamination in other nucleic acid amplification assays, including mechanical/chemical barriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, UV light irradiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, primer hydrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and hydroxylamine treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, these methods may not be able to completely eliminate or prevent carryover contamination. Therefore, they are not ideal approaches for controlling carryover contamination in LAMP reaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Compared with the aforementioned methods, the UDG-mediated digestion of dUTP-incorporated contaminant DNA is simple, inexpensive, and does not require substantial modification of existing protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. It specifically removes dUTP bases in uracil-containing DNA but has no effect on natural DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and RNA templates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The prevention of carryover contamination using dUTP and UDG has been well documented in previously reported PCR and LAMP assays using both DNA and RNA as the template<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. For RNA samples used in UDG-LAMP reactions, reverse transcription, UDG treatment, and the LAMP reaction are usually performed in separate steps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, which necessitates opening the reaction tube and increasing the risk of exposing the reaction mixture to carryover contaminants in the environment. Such a disadvantage limits the practical application of the UDG-RT-LAMP assay in the clinical detection of RNA viruses. Therefore, we performed rRT-LAMP amplification with UDG digestion in a one-pot reaction to eliminate carryover contaminants for the first time. The developed UDG-rRT-LAMP assay could remove as much as 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;16&#8201;</sup>g/reaction of simulated contaminants with a UDG concentration of only 0.01&#8201;U/&#956;L. Although the simulated contaminants cannot be removed at high concentrations (1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;15&#8201;</sup>g/reaction or more), adding more UDG and physically separating large aerosol droplet particles could serve as backup methods. To avoid opening the reaction tube during result detection, EvaGreen<sup>&#174;</sup> fluorescent dye was integrated into the RT-LAMP reaction for quantitative monitoring of the amplification and observing the endpoint result visually. Moreover, <italic>Bst</italic> 2.0 warmStart<sup>&#174;</sup> DNA polymerase was used in our strategy to enhance dUTP incorporation, amplification speed, amplicon yield, salt tolerance, thermostability, and specificity in the assay, which are critical to the success of the UDG-rRT-LAMP assay for TMUV detection.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the complete ORF alignment of various TMUV strains from different genotyping groups, we developed a universal TMUV detection assay using rRT-LAMP combined with UDG treatment to prevent/eliminate carryover contamination. This UDG-rRT-LAMP method is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable assay for diagnosing TMUV infection, and it provides a potentially powerful strategy for avoiding false-positive results in detecting other flaviviruses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Viral propagation and testing were performed according to the approved the Institutional Biosafety Committee, Shandong Agricultural University.
