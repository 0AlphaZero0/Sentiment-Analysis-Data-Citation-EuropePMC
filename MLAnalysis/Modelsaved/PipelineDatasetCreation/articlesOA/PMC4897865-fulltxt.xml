Melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic> L.) has become the model species for the agriculturally important <italic>Cucurbitaceae</italic> family. Approaches that take advantage of recently developed genomic tools in melon have been extremely useful for understanding viral pathogenesis and can contribute to the identification of target genes for breeding new resistant cultivars. In this work, we have used a recently described melon microarray for transcriptome profiling of two melon cultivars infected with two strains of <italic>Melon necrotic spot virus</italic> (MNSV) that only differ on their 3&#8242;-untranslated regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Melon plant tissues from the cultivars Tendral or Planters Jumbo were locally infected with either MNSV-M&#945;5 or MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 and analysed in a time-course experiment. Principal component and hierarchical clustering analyses identified treatment (healthy <italic>vs.</italic> infected) and sampling date (3 <italic>vs.</italic> 5 dpi) as the primary and secondary variables, respectively. Out of 7566 and 7074 genes deregulated by MNSV-M&#945;5 and MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264, 1851 and 1356, respectively, were strain-specific. Likewise, MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 specifically deregulated 2925 and 1618 genes in Tendral and Planters Jumbo, respectively. The GO categories that were significantly affected were clearly different for the different virus/host combinations. Grouping genes according to their patterns of expression allowed for the identification of two groups that were specifically deregulated by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 with respect to MNSV-M&#945;5 in Tendral, and one group that was antagonistically regulated in Planters Jumbo vs. Tendral after MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 infection. Genes in these three groups belonged to diverse functional classes, and no obvious regulatory commonalities were identified. When data on MNSV-M&#945;5/Tendral infections were compared to equivalent data on cucumber mosaic virus or watermelon mosaic virus infections, <italic>cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase2</italic> was identified as the only gene that was deregulated by all three viruses, with infection dynamics correlating with the amplitude of transcriptome remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Strain-specific changes, as well as cultivar-specific changes, were identified by profiling the transcriptomes of plants from two melon cultivars infected with two MNSV strains.

High-throughput technologies such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), microarrays and next-generation sequencing, have made possible the simultaneous analysis of functional data for many genes and the study of the plant&#8217;s transcriptomic remodelling in response to virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the past few years, DNA microarrays have become popular tools for comparative high-throughput gene expression analysis, and microarray platforms have become available for both model and non-model crop species. Melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic> L.), in addition to its agronomic importance, has biological features that make it an interesting experimental model, favouring the development of a growing number of genetic and molecular tools for this species, including large ESTs collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], TILLING platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the sequencing of its genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. More specifically, EST sequencing has allowed the development of a melon-specific microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which has been used for transcriptomic profiling of <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV), <italic>Watermelon mosaic virus</italic> (WMV) and <italic>Monosporacus cannonballus</italic>-infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this work, we have used the melon microarray to profile the melon transcriptome after infection with <italic>Melon necrotic spot virus</italic> (MNSV).</p><p>MNSV (genus <italic>Carmovirus</italic>, family <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>) is endemic in cucurbit crops worldwide, often causing significant economic losses due to epidemic outbreaks. The MNSV genome is composed of a 4.3Kb, single-stranded positive-sense RNA containing at least five open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which are flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) at their 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; termini. The 3&#8242; ORF encodes the capsid protein (CP) which has a structural role, is necessary for vascular transport of the virus, plays a role in suppression of RNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and is involved in virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It also contains a double gene block (DGB), typical of carmoviruses, consisting of two small, centrally located ORFs, which encode two consecutive 7&#160;kDa proteins (p7A and p7B) involved in the cell-to-cell movement of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The 5&#8242; ORF can either encode a 29&#160;kDa protein (p29) ending in an amber codon, or a larger 89&#160;kDa gene product (p89) if it is read-through, which contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. The p29 and p89 proteins are involved in viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which takes place in virus-altered mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The 3&#8242;-UTR of genomic MNSV RNAs, which are identical to those of sub-genomic RNAs, has been shown to contain sequences that act as cap-independent translational enhancers (3&#8242;-CITEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Depending on the specific nature of these 3&#8242;-CITEs, MNSV can infect <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and the otherwise resistant melon plants that carry the recessive <italic>eIF4E</italic><sup>228L</sup> allele at the <italic>nsv</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, 3&#8242;-CITEs exhibit a modular nature, as they can be exchanged among viral strains or even viral species through recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we have used two MNSV strains that only differed in their 3-UTRs, namely, MNSV-M&#945;5 and a chimera with its 3&#8242;-UTR from MNSV-264 (MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264) for infection profiling. MNSV-264 is a strain that is able to break the resistance controlled by <italic>nsv</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The characterization of melon cultivar-specific responses was also investigated, and two melon cultivars were used for this purpose. These were: cv. Tendral, which is fully susceptible to MNSV, and cv. Planters Jumbo, which is homozygous for the recessive <italic>eIF4E</italic><sup>228L</sup> resistance allele and is therefore resistant to most MNSV isolates but not to those carrying the MNSV-264 3&#8242;-CITE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], as is the case for MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Locally-infected tissues were analysed in a time-course experiment and the melon microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] was used for describing differential alterations of the melon transcriptome associated with: (i) the presence of one or another 3&#8242;-UTR in the MNSV RNA, (ii) the melon genotype and (iii) the type of plant tissue infected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of the main sources of variability</title><p>Once the data from each sample were normalized, biological variability and sample grouping were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>). Biological replicates from infected tissues, either from cotyledons (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) or leaves (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), always grouped together. The first component of variance separated cotyledon samples by treatment (healthy <italic>vs.</italic> infected) and the second one by time after infection (3 <italic>vs.</italic> 5 dpi). Interestingly, Tendral cotyledon or leaf samples inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5 separated from their healthy controls to a greater degree than the rest of the infected <italic>vs.</italic> healthy pairs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>); in contrast, Tendral leaf samples inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 separated to a lesser degree from their healthy controls than the other pairs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A hierarchical clustering analysis was also performed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c and d</xref>), and the results showed that once again, the cotyledon samples clustered primarily by treatment (healthy <italic>vs.</italic> infected) and then by time after infection (3 <italic>vs.</italic> 5 dpi). Among cotyledon samples, clustering varied for 3 and 5 dpi, with Tendral samples infected with the two viral isolates becoming more distinct with time (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In the case of the inoculated leaves, the differentiation between infected and non-infected samples was less clear as compared to the cotyledon samples, especially for Tendral leaves inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264. As for cotyledons, Tendral leaves inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5 showed the greatest differentiation as compared to the controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), suggesting greater transcriptomic changes in this cultivar by MNSV-M&#945;5 than in the other cases.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of biological variability in microarray samples. <bold>a&#8211;b</bold> Principal component analysis (PCA) of cotyledon samples at 3 and 5&#160;days post inoculation (dpi) (A), and directly inoculated leaf at 5 dpi (B), for the Tendral and Planters Jumbo cultivars analyzed after normalization of microarray data. <bold>c&#8211;d</bold> Dendrogram obtained after clustering cotyledon and directly-inoculated leaf samples.

An increase in viral accumulation was observed from 1 to 5 dpi in every virus/host combination, although virus accumulation was lower in the case of Tendral inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The differences in accumulation were already detected from the first sampling date, where higher accumulation was observed in Tendral/MNSV-M&#945;5 and Planters Jumbo/MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 combinations with respect to Tendral/MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264. For microarray analysis, we used sampling time points 3 and 5 dpi. Note that the relative increase in virus accumulation between these two time points was similar for Tendral/MNSV-M&#945;5 and Tendral/MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 (approx. fivefold) but larger for Planters Jumbo/MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 (approx. tenfold). The development of symptoms (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) induced by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 on Tendral cotyledons showed a slower progression as compared to the symptoms induced by MNSV-M&#945;5 in the same cultivar and of those induced by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 in Planters Jumbo.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Relative quantification of viral RNA and symptoms in melon cotyledons infected with Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV). <bold>a</bold> RNA accumulation as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of MNSV-M&#945;5 (M&#945;5) and MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 (M&#945;5/3&#8217;264) in melon cotyledon of the Tendral cultivar and MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 in melon cotyledons of the Planters Jumbo (PJ) cultivar.

Between cultivars, the number of identified terms was lower in Planters Jumbo than in Tendral (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Importantly, the GO categories that were significantly affected were clearly different for the different virus/host combinations, with some commonalities but many differences among host/virus treatments (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

A comparison of functional categories deregulated by each virus showed important differences among them. MNSV-M&#945;5 deregulated a great number of GO categories, with emphasis on processes linked to peroxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and responses to various types of stress. However, on the list of CMV-deregulated genes, only two GO categories were found, among them, &#8220;sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity&#8221; (GO:0003700), which includes a great number of transcription factors related to hormonal response regulation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Among these transcription factors, a few of the Basic Leucine Zipper Domain (bZIP) type, involved in the mediation of the response to salicylic acid, were activated, while many WRKY and Ethylene response factors (ERF) were repressed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), evidencing the early regulation on the hormonal responses that CMV exerts. Among the genes regulated by WMV, we identified processes related to oxidative stress as being over-represented (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p>The changes in common to all three viruses were minimal, only sharing the deregulation of a single gene among all three viruses (cCL4764Contig1, unknown function). As the accumulation dynamics of WMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] was predictably different from CMV and MNSV, we hypothesized that the dynamics of virus accumulation may have had a fundamental role in the transcriptomic alterations of the host plant. To test this hypothesis, the accumulation of the three viruses was measured in cotyledons of melon plants at different time points post-inoculation. Additionally, various genes that were allegedly deregulated by viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] were selected and the accumulation of their transcripts quantified at the same post-inoculation time points (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).

On the other hand, WMV did not start to accumulate to important levels until 9 dpi, in agreement with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The deregulation in cotyledons of the different genes showed responses that paralleled viral accumulation in the case of MNSV and CMV (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). In the case of WMV, the response was heterogeneous, with inhibitions observed in most of the genes at earlier times, and activations when the accumulation of RNA was more pronounced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Comparison of the dynamics of RNA accumulation of MNSV-M&#945;5, CMV and WMV in Tendral cotyledons at 3 dpi. <bold>a</bold> Relative quantification of viral RNA accumulation as a function of time from MNSV, CMV and WMV-infected melon cotyledons.

In Tendral inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5, 731 deregulated genes were identified, while MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 only deregulated 16 genes in Tendral and 224 genes in Planters Jumbo (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11a</xref>). The magnitude of the genetic deregulation in each tissue was correlated with the accumulation of MNSV as quantified by RT-qPCR, according to which the accumulation of the viral RNA in leaves was much lower than in cotyledons even at 3 dpi (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11b</xref>). A functional analysis of the deregulated genes in leaves identified many statistically significant GO categories that were mostly represented in cotyledons as well (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The direct comparison with the genes deregulated by MNSV-M&#945;5 in cotyledons at 3 dpi showed that more than 85&#160;% of the genes were shared by both tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11c</xref>).

As the accumulation levels of viral RNAs have been related to the intensity of the transcriptomic changes induced by certain viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the reduced transcriptomic impact induced by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 at 3 dpi (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) could be thus explained. This is an important aspect, because other observations with both strains at discrete time points could be, at least partially, due to differences in their infection dynamics. For this reason we decided to do our study at two different time points and compare the expression patterns as a function of time for both strains.</p><p>Both viruses activated genes involved in defense responses, oxidative stress and secondary metabolism or ubiquitin-dependent catabolic processes. Primary metabolism processes, mainly photosynthesis and genes related to the chloroplasts and the organization of the cell wall, were over-represented among the genes inhibited by both viruses, leading to changes that have consistently been described for other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, there were striking differences that were mainly found in two groups of genes that had a level of activation or inhibition in response to MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 that were well above the levels of those induced by MNSV-M&#945;5 infection. Among these genes, various transcripts of unknown unigenes (sSSH1G12_c) were found, as well as transcripts that coded for resistance-related proteins (cCL2022Contig2), proteins involved in lipid transfer (cCL5847Contig1), cytochrome p450 CYP87A3 (cCL2810Contig1), or membrane steroid binding proteins (c46d_14-E05-M13R_c), all belonging to a diversity of functional classes. These differences suggested differential interactions of both viral strains with the corresponding factors of the host, or at least with the routes and/or processes where these factors were involved. It is important to note that the region that was exchanged between the two viral strains does not code for any protein, but contains RNA structural elements that have critical regulatory functions in a variety of viral processes, including translation, replication and transcription of sub-genomic RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The potential functions of the altered genes for either the virus or the host are unknown, as are the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of these genes. In this regard, our attempts to identify common sequences shared by transcripts and viral 3&#8242;-UTRs that may point toward regulation through small RNAs have not been successful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Comparison of profiles associated with different varieties of melon</title><p>In agreement to previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 reached higher levels of accumulation in Planters Jumbo than in Tendral. However, the amplitude of the transcriptomic response of Tendral was greater than in Planters Jumbo. The genes deregulated only in Tendral were mostly related with defense processes and functions involved in photosynthesis in general and photosystem II specifically. The decrease in photosynthetic activity has been related to defense mechanisms through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from the chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and this has also been related to inhibition of photosystem II proteins with the increase in concentration of specific viruses, suggesting their involvement in basal defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this sense, the inhibition of these processes in Tendral and in Planters Jumbo could be related to the launching of different basal defense responses by the different cultivars. The list of genes that were specifically deregulated in Planters Jumbo, however, was enriched in functions related to potassium ion transport, which could be involved in early signaling of events that take place during viral infection in this cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Planters Jumbo is a cultivar that is susceptible to MNSV-264 and MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 but resistant to other strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], with the resistance being due to a mutation in <italic>eIF4E</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The two cultivars tested here differ in this resistance gene, but presumably also in several other genes, as they are not isogenic lines. Thus, perhaps not surprisingly, both cultivars responded differently to infection by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264. In this regard, the most remarkable finding was the unequivocal identification of a set of genes that showed antagonistic expression tendencies between both cultivars. Notably, clues of cultivar-viral strain double interactions were found: Among the deregulated genes, many of them coincided with those inhibited in Tendral that did not suffer changes in plants infected with MNSV-M&#945;5, which suggested the importance of those genes in the infection processes by MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 and its differential behavior depending on the melon genotype. Among the different genes included on the list, we found Myb factors (cCL4076Contig1), which are involved, together with WRKY transcription factors, in the modulation of the plant&#8217;s hormonal expression. These factors are frequently modified as a consequence of viral infections in relation to the alteration of hormonal expression of the plant in favor of the virus or as an integrated part of the plant&#8217;s defense system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Other annotated genes included diverse protein kinases, which are an essential part of the signaling events required during defense responses, as well as related to cellular death associated to resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The unigene cCL555Contig1, annotated as coding for the L31 protein of the 60S ribosome subunit, showed the greatest activation in Planters Jumbo, and was found among those that were most inhibited in Tendral, becoming a very interesting candidate for the analysis of its implication in the MNSV cycle of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Altogether, these genes represent potential targets for functional studies during infection with MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 and point to the differential involvement and regulation of metabolic processes between both cultivars. Further research could include transcriptomic profiling of melon isogenic lines that only differ on <italic>eIF4E</italic> after MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Comparison of profiles associated with different melon tissues</title><p>A possible criticism of the generic analysis of transcriptomic profiles could come from the assumption that the different cells or tissues respond in similar ways to viral infections, without taking into account specific alterations in the tissue as well as space-time variations of lesser intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In this sense, the transcriptomic deregulation induced by MNSV in leaves was lesser than that in cotyledons. This was probably related to the progression of infection, which was slower in leaves than in cotyledons as shown by the levels of viral accumulation. However, there was a big overlap in the nature of the genes deregulated in leaves with those from the cotyledons. Likewise, the biological functions and metabolic processes among the deregulated genes in infected leaves mostly identified the same over-represented functions in both of these tissues. These results provide validity to the general view of MNSV infections obtained in melon cotyledons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Comparison of profiles associated to infection by three different viruses</title><p>This comparison was possible due to the existence of previous data from research on infections of Tendral melon plants by CMV and WMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As each data set come from independent experiments and with the objective of minimizing variations that could be attributed to each process of analysis, the data sets were normalized and analyzed separately following the same criteria for all three cases. After the analysis, a single gene was identified, annotated as <italic>cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase2</italic>, which was deregulated by all three viruses, but with an expression pattern that differed according to the virus, that is, activated by MNSV and WMV but inhibited by CMV. Although the exact roles that cytokynins may play in plant-pathogen interactions are unknown, in Arabidopsis the involvement of these hormonal routes in some responses mediated by R proteins have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The common deregulation of this gene by the different viruses could indicate its involvement in the response to viruses in melon plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>Among MNSV and CMV, however, numerous shared genes were identified, among them, genes related to response to stress and general defense, heat shock proteins (cCL5861Contig1), glutathione S-transferases (cA_23-D09-M13R_c), transcripts that code for resistance proteins (cCL1320Contig1), or many WRKY transcription factors, which have been identified as a response to various viruses in other hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, each virus-host interaction was unique in terms of modified biological functions, as well as in the levels of genetic deregulation. For example, CMV caused a rapid deregulation of genes related to hormonal routes, while MNSV induced a rapid defense response and the activation of oxidative stress routes in infected plants. Unlike the other two viruses, the amplitude of the transcriptomic response induced by WMV was small, only activating oxidative-stress genes. A hypothesis that could explain the scarce genetic deregulation by WMV could be that the degree of response was related to the levels of viral accumulation. The quantification by RT-qPCR of a group of stress-response genes as a function of time showed the existence of correlation between the viral accumulation and the values of gene deregulation. These results suggest the existence of potential methodological errors when performing comparative analysis that use a single time point of observation or narrow temporal windows to compare different infections. Besides the dynamics of viral accumulation, the common deregulation of specific genes by different viruses has also been related to the phylogenetic distance of the viruses compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], so that new analysis and comparisons through the use of wider temporal windows and genetically-related viruses could provide more information on the processes that are commonly deregulated as a response to viral infection in melon plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>By comparing transcriptomic profiles of plants from the same cultivar infected with each of the two viral strains, we have shown that there are common but also strain-specific changes, the latter referring to a variety of genes with very different functions that were affected. No obvious regulatory features shared among deregulated genes were identified. Similarly, by comparing transcriptomic profiles of plants from each of the two cultivars infected with the same viral strain, common but also cultivar-specific changes were identified. Again, no obvious features among deregulated genes arose, but our analysis suggested the launching of different basal defense responses resulting in differential involvement of hormonal and stress response processes. An important methodological aspect emerging from this work is the influence of infection dynamics in transcriptome profiling. When comparing different viruses or viral strains, observations done at single time points could be significantly influenced by different infection dynamics. Biologically relevant data can be obtained by performing observations at different time points and comparing expression patterns as a function of time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Plant material, viral isolates and virus inoculation</title><p>Melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic> L.) seeds from the cultivars Tentral (Fit&#243; Seeds, Barcelona, Spain) and Planters Jumbo (accession C46 from the Experimental Station of &#8220;La Mayora&#8221;-CSIC, Malaga, Spain) were used. The seeds were germinated in Petri dishes for 48&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C. After germination, the seedlings were transplanted onto 35-cell trays with soil, and grown at 27/19&#160;&#176;C&#160;day/night conditions. Mechanical inoculations were done on fully-expanded cotyledons after 7&#160;days in the greenhouse or on the first fully-expanded leaves after 15&#160;days. For these inoculations, a mix of fresh inoculum in a 30&#160;mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH&#160;8.0) with active charcoal and 0.037&#160;mm Carborundum particles was used. The inocula used were from infected melon plants which had been infected with lyophilized material from MNSV-M&#945;5 and MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Experimental design and sampling</title><p>The biological assay consisted of cv. Tendral plants inoculated either with MNSV-M&#945;5 or MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264, and Planters Jumbo plants inoculated with MNSV-M&#945;5/3&#8217;264. For the healthy controls, plants from each cultivar were treated with virus-free buffer as used for the inoculations. The sampling was done at 1, 3 and 5&#160;days post-inoculation (dpi) in cotyledons and at 5dpi in inoculated leaves. We used three biological replicates that were composed of a pool of three different plants. Therefore, a single treatment (virus/cultivar/sampling time point) included at least 9 different plants. Viral accumulation was quantified in cotyledon samples inoculated with the different viruses (MNSV-M&#945;5, CMV, WMV) at 1, 3, 5 and 9 dpi. At 15 dpi, the second leaf showing systemic infection from plants inoculated with CMV-fny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and WMV-M116 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] was also sampled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>RNA extraction and microarray hybridization</title><p>All the samples were independently harvested and frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80&#160;&#176;C. The RNA extractions were performed with Tri-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. After the extraction, the RNA was analyzed by dot-blot to check for the presence of the virus in the infected samples. To eliminate traces of genomic DNA, total RNA was incubated with DNAse I (New England Biolabs, London) for 10&#160;min at 37&#160;&#176;C. The reaction volume was adjusted to 100&#160;&#956;l, and the aqueous phase was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Lastly, the RNA was precipitated with 10&#160;% (v/v) NaOAc (3&#160;M) and 2.5 volumes of absolute alcohol by centrifugation (12,000 x <italic>g</italic>, 20&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C). The quality and quantity of RNA was verified with a ND-1000 spectrometer (Nano Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For this work we used the melon microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] adding 244 new unigenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], already used in other research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In total, the melon microarray contain 17,443 melon unigenes that represent 10,649 genes in the melon genome, with additional 2,021 unigenes with no assigned hit in the annotated melon genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Our experiment data provided by NimbleGen, were grouped for normalization into two groups: cotyledon and leaf. As the CMV data came from an older platform, each hybridization data group (CMV, WMV and MNSV-&#945;5 at 3dpi) was independently normalized for later analysis and comparison. Each group of data were normalized and transformed to a log<sub>2</sub> scale using the RMA (Robust Multi-array Average) algorithm found in the oligo package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] of Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>). For the cotyledon time-course experiment, the maSigPro package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] was used to identify differentially-expresed genes. This program uses a two-regression step strategy. In the first step, a general regression model is defined. Then, the defined model is adjusted to the data through least squares, and the genes that significantly differ from this regression model are identified by correcting with a specific false discovery rate (FDR) of 1&#160;% (Q&#8201;=&#8201;0.01). In the second step, a stepwise regression is employed, and a probability (p) is calculated for each variable, showing the probability that causes the deviation. After the analysis, a list of the differentially expressed genes is obtained according to each variable (&#8220;TIME&#8221;, &#8220;TIME x Virus&#8221; and &#8220;Virus vs. Control&#8221;). We discard the differentially expressed genes associated with only the variable &#8220;TIME&#8221; in order to select those genes that were deregulated with time and associated with the virus in each cultivar. A maSigPro analysis was conducted for each cultivar. For the single stage experiment, the identification of differentially expressed genes was done through the SAM (Significant analysis of microarrays) module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found in the Multi Experimental Viewer (MeV, v. 4.9.0) program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], using a FDR&#8201;=&#8201;0. Genes with a fold change smaller than 2 (FC &#8804;2, cut-off of log<sub>2</sub>&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;1) were filtered out.</p><p>Samples were grouped with the PCA module from MeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Clustering of the samples was done with Euclidean distance by hierachical clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the bootstrap was done by Support trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] (bootstrap 100 replicates). Genes were clustered by their expression pattern by using the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and Pearson&#8217;s correlation for the calculation of distances. Lastly, the functional analysis was done with the Blast2GO program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], extracting the over- or under-represented GO terms among the differentially-expressed genes from each condition by the application of Fisher&#8217;s test (p-value &lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Microarray validation and real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)</title><p>The melon microarray was validated in previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and we undertook further verification by comparing microarray and RT-qPCR expression patterns of a pathogen response protein, a calmodulin-binding protein, a lipoxigenase and a glucosyl transferase transcript. The same RNA samples from cotyledon hybridized to the microarray were used for this purpose. Data from RT-qPCR were transformed to a log<sub>2</sub> scale to make the data comparable with microarray results.

As MNSV and CMV do not have a poly(A) tail, reverse primers for the respective viruses (CE-948, 5&#8242;-CCCACTATCATCACGATCTTTAC-3&#8242;, and CE-169, 5&#8242;-CCGCTTACGATTCCCAACTGT-3&#8242;) were added for transcription of the viral RNAs. The qPCR for the quantification of messenger RNA, as well as viral accumulation was performed on an AB7500 System (Applied Biosystems), using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as the detector and ROX as the passive reference. All the reactions (final volume of 20&#160;&#956;l) contained 10&#160;&#956;l Master Mix, 0.15&#160;&#956;l of each primer (100&#160;mM) and 60&#160;ng of cDNA. Each reaction was done in triplicate, along with controls without DNA (NTC), using a two-step amplification protocol and adding a melting curve. The analysis of the melting curves and the NTC were done in order to ensure the specific amplification of the product and the absence of dimerization of the primers.

The analysis was carried out with the SDS-7500 software and exported to a spread sheet for further calculations.
