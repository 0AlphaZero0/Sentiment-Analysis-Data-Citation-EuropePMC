There has been a recent interest to determine the factors that act as determinants between successful and unsuccessful rotator cuff repair. Vitamin D level in patients is one of the factors that have been linked to bone and muscle proliferation and healing, and it may have an effect on tendon-to-bone healing. The purpose of this article is to critically review relevant published research that relates to the effect of vitamin D on rotator cuff tears and subsequent healing. A review of the literature was conducted to identify all studies that investigate the relationship between vitamin D and tendon healing, in addition to its mechanism of action. The data were then analyzed in order to summarize what is currently known about vitamin D, rotator cuff pathology, and tendon-to-bone healing. The activated metabolite of vitamin D, 1&#945;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, affects osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Likewise, vitamin D plays a significant role in the tendon-to-bone healing process by increasing the bone mineral density and strengthening the skeletal muscles. The 1&#945;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> binds to vitamin D receptors on myocytes to stimulate growth and proliferation. The form of vitamin D produced by the liver, calcifediol, is a key initiator of the myocyte healing process by moving phosphate into myocytes, which improves function and metabolism. Investigation into the effect of vitamin D on tendons has been sparse, but limited studies have been promising. Matrix metalloproteinases play an active role in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tendons, particularly deleterious remodeling of the collagen fibers. Also, the levels of transforming growth factor-&#946;3 positively influence the success of the surgery for rotator cuff repair. In the tendon-to-bone healing process, vitamin D has been shown to successfully influence bone and muscle healing, but more research is needed to delve into the mechanisms of vitamin D as a factor in skeletal tendon health and healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D</kwd><kwd>matrix metalloproteinases</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>rotator cuff tear</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rotator cuff repair surgery is a common procedure to restore function and relieve pain in patients with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear.

With the advancement in the scientific enquiry and the findings on the effects of vitamin D on the bone component in tendon-to-bone healing, a critical role of vitamin D in tendon healing cannot be ruled out. However, there are currently limited reports investigating the specific role of vitamin D on tendon-to-bone healing.</p><p>In this article, we summarize the role of vitamin D in bone, muscle, and tendon physiology, and critically review the published studies that investigated the role of vitamin D in tendon-to-bone healing and discuss outstanding questions and future directions.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitamin D</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Many people who suffer from this deficiency lead lifestyles that keep them indoors or they live in a region where sunlight is sparse (such as northwestern Europe). Generally, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels define vitamin D status, and vitamin D deficiency (defined by the Institute of Medicine to be at &lt;12 ng/mL of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D) correlates with decreased bone density and rigidity (rickets), as well as adverse effects on muscle health and healing.<xref rid="b6-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>When sunlight hits the skin, the ultraviolet radiation turns 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3. The liver then metabolizes pre-vitamin D3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol). Finally, calcifediol is metabolized into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) in the kidneys.<xref rid="b6-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b9-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The vitamin D precursor, calcifediol, produced by the liver influences the accumulation of phosphate into muscle cells, along with the binding of vitamin D to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) on the myocyte plasma membrane. The phosphate is then metabolized to creatine phosphate, which supports the metabolism and function of myocytes.<xref rid="b6-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b9-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Activated VDRs result in the absorption of calcium to regulate the circulating levels of calcium and phosphate for normal mineralization of bone, which is intimately related to parathyroid hormone. The relationship of vitamin D and bones is one of the most critical and well-investigated functions of vitamin D within the body.</p><p>The parathyroid gland releases the parathyroid hormone when the levels of blood calcium are low. The released parathyroid hormone pulls calcium from the bone to blood and signals the kidney to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form), which ultimately results in an increase in the transcription of genes responsible for calcium absorption.<xref rid="b10-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Parathyroid hormone-activated calcium absorption from the kidneys and bones is a diverse mechanism that allows for quick homeostatic regulation. The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also stimulates gene expression and subsequent calcium absorption in the kidneys, as evidenced by the investigation of Hoenderop et al<xref rid="b12-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> using 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>-1&#945;-hydroxylase&#8211;knockout mice.

Vitamin D has been shown to significantly downregulate cellular response to tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), a major inflammatory cytokine.<xref rid="b18-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is thought that vitamin D blocks the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family) and the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) pathway to block the cellular response to TNF-&#945;.<xref rid="b18-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The exact mechanisms underlying this action are still unknown, but many possibilities exist because vitamin D has the ability to bind to receptors on both the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane. Along with TNF-&#945;, a recent study found that the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein were lower in patients who had sufficient levels of serum vitamin D, as compared to a group that was deficient in vitamin D.<xref rid="b19-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A recent study in BALB/c mice showed that mice with induced vitamin D deficiency had a higher incidence of airway hyper-responsiveness when exposed to antigens than the vitamin D-sufficient mice.<xref rid="b20-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Agrawal et al<xref rid="b20-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> also found that sufficient levels of vitamin D significantly reduced the levels of IL-5 and IL-13 and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, within the airways of sensitized mice.<xref rid="b20-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Because of its anti-inflammatory nature, vitamin D is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy for patients with arthritis, psoriasis, and some types of cancer.<xref rid="b21-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> More investigation is needed to fully understand the specific mechanisms by which vitamin D exerts the anti-inflammatory effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitamin D and bone healing</title><p>Gorter et al<xref rid="b22-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found vitamin D to be invaluable to bone density and repair, both postsurgery and during normal metabolic activity. Vitamin D does not directly signal the osteocytes to divide, thereby stimulating the healing process by generic pathways; rather, it increases the bone mineral density (BMD).<xref rid="b23-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> BMD is the amount of mineral matter per square centimeter in bones and, when increased, has been shown to result in better quality of healing.<xref rid="b24-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Specifically, an increase in BMD correlates to a greater degree of healing in patients who are postprocedural, as confirmed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans.<xref rid="b25-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Calcium and parathyroid hormone, along with vitamin D, have been shown to influence BMD, but it is not exactly clear how these chemicals act within the osteocyte to facilitate the healing process.<xref rid="b23-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Currently, BMD levels can be measured using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, which can help the physician determine timelines and best courses of action following a procedure.<xref rid="b23-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The next step in this investigation of BMD would be to have a larger-scale test to further validate the results obtained by Chung et al,<xref rid="b23-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> since their study only consisted of 272 people. Also, in vitro studies in cells and in vivo testing in experimental animals should be done to determine the relationship of vitamin D with BMD on a microscale and in a situation where the variables can be more tightly controlled. By understanding the cellular processes, improved therapeutic approaches could be developed for physicians and surgeons to better manage and improve the predicted outcome of their postprocedural patients.</p><p>A direct connection between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and the formation and growth of bone is the relationship between vitamin D and receptor activator of NF-&#954;B (RANK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jir-9-123">Figure 1</xref>). The RANK receptor, a member of the TNF-&#945; receptor molecular subfamily, functions to signal osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.<xref rid="b26-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Recently, research has been done to examine the therapeutic effects of anti-RANK antibodies in treating osteoporosis as well as pediatric osteosarcomas. Interestingly, a huge increase in anti-RANK antibodies decreased the rate of suture mineralization in mice and had adverse effects on long bone formation and tooth eruption.<xref rid="b27-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Vitamin D also suppresses the expression of RANK, but possesses more potential for therapeutic use than the anti-RANK antibodies in chemotherapy.<xref rid="b28-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Vitamin D decreases the levels of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-Fms), a receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which, in turn, downregulates RANK and osteoclastogenesis.<xref rid="b28-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Yoskovitz et al<xref rid="b29-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> found that vitamin D acts on the regions marginal to the RANK gene (specifically single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs9594738) by reducing the inhibition on the genomic region, affecting the transcription and translation of RANK protein.</p><p>Vitamin D exerts an indirect effect on the genetic expression within the osteoblasts. Serum vitamin D levels affect the expression of both bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factor-&#946;. BMPs are signaling molecules that regulate the stem cell activity and differentiation in various tissues, including bone and connective tissue.<xref rid="b30-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Both BMP-2 and BMP-4 show decreased expression relative to vitamin D, while BMP-3 mRNA expression is increased in osteoblasts.

In a study by Avenell et al,<xref rid="b31-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> there was a reduced incidence of hip fractures in elderly patients with sufficient calcium and vitamin D levels in comparison to a group with deficient levels of serum vitamin D.

It was found that the patients who received a mixed dose of vitamin D, calcium, and anabolic steroids had a steadier gait and better functions at both the 6- and 12-month postprocedural checkups. However, in this study, it was unclear whether the vitamin D had any tangible effect on muscle mass and healing or if the steroid treatment was solely responsible for the finding.</p><p>Indeed, more well-designed studies are warranted to further examine the actual healing of bones in relation to vitamin D. Avenell et al<xref rid="b31-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and Hedstr&#246;m et al<xref rid="b32-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> made significant progress investigating how vitamin D strengthens bones, but not much work has been done to investigate the specific effect of vitamin D on the quality and speed of bone healing.<xref rid="b22-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Studies in relevant animal models would allow for greater control of vitamin D levels and type of bone break in order to have a less confounding study, which could then be adapted to human testing at minimal risk (since vitamin D supplements already exist with negligible adverse effects). By establishing the role of vitamin D in fracture healing, physicians would be in a better position to prescribe patients with a more nuanced treatment and healing plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Vitamin D and muscle healing</title><p>Along with bone repair and healing, vitamin D levels also positively correlate with muscle growth and metabolism.<xref rid="b6-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although underlying mechanisms are not currently well understood, vitamin D acts on specific VDRs on myocytes.

The fibrillar type collagens, collagen I and collagen III, are critical in tendon&#8211;bone healing; collagen I is present during the remodeling, whereas collagen III is present in the early stage of the healing process and is associated with the degenerative and scar tissue.<xref rid="b38-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Healing failure is due, in part, to changes in the cartilage concentrations within the fibrovascular scar (composed of mostly type III collagen, which is replaced by type I collagen to achieve a specific ratio).<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b39-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Direct effect of vitamin D on the regulation of fibrocartilage in the four zones of the supraspinatus has not been examined. However, the effect of vitamin D on this healing process is to strengthen the postprocedural tendon-to-bone scar and, thus, increase the effectiveness of the healing.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Investigators have found that vitamin D positively influences the rotator cuff tendons through MMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jir-9-123">Figure 3</xref>). MMPs are enzymes that contain zinc ion in their active site and are essential in extracellular matrix breakdown and repair, specifically collagen degradation.<xref rid="b18-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Reider<xref rid="b40-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> reported a correlation between increase in MMPs and poor healing in rotator cuff muscles.<xref rid="b40-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Likewise, blockade of MMPs in tendon-to-bone healing was shown to improve healing by increasing fibrocartilage and collagen organization as well as improving the scar strength in rats.<xref rid="b39-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b41-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> An increase in MMP-1 and MMP-13 in rotator cuff synovial fluid correlates with decreased healing in the tendon-to-bone repair site. These MMPs signal for the degradation of collagen and connective tissue at the site of interest, an unfavorable phenomenon in rotator cuff healing.<xref rid="b4-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b42-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In a study of 35 participants, healing of the supraspinatus was shown to be inhibited by the presence of MMP-1 and MMP-9, with the defectively healed group possessing an increase of 2.5- and 5.2-fold, respectively, compared to that of the healed group (<italic>P</italic>=0.006 and <italic>P</italic>=0.021, respectively).<xref rid="b4-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> TNF-&#945; stimulates the secretion of MMP-9 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0005), an inflammatory component that is prevalent in wounds and aids in cutaneous healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jir-9-123">Figure 3</xref>). In an in vitro study, Bahar-Shany et al<xref rid="b18-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found that calcitriol inhibited the activation of MMP-9 by TNF-&#945; (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) and exerted its effect by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and (potentially) the NF-&#954;B pathways to varying degrees. Angeline et al<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> also found an inverse relationship between the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-9 and rotator cuff healing.</p><p>Tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) inhibit the connective tissue reconstructive properties of MMPs, aiding in rotator cuff healing. Specifically, Timms et al<xref rid="b4-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> found that TIMP-1 levels fluctuated with MMP-9. Vitamin D was shown to be another determinant of the amount of MMP-9 circulating in the body. Angeline et al<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> evaluated rotator cuff healing in Sprague Dawley rats by detachment and subsequent reattachment of the supraspinatus muscles. The test rats were held in a ultraviolet-restricted room until they were vitamin D deficient, and then, postsurgery measurements for biomechanical load-to-failure parameters were recorded, as well as analysis of histological specimens was carried out after a healing time of 2 weeks and 4 weeks. The significant quantitative result was the 2-week measurement of load-to-failure ratio, where the control (vitamin D-sufficient) rats had a significantly greater load-to-failure ratio than the test group. The most promising result from this study, however, was the histological staining and analysis. The 4-week test group showed significantly decreased organization of collagen fibers and bone formation than the 4-week control group. The intensity of the immunostaining for MMP-9 was also decreased in the vitamin D-deficient specimens than in the control animals. In addition, there have been many other studies focusing on the role of vitamin D in decreasing MMP-9 in the in vitro investigations.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b18-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> TIMPs, whose levels are also affected by vitamin D, were found to be beneficial in the healing process when held in a specific balance.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> An increase in TIMPs improved collagen organization and decreased collagen degradation, allowing for an increased amount and quality of rotator cuff healing.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The most recent study by Angeline et al<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> in 62 rats demonstrates the potential role of vitamin D in rotator cuff healing in humans. There have been many in vitro studies looking at the cellular mechanisms relating vitamin D and tendons. However, the in vivo studies are very limited. Therefore, in vivo studies with larger sample size are warranted to establish the relationship between vitamin D status and rotator cuff repair, followed by clinical studies to potentially develop a postsurgical therapy for humans.<xref rid="b3-jir-9-123" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Vitamin D has also been associated with strengthening of surgical scars by indirectly affecting the remodeling of fibrocartilage; however, a definitive evidence to support the role of vitamin D in this regard has yet to be established. There have been little to no definitive published articles or research relating vitamin D to either mineralized or unmineralized tendon. Thus, well-designed investigations are needed with a focus on the role of vitamin D in the healing of tendon rather than its role as a strengthening or protective factor on the tendon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Much research has been conducted concerning the specific effects of vitamin D on bone and muscle, but some studies have been conducted to study the effects of vitamin D on tendon and tendon healing. Given the nature and prevalence of rotator cuff injury requiring surgery, the potential for better management postoperatively with vitamin D supplementation is encouraging. Studies have investigated the effect of vitamin D on tendon-to-bone healing following rotator cuff repair. Thus far, much of the understanding on the role of vitamin D in the healing process comes from the effects of vitamin D on bone healing and repair with little attention into the effects on the tendon in tendon-to-bone healing. Nonetheless, limited studies, as discussed above, show promise for further research of vitamin D on rotator cuff tendon healing. Vitamin D supplements are a very simple therapy for the patients to take and the physicians to prescribe; therefore, if vitamin D is found to be beneficial in tendon repair, it would greatly benefit rotator cuff surgery patients and, indeed, many other orthopedic surgery patients with least cost.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by research grants R01 HL116042, R01 HL112597, and R01 HL120659 from the Office of Director, National Institutes of Health, and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, USA to DK Agrawal, and Haddix Grant to MF Dilisio.
