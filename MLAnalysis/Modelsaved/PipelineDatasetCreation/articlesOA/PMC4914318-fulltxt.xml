Although several PTC-specific miRNA profiles have been reported, only few upregulated miRNAs are broadly recognized, while less consistent data are available about downregulated miRNAs. In this study we investigated miRNA deregulation in PTC by miRNA microarray, analysis of a public dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), literature review and meta-analysis based on a univocal miRNA identifier derived from miRBase v21. A list of 18 miRNAs differentially expressed between PTC and normal thyroid was identified and validated in the TCGA dataset. Furthermore, we compared our signature with miRNA profiles derived from 15 studies selected from literature. Then, to select possibly functionally relevant miRNA, we integrated our miRNA signature with those from two <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models based on the PTC-driving oncogene <italic>RET/PTC1</italic>. Through this strategy, we identified commonly deregulated miRNAs, including miR-451a, which emerged also by our meta-analysis as the most frequently reported downregulated miRNA. We showed that lower expression of miR-451a correlates with aggressive clinical-pathological features of PTC as tall cell variant, advanced stage and extrathyroid extension. In addition, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-451a impairs proliferation and migration of two PTC-derived cell lines, reduces the protein levels of its recognized targets MIF, c-MYC and AKT1 and attenuates AKT/mTOR pathway activation.</p><p>Overall, our study provide both an updated overview of miRNA deregulation in PTC and the first functional evidence that miR-451a exerts tumor suppressor functions in this neoplasia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>papillary thyroid carcinoma</kwd><kwd>miR-451a</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>RET/PTC</kwd><kwd>AKT pathway</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most frequent malignancy of the endocrine system. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the prevalent histotype (approximately 80% of all TCs) and its incidence has steadily increased over the past 40 years [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PTCs comprise several histological subtypes characterized by different morphology and prognosis; among these the classical, follicular and tall cell variants are the most common.</p><p>Most PTCs are effectively treated by surgical removal followed by adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and the 5-years survival is over the 95% [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, a fraction of patients do not respond to RAI therapy and/or progress to metastatic disease; in these cases the prognosis is poor and the 10-years survival drops to 10% [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although several treatments have been tested in these patients, limited benefits have been achieved and effective therapies are still lacking [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Starting from the identification of the first oncogene in PTC, <italic>RET/PTC1</italic> [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in almost 30 years of investigations several tumor-driving genetic events have been identified and characterized. A remarkable contribution in this sense has recently been made by the work of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that, by a multiplatform analysis of almost 500 PTCs, the largest cohort studied to date, extended and advanced the knowledge of the biology and the genomic landscape of this tumor. Their discoveries not only confirmed the well known drivers as <italic>BRAF</italic> (60%) and <italic>RAS</italic> (13%) mutations and <italic>RET</italic> and <italic>NTRK</italic> gene fusions (8.8%), but also identified additional PTC-driving alterations as novel gene fusions and mutations in <italic>EIF1AX</italic> gene as well as in gene involved in DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and PI3K/AKT pathway. Although TCGA findings led to a significant reduction of the fraction of PTCs with unknown genetic drivers (from 25% to less than 4%), the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of PTC remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Recent evidence indicated that in addition to genetic alterations PTC, like the majority of tumors, is characterized by aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Since miRNAs are able to regulate multiple targets, their role in biological processes results simultaneously powerful and complex. In the last years many studies have investigated miRNA deregulation in PTC [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and their utility as diagnostic and prognostic markers has already been suggested [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Overall in PTC, miRNA upregulation is well supported and specific miRNAs have been broadly recognized (e.g. miR-146b and miR-221/-222 cluster), whereas miRNA downregulation has been reported only by a subset of studies and with low consistency [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Even though several functional studies have addressed the role of specific miRNAs in thyroid carcinogenesis [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the involvement of others remains unexplored. Further studies are thus required to better understand the consequences of miRNA deregulation in PTC as well as the molecular processes and networks in which these miRNAs operate.</p><p>miR-451a is located on chromosome 17q11.2 and its biogenesis occurs via a non-canonical pathway that depend on Ago2 protein [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. miR-451a aberrant expression and role in tumor pathogenesis and development have already been reported in lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancer, as well as in glioma and leukemia (reviewed in [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), and more recently confirmed in many other types of cancers [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, in several malignancies it was also reported a significant association between low miR-451a expression and aggressive clinical-pathological features as lymph node metastases (LNM) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], dedifferentiation [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], advanced TNM stage [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], metastases [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], recurrence [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and reduced overall survival [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several miR-451a validated targets have been reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/">http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] including, among the others, MIF, c-MYC and AKT1.</p><p>In the present study we investigated miRNAs deregulation in PTC. We performed miRNA microarray analysis in a small proprietary series of PTCs and validated the identified miRNA signature in an independent and larger dataset publicly available from TCGA [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, we carried out a literature review and meta-analysis and compared our miRNA signature with those derived from 15 published studies. Then, we combined our miRNA signature, with those derived from two <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models based on the PTC-driving oncogene <italic>RET/PTC1</italic> previously established by us [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on this analysis, we identified four consistently deregulated miRNAs: miR-222-3p, miR-199a-3p, miR-214-3p and miR-451a. Notably, miR-451a emerged also by our meta-analysis as the most frequently reported downregulated miRNA in PTC. Because the involvement of miR-451a has not been investigated in PTC so far, we focused on miR-451a attempting to explore its role in PTC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>miRNA expression profiles in PTC clinical samples</title><p>miRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray in a series of 19 PTC and 5 normal thyroid tissues collected in our Institute (clinical-pathological features available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>).

Hierarchical clustering analysis based on the identified miRNA list (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), showed a clear separation between PTC and normal thyroid samples, as expected, and a partial sub-stratification of PTC samples according to histological type. Four major clusters were detected: cluster 1 including all normal thyroid samples (5/5; p = 0.0001); cluster 2 including follicular variant PTCs (3/5; p = 0.0049); cluster 3 enriched for classical variant PTCs (5/8; p = 0.0069) and cluster 4 enriched for tall cell variant PTCs (4/5; p = 0.0474).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>miRNA expression profiles in PTC clinical samples</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Heat map showing miRNAs differentially expressed between PTC and normal thyroid tissues (absolute FC&#8805;1.5; FDR&lt;0.05). <bold>B-C.</bold> miRNA expression in the validation set of 499 PTC and 59 normal thyroid tissues derived from TCGA. miR abundance is reported as log2 normalized (reads-per-million, RPM) median-centered; q-value, statistical significance calculated by Wilcoxon test adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-07-12731-g001"/></fig><p>As validation set, we took advantage of public data available from TCGA [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and analyzed the expression of the 18 miRNAs in 499 PTCs and 59 normal thyroid samples.

As further validation, hierarchical clustering analysis of the 59 matched PTC/adjacent normal thyroid samples included in TCGA dataset was performed based on the identified miRNAs list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Our signature efficiently separated tumor samples from their normal counterpart also in this series of PTCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles in PTC versus normal thyroid</title><p>As previous studies have investigated miRNA deregulation in PTC, we explored to what extent our signature was consistent with literature data. We first carried out a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. To overcome the difficulties and heterogeneity associated with multiple datasets, we applied specific criteria of selection (see Materials and Methods) and focused only on studies reporting miRNA deregulation in PTC compared to normal thyroid tissue. Fifteen studies were selected from literature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). To assess the degree of concordance among studies, miRNA profiles were updated according to the most recent miRBase release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Datasets</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table S3</xref>; data processing fully described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Materials and Methods</xref>). Overall we observed a common pattern of deregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); in particular we confirmed better overlap across the studies for the upregulated than downregulated miRNAs, as already reported [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Regarding upregulated miRNAs, along with miR-146b-5p, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p, identified as top overexpressed in almost all studies, we found a set of miRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-21-5p and miR-31-5p) consistently reported in at least half of the analyzed studies. Interestingly, a more in-depth analysis revealed that a number of the identified miRNAs belong to gene families (miR-221, miR-146 and miR-181) or clusters (miR-221/222 and miR-181a/181b) or derive from the same hairpin precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2A</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the 15 studies selected from literature</title></caption></table-wrap><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles in PTC versus normal thyroid</title><p>Study-miRNA matrix showing miRNA expression across the 15 studies selected from literature and our study.

In addition, also among downregulated miRNAs we could identify miRNAs included either in gene families (miR-7, miR-199 and miR-15) or clusters (miR-451a/144 and miR-7-2/1179) or derived from the same precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p>When we compared our signature with those derived from literature, we observed a consistent overlap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). In addition, our signature identified two further relevant miRNAs: miR-214-3p, included in the miR-199a-2/214 cluster, and miR-99a-5p, included along with miR-100-5p, in the miR-10 gene family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Combined analysis of miRNAs in PTC clinical samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models</title><p>With the aim of selecting from our signature those miRNAs that could be functionally relevant and represent the best candidate for further analyses, we combined our miRNA signature with those derived from two <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models previously established by us [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The rationale for this analysis derived from the notion that in PTC different tumor-driving alterations converge on common signaling pathways (namely MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and that the use of these two cell models has already been helpful in the identification of functionally relevant miRNAs in PTC [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Combined analysis of miRNAs in PTC clinical samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models</title><p><bold>A-B.</bold> Schematic representation of the two complementary <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models based on the PTC-driving oncogene <italic>RET/PTC1</italic>.

In agreement with data obtained in PTC specimens, we found that miR-451a was markedly downregulated in all the tested cell lines compared with the control cells T686. As several experimentally validated targets of miR-451a have been identified [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and among these MIF is the most consistently reported (miRTarBase ID MIRT000046), we assessed MIF basal expression in the same panel of cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

In detail, marked reduction was observed for MIF (mean reduction of 96% and 71% in NIM and TPC1 cells, respectively), AKT (mean reduction of 71% and 54%) and c-MYC (mean reduction of 24% and 62%) proteins. In addition, reduced levels of the phosphorylated proteins AKT (mean reduction of 26% and 15%), mTOR (mean reduction of 31% and 45%) and S6 (mean reduction of 33% and 41%) were detected.

Our experimental strategy included: miRNA profiling, validation in an independent dataset from TCGA, literature review and meta-analysis, combined analysis of PTC clinical samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models and functional studies.</p><p>Firstly, by miRNA profiling we identified a panel of 18 miRNAs significantly deregulated in PTC compared to normal thyroid. This miRNA signature was able both to separate tumor samples from normal thyroid and to partially sub-stratify PTC samples according to histological variants. The most significant separation was observed for the follicular variant that form an individual cluster separate from the other PTCs. This is consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that highlighted how follicular variant PTCs represent a peculiar entity among PTCs sharing features with both PTC and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). In addition, we identified two further clusters enriched for the classical (cluster 3) and for the tall cell variant (cluster 4), even though more heterogeneity, especially in the tall cell-enriched group (cluster 4), was found. However, due to intrinsic heterogeneity and to possible co-presence of different histological patterns in the same tumor, a complete separation among distinct histotypes may not occur as already reported [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], also in larger PTC cohorts [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>As in the last decade several studies had already investigated miRNA expression in PTC, we compared our miRNA signature with those published. We performed a literature review; for a more homogeneous comparison, we applied stringent criteria of selection and we specifically focused only on studies using normal thyroid samples as healthy control group. However, a direct studies comparison resulted difficult, mostly because in some instances was applied heterogeneous miRNA nomenclature specific of different releases of miRBase. To overcome this problem, the identity of each miRNA was checked and updated according to miRBase (v21) mature sequence accession (i.e. MIMAT accession); this univocal ID was then used for a direct studies comparison. To our knowledge, this is the first report, among those analyzing miRNA profiles in PTC, that exploited this approach. Furthermore, for the first time, we included in our review the more recent publications in which miRNA expression was investigated by NGS [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our meta-analysis not only underlined a set of upregulated miRNAs common to most studies [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but also identified a set of downregulated miRNAs consistently reported in the most recent studies. Recently, Riesco-Eizaguirre et al. determined by NGS miRNA deregulation in 8 matched PTC/normal thyroid samples [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; their data are very consistent with those reported by our meta-analysis, providing further support to our results. Interestingly, some of the top downregulated miRNAs here identified, as miR-451a and miR-486-5p, had already been reported as unpublished data [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, our meta-analysis not only confirmed literature data but also shed new light on specific deregulated miRNAs whose possible relevance in PTC has been previously underestimated.</p><p>Along with the most frequently reported deregulated miRNAs, we identified several miRNAs reported only by a fraction of the analyzed studies. However, these miRNAs result of interest as they belong to specific miRNA families/clusters/precursors and thus appear in some way &#8220;linked&#8221; to each other. Indeed, miRNAs included in a gene family display sequence similarity, especially in the seed region, while miRNAs included in a cluster or precursor display physical proximity as they are transcribed in a single polycistronic transcript or derive from the same hairpin pre-miRNA, respectively. Collectively, these high related miRNAs are thought to be functionally related and to cooperate in the regulation of multiple biological processes either by co-targeting the same gene or different components of the same pathway. Interestingly, consistent patterns of deregulation have already been found in various tumors for these high related miRNAs [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the identification of concordant deregulation of miRNA families (e.g. miR-221,-146, -181, -199) or clusters (e.g. miR-221/222, -181a/181b, -451a/144, -7-2/1179) or mature miRNAs originated from the same precursor (e.g. miR-221-3p/5p, -146b-5p/3p, -21-5p/3p, -144-5p/3p, -199a-5p/3p, -486-5p/3p) in both up and downregulated miRNAs, suggests a major consistency for the their biological relevance in the pathology of PTC and provides a strong rationale to further investigate their role in this neoplasia by future studies.</p><p>The miRNA signature here identified, although derived from a small series of clinical samples, not only has been validated in an independent and larger cohort derived from TCGA, but also resulted consistent with literature data both in the general miRNA profile and in the coordinated deregulation of miRNA families/clusters/precursors.</p><p>Our meta-analysis identified miR-451a as the most frequently reported downregulated miRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In addition, miR-451a emerged also in the set of relevant miRNAs identified both in PTC clinical samples and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These findings suggested the possible involvement of miR-451a in PTC and prompted us to focus on this miRNA.</p><p>In line with data reported in other tumors, we found a significant association between low expression of miR-451a and aggressive clinical-pathological features of PTC as tall cell variant, advanced TNM stage and presence of ETE, but not with tumor size, T and N stage. Recently, a systematic review [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported in PTC an association of miR-451a with lymph node metastases (LNM or also defined as N stage) and this may appear in contrast with our study. However, the association described by Aragon Han et al [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was derived from a single study [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and some considerations should be made about that study: first, miR-451a was reported moderately higher in patients with LNM (FC 1.6, P value 0.026) and this appear in contrast with data reported in other tumors [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; second the tested case list was smaller than that analyzed in the present study (87 and 446 PTC samples, respectively).</p><p>Among various genetic lesions we found significantly lower level of miR-451a in PTC patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>V600E mutation. Because in PTC this mutation has already been associated with poor clinical-pathological parameters [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], this finding confirms the above mentioned association of miR-451a with aggressive features of PTC. Notably, a significant difference is also observed in PTCs with <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations in which miR-451a levels result higher if compared to the other PTC molecular subgroups.</p><p><italic>EIF1AX</italic> encodes the translation initiation factor eIF1A that recently has been reported to promote the biogenesis of miR-451a by interacting with Ago2 protein [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The expression and the activity of eIF1A thus appear to be directly linked to mature miR-451a levels. In line with this notion, we found that EIF1AX is moderately but significantly underexpressed in PTC samples derived from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5A</xref>); we could speculate that reduced expression of EIF1AX might cooperate or might be in part responsible of miR-451a downregulation in PTC. Our observation that PTCs with <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations express more miR-451a than PTCs with other genetic lesions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) is intriguing, although its significance remain to be determined. One hypothesis could be that these mutations might alter the eIF1A protein function and/or interaction with Ago2 and might promote a more effective processing and maturation of miR-451a. However, the functional effect of <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations is still unknown and further studies are required to test this hypothesis. As <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations have been recently found in various tumors [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], including thyroid tumors other than PTC [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], the identification of additional elements (e.g. miR-451a) linked to this gene is of general interest. However, as some <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations have been suggested to cause loss or impairment of protein function rather than gain [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we cannot exclude the possibility that additional mechanisms, not directly related to <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutation, could contribute to the miR-451a higher expression in PTC patients with <italic>EIF1AX</italic> mutations.</p><p>The key role of miR-451a has already been demonstrated in various types of cancers. To our knowledge, its role in PTC has not been investigated before. Thus, to elucidate the processes and pathways regulated by miR-451a, we performed functional studies in PTC-derived cell lines. In agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we found that the ectopic expression of miR-451a impairs cell proliferation and migration. Along with these biological effects, we observed the reduction at protein level of its validated targets MIF, c-MYC and AKT.</p><p>MIF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpressed in various tumors, where it promotes tumor growth and progression by the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including AKT pathway [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Recently, its involvement has been described also in PTC. In detail, two independent studies showed that the pharmacological inhibition either of MIF [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or its receptor CD74 [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] impairs proliferation and migration of PTC-derived cell lines and reduces the activation of AKT/mTOR pathway. In line with these findings, here we showed that the inhibition of MIF protein expression by miR-451a, along with other target genes, impairs proliferation and migration. Interestingly, both studies [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] described in PTC specimens a consistent overexpression of the MIF receptor and a trend toward MIF protein overexpression. According with these studies, we observed a moderate but significant overexpression of MIF in PTC samples derived from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5B</xref>). Together these findings provide additional support for a role of MIF and its associated regulatory and signaling pathways, including miR-451a, in the context of PTC.</p><p>c-MYC is a well known transcription factor that integrating signals from multiple pathways, including AKT pathway, controls gene expression and cellular functions as cell proliferation, differentiation and transformation [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>c-MYC</italic> is an established oncogene and its aberrant activation occurs in many human cancers [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. c-MYC deregulation has been found also in PTC where it is overexpressed at protein [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] but not at mRNA level [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. According to this, in PTC samples from TCGA we did not find c-MYC mRNA overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5C</xref>); by contrast, we found its moderate but significant underexpression. This finding, although unexpected, is in agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] showing that c-MYC transcript level was lower in some thyroid tumors than in their normal counterpart. However, the significance of this finding remains to be elucidated.</p><p>As it is broadly recognized that miRNAs can regulate target genes by translation blockage without changes of mRNA level, we could hypothesize that in PTC miR-451a may regulate c-MYC by a similar mechanism. Interestingly, Kim et al. have recently proposed that in PTC c-MYC overexpression could be due to c-MYC protein stabilization induced by activated AKT signaling [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These findings thus suggest that in PTC c-MYC overexpression may occur by multiple mechanisms, including regulation by miRNAs (e.g. miR-451a) and post-translational events, that do not necessary involve mRNA level changes.</p><p>Here we showed that miR-451a mimic reduces both the c-MYC protein levels and the activation of AKT pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F and 5I</xref>). As activated AKT pathway directly controls c-MYC protein levels [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed reduction of c-MYC protein may be due to the combined action of miR-451a not only on c-MYC but also on its upstream regulators, namely on AKT. Indeed, AKT (specifically AKT1) is a target of miR-451a (miRTarBase ID MIRT005740) and consistently with this notion, we showed its reduction following miR-451a transfection.</p><p>AKT is a central mediator in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that in turn regulates fundamental cellular processes as proliferation and migration. Importantly, AKT is activated in many cancers, including thyroid carcinomas, where it is involved in tumor formation and progression [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Evidence of its activation has been reported also in PTC [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and a trend toward AKT1 overexpression, both at mRNA and protein level, has already been described [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In line with these observations, we found a moderate but significant overexpression of AKT1 mRNA in PTC samples from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5D</xref>).</p><p>In biochemical analyses, consistently with AKT reduction, we observed decreased phosphorylation of its downstream effectors mTOR and ribosomal protein S6, indicative of reduced pathway activation. Interestingly, we found also decreased expression of total S6 protein. However, this reduction may be due to feedback regulation rather than to a direct targeting by miR-451a. Indeed, S6 is not a reported target of miR-451a (according to miRTarBase v16) and we have previously showed its decrease following mTOR silencing [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that miR-451a by targeting AKT indirectly impairs the downstream activation of mTOR and this in turn causes S6 protein reduction.</p><p>Collectively, our functional analyses showed that in PTC, miR-451a affects cell proliferation and migration and targets multiple elements of the AKT/mTOR pathway, thus appearing to play a role as tumor suppressor miRNA in this neoplasia. We are aware that here we focused primarily on selected targets of miR-451a, already validated in other experimental sets, and that the identified link miR-451a/AKT pathway may represent only one, among many, of the molecular mechanisms by which this miRNA exerts its functions. Additional and more in-depth studies are thus required to fully elucidate the biological role of miR-451a in PTC. However, to our knowledge this is the first study investigating the functional role of miR-451a in PTC and the identification of a link miR-451a/AKT pathway in this tumor is noteworthy. Indeed, AKT pathway, along with MAPKs pathway, is a central hub in the signaling networks involved in thyroid carcinogenesis and several deregulated miRNAs have already been reported to target this pathway at multiple levels (reviewed in [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). Thus, the identification of miR-451a as an additional regulator of AKT pathway provides further evidence of the complexity of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of this pathway crucial for both normal and neoplastic thyroid.</p><p>In summary, in this is work we gave a comprehensive and updated overview of the current knowledge about miRNA deregulation in PTC showing that along with the well known upregulated miRNAs a set of miRNAs emerges as consistently downregulated. In addition, we provided the first functional evidence that miR-451a displays tumor suppressor function in this neoplasia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Thyroid tissue samples</title><p>Nineteen PTC and five normal thyroid samples were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (INT), Milan, Italy.
