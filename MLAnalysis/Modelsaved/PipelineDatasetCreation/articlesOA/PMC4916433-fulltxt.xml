Additionally, AChR clustering is mediated by the components of the Wnt pathway. Laser capture microdissection of SMNs revealed that a secreted activator of Wnt signaling, R-spondin 2 (Rspo2), is highly expressed in SMNs. We found that Rspo2 is enriched at the NMJ, and that Rspo2 induces MuSK phosphorylation and AChR clustering. Rspo2 requires Wnt ligands, but not agrin, for promoting AChR clustering in cultured myotubes. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), an Rspo2 receptor, is also accumulated at the NMJ, and is associated with MuSK via LRP4. Lgr5 is required for Rspo2-mediated AChR clustering in myotubes. In <italic>Rspo2</italic>-knockout mice, the number and density of AChRs at the NMJ are reduced. The <italic>Rspo2</italic>-knockout diaphragm has an altered ultrastructure with widened synaptic clefts and sparse synaptic vesicles. Frequency of miniature endplate currents is markedly reduced in <italic>Rspo2</italic>-knockout mice. To conclude, we demonstrate that Rspo2 and its receptor Lgr5 are Wnt-dependent and agrin-independent regulators of AChR clustering at the NMJ.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse that is formed between a spinal motor neuron (SMN) and the skeletal muscle. Contraction of the skeletal muscle is controlled by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which is released from the motor nerve terminal. To achieve efficient neuromuscular transmission, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the muscle endplate must be densely clustered within the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ in direct apposition to the presynaptic active zones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Similarly, other intracellular Wnt signaling components, such as Dvl and casein kinase 2, regulate AChR clustering in cultured myotubes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In general, the strictly regulated expression of secreted antagonists including Dickkopf (Dkk) and secreted frizzled-related protein (Sfrps) and agonists such as R-spondins (Rspos) and Norrin enable the fine spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. For example, the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 is induced by denervation at rat NMJs, and it suppresses Wnt signaling to disperse AChR clusters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, no agonist of the Wnt signaling pathway is known to work on the NMJ formation.</p><p>Four secreted Rspos have unique Wnt-enhancing abilities, and their expression patterns are tightly regulated in a tissue- and developmental-stage&#8211;specific manner. A cell surface binding assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, a co-immunoprecipitation assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and a high resolution crystal structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> showed that Rspo2 directly binds to the leucine-rich-repeat&#8211;containing G-protein coupled receptor (Lgr) 4 and 5; its binding activates the Wnt receptors (Frizzled and LRP6) on the cell membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Rspo2 is involved in the development of several tissues. Rspo2 is required for the development of the larynx, trachea, and lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In addition, Rspo2 can regulate early muscle differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Expression of Rspo family proteins in the brain was previously reported using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>; however, the function of Rspo proteins in the neural and neuromuscular networks remains to be elucidated. Here we report that a secreted protein, Rspo2, is highly expressed in the SMNs and binds to its receptor, Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), at the NMJ. Rspo2 enhances the LRP4/MuSK signaling via Lgr5 in an agrin-independent manner and promotes AChR clustering. In addition, the loss of <italic>Rspo2</italic> in mice compromises AChR clustering, the ultrastructure of the NMJ, and neuromuscular signal transduction.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rspo2 is a highly expressed Wnt-related gene in SMNs</title><p>To screen for proteins that could potentially participate in NMJ formation, we harvested ~3,000 SMNs from three 6-week-old C57BL6/J mice using laser capture microdissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As a control, we harvested cells from the posterior horn cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We analyzed gene expression using the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>). We found that the expression levels of 164 genes were more than 10 times higher in SMNs than in the posterior horn cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). <italic>Agrn</italic> encoding agrin, <italic>Mnx1</italic> encoding HB9, <italic>Chat</italic> encoding choline acetyltransferase, and <italic>Isl1</italic> encoding islet1 are commonly used markers for SMNs. SMN-specificity of <italic>Rspo2</italic> expression was the highest among the 39 Wnt-related genes, although it was lower than those of <italic>Mnx1</italic>, <italic>Chat</italic>, and <italic>Isl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Similar to the results of the microarray, RNA-seq analysis showed a 14.9-fold higher expression of <italic>Rspo2</italic> in SMNs than in the posterior horn cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>). We also confirmed specific expression of <italic>Rspo2</italic> in SMNs by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>) in the spinal cord, which revealed a similar hybridization pattern to that in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/">http://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). In addition, Rspo2 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were co-expressed in anterior horn cells by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rspo2 enhances LRP4/MuSK signaling and induces AChR clustering via Lgr5 in a Wnt-dependent and agrin-independent manner</title><p>We first compared the expression of Rspo2 in the skeletal muscles and the spinal cord. Gene expression level of <italic>Rspo2</italic> was 56 times higher in the spinal cord than that in the skeletal muscles at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), and was ~300,000 times higher in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Nevertheless, Rspo2 was enriched at the NMJs together with AChR clusters in adult skeletal muscles, and also along the muscle plasma membrane to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1C</xref>). The enrichment of the Rspo2 at the NMJs prompted us to investigate the function of Rspo2 at the NMJs.</p><p>Wnt ligands induce MuSK phosphorylation and subsequent AChR clustering <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, we examined the effect of Rspo2 on AChR clustering in cultured myotubes in C2C12 myotubes, and found that exogenous Rspo2 enhanced AChR clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>). We next evaluated the effects of Rspo2 on MuSK activation using a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-responsive activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) luciferase reporter (ATF2-luc)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). As previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, agrin activated ATF2-luc in MuSK/LRP4-cotransfected HEK293 cells. Addition of Rspo2-conditioned medium (CM) activated ATF2-luc in MuSK-transfected HEK293 cells, and more prominent activation was observed in MuSK/LRP4-cotransfected HEK293 cells. Purified recombinant Rspo2 protein similarly enhanced the phosphorylation of MuSK in a dose-dependent manner in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>). In addition, Rspo2 had an additive effect on agrin-mediated AChR clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>), MuSK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2B</xref>), and Rapsyn expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2C</xref>).</p><p>Lgr5 is a receptor of Rspo proteins in the intestinal crypts and hair follicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We first observed that Lgr5 was colocalized with AChR at the NMJ in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Colocalization of Rspo2 and Lgr5 at the NMJs suggested that Lgr5 might be a receptor for Rspo2 at the NMJs. Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitation assays to examine whether Lgr5 was able to associate with MuSK. As previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, Lgr5 was co-immunoprecipitated with Rspo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We found that Lgr5 was not co-immunoprecipitated with MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>). However, coexpression of LRP4 enabled co-immunoprecipitation of Lgr5 with MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>). As LRP4 was able to co-immunoprecipitate Lgr5 and MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3B</xref>), Lgr5 binds to MuSK via LRP4 and not directly. We next examined the effects of Lgr5 on Rspo2-mediated MuSK activation in HEK293, L, and C2C12 cells. First, in MuSK/LRP4-cotransfected HEK293 cells, knockdown of Lgr5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3C</xref>) markedly suppressed Rspo2-mediated, but not agrin-mediated, activation of ATF2-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Second, in L cells, we examined the phosphorylation of MuSK using a lentivirus that expressed an inducible shRNA against <italic>Lgr5</italic>. Knockdown of Lgr5 in MuSK/LRP4-cotransfected L cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3E</xref>) suppressed Rspo2-mediated phosphorylation of MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3F</xref>). In contrast, the overexpression of Lgr5 enhanced Rspo2-mediated phosphorylation of MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3F</xref>). Third, in C2C12 myotubes, knockdown of Lgr5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3G</xref>) suppressed Rspo2-mediated, but not agrin-mediated, phosphorylation of MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3H</xref>). In addition, Rspo2 enhanced the expression of membrane-bound LRP4, but not of membrane-bound MuSK, in the mouse diaphragm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4A&#8211;C</xref>) and in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4D,E</xref>).</p><p>We next examined if the positive effect of Rspo2 on MuSK phosphorylation was Wnt-dependent. IWP-2, an inhibitor of Wnt secretion, abrogated the Rspo2-mediated phosphorylation of MuSK in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3I</xref>). Thus, Wnt ligands are necessary for Rspo2-mediated phosphorylation of MuSK.</p><p>We also examined the effects of Lgr5 on Rspo2-mediated AChR clustering in myotubes. We introduced a lentivirus expressing an inducible shRNA against <italic>Lgr5</italic> in C2C12 myotubes. In <italic>Lgr5</italic>-deficient C2C12 myotubes, agrin increased the length and number of AChR clusters, whereas Rspo2 could not induce the formation of AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2D</xref>). These results suggest that Lgr5 is a receptor for Rspo2, and is required for phosphorylation of MuSK and AChR clustering mediated by Rspo2, but not by agrin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of Rspo2 compromises AChR clustering as well as the ultrastructure and signal transduction at the NMJs in <italic>Rspo2</italic>-deficient (&#8722;/&#8722;) mice at E18.5</title><p>To evaluate the function of Rspo2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice. <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. To elucidate the function of Rspo2 in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle during embryonic development, we first counted the number of islet1/2-positive SMNs in the C3-C6 spinal segments of E18.5 mice. The number of SMNs did not change in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice, indicating that Rspo2 is not required for the development and survival of SMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Next, we examined muscle differentiation in the <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; diaphragm at E18.5. Although Rspo2 was previously reported to enhance early myogenic differentiation in cultured C2C12 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, the microscopic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>) and ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E&#8211;H</xref>) of muscle fibers in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice were similar to those in wild-type mice at E18.5. Quantification of the thickness of muscle fibers at the Z disk also revealed that wild-type and <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice had a similar muscle fiber thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4I</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Rspo2</italic> deficiency does not affect muscle differentiation in the diaphragm at E18.5.</p><p>We then investigated the NMJs of <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice. At E14.5, the sizes of AChR clusters were slightly larger in the left diaphragm of <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice compared to those in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5A and B</xref>). At E18.5, AChR clusters in the left diaphragm formed a broader band in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice compared to those in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4J</xref>). In addition, at E18.5. blinded morphometric analysis of AChR clusters and the nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A&#8211;F</xref>) revealed that the synaptophysin-positive nerve terminal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>) and the AChR-positive endplate area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5H</xref>) were both approximately two-fold larger in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice than wild-type mice. As the ratio of the synaptophysin-positive area within each AChR cluster remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5I</xref>), the nerve terminals was likely to be properly appositioned to AChR clusters in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice. The number of AChR clusters was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5H</xref>), which likely represents that AChR clusters became expanded and fused each other to make a fewer number of weakly stained AChR clusters. In contrast, the number of synaptophysin-positive areas was not likely to be fused, and its number was increased in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>). The signal intensities of AChR and synaptophysin were reduced in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G,H</xref>).

Defective neuromuscular signal transmission was also confirmed on the basis of the abnormally decreased CMAP amplitude measured in the tibialis anterior muscle after the repetitive stimulation of the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). A similar phenomenon is commonly observed in myasthenia gravis and in congenital myasthenic syndromes, in which the NMJ signal transmission is compromised<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.

Neuronal-type agrin, which has two alternatively spliced exons, is able to drive AChR clustering, whereas muscle-type agrin lacks these critical exons, and cannot drive AChR clustering. According to gene annotation databases (RefSeq, ENSEMBL, UCSC, and GENCODE), mouse <italic>Rspo2</italic> is not alternatively spliced in its coding region. We also confirmed lack of alternative splicing isoforms in mouse <italic>Rspo2</italic> by RT-PCR and RNA-seq (data not shown).

Therefore, Rspo2 at the NMJs may similarly stabilize LRP4, which enhances the effect of Rspo2 by facilitating binding of Lgr5 and MuSK, and the effect of agrin by increasing the number of LRP4/MuSK co-receptor. Our findings provide the first evidence that a secreted Wnt signaling agonist, Rspo2, modulates AChR clustering together with Wnt proteins, Lgr5, LRP4, and MuSK.</p><p>The diaphragm of <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice show an expanded area and a decreased intensity of AChR clusters at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A&#8211;H</xref>).

Thus, large synaptic vesicles in <italic>Rspo2</italic>&#8722;/&#8722; mice may be caused by reduced synaptic release, which is suggested by the markedly reduced MEPP frequency.
