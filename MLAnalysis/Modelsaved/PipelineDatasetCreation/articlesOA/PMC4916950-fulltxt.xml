It is located at 3p21, one copy of which is lost in the majority of ccRCC tumors, suggesting that <italic>SETD2</italic> might function as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the manner in which loss of SETD2 contributes to ccRCC development has not been studied in renal primary tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Therefore, we studied the consequences of SETD2 knockdown through lentiviral shRNA in human PTECs. Consistent with its known function, SETD2 knockdown (SETD-KD) led to loss of H3K36me3 in PTECs. In contrast to SETD2 wild-type PTECs, which have a limited proliferation capacity; the SETD2-KD PTECs continued to proliferate. The expression profiles of SETD2-KD PTECs showed a large overlap with the expression profile of early-passage, proliferating PTECs, whereas nonproliferating PTECs showed a significantly different expression profile. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of E2F targets in SETD2-KD and proliferating PTECs as compared with nonproliferating PTECs and in proliferating PTEC compared with SETD2-KD. The SETD2-KD PTECs maintained low expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and high expression of <italic>E2F1</italic>, whereas their levels changed with continuing passages in untreated PTECs. In contrast to the nonproliferating PTECs, SETD2-KD PTECs showed no &#946;-galactosidase staining, confirming the protection against senescence. Our results indicate that <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation enables PTECs to bypass the senescence barrier, facilitating a malignant transformation toward ccRCC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) represents the most common and lethal subtype of kidney cancer, accounting for 80% to 90% of renal cell carcinomas and 3% of all cancers <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A better understanding of the processes that underlie ccRCC development might help in designing more successful ways to treat these tumors <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. ccRCC arises from the primary tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) of the kidney <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but the malignant transformation process is poorly understood. The most common genomic aberration in ccRCC is 3p loss <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, indicating the presence of ccRCC-associated tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). The first TSG identified in ccRCC was Von Hippel&#8211;Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which maps to 3p25 and is mutated in approximately 55% of tumors <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In recent years, three additional 3p genes (<italic>PBRM1</italic>, <italic>BAP1</italic>, and <italic>SETD2</italic>) have been identified as being frequently mutated in ccRCC. Mutations in <italic>SETD2</italic> were first reported in two independent studies. Dalgliesh et al. identified <italic>SETD2-</italic>inactivating mutations in 15/342 ccRCC cases&#160;<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and we identified <italic>SETD2</italic>-inactivating mutations in 5/10 ccRCC-derived cell lines <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>SETD2</italic>-inactivating mutations occur at a frequency of 11% in ccRCC <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Together, these studies support the relevance of <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation in the development of ccRCC. Loss of one allele of <italic>SETD2</italic> and functional inactivation of the second allele by a point mutation are consistent with Knudson&#8217;s classic two-hit model to inactivate TSGs.</p><p>SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase responsible for the histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), a histone mark enriched at the gene body of actively transcribed genes <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The SRI domain of SETD2 interacts with RNA-polymerase II, causing SETD2 to be present during transcription. Many of the biological processes in which SETD2 has been suggested to participate revert to its presence during the transcriptional process. In ccRCC-derived cell lines, loss of 3p and mutation of the remaining <italic>SETD2</italic> allele result in a complete loss of H3K36me3, whereas cell lines with one functional <italic>SETD2</italic> allele show at most slightly reduced or even normal H3K36me3 levels <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Both SETD2 shRNA constructs induced a 60% to 70% decrease in <italic>SETD2</italic> mRNA levels. A virtual absence of H3K36me3, commonly used as a measure of SETD2 loss <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10],</xref> in SETD2 shRNA-treated HEK293 cells confirmed efficient downregulation of SETD2 at the protein level (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref><italic>A</italic>). To study the effect of SETD2 knockdown on cell growth, we performed a GFP competition assay in both cell lines. In HEK293T cells, a significant reduction of GFP+ SETD2-KD cells (60%-80%) was observed at day 20 for both shRNA constructs relative to the GFP+ percentage at day 3. In HKC8 cells, the reduction was also significant, although less pronounced, with a drop of 40% to 60%. No significant differences were observed in the growth competition assays for the NT-shRNA construct transduced cell lines (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Thus, SETD2 depletion caused a marked decrease in cell growth in immortalized human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells and kidney epithelial (HKC8) cells. The decrease in GFP+ cells might be related to a reduced transcription elongation rate of multiexon protein coding genes as a consequence of loss of H3K36me3 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These findings are not consistent with a tumor suppressor function of <italic>SETD2</italic> in ccRCC. However, the impact of SETD2 knockdown in these immortalized and highly proliferating kidney cell lines might not represent an optimal model to study the tumor-suppressing function of <italic>SETD2</italic> in ccRCC.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><title>SETD2-KD in PTECs</title><p>To further study the possible tumor suppressor function of <italic>SETD2</italic> in ccRCC oncogenesis, we switched to renal primary tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), which are generally regarded as the normal counterparts of ccRCC <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These PTECs can be isolated from the kidney cortex segment and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> for a limited number of population doublings <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We isolated PTECs and authenticated their phenotype as described previously <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Early-passage PTECs derived from three different individuals were transduced with viral particles containing SETD2-shRNA constructs. Again, both constructs induced a significant decrease in <italic>SETD2</italic> mRNA levels (40%-60%) and an almost complete loss of H3K36me3 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref><italic>A</italic>). This loss of H3K36me3 is consistent with a complete functional loss of SETD2 as observed in ccRCC cell lines caused by loss of one allele and an inactivating mutation in the remaining <italic>SETD2</italic> allele <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We next assessed the effect of SETD2 knockdown in a GFP-competition assay. At day 22 of the growth competition assay, the proportion of GFP+ cells showed a significant increase of 140% and 70% in SETD2-sh1 and SETD2-sh2 transduced PTECs, respectively, over the GFP&#8722; cells compared with day 2. The percentage of GFP+ cells in the NT-shRNA transduced PTECs (NT-PTECs) did not show a significant change over time (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref><italic>B</italic>). These experiments revealed an apparent growth advantage of SETD2-KD PTECs relative to SETD2-WT PTECs consistent with a possible tumor suppressor function of SETD2. The proliferative capacity of untreated and NT-shRNA&#8211;treated PTECs gradually decreased, and cells stopped proliferating at around day 15 (passage 5), consistent with the known limited proliferative capacity of PTECs <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We therefore stopped the GFP-competition assay at day 22.</p><p>SETD2-KD PTECs continued to proliferate until we stopped these cultures at day 40. Staining of the SETD2-KD PTECs at day 40 revealed an immunophenotype consistent with the wild-type PTECs at passage 3 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Figure&#160;1.</xref>), i.e., positive for epithelial markers cytokeratin 8/18 (CK 8/18), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin clone AE1/3 (CK AE1/3), and C5 alpha receptor (c5alphaR) and negative for fibroblast marker alpha smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA).

PTECS transduced with NT shRNA constructs (days 6 and 16) were used as controls. To obtain sufficient cells for the analysis, we infected the NT cells at a high MOI. To exclude a potential bias caused by comparing untreated PTECS to PTECS infected with a high MOI (NT) or a low MOI (SETD2-KD shRNAs), we carried out a principle component analysis (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Figure&#160;2</xref>). Component 1 discriminated between nonproliferating WT- and NT-day 16 cells and the proliferating WT/NT-day 6 and KD-day 25 cells. Component 2 discriminated between WT/NT-day 6 and the KD-day 25 samples. NT cells clustered together with the WT cells at both day 6 and day 16, indicating that MOI did not affect the expression profile. Moreover, no significant differences in the expression profiles between the WT and NT cells were detected. These analyses clearly indicate that the high MOI used for the NT short hairpin transduction did not affect the expression signature of PTECs.</p><p>One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni FWER multiple testing correction revealed 227 differentially expressed genes between the three experimental groups, i.e., proliferating untreated/NT PTECs at day 6 (WT/NT-day 6), nonproliferating WT/NT-day 16 PTECS, and proliferating SETD2-KD day 25 PTECs. Two hundred seven genes were differentially expressed between WT/NT-day 6 and WT/NT-day 16 PTECs, 207 genes between SETD2 KD-day 25 and WT/NT-day 16 PTECs, and 148 genes between WT/NT-day 6 and SETD2 KD-day 25 PTECs (<xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table&#160;2</xref>).

In comparison to WT/NT-day 6 PTECs, SETD2 KD-day 25 PTECs showed a significant enrichment of nine gene sets (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.01).

G2/M checkpoint genes regulate the transition of G2 to M phase in cells and prevent division of cells with DNA damage <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The E2F family of transcription factors orchestrates the expression of hundreds of genes in multiple biological processes, including senescence <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SETD2-KD PTECs remain in an active proliferation status well beyond a passage that would have caused senescence in the WT-PTECs. Given the known association between E2F targets and senescence, as well as the results of the growth competition assay, we next studied the expression of known senescence markers.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Inhibition of CDKN2A-E2F signaling in SETD2-KD PTECs</title><p>Senescent cells are characterized by growth arrest, enlarged and flat cellular morphology, and an expression profile characterized by senescence-associated genes. The most commonly used marker to identify senescent cells is &#946;-gal activity <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>, almost all NT-day 20 PTECs (both GFP&#160;+ and GFP&#160;&#8722;) stained positive for &#946;-gal, indicative of a senescent status. In the mixed SETD2-KD cultures at day 20, containing both transduced GFP&#160;+/SETD2-KD PTECs and nontransduced GFP-/SETD2-WT PTECs, only a subpopulation of the cells stained positive for &#946;-gal. After 40 days, almost all SETD2 KD cells were negative for &#946;-gal while being positive for GFP. The decrease of &#946;-gal&#8211;positive cells, in combination with the increasing number of GFP&#160;+ cells in the SETD2-KD PTEC culture, is consistent with a rescue of senescence of the SETD2-KD cells. These results indicate that knockdown of SETD2 prevents the transition of proliferating PTECs to nonproliferating, senescent PTECs.</p><p>The two main pathways associated with regulation of senescence are the tumor protein (TP)53-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>) and the CDKN2A-E2F1 pathway <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Activation of TP53 results in induction of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and senescence. The expression levels of <italic>TP53</italic> did not change, whereas its downstream target <italic>CDKN1A</italic> was increased in both nonproliferating WT/NT-day 16 PTECs and proliferating SETD2 KD-day 25 PTECs (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Figure&#160;3</xref>). Activation of CDKN2A induces senescence by inhibiting <italic>E2F</italic> family member<italic>s</italic> through binding to the retinoblastoma protein. As GSEA showed enrichment of E2F targets in WT/NT-day 6 and SETD2 KD-day 25 PTECs compared with WT/NT-day 16 PTECs, we studied the expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> in these three cohorts. Compared with WT/NT-day 6 PTECs, we observed a significant increase of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and a significant decrease of <italic>E2F1</italic> in WT-day 16 PTECs. In SETD2 KD-day 25 PTECs, the expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> was maintained at levels comparable to WT/NT-day 6 PTECs (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref><italic>B</italic>). These findings are consistent with a previous report showing that the expression of the <italic>E2F1</italic> was decreased in senescent cells, whereas <italic>E2F1</italic> overexpression enabled resistance to senescence in primary fibroblast cells <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, it appears that SETD2 knockdown prevents senescence in PTECs by maintaining the CDKN2A-E2F pathway. In the immortalized HEK293T cells, we observed decreased expression of both <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> as a result of SETD2-KD (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Figure&#160;5</xref>). Since the phosphorylation of RB is abolished as a result of the immortalization, the decreased expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> cannot activate E2Fs. The decreased expression level of E2F1 might be caused by the genome-wide absence of H3K36me3 in gene bodies.</p><p>To examine if <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation could reverse the senescent nature of PTECs at high passage number, &#946;-gal staining was performed on PTECs 6 days after transduction with lentiviral SETD2-shRNA at passage 6 (day 20). Although the majority of the cells were GFP&#160;+, they also stained positive for &#946;-gal (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Figure&#160;5</xref>), indicating that the senescent state could not be reverted upon SETD2 knockdown.</p><p>Our data show that <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation represents an escape of senescence mechanism of PTECs, in line with its tumor suppressor function in ccRCC. This is consistent with the proposed role of <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation in acute leukemia <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Senescence is a response that prevents proliferation of cells with DNA damage, and it serves as a barrier for malignant transformation <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We now show that <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation in PTECs bypasses the senescence barrier by maintaining CDKN2A-E2F signaling. Collectively, these studies emphasize the importance of the senescence-associated pathway in the development of ccRCC.</p><p>The major known consequence of SETD2 inactivation is loss of H3K36me3 on actively transcribed multiexon genes. This histone mark is recognized by so-called readers, most often by virtue of their PWWP domain <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These readers are important components of several cellular pathways that are linked to cancer. <italic>SETD2</italic> mutated ccRCC tumors and/or cell lines showed altered chromatin accessibility, resulting in widespread transcript processing defects <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This is consistent with the known regulatory role of H3K36me3 methylation on transcription regulation <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Loss of H3K36me3 in ccRCC prevented recruitment of the mutS homolog 6, which is essential for DNA mismatch repair <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and recruitment of Lens epithelium-derived growth factor, which is required for homologous recombination of DNA double-strand breaks <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Loss of H3K36me3 also hinders the recruitment of RAD51 to DNA damage sites, resulting in failure of the TP53-mediated DNA damage response <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A disrupted interaction of BRCA1 with RAD51 was shown to lead to microtubule organizing center amplification, causing chromosomal instability <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, it might be speculated that loss of SETD2 leads to accumulation of DNA damage. However, it remains unknown how SETD2 loss exactly prevents senescence in PTECS; most likely, the effect is modulated by <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, which is strongly induced upon senescence and prevents induction of E2Fs and their targets. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that another, undiscovered mode of action of SETD2 is responsible for the phenotype as observed upon SETD2-KD. Loss of a direct interaction of SETD2 with TP53 could play a role in this process <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The regulation of several TP53 downstream targets appeared to be dependent on its interaction with SETD2. Loss of <italic>puma</italic>, one of these targets, is suggested to prevent DNA-damage&#8211;induced apoptosis <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we demonstrate that functional loss of <italic>SETD2</italic> enables PTECs to bypass the senescence barrier by maintaining CDKN2A-E2F signaling. The prolonged proliferating potential might result in accumulation of DNA damage and thereby result in the development of ccRCC. Our results thus support a tumor suppressor role for <italic>SETD2</italic> in ccRCC, consistent with Knudson&#8217;s two-hit model.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><p>Supplementary Material and Methods.
