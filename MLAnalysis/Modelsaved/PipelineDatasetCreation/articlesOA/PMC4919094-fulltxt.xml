We obtain a predictor for running performance, a parsimonious model and a training state summary consisting of three numbers by application of modern validation techniques and recent advances in machine learning to the thepowerof10 database of British runners&#8217; performances (164,746 individuals, 1,417,432 performances). Our predictor achieves an average prediction error (out-of-sample) of e.g. 3.6 min on elite Marathon performances and 0.3 seconds on 100 metres performances, and a lower error than the state-of-the-art in performance prediction (30% improvement, RMSE) over a range of distances. We are also the first to report on a systematic comparison of predictors for running performance. Our model has three parameters per runner, and three components which are the same for all runners. The first component of the model corresponds to a power law with exponent dependent on the runner which achieves a better goodness-of-fit than known power laws in the study of running. Many documented phenomena in quantitative sports science, such as the form of scoring tables, the success of existing prediction methods including Riegel&#8217;s formula, the Purdy points scheme, the power law for world records performances and the broken power law for world record speeds may be explained on the basis of our findings in a unified way. We provide strong evidence that the three parameters per runner are related to physiological and behavioural parameters, such as training state, event specialization and age, which allows us to derive novel physiological hypotheses relating to athletic performance. We conjecture on this basis that our findings will be vital in exercise physiology, race planning, the study of aging and training regime design.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DE)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship in graduate school GRK 1589/1 &#8220;Sensory Computation in Neural Systems&#8221;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blythe</surname><given-names>Duncan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach</institution></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kir&#225;ly</surname><given-names>Franz J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>DAJB was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation, research training group GRK 1589/1 &#8220;Sensory Computation in Neural Systems.&#8221; FJK was partially supported by Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO).

Existing research on running performance focuses either on (A) explaining world records [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], (B) equivalent scoring [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or (C) modelling of individual physiology [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Currently, however, there is no parsimonious model which simultaneously explains individual physiology (C) and collective performance (A,B) of runners.</p><p>We present such a model, a non-linear low-rank model derived from a database of UK runners. It levers an individual power law which explains the power laws known to apply to world records, and which allows us to derive runner-individual training parameters from prior performance data. Performance predictions obtained using our approach are the most accurate to date, with an average prediction error of under 4 minutes (2% rel.MAE and 3% rel.RMSE out-of-sample) for elite performances. We anticipate that our framework will allow researchers to leverage existing insights in the study of world record performances and sports medicine for an improved understanding of human physiology.</p><p>Our work builds on the three major research strands in prediction and modeling of running performance, which we briefly summarize:</p><p><bold>(A) Power law models of performance</bold> posit a power law dependence <italic>t</italic> = <italic>c</italic> &#8901; <italic>s</italic><sup><italic>&#945;</italic></sup> between the time elapsed running <italic>t</italic> and the distance <italic>s</italic>, for constants <italic>c</italic> and <italic>&#945;</italic>. This is equivalent to assuming a linear dependence log <italic>t</italic> = <italic>&#945;</italic> log <italic>s</italic> + log <italic>c</italic> of log-time on log-distance. Power law models have been known to describe world record performances across sports for over a century [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and have been applied extensively to running performance [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These power laws have been applied to prediction by practitioners: the Riegel formula [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] predicts performance by fitting <italic>c</italic> to each runner and fixing <italic>&#945;</italic> = 1.06 (derived from world-record performances). The power law approach has the benefit of <italic>modelling</italic> performances in a scientifically parsimonious way.</p><p><bold>(B) Scoring tables</bold>, such as those of the international association of athletics federations (IAAF), render performances over disparate distances comparable by presenting them on a single scale. These tables have been published by sports associations for almost a century [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and catalogue, rather than model, performances of equivalent standard. Performance predictions may be obtained from scoring tables by forecasting a time with the same score as an existing attempt, as implemented in the Purdy Points scheme [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The scoring table approach has the benefit of <italic>describing</italic> performances in an empirically accurate way.</p><p><bold>(C) Explicit modeling of performance related physiology</bold> is an active subfield of sports science. Several physiological parameters are known to be related to athletic performance; these include maximal oxygen uptake (<inline-formula id="pone.0157257.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157257.e001.jpg" id="pone.0157257.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#729;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>-max) and critical speed (speed at <inline-formula id="pone.0157257.e002"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157257.e002.jpg" id="pone.0157257.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#729;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>-max) [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], blood lactate concentration, and the anaerobic threshold [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Physiological parameters may be used (C.i) to make direct predictions when clinical measurements are available [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], or (C.ii) to obtain theoretical models describing physiological processes [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These approaches have the benefit of <italic>explaining</italic> performances physiologically.</p><p>All three approaches (A), (B), (C) have appealing properties, as explained above, but none provides a complete treatment of running performance prediction: (A) individual performances do not follow the parsimonious power law perfectly; (B) the empirically accurate scoring tables do not provide a simple interpretable relationship. <italic>Neither</italic> (A) nor (B) can deal with the fact that runners may differ from one another in multiple ways. The clinical measurements in (C.i) are informative but usually available only for a few select runners, typically at most a few dozen (as opposed to the 164,746 considered in our study). The interpretable models in (C.ii) are usually designed not with the aim of predicting performance but to explain physiology or to estimate physiological parameters from performances; thus these methods are not directly applicable to running performance prediction without additional work.</p><p>The approach we present unifies the desirable properties of (A), (B) and (C), while avoiding the aforementioned shortcomings. We obtain (A) a parsimonious model for individual athletic performance that is (B) empirically derived from a large database of UK runners. It yields the best performance predictions to date (2% average error for elite runners on all events, average error 3.6 min for Marathon 0.3 seconds for 100 metres) and (C) unveils hidden descriptors for individuals which we find to be related to physiological and behavioural characteristics.</p><p>Our approach bases predictions on <italic>Local Matrix Completion</italic> (LMC), a machine learning technique which posits the existence of a small number of explanatory variables which describe the performance of individual runners. Application of LMC to a database of runners allows us, in a second step, to derive a parsimonious physiological model describing the running performance of <italic>individual</italic> runners. We discover that a <italic>three number-summary</italic> for each individual explains performance over the full range of distances from 100m to the Marathon. The three-number-summary relates to: (1) the endurance of a runner, (2) the relative balance between speed and endurance, and (3) specialization over middle distances. The first number explains most of the individual differences over distances greater than 800m, and may be interpreted as the exponent of <italic>an individual power law for each runner</italic>, which holds with remarkably high precision, on average. The other two numbers describe individual, non-linear corrections to this individual power law. Vitally, we show that the individual power law with its non-linear corrections reflects the data more accurately than the power law for world records. We anticipate that the individual power law and three-number summary will allow for exact quantitative assessment in the science of running and related sports.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Local Matrix Completion and the Low-Rank Model</title><p>It is well known that world records over distinct distances are held by distinct runners&#8212;no one single runner holds all running world records. Since world record data obey an approximate power law (see above), this implies that the individual performance of each runner deviates from this power law. The left top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157257.g001">Fig 1</xref> displays world records and the corresponding individual performances of world record holders in logarithmic coordinates&#8212;an exact power law would follow a straight line. The world records align closely to a straight line, while individuals deviate non-linearly. Notable is also the kink in the world records which causes them to deviate from an exact straight line, yielding a &#8220;broken power law&#8221; for world records [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0157257.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157257.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Central phenomenon: non-linear deviation from the power law in individuals.</title><p>Top left: performances of world record holders and a selection of random runners. Curves labelled by runners are their known best performances (y-axis) at that event (x-axis). Black crosses are world record performances. Individual performances deviate non-linearly from the world record power law. Top right: a good model should take into account specialization, illustration by example. Hypothetical performance curves of three runners, green, red and blue are shown, the task is to predict green on 1500m from all other performances. Dotted green lines are predictions. State-of-art methods such as Riegel or Purdy predict green performance on 1500m close to blue and red; a realistic predictor for 1500m performance of green&#8212;such as LMC&#8212;will predict that green is outperformed by red and blue on 1500m; since blue and red being worse on 400m indicates that out of the three runners, green specializes most on shorter distances. Bottom: using local matrix completion as a mathematical prediction principle by filling in an entry in a (3 &#215; 3) sub-pattern. Schematic illustration of the algorithm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157257.g001"/></fig><p>Any model for individual performances must model this individual, non-linear variation, and will, optimally, explain the broken power law observed for world records as an epiphenomenon of such variation over individuals. In the following paragraphs we explain how the LMC scheme captures individual variation in a typical scenario.</p><p>Consider three runners (taken from the database) as shown in the top-right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157257.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The 1500m performance of the green runner is not known and is to be predicted. All three runners, green, blue and red, achieve similar performance over 800m. Any classical method for performance prediction which only takes this information into account will predict that green performs similarly over 1500m to blue and red. However, this is unrealistic, since it does not take into account event specialization: looking at the 400m performance, we see that red is slowest over short distances, followed by blue and then by green. Thus red is more of an endurance type runner than blue, and blue is more of a speed type runner (sprinter) than red; green specializes to a greater extent in speed than both red and blue. Using this additional information leads to the more realistic prediction that green will be out-performed by red and blue over 1500m. Supplementary analysis (IV) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157257.s001">S1 Supplement</xref> validates that this phenomenon illustrated in the example is prevalent throughout the data set.</p><p>LMC is a quantitative method for taking into account this event specialization. A schematic overview of the simplest variant is displayed in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157257.g001">Fig 1</xref>: to predict an event for a runner (figure: 1500m for green) we find a 3-by-3-pattern of performances, denoted by <italic>A</italic>, with exactly one missing entry&#8212;this means the two other runners (figure: red and blue) have attempted similar events and their data are available. Explanation of the green runner&#8217;s curve by the red and the blue is mathematically modelled by demanding that the data of the green runner is given as a weighted sum of the data of the red and the blue; i.e., more mathematically, the green row is a linear combination of the blue and the red row. A classical result in matrix algebra implies that the green row is a linear combination of red and blue whenever the <italic>determinant</italic> of <italic>A</italic>, a polynomial function in the entries of <italic>A</italic>, vanishes; i.e., det(<italic>A</italic>) = 0.</p><p>A prediction is made by solving the Eq det(<italic>A</italic>) = 0 for &#8220;?&#8221;. To increase accuracy, candidate solutions from multiple 3-by-3-patterns (obtained from many triples of runners) are averaged in a way that minimizes the expected error in approximation. We shall consider variants of the algorithm which use <italic>n</italic>-by-<italic>n</italic>-patterns, <italic>n</italic> corresponding to the complexity of the model (we later show <italic>n</italic> = 4 to be optimal). See the methods appendix for an exact description of the algorithm used.</p><p>The LMC prediction scheme is an instance of the more general local low-rank matrix completion framework introduced in [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], here applied to performances in the form of a numerical table (or matrix) with columns corresponding to events and rows to runners. The cited framework is the first matrix completion algorithm which allows prediction of single missing entries as opposed to all entries. While matrix completion has proved vital in predicting consumer behaviour and recommender systems, the results in the present study show that existing approaches which predict all entries at once cannot cope with the non-uniform missingness and the noise associated with performance prediction in the same way as LMC can (see findings and supplemental analysis II.a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157257.s001">S1 Supplement</xref>). See the methods appendix for more details of the method and an exact description.</p><p>In a second step, we use the LMC scheme to fill in all missing performances (over all events considered&#8212;100m, 200m etc.) and obtain a parsimonious low-rank model&#8212;we remark that first filling in the entries with LMC and only then fitting the model is crucial due to the fact that data are non-uniformly missing (see supplemental analysis II.a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157257.s001">S1 Supplement</xref>).

Methods (3.a), (3.b) will return a result for any number of observed performances (including zero). Prediction accuracy is therefore measured by evaluating the RMSE and MAE out-of-sample on the runners who have attempted at least three distances, so that the two necessary performances remain to calculate the prediction when one is removed for leave-one-out validation. Prediction is further restricted to the best 95-percentile of runners (measured by performance in the best event) to reduce the effect of outliers. Whenever the method demands that the predicting events need to be specified, the events which are closest in log-distance to the event to be predicted are taken. The accuracy of predicting time (normalized w.r.t. the event mean), log-time, and speed are measured. We repeat this validation setup for the year of best performance and a random calendar year. Moreover, for completeness and comparison we treat 2 additional cases: the top 25% of runners and runners who have attempted at least 4 events, each in log time.

More precisely, we establish:</p><p><bold>The individual power law.</bold> In log-time coordinates, the first component of our physiological model is linear with high accuracy, yielding an individual power law (finding III). This is a novel and rather surprising finding, since, although world-record performances are known to obey a power law [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], there is no reason to suppose <italic>a-priori</italic> that the performance of individuals is governed by a power law. Striking is that the power-law derived is considerably more accurate when considered in log-distance&#8212;log-speed coordinates than the power-law which applies to world-record data. This <italic>parsimony a-posteriori</italic> unifies (A) the parsimony of the power law with the (B) empirical correctness of scoring tables. To what extent this individual power law is exact is to be determined in future studies.</p><p><bold>An explanation of the world record data.</bold> The broken power law [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] of world record data can be seen as a consequence of the individual power law and the non-linearity in the second and third component (finding III) of our low-rank model. The breakage point in the world records can be explained by the differing contributions in the non-linear components of the distinct individuals holding the world records. Savaglio and Carbone [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] hypothesize that the breakpoint in the log-speed&#8212;log-distance slope of world-record data, which occurs between short and long distance events, is due to a transition in the physiology required between short and long-distance events. Our analyses indeed show that their exist breakpoints, manifested in the second and third components of the low-rank model. However our findings show that the claim that there is a universal physiological transition manifesting itself in the differing slopes of short and long-distance world-record data is unwarranted. Runners who exhibit small values for the 2nd and 3rd numbers in their three number summaries will exhibit performances close to log-log with little or no transition; this is because the first component of the model is much closer to scale-free (log-log straight line) than world-record data. Some runners will indeed display an upward kink in their average speed as is the case with world-record data. Other runners will exhibit transitions corresponding to a quicker fall off in average speed rather than faster, i.e. a downwards kink. Thus the validity of the three component model points to a far more complex description and diversity of average speed than world record data suggest.</p><p>Crucially both <italic>the power law and the broken power law on world record data can be understood as epiphenomena of the individual power law and its non-linear corrections</italic>.</p><p><bold>Universality of our model.</bold> The low-rank model remains unchanged when considering different subgroups of runners, stratified by gender, age, or calendar year; only the individual three-number-summaries change (finding VI). This shows the low-rank model to be universal for running.</p><p><bold>The three-number-summary reflects a runner&#8217;s training state.</bold> Our predictive validation implies that the number of components of our model is three (finding II), which yields three numbers describing the training state of a given runner (finding IV). The most important summary is <italic>the individual exponent</italic> for the individual power law which describes overall performances for distances longer than 400m (IV.iii). The second coefficient describes whether the runner has greater endurance (positive) or speed (negative) and predicts performances over the sprint distances, the third describes specialization over middle distances (negative) vs. short and long distances (positive). All three numbers together clearly separate the runners into four clusters, which fall into two clusters of short-distance runners and one cluster of middle-and long-distance runners respectively (IV.i). Our analysis provides strong evidence that the three-number-summary captures physiological and/or social/behavioural characteristics of the runners, e.g., training state, specialization, and which distance a runner chooses to attempt. While the data set does not allow us to separate these potential influences or to make statements about cause and effect, we conjecture that combining the three-number-summary with specific experimental paradigms will lead to a clarification; further, we conjecture that a combination of the three-number-summary with additional data, e.g. training logs, high-frequency training measurements or clinical parameters, will lead to a better understanding of (C) existing physiological models.</p><p>Some novel physiological insights can be deduced from leveraging our model on the UK runners database:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We find that the individual exponent correlates with performances over distances greater than 400m and especially long distances above 5km (finding III). We also find that LMC is most effective for the longer-sprints and middle distances; the improvement of the higher rank over the rank 1 version is lowest over the marathon distance (supplemental analysis I.c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157257.s001">S1 Supplement</xref>). This indicates that the variability in performances on long distances may to a large extent be explained by a single factor, which may imply that there is <bold>only one way to be a fast marathoner</bold>. On the other hand since we find that the rank-2 and 3 versions far outperform the rank-1 version over middle distances, this may be interpreted in terms of some runners using a high maximum velocity to coast whereas other runners using greater endurance to run closer to their maximum speed for the duration of the race; if the type of running (coasting vs. endurance) is a physiological correlate to the specialization summary (as hypothesized above), it could imply that the &#8220;one way&#8221; corresponds to possessing a high level of endurance&#8212;as opposed to being able to coast relative to a high maximum speed. In any case, the low-rank model predicts that a marathoner who is not close to world class over 10km is unlikely to be a world class marathoner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <bold>phase transitions</bold> which we observe (finding V) provide additional observational evidence for a transition in the complexity of the physiology underlying performance between long and short distances. This finding is bolstered by the difference we observe between the increase in performance of the rank 2 predictor over the rank 1 predictor for short/middle distances over long distances. Notice, however, that this is quite different evidence than the kink in the power-law of world-record speeds [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which we argued above does not necessarily imply the presence of transitions at the level of the individual runner. Our results may have implications for existing hypotheses and findings in sports science on the differences in physiological determinants of long and short distance running respectively. These include differences in the muscle fibre types contributing to performance (type I vs. type II) [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], whether the race length demands energy primarily from aerobic or anaerobic metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which energy systems are mobilized (glycolysis vs. lipolysis) [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and whether the race terminates before the onset of a <inline-formula id="pone.0157257.e004"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157257.e004.jpg" id="pone.0157257.e004g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#729;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> slow component [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157257.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We conjecture that the combination of our methodology with experiments will shed further light on these differences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An open question in the physiology of aging is whether sprinting power or endurance capabilities diminish faster with age. Our analysis provides cross-sectional evidence that <bold>training standard decreases with age, and specialization shifts away from endurance</bold>: a larger exponent is correlated with worse performance on endurance type events (finding IV.i), and exponents increase, in cross-section, with age (finding IV.iv). This confirms observations of Rittweger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157257.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] on masters world-record data. There are multiple possible explanations for this, for example longitudinal changes in specialization, or selection bias due to the distances older runners prefer; our model renders these hypotheses amenable to quantitative validation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We find that there are a number of <bold>high-standard runners who attempt distances different from their inferred best distance</bold>; most notably a cluster of young runners (&lt;25 yrs.) who run short distances (mostly in accordance with legal limitations of participation), and a cluster of older runners (&gt;40 yrs.) who run long distances, but who we predict would perform better on longer resp. shorter distances. Moreover, the third component of our model implies the existence of <bold>runners with very strong specialization in their best event</bold>; there are indeed high profile examples of such runners, such as Zersenay Tadese, who holds the half-marathon world best performance (58:23) but has as yet to produce a marathon performance even close to this in quality (best performance, 2:10:41).</p></list-item></list></p><p>We also anticipate that our framework will prove fruitful in <bold>equipping the practioner with new methods for prediction and quantification</bold>:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Individual predictions are crucial in <bold>race planning</bold>, especially for predicting a target performance for events such as the Marathon for which months of preparation are needed; the ability to accurately select a realistic target speed could potentially make the difference between a runner achieving a personal best performance and &#8220;hitting the wall&#8221; or at worst dropping out of the race from exhaustion.</p><p><bold>N.B.:</bold>
<italic>We would like to stress that using a prediction as part of marathon preparation without professional support may lead to injury and is entirely at the risk of the user.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Predictions and the three-number-summary yield a concise description of the runner&#8217;s specialization and training state and are thus of immediate use in <bold>training assessment and planning</bold>, for example in determining the potential effect of a training scheme or finding the optimal event(s) for which to train.</p><p><bold>N.B.:</bold>
<italic>We would like to stress that our study is not able to assign a conclusive meaning to the three-number summary, due to the limitations of the data set; therefore decisions should not be based on a hypothesized interpretation without consideration.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>The presented framework allows, in principle, for the derivation of novel and more accurate <bold>scoring schemes</bold>, including scoring tables for any type of population.</p><p><bold>N.B.:</bold>
<italic>We would like to stress that the form of the derived scoring tables may depend on the selection of the data from which they are derived.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Predictions for elite runners allow for a more precise <bold>estimation of quotas and betting risk</bold>. For example, we predict that a fair race between Mo Farah and Usain Bolt is over 492m (374-594m with 95% confidence), Chris Lemaitre and Adam Gemili have the calibre to run 43.5 (&#177;1.3) and 43.2 (&#177;1.3) resp. seconds over 400m. Kenenisa Bekele is capable, in a training state where he can achieve his personal bests over 5km, 10km and the half-marathon, of a 2:00:36 marathon (&#177;3.6 mins).</p><p><bold>N.B.:</bold>
<italic>We would like to stress that such predictions need to be taken with much caution, as they are only correct insofar as our model extends, from the top 25% of UK runners (who successfully participated in official events), to the very extremes of human performance.</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p>We further conjecture that the physiological laws we have validated for running will be immediately transferable to any sport where a power law has been observed on the collective level, such as swimming, cycling, and horse racing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec007"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157257.s001"><label>S1 Supplement</label><caption><title>Additional analyses and method details with corresponding figures and tables.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157257.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>DAJB was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation, research training group GRK 1589/1 &#8220;Sensory Computation in Neural Systems&#8221;.
