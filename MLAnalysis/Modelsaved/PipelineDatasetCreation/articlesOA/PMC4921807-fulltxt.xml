For 1,168 proteins, the majority of all expressed proteins, molecule numbers per cell have been determined to monitor the cellular investments in single branches of bacterial life for the first time. In the presence of glucose the anaerobic protein pattern is characterized by increased amounts of glycolytic and fermentative enzymes such as Eno, GapA1, Ldh1, and PflB. Interestingly, the ferritin-like protein FtnA belongs to the most abundant proteins during anaerobic growth. Depletion of glucose finally leads to an accumulation of different enzymes such as ArcB1, ArcB2, and ArcC2 involved in arginine deiminase pathway. Concentrations of 29 exo- and 78 endometabolites were comparatively assessed and have been integrated to the metabolic networks. Here we provide an almost complete picture on the response to oxygen starvation, from signal transduction pathways to gene expression pattern, from metabolic reorganization after oxygen depletion to beginning cell death and lysis after glucose exhaustion. This experimental approach can be considered as a proof of principle how to combine cell physiology with quantitative proteomics for a new dimension in understanding simple life processes as an entity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The publication of the first entire genome sequence of the bacterium <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> in 1995 marked a turning point in life sciences because it provided the first blueprint of a self-replicating (micro)organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Since then the genome sequences of thousands of organisms including humans have been published. It turned out, however, that genome sequencing is only the first step on the way to a comprehensive understanding of cellular functions on molecular level. In the second step functional genomics is required to translate this blueprint of virtual life into real cellular physiology. Within the ensemble of OMICs techniques proteomics holds a privileged position because proteins execute and regulate most cellular functions in all organisms. Metabolite data, in turn, provide a readout of the function and activity of proteins. Because of their low complexity, bacteria are particularly suited to study this translation of the genome sequence into real life processes since the protein inventory of a bacterial cell consists of only a few hundreds up to a few thousands of proteins which can be efficiently handled by current proteomics techniques.</p><p>To provide the protein inventory of an organism is not only one of the important achievements of life sciences in the post genomic era but also the next crucial step after genome sequencing on the long way from the genome sequence to comprehension of cell function. Meanwhile the majority of proteins synthesized in bacteria are identified for model microorganisms such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Becher and co-workers identified the greater part of proteins synthesized in exponentially growing and glucose-starved cells of <italic>S. aureus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> was selected as a model in this study, too, because of its medical importance, which is illustrated by the broad range of infections that are caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and that are increasingly refractory to treatment because of the multiple resistant clones.</p><p>Here, we provide absolute quantitative protein data to monitor the dynamics of the protein inventory of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to an infection-related stimulus. This can be considered as a new and promising approach to understand <italic>S. aureus</italic>&#8217; pathophysiology and infection biology. Absolute protein quantification is crucial to obtain a real mass balance of what is going on in the cell in response to external stimuli such as stress and starvation. In the past years mass spectrometry based methods have been developed for absolute protein quantification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Combinations of different approaches were established for the determination of protein amounts on a global scale for model bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Protein identification rates and sequence coverage were improved with the introduction of data-independent acquisition methods such as LC-MS<sup>E&#8201;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Complemented with the Hi3 absolute quantification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> even more comprehensive quantitative data sets can be generated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, there are only very few studies that combine the dynamics of the entire protein inventory with interpretation of basic physiological processes aiming at the understanding of cell physiology as an entity, the main goal of this study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In contrast, numerous studies focus on <italic>S. aureus</italic> regarding pathogenicity and virulence factors such as adhesins and invasins, toxins, superantigens, immune evasion proteins, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. But only limited information is available on basic cellular physiology compared to well-known model organisms such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The survival and persistence in the human host is mainly dependent on the physiological fitness including the adaptation to stress and starvation stimuli.</p><p>In 2007 we studied the immediate reactions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> COL to oxygen starvation on transcriptomic and protein synthesis level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition to DNA array techniques radioactive pulse-labeling of proteins was used to visualize early changes in the gene expression patterns immediately after the transition to oxygen starvation. However, the number of protein molecules that execute cell functions as well as the adaptation to prolonged anaerobic periods was not yet considered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>In this study we analyzed the dynamics of the protein inventory during long-term adaptation to oxygen starvation with the focus on quantitative proteomics. When invading different host tissues, <italic>S. aureus</italic> encounters low oxygen levels as one of the most important growth-limiting factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Thus, the observed adaptation strategies are crucial for <italic>S. aureus</italic> because oxygen limitation is one of the dominating stimuli in many infection-related settings. Using a combination of ion mobility LC-MS<sup>E</sup> (LC-IMS<sup>E</sup>) and Hi3 quantification, protein copy numbers of 1,168 cytosolic proteins were determined and complemented with concentrations of extra- and intracellular metabolites to provide a complete picture on the physiology of this long-term adaptation process. This is one of the first studies linking absolute protein amounts to crucial adaptational and physiological processes of a pathogenic microorganism. Thus, at least 1,200,000 cytoplasmic protein molecules represent the machinery of life in a single <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell with a volume of 320 attolitre in average. Quantitative Voronoi treemaps were used for visualization of the cellular investment in proteins involved in fundamental processes of life under oxygen limitation. Our experimental approach can be regarded as a proof of principle study that illustrates how quantitative proteomics and metabolome data can be integrated to come to a new dimension in understanding simple life processes as an entity. Such studies may thus pave the way towards a higher quality in understanding pathophysiology, opening new avenues for infection-related research on this and other crucial pathogens.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Three different physiological states can be defined by the availability of oxygen and glucose</title><p><italic>S. aureus</italic> was first cultivated in the presence of oxygen and high levels of glucose (7.2&#8201;mM). At mid-exponential growth phase (OD<sub>500</sub>&#8201;<sub>nm</sub> 0.5) cells were shifted to anaerobic conditions and cultivated for further 24&#8201;hours. During aerobic cultivation <italic>S. aureus</italic> was exponentially growing with a growth rate [&#956;] of 0.207&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). As expected, growth rate significantly dropped after oxygen depletion (&#956;&#8201;=&#8201;0.049&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Interestingly, cells were not able to use alternative energy sources such as amino acids after exhaustion of glucose and, thus, started dying as determined by a clear decrease of CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>Thus, at least three main growth phases have been considered by our experimental setup: (i.) exponential growth in the presence of oxygen and glucose (0&#8211;t<sub>0</sub>), (ii.) slow growth in the absence of oxygen and presence of glucose (t<sub>1</sub>&#8211;t<sub>13</sub>), and (iii.) cessation of growth, cell death and lysis in the absence of oxygen and glucose (t<sub>13</sub>&#8211;t<sub>24</sub>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The dynamics of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> proteome and metabolome in response to oxygen and glucose starvation</title><p>In total, 1,390 proteins have been identified in at least two biological replicates at one or more time points of the growth curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). This includes 222 non-cytoplasmic proteins (mainly membrane-bound and -associated proteins) which have been excluded from further analyses since these mainly hydrophobic proteins cannot be completely recovered by the applied approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Absolute protein concentrations have been used to calculate molecule numbers per cell for 1,168 cytosolic proteins which corresponds to 64% of the cytosolic <italic>S. aureus</italic> proteome predicted by LocateP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The real coverage is even higher considering that not all <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes are expressed during the conditions analyzed. The dynamic range covering proteins present in thousands or only few copies per cell is remarkably high (for example: 20,000 molecules per cell of GapA1 and 20 molecules per cell of ArcB1 under anaerobic conditions). Additionally, concentrations of intra- and extracellular metabolites were determined using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, GC/MS and LC/MS. In total, time-resolved concentration profiles of 29 extracellular and 78 intracellular metabolites have been integrated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vegetative proteins dominate the cytoplasmic proteome during phase I (aerobic growth in the presence of glucose)</title><p>In total, 996 cytosolic proteins were quantified when both, glucose and oxygen, are available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Based on these data about 1,200,000 protein molecules are packed into only 0.32&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup> of an exponentially growing <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). With 190,000 copies per cell (16%) the 53 identified ribosomal proteins account for the largest proportion followed by proteins involved in amino acid metabolism (114,000 copies per cell; 10%), glycolysis (83,000 copies per cell; 7%), protein folding, repair and degradation (52,000 copies per cell; 4%), and TCA cycle (15,000 copies per cell; 1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, only three (alanine, serine, and aspartate) of the 15 amino acids provided were consumed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> during exponential growth in significant quantities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). This closely correlates with the high amount of enzymes involved in the conversion of these amino acids to lysine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, glycine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine (98,500 molecules per cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of oxygen and high levels of glucose, glycolytic enzymes belong to the highest abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) which allow rapid degradation of glucose (0.34&#8201;&#956;M&#8201;&#215;&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;&#215;&#8201;&#916;cell number<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) indicating that a significant part of the ATP is provided by substrate phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Interestingly, enzymes of the preparatory part of glycolysis (Glk, Pgi, PfkA, Fba) are present in lower amounts compared to enzymes employed in the pyruvate converting branch (TpiA, GapA1, Pgk, Pgm, Eno, Pyk) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This correlates well with the number of molecules channeled through the respective branches (preparatory phase: 1x C<sub>6</sub>; pyruvate converting reactions: 2x C<sub>3</sub>).</p><p>The high level of glucose used in this study prevents their complete oxidation and triggers down-regulation of the TCA cycle enzymes (<italic>Crabtree effect</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Pyruvate is converted to overflow metabolites (mainly acetate) which is secreted into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Involved enzymes are present in high numbers (phosphate acetyltransferase Pta: 4,800 copies per cell; acetate kinase AckA: 1,100 copies per cell). At the end of phase I 1.65&#8201;mM acetate has been secreted by <italic>S. aureus</italic> which corresponds to 62% of glucose degraded in this time span (1.34&#8201;mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the central metabolic pathways <italic>S. aureus</italic> invests mainly in proteins for growth and reproduction such as DNA metabolism, transcription, and translation during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). For instance, with 17,500 copies the translational factor Tuf is one of the most abundant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The protein inventory is completely reorganized in response to oxygen starvation as long as glucose is available (phase II)</title><p>Depletion of oxygen induced a major reorganization of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). To follow these changes more easily, an animated and zoomable movie has been created based on Voronoi Treemaps ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.protecs.uni-greifswald.de/bionic-vis/timeline/costsoflife.html">http://www.protecs.uni-greifswald.de/bionic-vis/timeline/costsoflife.html</ext-link>). As expected, production of glycolytic enzymes was increased even further despite the high level already present in phase I (for example: enolase increased from 12,100 to 14,500 or GapA1 from 16,100 to 19,600 molecules per cell; Fig. S2). This was accompanied by a strong increase in level of fermentation enzymes. With up to 11,300 copies per cell the lactate dehydrogenase Ldh1 is by far the most abundant fermentation enzyme even during long-lasting anaerobiosis. Ldh2 and the D-lactate producing LdhD (SACOL2535) are also produced in higher amounts after oxygen starvation but only to a level of 2,100 and 3,300 molecules per cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). In accordance lactate was measured as the main fermentation product of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and is strongly accumulating within the cells (up to 350&#8201;nmol/mg CDW) as well as secreted in high amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, lactate is mainly responsible for the significant decrease of extracellular pH from 6.8 to 5.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additional fermentation products (ethanol, acetate, formate, 2,3-butanediol) were secreted only in very little amounts which is in accordance with the low level of respective fermentation enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Pyruvate formate lyase PflB was newly detectable, but only up to 1,800 copies per cell. Other enzymes involved in mixed acid or alternative fermentation pathways were also present in low amounts (AdhE: 300 copies per cell; BudA1 and BudB: less than 100 copies per cell each). The only exceptions were the alcohol dehydrogenase Adh1 (6,000 copies per cell) and the acetoin reductase SACOL0111 (5,000 copies per cell). Our metabolic data indicate that SACOL0111 is responsible for re-utilization of acetoin secreted in phase I. By this acetoin can be converted to 2,3-butanediol which regenerates an additional NAD<sup>+</sup>. Accordingly, a decrease of extracellular concentrations of acetoin and an increase of 2,3-butanediol have been observed within the first three hours of anaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).</p><p>However, it is still a matter of debate why <italic>S. aureus</italic> prefers lactate fermentation even if the mixed acid fermentation would provide an additional ATP per molecule glucose. Lactate dehydrogenases compete with other fermentation enzymes for pyruvate and NADH+H<sup>+</sup>. As shown here, Ldh1 is by far the most abundant fermentation enzyme in anaerobic <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells. This might be the major factor determining the pyruvate flux under anaerobic conditions as shown for <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, activity of PflB is needed because it is essential to supply formate for metabolic processes such as the purine and protein biosynthesis under anaerobic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>Our data suggest that Ldh1 plays anaerobically the central role in maintaining the redox balance in <italic>S. aureus</italic> at least under glucose excess. Mixed acid fermentation may become important when glucose becomes limited or during growth on alternative carbon sources.</p><p>In the absence of oxygen (and alternative electron acceptors) and the presence of glucose ATP generation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is restricted to the level of substrate phosphorylation during glycolysis (<italic>Pasteur effect</italic>) explaining the further increase in glycolytic activity under fermentation conditions (consumption of up to 0.56&#8201;&#956;M glucose&#8201;&#215;&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;&#215;&#8201;&#916;cell number<sup>&#8722;1</sup>; 165% compared to phase I) compared to the already high level of <italic>S. aureus</italic> growing aerobically with glucose excess. Increased flux through glycolysis ensures maintenance of the cellular energy charge within the physiological range of 0.80 to 0.95<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> even after several hours of anaerobiosis as long as glucose is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Most interestingly, with the exception of ATP intracellular concentration of nucleotide triphosphate pools (UTP, GTP, and CTP) dropped under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Oxygen depletion has also a significant impact on the consumption of available amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Alanine was no longer consumed under anaerobic conditions, but was even secreted as fermentation product (in very small amounts). This might be an indication of pyruvate conversion to alanine which recycles one molecule NADH+H<sup>+</sup> to NAD<sup>+</sup>. The involved alanine dehydrogenase Ald1 was only accumulating after oxygen depletion (1,400 copies per cell; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Additionally, serine and threonine were degraded anaerobically in high amounts, while isoleucine and lysine were taken up in lower amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).

Without oxygen the lack of glucose could not be compensated and the energy charge dropped to 0.4 to 0.6.

Accordingly, intracellular levels of NADH+H<sup>+</sup> increased significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Gluconeogenetic enzymes were produced only in low amounts (for example: 300 PckA copies per cell; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) indicating that the energetic situation did not allow sufficient investment in gluconeogenesis that would be urgently required for sustaining life processes under these conditions.

The level of these enzymes, however, was extremely low (only 20 to 200 copies per cell; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6; Supplementary Data 1</xref>), probably because of the low energy charge. In the absence of oxygen and glucose <italic>S. aureus</italic> can use arginine as an energy source to generate ornithine, ammonia, carbon dioxide and 1&#8201;mol ATP per mol arginine by the deiminase. Indeed, a slight increase of intracellular and extracellular ornithine has been observed when glucose is exhausted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S6; Supplementary Data 2</xref>). A strong induction of the deiminase pathway as observed in rich media<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> failed in the nutrient-reduced synthetic medium used in this study. Thus, ATP produced by the arginine deiminase pathway, probably one of the main ATP sources in the absence of glucose, is not sufficient to keep the energy charge in <italic>S. aureus</italic> high enough to prevent cell death and lysis under the tested conditions. As a consequence of the low energy charge overall protein synthesis measured by L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation nearly stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p>Thus, energy limitation might be the major factor for loss of viability and the missing fermentative and gluconeogenetic activity just a consequence under the tested conditions.</p><p>It has been previously described that in glucose starved cells vegetative proteins no longer active in the non-growing state are strongly degraded if oxygen is available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.

Many functionally so far uncharacterized proteins can be found in group 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) indicating a function in the adaptation to oxygen starvation. One of the ten most abundant proteins under anaerobic conditions is SACOL1952 (FtnA) whose amount steadily increased from 5,000 copies per cell in phase I to 14,500 and 42,700 copies in phase II and III, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). This protein belongs to the ferritin protein family, which is composed of 24 identical subunits and serves as iron storage and provides intracellular iron reserves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Expression of <italic>SACOL1952</italic> is regulated by PerR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and by the cellular iron level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The calculated number of SACOL1952 molecules and the subunit composition suggests the formation of about 1,800 ferritin complexes after 24&#8201;h of anaerobiosis. We suggest that the Fe solubility in the medium increased under anaerobic conditions at acid pH (shift from Fe(III) to Fe(II)) leading to a strong increase in Fe uptake followed by induction of <italic>SACOL1952</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, the expression of other PerR-regulated genes were downregulated which includes genes encoding for the assembly of Fe-S-clusters (<italic>sufC</italic>, <italic>sufD</italic>, <italic>sufS</italic>, <italic>SACOL0917</italic>, <italic>sufB</italic>) no longer synthesized after shift to anaerobic conditions. The stoichiometry of the SufBCD complex is determined as 1:2:1 for <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. A similar stoichiometry of the Fe-S-cluster assembly proteins was calculated for <italic>S. aureus</italic> COL. The stoichiometries of other protein complexes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> could be determined as well by our approach for absolute protein quantification and are in good agreement with published data from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Despite the low energy charge <italic>S. aureus</italic> still synthesized proteins in phase III. One of these proteins is the azoreductase AzoR which might probably be involved in the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Although, it is one of the prominent proteins in phase III, the copy number only increased from about 700 copies in phase II to 4,000 in phase III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).</p><p>Another protein with strongly increased levels during oxygen starvation was ClpL (SACOL2563; from 1,100 to 4,000 molecules per cell) but the level of ClpX decreased at the same time (from 1,900 to 900). The function of ClpL in response to oxygen starvation is still a matter of debate and has to be analyzed in follow up-studies.</p><p>Notably, the production of the universal stress protein UspA (SACOL1759) was strongly increased in oxygen-starved and even more in oxygen/glucose-starved cells (from 4,800 copies per cell in t<sub>0</sub> to 7,800 in phase II and 30,200 in phase III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).

In total, 57 transcriptional factors and response regulators have been identified and quantified in this study. As one would expect, molecule numbers of regulators of gene expression showed a positive correlation with regulon size of the respective regulator. For instance, CodY and CcpA were among the most abundant transcriptional factors during aerobic growth with 1,900 and 1,300 molecules per cell, respectively. Both control large regulons of approximately 100 and 60 operons, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Notably, the MarR-type transcriptional regulator MgrA was in our study the most abundant regulator (2,600 molecules per cell; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). MgrA is a global regulator that controls expression of about 350 target genes, among them genes that encode for virulence factors, autolysis and capsule production. Moreover, it regulates the expression of efflux transporters that lead to an increased resistance to antibiotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. A strong level increase in response to oxygen starvation was found for CodY, YycF, SACOL1541, PyrR, SrrA, and SaeR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Regulators controlling only small regulons were found only in low amounts. For instance, CtsR controlling only five operons is present only in 50 to 100 copies per cell. The regulator GraR (SACOL0716) that regulates the expression of about 30 genes was present with 50 copies per cell in phase I.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Costs of life - Comparative assessment of cellular investments in the protein inventory during the different physiological states</title><p>Combining the changes of molecules per cell between two time points with the specific molecular weight the cumulative cellular investment in the respective protein species can be estimated. As expected, exponentially growing cells invested mainly in proteins involved in energy metabolism (24%) and protein synthesis (22%), but also in gene expression including transcription, translation, protein fate and quality control, and many others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>).

Investment in proteins involved in glycolysis (Pyk, Pgk, TpiA, Pgm) and fermentation (Ldh1, PflB, Adh1, Ald1) had highest priority indicating that generation of ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup> are the growth limiting processes during the early stage of anaerobic adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). After glucose exhaustion cells are not able to compensate the lack of energy. Investment in ribosomal proteins reaches a new minimum of 4.7% (8.3% during exponential growth at t<sub>0</sub>). Most resources were used by <italic>S. aureus</italic> in this phase to maintain the anaerobic energy metabolism (18%). However, investment calculations in this phase are prone to more uncertainty because of partial cell death and lysis.</p><p>Our results show that the presentation of the entire proteome and its dynamics in relation to environmental changes is the next crucial step after genome sequencing towards the understanding of life processes as an entity.

Furthermore, our integrated and quantitative Multi-OMICS approach may serve as a starting point for a systems biology application and consideration in near future. With the identification of the protein inventory of a cell, however, we are just at the beginning of a long way towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of simple life. The next step that follows is to understand how the hundreds of different protein molecules released from the ribosome organize life of a bacterial cell. Right after their emergence from the ribosome tunnel, they find their partners and their final destination, organize huge protein networks, they are modified, damaged by external stimuli, protected or repaired and in hopeless cases or in cases of &#8220;unemployment&#8221; degraded. To understand this dynamics of the protein fate from birth at the ribosome to death at the proteomics scale belongs to the greatest challenges for future research from bacteria to men. Quite clearly, <italic>S. aureus</italic> appears to be an excellent model system to tackle this crucial question of life sciences.
