In sub-Saharan Africa, HLA-B*57, HLA-B*58:01, and HLA-B*81:01 are protective against disease progression, while HLA-B*18:01 and HLA-B*58:02 are associated with rapid progression [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="JIW093C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One contributory factor is the role of HLA molecules in presenting particular epitopes to induce CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against HIV-1. Gag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses are associated with lower viremia levels and are dominant in people with protective HLA alleles, such as HLA-B*57:03 [<xref rid="JIW093C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, disease-susceptible HLA alleles, such as HLA-B*58:02, typically present relatively ineffective non-Gag responses [<xref rid="JIW093C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] associated with high viral set points [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This prompts the hypothesis that a successful vaccine might induce Gag-specific responses in subjects who would not target this protein in natural infection.</p><p>Two recent randomized efficacy trials of the MRKAd5 subtype B HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef T-cell vaccine provide a unique opportunity to address this hypothesis [<xref rid="JIW093C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The first study, Step, was conducted in the Americas, Australia, and the Caribbean, where HIV-1 subtype B predominates [<xref rid="JIW093C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both interim and follow-up analyses reported vaccine-enhanced HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="JIW093C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The second trial, Phambili, tested the efficacy of the same vaccine in South Africa, where HIV-1 subtype C is endemic [<xref rid="JIW093C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Following Step discontinuation, Phambili was terminated 9 months into the study, having enrolled 801 subjects (27%) of the originally scheduled 3000 [<xref rid="JIW093C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As in Step, the vaccine increased the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and did not reduce viremia levels in early infection [<xref rid="JIW093C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Post hoc Step studies, however, demonstrated lower viremia levels in vaccinees with a greater breadth of Gag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activity [<xref rid="JIW093C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], consistent with the notion of Gag-specific efficacy, but also suggested the possibility of lower viral loads in vaccinees expressing protective HLA alleles [<xref rid="JIW093C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To examine this question in a population substantially dissimilar in the HLA alleles expressed from that studied in Step, we here tested in the South African Phambili cohort the hypothesis that the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine might indeed have an HLA-specific effect.</p><p>Specifically, we hypothesized that subjects expressing HLA-B*58:02, the most prevalent HLA-B allele in South Africans [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], might benefit from the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine. The rationale was that the HLA-B*58:02&#8211;restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response is solely Env specific and, therefore, associated with poor immune control [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; HLA-B*58:02 indeed is strongly associated with rapid HIV-1 disease progression in southern Africa [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, vaccine-mediated induction of Gag-specific responses in subjects expressing HLA-B*58:02 would, hypothetically, improve disease course in vaccinees who subsequently became HIV-1 infected. HLA-B*18:01, also strongly associated with rapid progression [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], restricts a dominant CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope in Nef [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although Nef-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses have also been associated with poor control of HIV-1 [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="JIW093C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the immunodominance of the HLA-B*18:01&#8211;restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response might be unaffected by the MRKAd5 HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine.</p><p>We set out, therefore, to investigate the impact of the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine in the Phambili trial, particularly on the HLA-B*58:02&#8211;expressing individuals, to determine whether immune control of HIV-1 was improved in vaccinees who subsequently became infected. This study has limitations that we wish to highlight, including postrandomization bias, sample selection bias, and low subject numbers (see Discussion), but it provides potentially important insights into HLA-dependent vaccine effects on the postinfection disease course and immune response to HIV-1.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>The Phambili Ancillary Study included 100 HIV-1&#8211;infected Phambili participants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw093/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>).

For the remaining 40 individuals, no PBMC were available to assess CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, and thus only selected viral load and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count data were included in additional analyses; material for HLA typing was available for 25 participants. Subjects were categorized as having protective HLA-B expression (HLA-B*57:02/57:03/58:01/81:01); disease-susceptible HLA-B expression (HLA-B*18:01/58:02), and neither protective nor disease-susceptible HLA-B expression (eg, HLA-B*42:01/44:03) [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For the most prevalent HLA-B allele, HLA-B*58:02 (phenotypic frequency, 23%), there were sufficient subject numbers to compare vaccinees (n = 7) to placebo recipients (n = 7). All participants provided written informed consent; ethics committee at each clinical site and the University of Oxford approved the study.

Half of the Step trial participants who subsequently became infected were white, whereas none of the Phambili cohort was white. Expression of HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-B*42:01, HLA-B*58:02, and HLA-B*81:01, for example, is observed in 0% of white individuals [<xref rid="JIW093C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and in 20%, 23%, and 10%, respectively, of Black South Africans [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The principal finding in the current study is an HLA-specific vaccine effect in subjects expressing the disease-susceptible HLA-B*58:02. HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive vaccinees had a significantly lower viral set point and progressed more slowly to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &lt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, compared with HLA-matched placebo recipients. This result was associated with an increased breadth and magnitude of Gag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in vaccinees expressing HLA-B*58:02. In contrast, in Phambili subjects expressing neither protective nor disease-susceptible alleles, these vaccine effects were not observed.</p><p>The described HLA-specific vaccine effect was suggested in the Step study in relation to the protective HLA-B*27:05/B*57:01/B*58:01 [<xref rid="JIW093C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The 17-fold reduction in viral set point in HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive vaccinees observed here equates to a &gt;5-year AIDS-free period without ART and a &gt;2-fold reduction in onward transmission risk [<xref rid="JIW093C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Second, HLA-B*58:02 is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (20%&#8211;25% of South Africans) [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, a vaccine effect on postinfection disease progression in subjects expressing protective HLA-B*57/58:01/81:01 (24% of South Africans [<xref rid="JIW093C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) and in those expressing HLA-B*58:02 would favorably affect disease course in approximately half of the population.</p><p>The HLA-B*58:02&#8211;specific effect observed supports the original hypothesis. HLA-B*58:02&#8211;restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses are almost exclusively directed against Env, which is associated with a high viral load [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIW093F5">5</xref>). The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine might therefore be expected to improve outcome by boosting beneficial Gag responses [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A 70-fold higher magnitude and a 4&#8211;5-fold greater breadth of Gag-specific responses were observed in HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive vaccine recipients, but the necessary samples were unavailable to determine whether these were restricted by HLA-B*58:02 or by other HLA alleles expressed by these subjects.</p><p>Although previous studies have shown a correlation between increasing Gag breadth and decreasing viral load [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], including in vaccinees in the Step study [<xref rid="JIW093C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this was not observed here (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw093/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures 2 and 3</ext-link>). In part this is due to our small study numbers. In addition, Gag-specific responses are not equally potent. For example, p24-specific responses are associated with better viremic control than p17- or p15-specific responses [<xref rid="JIW093C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, in this study the design of the Gag peptide pools made these subanalyses not possible. Furthermore, sample nonavailability prevented the HLA restriction of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in the vaccinees to be determined. In large cohort studies, on average, Gag-specific breadth is associated with a lower viral load, but in small studies the variation between the different Gag and non-Gag responses will strongly influence these analyses. Furthermore, the vaccine-mediated increase in Gag breadth may be associated with changes in the non&#8211;Gag-specific responses. On average Nef-specific and Env-specific responses are associated with higher viral loads [<xref rid="JIW093C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, Nef-specific breadth in infected HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive vaccinees was 4-fold lower than in HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive placebo recipients (<italic>P</italic> = .06). Nef-specific breath has been consistently shown in previous studies to be associated with higher viral loads and the same observation is made here (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw093/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures 2 and 3</ext-link>). Thus, the finding of a lower viral loads in B*58:02-positive subjects with both higher Gag-specific and lower Nef-specific responses may be the result of a combination of these effects.</p><p>The limitations of this study include small subject numbers, the potential for postrandomization bias [<xref rid="JIW093C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the caveats that apply to any post hoc analysis. To address the possibility that the differences in postinfection outcomes were caused by the differences in characteristics associated with infection risk, rather than by vaccination, we investigated the impact of HLA on HIV-1 acquisition among 329 (of 801) Phambili subjects with available HLA data. There was no such influence in either vaccine or placebo recipients. This suggests that HLA does not confound the association of vaccination status with disease progression [<xref rid="JIW093C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and is consistent with ample data showing the impact of HLA on disease progression but not on HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="JIW093C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Skewing could have been introduced by unintended sample selection bias: PBMCs were only available for 60 of the 100 HIV-1&#8211;infected subjects, and the 40 subjects with unavailable samples and thus unknown CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses showed a faster time to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &lt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. However, the absence of data on the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in this group of 40 more-rapidly progressing subjects does not alter the validity of the finding in relation to the 60 we were able to study.</p><p>Finally, although low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and high viral load are, separately, strongly correlated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections and mortality [<xref rid="JIW093C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], these measures do not necessarily equate with disease [<xref rid="JIW093C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the observation of progression to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count of &lt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> within 6 months of infection in &gt;80% of the HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive placebo recipients, together with a viral set point of 5.1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL in these subjects, is consistent with rapid progression observed in natural infection in HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive individuals [<xref rid="JIW093C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The 1.3 log<sub>10</sub> lower viral set point in HLA-B*58:02&#8211;positive vaccinees and the inability of &gt;50% to meet the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count criteria for ART initiation by 600 days after infection are consistent with vaccine-mediated protection against rapid progression.</p><p>In conclusion, although the MRKAd5 HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine increased the infection risk among vaccine recipients in the Step and Phambili trials [<xref rid="JIW093C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="JIW093C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], these data suggest its potential role as a therapeutic vaccine operating in an HLA-specific manner, with the capacity to benefit individuals expressing disease-susceptible alleles. Even in ART recipients, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may contribute to suppression of viremia [<xref rid="JIW093C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and so-called shock and kill cure strategies [<xref rid="JIW093C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] may likely require effective anti&#8211;HIV-1 CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activity to achieve successful eradication of viral reservoirs [<xref rid="JIW093C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Any theoretical increased risk of HIV-1 infection resulting from adenoviral-based vaccines in subjects already infected with HIV-1 would be low as compared to the potential therapeutic benefit of inducing an effective anti&#8211;HIV-1 T-cell response. These studies indicate that the dramatic differences in HLA composition between distinct populations may contribute to variation in vaccine efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw093/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <uri xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.
