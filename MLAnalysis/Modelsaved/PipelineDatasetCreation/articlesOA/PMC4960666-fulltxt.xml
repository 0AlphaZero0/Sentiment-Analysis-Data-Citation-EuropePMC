Recent studies have found that acupuncture had a similar efficacy as the Western anti-obesity drugs with fewer reported adverse effects.

According to the statistical data of the Centre for Health Protection, Hong Kong SAR in 2013, 36.6&#160;% of the population aged 18&#8211;64 were classified as overweight or obese (body mass index, BMI &#8805;&#8201;23), including 18.8&#160;% as obese (BMI &#8805;&#8201;25) among all the population. Excess body weight is the sixth most important risk factor contributing to the overall burden of disease worldwide, such as hypertension, heart disease, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, gall bladder disease, and some types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Obesity is becoming a global epidemic and common health problem. The weight control treatments commonly used nowadays include behavioural intervention, dietary intervention and physical activity, which require a higher level of self-discipline and take up to 6&#160;months or longer to achieve significant weight change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; surgery like the duodenal&#8211;jejunal bypass liner, which may cause surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; and anti-obesity medications.</p><p>Currently, most of the Western anti-obesity drugs have adverse effects like oily discharge followed by flatus and faecal incontinence for orlistat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; headache, nausea and dizziness for lorcaserin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or body weight regaining upon cessation of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More people would like to seek help from Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and/or acupuncture for body weight control, especially from&#160;acupuncture because it is safe and does not involve the intake of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials have shown the beneficial effects of acupuncture, including body acupuncture and auricular acupressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Acupuncture compared with placebo or lifestyle modification had more effectiveness in lowering body weight, BMI and waist circumference and it had a similar efficacy as the Western anti-obesity drugs with fewer reported adverse effects of insomnia, headache or gastrointestinal reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Auricular acupressure has been summarized as having the effect of appetite suppression on overweight patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and its efficacy on weight control is higher when combined with body acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, these conclusions are limited due to the small sample size and low quality of the methodologies of these studies.

According to a systematic review, the highly frequently used acupuncture points in body weight control trials are Zusanli (ST-36), Sanyinjiao (SP-6), Tianshu (ST-25), Fenglong (ST-40), Zhongwan (CV-12) and Qihai (CV-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among them, the traditional effects of the abdominal points are harmonizing gastrointestinal function, regulating Qi circulation and treating localized problems, which would be excessive adipose tissue deposition for the studied subjects. The traditional effects of the points at the lower limbs are stabilizing gastrointestinal function and enhancing fluid drainage. With the clinical experience of our principal investigator and co-investigators, eight body points are chosen: Tianshu (ST-25), Daheng (SP-15), Daimai (GB-26), Qihai (CV-6), Zhongwan (CV-12), Zusanli (ST-36), Fenglong (ST-40) and Sanyinjiao (SP-6). The details of acupoints and their functions are listed in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The acupuncture treatment will be conducted by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner with more than 6&#160;years of Chinese medicine college education and at least 5&#160;years of clinical experience.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Acupoints of the body and their functions</p></caption></table-wrap></p><p>Disposable acupuncture needles (verum acupuncture needles asia-med Special No. 16 0.30&#8201;&#215;&#8201;30&#160;mm matching the Streitberger sham needles) will be inserted at a depth of 10&#8211;25&#160;mm into the points. As electro-acupuncture has been reviewed as having a higher efficiency in weight loss treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we will deliver electrical stimulation with dense-disperse waves at 50&#160;Hz and 10&#160;V through the electrical acupuncture stimulation instrument (ES-160 6-Channel Programmable Electro-acupuncture) to the abdominal points.

The four points were most frequently used on overweight treatment as summarized by a systemic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clinically, the ear points Spleen and Stomach are used for regulating gastrointestinal function; Shen men, meaning Spirit gate, is used for calming mental conditions; Hunger is used for suppressing the desire to eat and is reported to be particularly effective on weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Auricular acupressure points and sham acupressure points</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1458_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sham acupuncture</title><p>For subjects assigned to the control group, Streitberger&#8217;s non-invasive acupuncture needles (Gauge 8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;1.2&#8221;/0.30&#8201;&#215;&#8201;30&#160;mm) will be applied to serve as a sham control at the same acupoints with the same stimulation modality, except that the needles are only adhered to the skin instead of being inserted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The secondary outcomes include changes in BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference and body fat percentage during the treatment and follow-up period. Besides at baseline (0&#160;week), the numbers will be measured every 2&#160;weeks. Both the body weight and body fat percentage will be measured with the Omron Karada Scan HBF-701.</p><p>Adverse events will be noted throughout the study, based on participant reports and laboratory tests (whole blood counts, renal and liver functions) if needed.

For randomization, simple, complete non-sequential random numbers will be generated in advance by a computer program in a block of four, and kept by the principal investigator (PI, ZXB). After a patient&#8217;s eligibility is confirmed, a randomization number which corresponds to the group allocation will be provided to the acupuncturist by the PI. This arrangement will ensure that the clinical assessor and participants are blinded to the allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of changes in body weight. A systematic review on acupuncture for obesity has shown that acupuncture significantly reduced the body weight with average weight loss (MD&#8201;=&#8201;1.56&#160;kg, 95&#160;% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.74&#8211;2.38) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Missing values will be imputed by the last-observation-carried-forward method. The statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows version 21.0. The statistical significance is defined as two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;&#8201;0.05. Baseline characteristics will be reported as mean (SD). Baseline differences between the groups will be assessed with the use of Student&#8217;s <italic>t</italic> test for normally distributed continuous variables and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for non-normally distributed variables. For categorical variables, the chi-squared test or Fisher&#8217;s exact test will be used. Comparisons between groups will be conducted by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline as covariate. All items and subscales will be compared between groups every 4&#160;weeks using ANCOVA, with treatment group as a factor in the model and baseline as the covariate. The changes from baseline to endpoint of treatment in scores will be tested with a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Within-group differences will be assessed with a paired <italic>t</italic> test for normally distributed data and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>This single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on body weight control in Hong Kong. It will be the first such study on the Hong Kong population and will obtain evidence for utilizing acupuncture in obesity treatment especially for patients with Hong Kong diet patterns and health conditions. In order to achieve a higher therapeutic efficacy, we will integrate electro-acupuncture with auricular acupressure. Except for acupuncture point stimulation on the body and ears, we will not apply any interventions such as CHM, diet or physical activities to the subjects. Therefore, the effects of acupuncture alone will be observed. The outcome measures will include the change in body weight and body fat percentage, which will provide data to us on analysis of the treatment&#8217;s potential benefit on body fat mass.</p><p>So far there is no study of this kind in Hong Kong. This pilot study will provide evidence for large-scaled research such as combined therapy on overweight subjects with CHM, diet control, physical training or behavioural intervention. Further research on the changes in hormones, the nervous system or psychological conditions can also be developed to specifically target the Hong Kong population, as there have only been overseas studies up to the present.</p><p>In this clinical trial, the selection of body and auricular points is standardized and utilized for every subject. This may be helpful for easier utilization of the treatment over different individuals, but the limitation is that the selection of acupuncture points is not based on syndrome differentiation, which is the main concern in traditional Chinese acupuncture. Another limitation is the small sample size, as the trial was proposed to be a pilot study for a later large-scaled clinical trial.</p><p>In conclusion, in this pilot study, a single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, efficacy and safety of acupuncture on weight control in Hong Kong. This study will obtain the solid evidence for Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs) to utilize acupuncture for obesity and will also provide a platform to offer research training opportunities for junior CMPs.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>The participants are currently being recruited for the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BMI, body mass index; CHM, Chinese herbal medicine; CMP, Chinese medicine practitioner; ITT, intention-to-treat</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was financially supported by Hong Kong Hospital Authority Research Project: Acupuncture for Body Weight Control: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (Ref Code: HA 33-14-112-542-130).</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient(s) for publication of this manuscript and accompanying images.
