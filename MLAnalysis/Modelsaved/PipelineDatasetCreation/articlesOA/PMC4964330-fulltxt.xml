Approximately 69 million high quality reads were assembled <italic>de novo</italic>, yielding 37,790 unique transcripts with more than 55% being functionally annotated. Differentially expressed, 149 defense related transcripts/genes, namely defense related enzymes, resistance genes, multidrug resistant transporters, transcription factors, retrotransposons, metacaspases and chaperons were observed in RG, suggesting their role in defending against BB. Being present in the major hub, putative master regulators among these candidates were identified from predetermined protein-protein interaction network of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Further, confirmation of abundant expression of well-known RPM1, RPS2 and RPP13 in quantitative Real Time PCR indicates salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, possibly induce synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, required to overcome the virulence of <italic>E. vexans</italic>.

Additionally, hydrogen peroxide regulation, a part of regulation of oxygen and reactive oxygen species and metabolic process which is positively regulated by a hydrogen peroxide metabolic process were enriched only in RG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). At S3_RG, major categories including signalling and response to stimulus were found to be enriched, with response to stimulus, including response to organic substance under the category of response to chemical stimulus being highly enriched.

On closer analysis, it was observed that 62 of 88 mapped genes were found in the major group containing 661 nodes with average number of neighbours 10.6, while 26 remained in solitary clusters. Based on the interactome, R genes (4), defense enzyme (7), transcription factor (11), reterotransposon (2), multidrug resistance (9) and other defense genes (2) were present in the major hub, hence can be considered as putative key genes for BB defense (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, PPI network analysis revealed that R genes interacting with 35 other genes, defense related enzymes with 125, transcription factors with 149, reterotransposon with 175, multidrug resistant category with 149 genes and other defense related genes with 41 genes; therefore, can be potential candidates for combining of resistance in promising tea genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental validation of differential expression data by qRT-PCR</title><p>To validate a differential gene expression pattern obtained through RNA-seq, 13 immune related genes were selected for qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).

Hence, indicating that RNA-seq approach provided reliable differential gene expression information to understand molecular mechanism of immune response against the BB defense in tea.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is imperative to use NGS based global transcriptome sequencing approach to identify key pathway genes involved in BB defense in tea as follows in earlier studies for dissecting various biotic stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. <italic>E. vexans</italic> Massee is an obligate biotroph thus difficult to study its virulence, and therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanism and identification of key immune gene(s) involved in BB defense in RG could be an appropriate approach to control severe crop loss. Furthermore, identification of diverse R genes will also provide opportunity to study interactions with a wide range of <italic>E. vexans</italic> effectors for ascertaining possible immune signalling during BB defense in tea.</p><p>In this study, GO enrichment of the defense related aromatic compound and salicylic acid biosynthesis processes in RG, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis (lignin or phytoalexins like antimicrobial compounds) in S1_SG suggests the activation of the immune system during the initial stages of disease transition irrespective of the RG &amp; SG. The Presence of hydrogen peroxidase activity suggests efficient scavenging of free radicals enabling restricted penetration/germination of spores inside the host tissue at S2_RG. Phenylpropanoid and aromatic compound synthesis perhaps lead to synthesis of antimicrobial compounds that might have provided protection during haustoria and mycelial growth at S3_RG. Concurrently, chloroplast RNA processing, known to reduce photosynthesis, could be responsible for failure of the immune system during S3_SG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Additionally, enrichment of defense response, jasmonic acid stimulus, secondary metabolic process and jasmonic acid mediated signalling during sporulation of exobasidiospore at later stages of BB transition (S4_RG) confirmed that RG developed immunity by jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Although the presence of developmental processes, cell cycle, histone lysine methylation is known to provide small immunity achieved by histone lysine methylation, jasmonic and salicylic acid signalling of immune response, it was totally absent during sporulation of exobasidiospore (S4_SG). Furthermore, flavonol synthesis and secondary metabolite production during S1_SG and presence of xyloglucosyl transferase at S2_SG as evident in the molecular function GO term, might provide a preliminary defense by lignin deposition restricting the entry of pathogen and subsequent spread of disease as reported earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, whereas, immune system appeared to have failed in S3_SG due to expression of nucleases and endonucleases activity. In general, molecular function GO analysis revealed a declining trend of immunity during progression of BB from S1_SG to S4_SG. However, up-regulation of monooxygenase and ACC oxidase activity in S4_RG possibly provides defense by removing free radicals and production of ethylene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Enrichment of defense related genes possibly suggests stronger immunity due to activation of <italic>E. vexans</italic> secondary infection, immune prime cell. Conclusively, the presence of strong immune system machinery might be responsible for long lasting immunity at S4_RG.</p><p>Up-regulation of R genes, defense related enzymes, transcription factors, retrotransposons and chaperones during BB transition in RG as revealed in the current study suggests the putative defense mechanism against BB in tea was comparable with model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In general, R genes encode five classes of proteins, among which, the NB-LRR (Nucleotide Binding Leucine Rich Repeat) composed of a conserved Nucleotide Binding domain and a variable Leucine Rich Repeat, makes up the largest class<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Up-regulation of various R genes during the BB transition in RG possibly increased its recognition capacity to various effectors that limit the pathogen growth by cell wall modification, secondary metabolite production and finally, programmed cell death (hypersensitive response) by activation of salicylic acid signalling pathway, probably involved in tea immunity against BB. In general, disease resistance is governed by specific plant and biotrophic pathogen interaction between pathogen avr gene and resistance R locus alleles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Although, little is known on signalling events required to activate NB-LRR mediated ETI (Effective Triggered Immunity) in tea, presence of few important R genes up-regulated in RG possibly binding to unknown effector(s) of <italic>E.vexans</italic> that might be playing a role in conferring immunity. Among the various R genes reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, RIN4, a plasma membrane associated protein is guarded by NB-LRR protein and manipulated by AvrRpm1 and AvrB effectors; eventual modification of RIN4 activates RPM1 NB-LRR protein. AvrRpt2 activates a cysteine protease inside the host cell which cleaves RIN4, consequently activating the RPS 2 NB-LRR protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Up-regulation of RPM1, RPS2-like disease resistance genes in RG suggests guard model might possibly serve as one of the important mechanisms in tea defense against BB. However, separate reverse genetics studies will be required to prove guard hypothesis in tea. Up-regulation of RPP13 (another R gene) in RG insinuates its important role in defense against BB as reported in <italic>A thaliana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Additionally, higher expression of most of the R genes in RG indicates strongly activated immune machinery, maintained till S4_RG where more biotic pressure exists due to secondary infection of BB.</p><p>Penetration of pathogen (hyphae) generally, is prevented due to the presence of a tightly sealed cell wall in RG. This results in depletion of nutrient available to pathogen leading to inhibition of hyphal growth and pathogen toxin diffusion. During the polymerization reaction of cell wall, low molecular weight phenolic compounds which are precursor of lignin and free radicals (ROS) affect the pathogenicity. In response to <italic>E. vexans</italic> infection, lignin metabolism, cellulose synthesis, secondary metabolite synthesis, detoxification of toxic compound, ethylene biosynthesis, free radical scavenger, long lasting immune memory priming responsible enzymes were found to be up regulated at various stages of disease transition and possibly provide immunity as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In reference to <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> MPK6 and MPK1, m-RNA and proteins were reported to be accumulated in inactive form in an immune primed cell for long lasting immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. During secondary cycle/infection of the pathogen, MPK1 and MPK6 were activated in primed cell, thus enabling cell to take strong and rapid action at a very low level of stimulus compared to un-primed cell. Higher MPKK 6 transcript basal level in primed cell irrespective of the disease transition stages might be the reason for strong immune response in RG during secondary infection.</p><p>During pathogenic pressure, various transcription factors have been reported to reprogramme transcriptional dynamics of the plant. Among others, WRKY TFs form a large family of regulatory proteins which are known to play an important role in regulating plant immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Up-regulated members of WRKY, NAM and other transcription factor families in RG suggests their importance in BB defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Additionally, R gene activation most likely increases salicylic acid level subsequently leading to NPR1 activation <italic>via</italic> WRKY TF binding upstream of NPR1 gene boxes. The high salicylic acid level might disturb the redox potential of NPR1 protein reducing TGA disulfide bridge, and results a conformational change which allows the TGA family transcription factor to interact with NPR1. TGA-NPR1 complex binds to the promoter of PR gene and possibly provides immunity in RG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>In general, the biotic pressure increases the genome instability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Increased pathogen pressure promotes the formation of R gene by locally changing the epigenetic chromatin landscape to stabilize R gene clusters and allow gene rearrangement. Additionally, transposons activity may contribute to the evolution of R genes and could influence their expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. In our study, up-regulation of LTR and DNA/PIF-Harbinger class of retrotransposons might lead to genome reshuffling and formation of new polymorphic R genes; hence, could be responsible for providing strong immunity. Though the basal level of expression of most retrotransposons was found to be higher in RG irrespective to BB transition, almost all the retrotransposons were activated as a result of elevated <italic>E.vexans</italic> disease pressure due to the secondary infection at S4_RG.</p><p>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate the translocation of a wide range of molecules across the biological membrane. ABC transporters are reported to be responsible for the vacuolar import of chlorophyll catabolites and xenobiotics, playing a key role in cellular detoxification by vacuolar sequestration of endogenous or exogenous toxic compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Higher basal level of most MDR transporter&#8217;s transcripts in RG suggests these perhaps detoxifies the cellular toxin produced by <italic>E. vexans</italic>.</p><p>Identification of other important defense related genes such as chaperones and metacaspases might facilitate their conformational changes to induce downstream immune signalling as reported earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Chaperone regulates the R protein, eventually leading to programmed cell death (apoptosis) at the site of infection. In plants, tissue or organ apoptosis occurs during normal senescence or response to pathogens. During incompatible interaction, PCD (Programmed Cell Death) occurs and prevents the spreading of pathogen. All these important and defense related regulatory genes were up-regulated at various stages of disease transition with higher basal level of transcripts in RG that may be responsible for regulating tea immunity.</p><p>PPI network analysis of 149 defense related proteins with model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was conducted to reaffirm key proteins modulating BB defense in tea as follows in earlier studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Being in the PPI network hub and regulating more than 5 other proteins, 35 proteins could thus be designated as key putative proteins involved in BB defense in tea. A Direct association of RIN4 with RPM1 and RPS2 and indirect interaction with NB-ARC domain related to disease resistance indicates that guard hypothesis reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> might be acting in tea defense against BB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Defense related enzymes, namely, superoxide dismutase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-6, nitrate reductase [NADH], phototropin-2, Alcohol dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase GPx and cinnamoyl CoA reductase-1, being present in hub possibly regulate other enzymes involved in BB defense. Transcription factors disclose various genes like LRR1, HSP20, WRKY, UCH, HSF_DNA-bind, SHMT, KNOX2, p450, Pkinase and NAM present in network regulating other genes, thus might be playing vital role in BB defense. Among these, NAM (NAC Domain) and WRKY were also found in regulating seconadary metabolites: flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis in tea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. This suggests that these TFs may regulate the BB defense either directly or indirectly via secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In case of retrotransposons it has been found that 2 genes, LTR/Copia and DNA/PIF-Harbinger associated with 175 other Arabidopsis genes in the network and may have an important role in BB defense. Multi Drug resistant genes, namely ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), 1 pleiotropic drug resistance protein, 1ABC transporter B family member and 1ABC transporter G family member have shown direct interactions with resistance in predicting network of <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> hence affirming to be valuable candidates in BB defense in tea. Other genes mapped from identified genes related to defense are metacaspase-1and serine carboxypeptidase-like-19 present in centre regulating various genes in the network. The overall interactome analysis predicted 35 key putative proteins, thus can be categorized as good candidates for regulating BB defense in tea.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study, for the first time provides comprehensive defense responsive expressions against the BB defense in tea. An overall analysis initiated after inoculating <italic>E. vexans&#8217;</italic> spores revealed activation of various R genes along with defense related enzymes to prevent spread of disease after infection, followed by transporters, involved in overcoming the virulence caused by the pathogen in RG. To cope up with disease severity, retrotransposons are activated and by genome reshuffling possibly produce new type of R gene(s) so that plant is able to recognize a new kind of virulence produced by pathogen. Transcription factors are activated in the plant to further enhance the activity of R and other defense associated genes. Overall, R genes, defense related enzymes, retrotransposons, transcription factors and other defense associated molecules provide immunity in RG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Furthermore, 149 putative key defense related transcripts/genes identified in expression and PPI network analysis can serve as good candidates for future research and also to be used for combining and characterizing defense system against BB in quality tea clones through molecular breeding and genetic engineering technologies. This information is valuable considering the biotrophic nature of fungi and will provide a powerful approach to identitying potential RG from the random gene pool and to unravel immune regulation of various biotic stresses in tea and other crops.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant Material</title><p>Tea [<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.)
