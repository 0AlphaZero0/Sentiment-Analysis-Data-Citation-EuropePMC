In the disordered relaxed state myosin heads are not bound to the core of the thick filament and have an ATPase rate that is 10 fold greater. In the interacting-heads motif the two regulatory light chains appear to bind to each other. We have made single cysteine mutants of the regulatory light chain, placed both paramagnetic and fluorescent probes on them, and exchanged them into skinned skeletal muscle fibers. Many of the labeled light chains tended to disrupt the stability of the super-relaxed state, and showed spectral changes in the transition from the disordered relaxed state to the super-relaxed state. These data support the putative interface between the two regulatory light chains identified by cryo electron microscopy and show that both the divalent cation bound to the regulatory light chain and the N-terminus of the regulatory light chain play a role in the stability of the super-relaxed state. One probe showed a shift to shorter wavelengths in the super-relaxed state such that a ratio of intensities at 440nm to that at 520nm provided a measure of the population of the super-relaxed state amenable for high throughput screens for finding potential pharmaceuticals. The results provide a proof of concept that small molecules that bind to this region can destabilize the super-relaxed state and provide a method to search for small molecules that do so leading to a potentially effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes and obesity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR062279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pate</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the NIH AR062279 to EP and RC, and by a grant from Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo to CR.

Ferenczi et al [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] over 35 years ago, showed the existence of an inhibited state of myosin in living relaxed fibers via a comparison between the ATPase activity of purified myosin from frog muscle, and the much lower metabolic rate of living fibers. A similar conclusion was reached for rabbit muscle myosin [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the inhibited state was not observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> muscle assays for many years, in spite of numerous attempts. The inhibited state was finally monitored by measuring single cycle ATP turnovers initiated by incubation of skinned fibers in a fluorescent analog of ATP, followed by chase with unlabeled ATP [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The inhibited state was called the Super Relaxed State (SRX). Although the presence of an ordered state of myosin heads in the relaxed fibers had been known for decades [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the role of this state in the kinetics of the myosin ATPase in vertebrate striated muscle was not appreciated. Correlations between the stability of the SRX, measured kinetically, and the stability of the array of myosin heads bound to the core of the thick filament as measured by x-ray diffraction or by EM, has suggested the hypothesis that the inhibited state is associated with an ordered structural state [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Testing this hypothesis is one of the goals of the present work. Myosin heads in the SRX are in equilibrium with myosin heads that are disordered and moving freely in the inter-filament space, which we term the disordered relaxed state (DRX). These myosin heads have the faster ATPase activity observed for purified myosin.</p><p>The first evidence for a structured state of the myosin heads in resting muscle came from the small angle x-ray diffraction pattern, where the strong myosin layer lines showed that a large fraction of the myosin heads were bound to the core of the thick filament in a helical array [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The best model of the structure of the ordered array of myosin heads bound to the core of the thick filament is based on cryo-electron micrographs of myosin thick filaments from tarantulas and other invertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The structure, called the Interacting-Heads Motif (IHM) shows the two myosin heads of one molecule bound closely together and bent back on the rod portion of the coiled-coil tail and the core of the thick filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The myosin head is composed of a large catalytic domain that contains the sites for binding actin and ATP, and a light chain domain formed by the binding of two small subunits, the essential light chain and the regulatory light chain (RLC). In the IHM there appears to be an interface between the two catalytic domains, an additional interface between the two RLCs, and an interface between the catalytic domain of the blocked head and the coiled-coil tail region. In addition, there are interfaces between adjacent myosin molecules both above and below in the helical array. The IHM was initially observed in two-dimensional crystals of a fragment of myosin from chicken gizzard [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It was later found in tarantula exoskeletal striated filaments, and has now been observed in a variety of invertebrate filaments, in vertebrate cardiac filaments and in isolated myosin molecules from vertebrate skeletal muscles [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This leads to the hypothesis that the IHM is widely distributed in various muscles, and evolved early in the animal kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The IHM has also been observed by the polarization of bi-functional fluorescent probes on the RLC in skinned fibers from skeletal and cardiac muscles [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In skeletal fibers at physiological temperatures and lattice spacing, these probes show that virtually all of the heads are in the IHM [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0160100.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160100.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The structure of the tarantula IHM (3DTP) [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</title><p>(A) The myosin heavy chain of the blocked head is light blue, and that of the free head is dark blue.

These myosins all come from muscles controlled, completely or in part, through the thick filament. It is our proposal that this association also extends to vertebrate skeletal muscle, although with a faster ATP turnover time in the SRX of approximately 4 minutes.</p><p>The large amount of myosin in animals and humans leads to the conclusion that the equilibrium between the SRX and the DRX will play a role in whole body metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the initial observation of the inhibited state in frog muscles it was noted that if all the myosins in the muscle had the ATPase activity observed in the test tube that the metabolism of the myosins alone would be 5 times greater than the metabolism of resting living muscle [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This shows that the vast majority of the myosins in the living muscle must be in the inhibited state as is also shown by fluorescent probes in skinned skeletal fibers in physiological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A high population of the SRX leads to energy economy, which is of obvious utility when energy/food is limited. From the point of view of a modern society, however, where energy can be harder to waste than to gain, a high population of the SRX can be counter-productive [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This leads to the concept that destabilizing the SRX would be a good target for increasing basal metabolism to treat weight-related diseases and Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Several factors complicate the search for an assay that can measure the population of the SRX in a high-throughput screen, to find small molecules to disrupt the SRX and increase resting muscle thermogenesis. The most prominent of these is that in vertebrate striated muscles, the SRX has only been visualized easily in skinned muscle fibers. Our attempts to observe a SRX in purified proteins using fluorescent probes proved unsuccessful. With a lifetime of only 4 min. the kinetics of the chase experiment in fibers, are difficult to carry out in a plate reader. In the skinned fiber preparation there are other enzymes that use ATP, ion transporters, etc. There are also populations of myosin in the DRX and in damaged, unregulated fiber regions that are active with a very high ATPase activity. These factors complicate the direct steady-state measurement of ATPase activity as a method of monitoring the population of a state that has a very low ATPase activity. The signal that would be most useful in a screen is a fluorescent probe that has a spectral shift that was sensitive to the SRX-DRX transition.</p><p>Our study focused on the RLC as a site for spectroscopic labeling and sensing of the state of the myosin. The RLC has several advantages: 1. it is easily replaceable in skinned muscle fibers, 2. it may form one of the protein-protein interfaces that is important for the stability of the IHM complex [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], 3. it has a physiological site of regulation of the population of the IHM and SRX through its N-terminus phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our first aim was to characterize the effect of a set of single cysteine RLC mutants, labeled with paramagnetic and fluorescent probes, on the stability of the SRX state. A second aim was to search for changes in the spectra of these probes that occur on the transition into the SRX. In particular, we were searching for a fluorescence signal that monitors the population of the SRX that would be a tool to scale the experiment up to the high-throughput level. The observations made here have provided information on the role of the proposed interface between the two RLCs in the stability of the SRX. We also describe one probe that provides a spectral signal that is amenable for measuring the population of the SRX in high throughput screening. Such screens can now find small molecules that disrupt the SRX, thus increasing metabolic rate to treat metabolic diseases in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>White New Zealand Rabbits, obtained from Charles River Laboratories Boston MA, were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine followed by exsanguination and bilateralthoractotomy, protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, approval number AN108976-02.

Comparison of intensities of 2 spectra obtained by this method was complicated by artifacts due to slight movements of the fiber that occurred during solution changes and due to photo decay. For the excitation and emission spectra shown, the difference in the absolute intensities of the spectra in different condition were determined by observing fibers in the fluorescent microscope using an emission filter that measured the peak intensity 660 to 670nm. This allowed us to measure the change in the peak intensity during the transition from rigor to relaxation.

After completion of these studies, a model at higher resolution was published (3JBH), however the new model did not change any of the conclusions on the proposed interface that we had made [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A comparison between the sequences of tarantula exoskeletal muscle and vertebrate skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) shows that many of the conserved amino acids are clustered on the surface on the N-terminal lobe, close to the location of the RLC-RLC interface in the model of the IHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The presence of a cluster of conserved residues on the surface of a protein suggests that they may have a role in protein-protein interactions. This cluster provided another method for choosing residues for probe sites. The model structure of the IHM suggests that the interface between the two RLCS is formed around the A helix, aa 30 to 40 (mouse sequence numbering), and the N-terminus of the D helix 76 to 88 [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ideal location to place probes to monitor the SRX will be at the border of the interface, will not destabilize the IHM and will sense changes in the SRX versus the DRX. Three sets of mutants were chosen, the first is in the very N-terminus, the second is in the surface region of the proposed interface. The third is in the C-lobe serving as a control. The first set has been designed with the idea that the N-terminus plays an important role in the stability of the IHM structure. A recent paper suggests that the N-terminus undergoes a structural change when phosphorylated [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

To overcome this problem, we measured single nucleotide turnovers by first incubating the fiber in a relaxing solution that contained 250 &#956;M mantATP. MantATP has been shown to bind to myosin with high affinity, and to be hydrolyzed with similar kinetics as ATP [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The mantATP binds to the myosin, relaxing the fiber. In addition, it also binds non-specifically to other structures in the fiber. After incubation of the fiber in mantATP for several minutes, the fiber was chased with a relaxing solution containing ATP. The decay in fiber fluorescence occurs in several phases as mant-nucleotides are released from their sites and diffuse out of the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g004">Fig 4</xref>). There is a rapid decay that occurs in the first 20&#8211;30 seconds, followed by a slower decay that occurs with a lifetime that is approximately 4 minutes. The first phase consists of the diffusion of free nucleotides out of the fiber, which occurs in 10 seconds, the release of mantATP from most non-specific sites, which occurs quickly, and the turnover and release of mant-nucleotides from disordered myosin and from other enzymes, which occurs in 20 seconds or less. The slower phase, which has a lifetime of about 240 seconds, has been shown to be largely due to the slow turnover and release of mant-nucleotides from myosin that is in the SRX [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The data could be adequately fit by a function consisting of 2 exponential decays one with a short lifetime and one with a longer lifetime.

The fraction of the fluorescence intensity that decays with the longer lifetime, P2, provides a measure of the stability of the SRX.

For the control sample there is a fraction of the fluorescence that decays slowly during the chase, which represents 37% of the total fluorescence and has a lifetime of 248 seconds. This component arises from the slow release of nucleotides from myosin heads in the SRX. Although this component represents 37% of total fluorescence it represents a greater fraction of the myosin heads. There is a fraction of probes, ~40%, that are bound nonspecifically to the fiber, and are released quickly [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus only 60% of the total fluorescence arises from probes bound to myosin and the proportion of the myosin that is in the SRX is 62%. For fibers exchanged with RLC-C44-BIMANE, virtually all the fluorescence, 99%, is released in the fast phase. The population of the SRX in these fibers is close to zero. For fibers exchanged with RLC-C6-MDCC, there is a slow decay of fluorescence that represents 26% of the total with a lifetime of 172 seconds. Both the population and the lifetime show that the SRX in these fibers is destabilized relative to that observed in the control fibers. The fraction of fluorescence that decays slowly during the chase phase is proportional to the population of the SRX. As can be seen by the values of P2 summarized in <xref rid="pone.0160100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (bar graph <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) the mutations alone have a minimal effect on the stability of the SRX. For only one of the mutants, RLC-C38, did the mutation alone destabilize the SRX, decreasing the value of P2 by 35%. The D38C mutation is in an aspartic acid that coordinates to the divalent cation that is bound to an EF hand in the N-terminal lobe of all RLCs. In some cases, the attachment of probes to the single cysteines decreases the population of the SRX. Some of the probes are small, MMTS and BIMANE, some are intermediate, MSL and IASL, some are large but attached by a flexible leash, MDCC. One is large but not flexible, MIANS, and would be expected to provide the most interference. The structures of the probes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s003">S3 Fig</xref>. The pattern of interference produced by the attachment of probes could provide information on the role of the various sites in the proposed interface formed by the two RLCs in the SRX. Mutant C128, one of the native cysteines, is used as a control since it is in the C-terminus lobe, far from the putative interface. None of the probes attached to it affect the population of the SRX, as expected for a control. Two of the probe sites, D38C and I44C cannot tolerate even the smallest of the probes, MMTS or BIMANE. These sites are located in the region of a structural motif known as an EF hand, which binds divalent cations, either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In fact, the mutant D38C was the site that produced the greatest effect on the value of P2 even in the absence of an attached probe as discussed above. The second mutation in this region, I44C, is also in the EF hand structure. Although it does not coordinate the divalent cation and is not completely conserved, it forms part of the structural motif that binds the divalent cation, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. These observations attest to the importance of the presence of the divalent cation in the stability of the SRX. The sites K31C, and T81C are within both the cluster of conserved residues, and the proposed interface. Both of these sites tolerated the smallest probes or the flexible probes, while larger and stiff probes partially affected the stability of the complex (<xref rid="pone.0160100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The sites on the N-terminal region tolerated many but not all of the probes, with little correlation between probe properties and their effect. In general, the destabilization of the population of the SRX was accompanied by a corresponding decrease of T2. However, there was a lot of scatter in the data. Although the data provide additional support for the hypothesis that the inhibited heads of the SRX are in the IHM, they do not prove this possibility. Furthermore, the supposition that there are also myosin heads that have an inhibited ATPase activity but are not in the IHM cannot be ruled out by our data.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0160100.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160100.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Fraction of the Fluorescent Nucleotides Released Slowly during the Chase Phase.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0160100.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0160100.t001"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>The fraction of the nucleotides that are released in the slow phase, measured by the mantATP chase experiments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g004">Fig 4</xref>, is shown for various preparations of exchanged fibers.

Thus in the presence of GTP, fibers are mechanically relaxed with 90% of the myosin heads in the DRX and 10% in the SRX. Thus on the addition of ATP to rigor fibers 50&#8211;60% of the myosin heads make the transition from a rigor state to a more ordered SRX, and upon addition of GTP, two thirds of these return to a disordered, but still relaxed state.</p><fig id="pone.0160100.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160100.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The intensity of the fluorescence of fibers exchanged with RLC-C31-MDCC is shown as a function of time.</title><p>The fiber starts in rigor.

This was generally observed for most of the probes that gave spectral changes (see <xref rid="pone.0160100.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

The mobility of the probe can be determined from the spectra and is related to the topology of the surrounding environment. In addition to mobility, an oriented sample such as muscle provides a good system to measure the orientation of the probes. The spectrum of a probe in an EPR experiment is sensitive to the angle between the magnetic field direction and the principal axis of the probe.

As the only reliable measurements of the stability of the SRX require observations of muscle fibers these high throughput screens will be carried out by observing fibers minced with a scalpel, and pipetted into wells in 384 well plates. As each well will have different numbers of fibers, the excitation is not uniform and the positions of the fibers may change during the assay, reliable observations require a signal that does not depend on the amount of fibers in the field of view. A standard method for obtaining such a signal is to use the ratio of two different intensities that respond differently to changes in the population of the SRX. In some cases, probes show a blue shift e.g. a shift in the emission maximum to shorter wavelengths upon an increase in quantum yield; both due to a decrease in the polarity of the surrounding environment of the probe. The presence of a blue shift in our fibers was measured by using filter sets to observe intensities on the short and long sides of the emission maximum. In a survey of the probe spectra that showed changes in quantum yield we found only one signal, the fluorescence intensity of RLC&#8211;C5&#8211;MDCC exchanged into fibers that showed an appreciable blue shift, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g007">Fig 7</xref> for fluorescence intensities measured in the microscope. The emission spectra of the other probes changed in intensity but not in shape. The fibers were excited using an excitation filter centered at 387nm and observed using emission filters centered at 440nm and at 520nm. The blue shift caused the increase in intensity at the short wavelength side of the spectral peak to be larger than the change in the long wavelength side of the peak (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g008">8</xref>). By taking the ratio of the two spectral components we obtained a signal that was independent of the number of fibers in the field of view and was also not sensitive to photo bleaching of the probe. The ratio signal obtained in our standard experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g007">Fig 7</xref>. The ratio of the two intensities increases by 18% in the transition from rigor fibers to fibers relaxed in ATP and decreases by a similar amount upon subsequent relaxation of the fibers in GTP. The population of the SRX is known to be decreased significantly in the presence of GTP [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The bottom panel shows that the ratio also responds to activation of the fibers, a condition in which the population of the SRX is also decreased [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The average change in the ratio between rigor and relaxed fibers was 15 &#177; 3% (SEM n = 20). The ratio is independent of the amount of material being observed, and provides the long sought for signal that can be used to carry out high throughput screens in 384 well plates.</p><fig id="pone.0160100.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160100.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><p><italic>Top panel</italic>: Measuring two regions of the emission spectrum of RLC-C5-MDCC.

To survive, animals, need to move, and to do so muscles have been developed. Muscles are powerful tools optimized for moving, mating, fighting, hunting and escaping. Because of the complex functions of muscle tissue, it is logical to think that it needs multiple modes of regulation. In particular, an important function is to manage energy expenditure. The SRX provides a mechanism whereby striated muscle can achieve higher energy economy. Our goal in this study was two-fold. First was to understand the role of the RLC in the structure of the IHM. Second was to find a signal that would allow the use of high throughput screens to search for small molecules that would change the stability of the IHM and SRX, and thereby alter the energy economy of muscle to influence whole body metabolism.</p><p>The mutations alone had a small effect on the stability of the SRX as measured by our chase experiments, see <xref rid="pone.0160100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. A single mutation would not be expected to have a large effect on the stability of the SRX as the interfaces that form this complex involve extensive areas, and the perturbation in energy caused by changing one amino acid to cysteine will be small. Only one mutation had a sizable effect, and is discussed below. Addition of probes to the sites on the RLC exerted larger changes to the stability of the SRX. The pattern of inhibition was consistent with the hypothesis that the patch of conserved residues, which occurs in the region identified by cryo electron microscopy is in fact the interface. This is also supported by the pattern of probes showing changes in fluorescence spectra.</p><p>The best evidence for the RLC-RLC interface is the juxtaposition of these subunits in the 3D electron microscopy structures [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the data described above support this hypothesis these data must be interpreted with caution. The inhibition of the SRX could also be caused by local unfolding of the protein. We tried to explore this by observing circular dichroism spectra of the labeled light chains, however in the absence of a heavy chain the RLC was not sufficiently well folded to obtain meaningful data. An RLC-RLC bond has never been observed in solution. In spite of extensive kinetic investigations a state with an inhibited ATP turnover has not been observed in skeletal myosin or heavy meromyosin [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We think that the RLC-RLC bond is weak, and only plays a major role in the context of the formation of the IHM array, where many myosins operate cooperatively to provide stability. Thus the most conservative interpretaton of the data provided here is that perturbations to this region of the N-terminal lobe of the RLC can alter the SRX.</p><p>The data also identify two regions of the RLC as playing important roles in the stability of the SRX, the binding site for divalent cations and the N-terminal end, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160100.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. The RLC has one site that binds both Mg<sup>++</sup> and Ca<sup>++</sup> ions. Although the site primarily binds Mg<sup>++</sup>, during periods of intensive activity Ca<sup>++</sup> will replace a fraction of the Mg<sup>++</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The role of this site remains undefined. Complete loss of the ability to bind cations in skeletal muscle decreases maximum tension by modulating the kinetics of cross bridge attachment and detachment [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In cardiac muscle, loss of binding leads to cardiomyopathies [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here we show that alterations of this site lead to a strong destabilization of the SRX. Although it is not clear from the structure whether it is involved directly in the proposed interface, it forms one side of the patch of conserved residues discussed previously. One of the amino acids changed, aspartate 38, would strongly affect binding of a cation as it is involved in the binding. The other amino acid, isoleucine 44, points away from the bound cation and into a position where it would communicate with the rest of the interface. Our results show that the divalent cation is involved in the stability of the SRX. This conclusion, along with the fact that Mg<sup>++</sup> can be replaced by Ca<sup>++</sup> during muscle activity [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggests that the divalent cation may regulate the SRX.</p><p>The N-terminus has been shown to be important in the formation of the IHM in smooth muscle [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and we here extend this result to skeletal muscle. Probes placed on amino acid 23 in smooth muscle myosin fragments show changes in the conformation of this region upon phosphorylation only in the presence of nucleotide and only in heavy meromyosin and not in subfragment-1 [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These observations show that this region of the peptide, which lies between the N-terminus and the putative interface changes in response to the formation of the RLC-RLC interface. Providing further support for the conclusions drawn here. The role of the N-terminus in the formation of the SRX provides support for a structural model of a conformational change in the N-terminal region of the RLC upon the transition from the dephosphorylated form (presumably the SRX conformation) to the phosphorylated form (presumably in the DRX) [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This involves a transition from a compact region lacking secondary structure to an alpha-helical region that is more solvent exposed. Our data also show that there is a tendency for the probes in the N-terminal region to be less solvent exposed in the SRX, which provides further support for the model.</p><p>The observation that the addition of a probe to a site within the RLC-RLC interface destabilizes this interface provides a proof of concept that the binding of small molecules could decrease the stability of the SRX. Although the structure of the IHM involves multiple interfaces the steric disruption of one of these interfaces by an attached probe is sufficient to destabilize the entire complex. Because full inhibition was found for some samples, in which only 50% of the RLC's were exchanged, the data further show that the sub-stoichiometric binding of an inhibitor can destabilize the SRX completely. The SRX is completely destabilized in spite of the fact that 25% or more of the myosins in the array have not been modified. Thus destabilization of one molecule also destabilizes adjacent molecules, and the myosin heads in the array are interacting in a cooperative fashion. Destabilization of a fraction of them destabilizes the entire array, which then acts as a unit. A variety of data support the idea that the energetics of the formation of the IHM is cooperative. A cooperative inhibition of the SRX has previously been observed for RLC phosphorylation where the maximum inhibition is achieved when less than 50% of the myosins are phosphorylated [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some of the most compelling evidence for cooperativity comes from small angle x-ray diffraction measurements in which the muscle fibers are activated at longer sarcomere lengths, where a large fraction of the myosin heads are not in the overlap zone [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even though half or more of the myosin heads have no thin filaments to interact with, upon activation all of the myosin heads become very rapidly disordered. This observation shows that there has been a signal passed from the myosin heads in the overlap zone to other distant myosin heads causing them to become disordered. A cooperative mechanism has also been proposed for the activation of tarantula thick filaments by phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0160100.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160100.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In the presence of a magnetic field an unpaired electron gives rise to a spectrum consisting of three lines. The splitting between the spectral peaks depends on the angle between the principal axis of the probe and the magnetic field: the wider the spectral splitting the smaller the angle. A comparison of the spectra taken with the long axis of the fiber parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field provides information on the orientation distribution of the probes. Such a comparison is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g006">Fig 6</xref>, for fibers exchanged with RLC-C31-MMTS, the only sample to show good orientation. The splitting between the high-field and low-field peaks is less in the parallel spectra showing that the long axis of the probes is oriented predominantly more perpendicular than parallel to the fiber axis. More quantitative interpretation of this orientation is difficult as the two RLC's of a given myosin molecule have two different orientations, and in addition we do not know how the probe is oriented relative to the protein. However, we note that oriented probes even in muscle fibers are rare. In contrast for these fibers in rigor there was no preferred orientation of the probes relative to the magnetic field, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g006">Fig 6</xref>. In the modeled tarantula IHM, the residue number 31 seems to be in an ideal position to sense the changes in the conformation of the complex. The original lysines are right at the interface between the two RLCs, facing each other. The surface is not tight and a small probe may fit in the empty space, which is left by removal of the lysines. There was also a decrease in the mobility of probes on fibers exchanged with RLC-C31-MMTS on going from rigor to the SRX. Smaller decreases in mobility were also seen for fibers exchanged with RLC-C81-MMTS.</p><p>The changes in spectral intensity of the fluorescent probes discussed above do not provide a signal that would be useful for high throughput screens per se. Fortunately, the shift in the wavelength for the emission spectrum of MDCC attached to RLC-C5 provides a solution to this problem (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160100.g009">9</xref>). Because the fluorescence intensities at two wavelengths arise from excitation of one probe, the resulting ratio is independent of the amount of material being observed, excitation intensity and photo-bleaching. This provides the long sought for signal that can be used to search for potential therapeutic molecules that could increase resting muscle metabolism to treat obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Such screens are in progress and the results will be reported in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160100.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Alignment of tarantula exoskeletal myosin RLC (Uniprot B4XT43, PDB 3DTP) with mouse fast muscle myosin RLC (Uniprot P97457).</title><p>Output of the EMBOSS Needle Pairwise Sequence Alignment tool.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0160100.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160100.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Bar graph of the <xref rid="pone.0160100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> data.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0160100.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160100.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The structures of the probes employed in this study.</title><p>The probes are: 4-maleimido-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (MSL), 4-iodoacetamido-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (IASL) (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), 3-(bromomethyl)-2,5,6-trimethyl-1H,7H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazole-1,7-dione (BIMANE); 7-Diethylamino-3-[N-(2-maleimidoethyl)carbamoyl]coumarin (MDCC); 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0160100.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0160100.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>EPR spectra of fibers exchanged with RLC-C81-MMTS.</title><p>EPR spectra of fibers exchanged with RLC-C81-MMTS with the fiber axis perpendicular to the magnetic field.
