Hence, WES reduces the cost associated with the identification of the causative mutations of a certain disease while maintaining the efficiency of mutation detection in protein-coding regions that might substantially affect the phenotype. Since the use of this method to select an entire set of human exons for sequencing using probe hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and its first application for the identification of a gene involved in a genetic disease were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], WES has been successfully applied to the identification of responsible genes and their causative mutations in many diseases (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]).</p><p>Although WES has been mainly applied to human genetics, some studies have investigated WES application to mouse exome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which is among the most widely used animal models in basic molecular biology and biomedical science. Rat has also been used extensively as a model for various human diseases and the genome has been sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however, WES analyses of rat exome have not yet been reported because of the lack of a commercially available exome capture kit. It is possible to design a customized capture kit for the desired target sequences in such species. Some applications of exome sequencing have been described for some species for which commercial capture kits are not available. These species include dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], cows/bison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], chipmunks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the conventional WES target capture method, all regions except for exons and their neighboring splice sites are eliminated as targets. As such, mutations in most regulatory regions, which often reside in non-exonic regions, are, in principle, hardly detected despite the fact that mutations in these regions have been found to be responsible for certain diseases such as preaxial polydactyly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the Pierre Robin sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). Such mutations are often identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For example, among the published reports of 2304 studies (16,831 associations) registered in the GWAS Catalog (October 30, 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the reports of 535 studies (2276 associations) stated that significant markers were found in intergenic regions distant from any annotated genes. These may be candidates for disorder- or risk-associated loci that harbor regulatory mutations, which cannot be detected using conventional WES as this technique targets only the exons in protein-coding genes. Because these regulatory regions are functionally important and have been subjected to selective pressure, they tend to be conserved during the course of evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, to ensure that the target capture procedure covers not only exons for protein-coding genes but also possible regions containing regulatory mutations, these regions, namely conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs), should be included in the target. Advances in vertebrate genome sequencing and subsequent comparative genomic analyses have made it possible to decipher such regions under strong selective constraints. Information about these regions can easily be retrieved from the multiple genome sequence alignments provided by the UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>One key step in a WES data analysis is the filtering of known single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are commonly observed in different individuals and hence thought not to be associated with a certain phenotype of interest. At this stage, filtering efficiency depends on the number of known SNVs commonly found in wild-type samples. The most popular data repository for these variants is dbSNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The number of rat SNVs in dbSNP (Build 146; November 24, 2015) is approximately 5.1 million, whereas 150.5 million and 99.5 million variants are registered for the human and mouse, respectively. This discrepancy has been considered a disadvantage with regard to rat exome analysis in comparison to human and mouse analyses. Fortunately, rapid progress in genome sequencing and the identification of sequence variations in several rat strains have recently been made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These resources concerning sequence variations in rat will allow an efficient focus on variants that might be responsible for a certain phenotype.</p><p>Here, we describe the development of a novel rat target capture probe set, TargetEC (target capture for exons and CNSs). This probe set covers not only the annotated exons for protein-coding genes but also CNSs, and thus allows the detection of variations in genomic regions important for regulatory functions. To evaluate its performance, we applied the TargetEC to two normal rat strains, WTC/Kyo and PVG/Seac. In addition, as a proof of concept, we also applied this probe set to two mutant rat strains to demonstrate its ability to identify causative mutations for the phenotypes: WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo, which exhibits a sparse and wavy hair (<italic>swh</italic>) phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and KFRS4/Kyo, which exhibits multiple phenotypes such as congenital cataract formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and ear malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This study describes a powerful method by which to identify the causative mutations of various phenotypes in rat strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of target capture regions for sequencing</title><p>RefSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and Ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used for gene annotation; these databases contain 18,573 transcripts for 17,168 genes with coverage of 39.0&#160;Mb of the genome, and 30,404 transcripts for 26,689 genes with coverage of 48.2&#160;Mb of the genome, respectively. By merging these two gene annotations, the genomic regions covered by these annotations increased slightly to 50.8&#160;Mb.</p><p>Many regions in the genome sequences of vertebrate species exhibit a very high level of conservation, suggesting that selective pressure has acted on these regions to ensure certain functions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These regions are comprised of not only exons, but also CNSs. A certain fraction of CNSs might correspond to regulatory elements for gene expression, which are not well annotated even in the human and mouse genomes. By including these regions in target capture sequencing, it might be possible to identify regulatory mutations that would not be targets of conventional exome sequencing. In this study, we used phastCons scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which range from 0.0 (low conservation) to 1.0 (high conservation) and were calculated for the genome alignment of 13 vertebrate species (including rat as the reference genome) as an index for genome sequence conservation. We focused only on highly conserved regions with phastCons scores of 1.0, which accounted for 36.1&#160;Mb of the rat genome; of these, 5.4&#160;Mb did not overlap with exons. Here we must note that when designing capture probes, shorter regions must be expanded to at least 100&#160;bp to ensure efficient target region capture. Because non-exonic conserved regions (median: 5&#160;bp) tend to be shorter than exonic regions (median: 132&#160;bp for RefSeq exons), the inclusion of non-exonic conserved regions drastically affects the total lengths of the capture probes. Mainly for this reason, we focused only on regions with phastCons scores of 1.0 for CNS capture. By merging these regions (i.e., exons and CNSs) and expanding the minimum length of the regions to 100&#160;bp, we obtained initial target regions (588,195 regions, total&#8201;=&#8201;137.9&#160;Mb). After optimizing the probe design using the manufacturer&#8217;s internal protocols, we finally obtained target regions for TargetEC (1,078,129 regions, total&#8201;=&#8201;146.8&#160;Mb) that were subsequently applied to capture probe design using the SeqCap EZ Developer Library product from Roche NimbleGen.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A genome browser view illustrating genome sequence conservation around <italic>Cyp26a1</italic>.

In other words, the target capture kit can be used not only to detect SNVs and small INDELs within the target regions, but also to identify large deletions that contain target regions. To quantitatively assess the ability to detect large deletions using TargetEC, we measured the proportion of genomic regions in which large deletions of various lengths could be detected using the TargetEC probes, and compared the result with that of a hypothetically designed conventional exome probe that only targets exonic regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The probe intervals in TargetEC suggest that a 100-kb genomic deletion could be detected in 93.4&#160;% of the entire genome, whereas this value decreased to 57.7&#160;% using the conventional exome design. Similarly, a 10-kb genomic deletion could be detected in 63.8&#160;% of the entire genome with TargetEC, whereas this value decreased to 24.1&#160;% of the genome using the conventional exome design. We also measured the proportion of the CNSs that are located close vicinity to annotated exons. Those CNSs might be sequenced even by conventional exome design because of the insert size of the library in exome experiments (typically around 250&#160;bp). We found that only 6.1&#160;% of CNSs (41,393 out of 677,605 CNS regions) are located within 250&#160;bp to the closest exons. This means that about 90&#160;% of CNSs can not be covered by conventional exome design.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Proportion of genomic regions that can detect various deletion lengths.

The obtained reads have been deposited in a public database (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive accession number: DRA004543). WTC/Kyo and PVG/Seac were used as control strains for WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo and KFRS4/Kyo, respectively, both of the mutant strains exhibit prominent phenotypes (for details, see NBRP-Rat homepage: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anim.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nbr/">http://www.anim.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nbr/</ext-link>). The total numbers of bases obtained just after sequencing ranged from 33.2 Gb (PVG/Seac) to 37.6 Gb (WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo). These reads were mapped onto the rat genome (rn5; March 2012), and more than 99.1&#160;% of the bases appeared to be mapped in all four samples. After removing duplicated reads, 85.2&#8211;94.2&#160;% of the initially-obtained reads were retained as final mapped reads. Of these reads, more than 78.3&#160;% of the initially-obtained reads were mapped onto target regions. Because we obtained a rather high number of reads, the average depth of coverage in the target regions ranged from 108.0 (WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo) to 125.3 (KFRS4/Kyo). In all four samples, more than 99&#160;% of the target regions were covered with a depth of &#8805;10. We constructed plots to analyze the relationship between the depth of coverage and the target regions covered with a certain minimum depth (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). For WTC/Kyo, 84.4&#160;% of the target regions were covered by at least 50 reads, and 97.9&#160;% by at least 20 reads. The coverage trends for the remaining three strains were very similar (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Here, we have to note that the median values of the insert size of the library range from 205 to 214&#160;bp. This means that significant fraction of pairs of reads overlap with each other especially for the samples sequenced with the read length of 251&#160;bp. We also measured the proportion of the target regions that was not covered by any reads in each of the four strains. This ranged from 0.15 to 0.17&#160;%. The proportion of the target regions that are not covered by any reads in all four strains was only 0.067&#160;%.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary statistics for sequencing and mapping</p></caption></table-wrap></p><p>According to the molecular phylogenetic trees of inbred laboratory rat strains constructed using microsatellite markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], WTC/Kyo, PVG/Seac, and the reference strain BN/SsNHsdMCW are widely separated on the tree, indicating a divergence in genomic sequences among these strains. Indeed, the polymorphic rate, measured by microsatellite markers, between WTC and BN/SsNHsdMCW was close to the highest value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In spite of this divergence, the sequence reads of all strains analyzed in this study mapped well on the reference strain, BN/SsNHsdMCW. This indicates that although the probe sequences were designed based on the BN/SsNHsdMCW reference strain, TargetEC can be applied to a wide range of commonly-used inbred laboratory rat strains for the systematic identification of mutations in regions with functional importance (i.e., exons and CNSs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Variant identification</title><p>We next applied variant calling procedures to mapped reads for SNV and INDEL identification (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Here we only considered mutations identified in target regions with a coverage depth of &#8805;10. In all groups of regions (i.e., CDS, UTR, and CNS), the numbers of SNVs and INDELs were higher in WTC/Kyo and WTC-swh/Kyo than in PVG/Seac and KFRS4/Kyo, which was derived as a congenic strain using PVG/Seac as an inbred partner strain. This finding indicates a higher level of genetic divergence in BN/SsNHsdMCW vs. WTC/Kyo than in BN/SsNHsdMCW vs. PVG/Seac. This result is consistent with the genomic differences measured using polymorphisms determined by 357 microsatellite markers, in which the rates of polymorphic markers in BN/SsNHsdMCW vs. WTC/Kyo and in BN/SsNHsdMCW vs. PVG/Seac were 89 and 85&#160;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We also compared the SNVs identified in WTC/Kyo and PVG/Seac (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We omitted the other two strains from this analysis as each was similar to either of the analyzed strains. We found that 54.4&#160;% of SNVs in WTC/Kyo and 60.8&#160;% of those in PVG/Seac were common between WTC/Kyo and PVG/Seac. The ratios of common SNVs in each group of regions (i.e., CDS, UTR, CNS, and other regions) were highly similar to those among the total identified SNVs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio ranged from 3.56 to 3.66 in CDS, whereas the ranges for UTR and CNS were smaller (2.43&#8211;2.48 and 2.30&#8211;2.37, respectively). These values are consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The higher Ti/Tv ratio in CDS might be mainly attributed to codon degeneracy, i.e., the third position of a two-fold degenerate codon is always purine (A/G) or pyrimidine (C/T). We also calculated the numbers of mutations in various coverage depths (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary statistics for SNV and INDEL</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>

Although we designed our capture kit to cover only exonic regions and CNSs (phastCons score&#8201;=&#8201;1.0), it also covered some flanking regions because of the expansion to a minimum length of 100&#160;bp and optimization of hybridization using the manufacturer&#8217;s internal protocols. Accordingly, approximately 60&#160;% of the residues in the target could not be classified as CDS, UTR, or CNS. In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, we present our results for the WTC/Kyo strain, but note that the results for the other three strains were almost identical (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Our findings clearly indicate that mutations are highly suppressed among CNSs and CDSs, whereas fewer constraints are placed on UTR; in contrast, the remaining regions are relatively susceptible to mutations.</p><p>To further analyze the relationship between the mutation frequencies and selective pressure acting on each genomic region, we plotted SNV density as a function of the phastCons score (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). As expected, we observed a clear negative correlation between the SNV density and phastCons score. Although phastCons scores are calculated for genome alignments of vertebrate species, which include not only mammals but also chicken and zebrafish, the existence of a negative correlation between the SNV density and phastCons score indicates a similar trend of selective pressure among different strains of rats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Validation of TargetEC for the identification of known causative mutations</title><p>To validate whether our approach could detect the causative mutations of certain phenotypes, we analyzed mutations identified by TargetEC in the WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo and KRFS4/Kyo strains.

We identified a total of 151,981 SNVs and 28,870 INDELs. After subtracting the known variants registered in dbSNP (Build 138; April 25, 2013), 46,737 SNVs and 28,378 INDELs remained. These variants were further filtered using information from the linkage analysis, yielding a final total of two SNVs and two INDELs. One of these was a non-synonymous variant in the CDS of <italic>Edaradd</italic>. By evaluating the functional protein-level consequences of these mutations using the PolyPhen-2 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], the C to T transition mutation in the last exon of <italic>Edaradd</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which changes proline to serine at codon 153 of the EDARADD protein, was predicted to be a damaging mutation. Indeed, this mutation was previously identified as causative for the HED phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Validation of the causative mutation for HED in the WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo strain. A C-to-T transition mutation, which was previously confirmed as a causative mutation for HED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], was identified in the <italic>Edaradd</italic> gene. The locus is compared with that of the normal strain (WTC/Kyo)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2975_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Next, we sought to validate whether this method could successfully detect the causative mutation for cataract development in the KFRS4/Kyo strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. By linkage analysis, the mutation responsible for the cataract phenotype was mapped to an interval of 9.7&#160;Mb on chromosome 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which contains about 150 genes. We identified 134,604 SNVs and 25,578 INDELs in the KFRS4/Kyo strain. The numbers of variants were reduced to 49,747 SNVs and 25,190 INDELs after filtering out known variants. Among these, 234 SNVs and 72 INDELs were located in the 9.7-Mb interval identified by the linkage analysis. <italic>Mip</italic>, one of the genes in this region, has previously been identified as a causative gene because of its known role in cataracts in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and an observed 5-bp insertion in KFRS4/Kyo was predicted to have a severe effect on the protein product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Among the 72 INDELs identified by the TargetEC reads obtained for KFRS4/Kyo, we also observed the same 5-bp insertion in exon 1 of <italic>Mip</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), indicating that the TargetEC method can detect the causative mutation for cataract formation in KFRS4/Kyo.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Validation of mutations in the KFRS4/Kyo strain.

A 5-bp insertion, which was previously reported as the causative mutation for cataracts in KFRS4/Kyo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], was identified near the end of exon 1 of the <italic>Mip</italic> gene. <bold>b</bold> Deletion of a CNS responsible for congenital ear malformation in KFRS4/Kyo. This deletion, which was previously identified as the mutation responsible for congenital ear malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], was located approximately 80-kb downstream of the <italic>Hmx1</italic> gene</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2975_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>The KFRS4/Kyo strain also exhibits other phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. One such phenotype is congenital ear malformation, also known as the &#8220;dumbo&#8221; phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although the responsible locus was mapped to a 6-Mb interval on chromosome 14, which contains the <italic>Hmx1</italic> gene, no coding changes were identified in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; eventually, deletion of a conserved regulatory element for <italic>Hmx1</italic>, located approximately 80-kb downstream of the gene, was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Here, we applied the MACS2 program, which is usually used for peak calling in ChIP-seq experiments, to the mapped reads of KFRS4/Kyo and the control strain PVG/Seac in order to systematically identify large deletions as differences in the accumulated reads. We identified 6554 peak regions specific for PVG/Seac, which were hence thought to be KFRS4/Kyo-specific deletions. Of these peaks, 15 were located within the 6.0-Mb interval on chromosome 14; the most significant, according to the ratio of read numbers, was the deletion located approximately 80-kb downstream of <italic>Hmx1</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), which exactly corresponds to the deletion identified in the conserved regulatory element for <italic>Hmx1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we designed a novel target capture probe set, TargetEC, for rat genome analysis. This probe set not only covers exons for all annotated genes but also covers regions that are highly conserved across vertebrate species. Although the span of covered regions (146.8&#160;Mb) is approximately three times larger than that covered by conventional human (58.0&#160;Mb; Agilent Human All Exon V6) and mouse (49.6&#160;Mb; Agilent Mouse All Exon) exome probes, it can potentially identify regulatory mutations that cannot be detected using conventional exome strategies. Another advantage associated with the inclusion of conserved regions is that most genic regions will be covered even without explicitly using gene annotation information. This can be a great advantage, especially for organisms with poorly annotated genes.</p><p>Regarding variants identified in coding regions, predictions of functional consequences are rather straightforward because several types of mutations, including synonymous, non-synonymous, inframe stop, and frameshift mutations exist, and each has different effects on the protein products. Indeed, several existing programs can classify these types of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and predict the severity of the mutant phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. On the other hand, predicting the effects of variations in non-coding regions might not be an easy task. This might explain why non-coding regions have not been previously analyzed using conventional target capture methods (i.e., exome analysis), although a certain fraction of disease-associated mutations are known to be located in non-coding regions (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). In this study, we included both CNSs and exons as capture targets. These CNSs may be plausible targets for regulatory mutations because of the high conservation among vertebrate species, which implies the action of strong negative selection on these sites. Validation of the ability of our target capture kit to detect mutations in the regulatory element of <italic>Hmx1</italic> suggests that this kit can be a powerful tool for the detection of regulatory mutations, which are not currently well annotated in genome databases. To evaluate the functional relevance of CNS mutations in the rat, we can incorporate information about epigenomic states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] such as H3K4me1, the histone modification associated with enhancers in the human and mouse, by transferring this information to corresponding regions in the rat genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Given the number and the total length of CNSs, huge amounts of regulatory mutations might be responsible for certain phenotypes because mutations in non-coding regions only alter the spatio-temporal expression of target genes while maintaining the function of the protein products. On the other hand, critical mutations in coding regions completely change the functions of protein products, which might lead to severe or often lethal phenotypes.</p><p>In conventional exome analysis, information about SNPs helps to narrow down the number of candidate mutations. In humans, the number of SNPs registered in dbSNP has increased rapidly, and continues to increase further as a result of progress in genome sequencing projects for individuals such as the 1000 Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, the number of SNPs identified in rat is far less than those in the human and mouse. However, recent continuous and steady progress has been made in the field of rat genome resequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The genome resequencing of closely-related reference strains has yielded massive and valuable information about genetic variations in the rat. Exome sequencing of many sample strains represents another possible approach to overcoming this shortfall of information about genetic variations in the rat. In fact, this strategy was adopted in the pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes Project, where more than half of the samples were subjected to exome sequencing to reveal rare variations in a cost-effective manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Following this strategy, the application of TargetEC to a large stock of mutant strains, such as that stored by NBRP-Rat in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], would be useful for the collection of common and rare variations in functionally important regions and would therefore facilitate the identification of mutations responsible for certain phenotypes in mutant strains. This type of analysis is our future aim. The data obtained during this analytical course would be disclosed to public repositories, and would thus be of potential value to the rat genetics and genomics research communities.</p><p>One of the drawbacks for TargetEC is that the total length of the covered regions is approximately three-fold greater than that achieved with a conventional exome kit (e.g., a widely used human exome capture kit). Although a three-fold higher number of reads is needed to obtain the same depth of coverage as those obtained by conventional exome sequencing, the total length of the target regions remains 20-fold less than the entire genome, thus confirming the feasibility of this strategy relative to whole genome sequencing (WGS) when seeking relevant mutations for certain phenotypes. Moreover, rapid growth in sequencer performance will render the TargetEC strategy an even more affordable option for the detection of variations not only in exonic regions, but also in functionally important CNSs.</p><p>To experimentally confirm the involvement of a candidate mutation identified by target capture sequencing, we can use a gene knockout procedure that was recently established for rats. An early <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis-based method was devised for knockout rat generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. With the recent emergence of genome editing technology, it is more feasible to implement genomic modifications in rats to analyze the phenotypic effects of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In these circumstances, TargetEC can be applied to laboratory rats that exhibit various disease phenotypes; the resulting experimental confirmation of the involvement of the identified mutations would shed light on the genetic cause underlying these mutants and promote mechanistic insights into the disease etiology.</p><p>This design strategy (i.e., targeting both exonic regions and CNSs) can easily be applied to human samples for the detection of regulatory mutations associated with certain phenotypes. Moreover, TargetEC developed in this study might have a potential to be directly applied to cross-species capture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], for example, for other rodents, because it covers all the regions that are highly conserved (phastCons score&#8201;=&#8201;1.0) among vertebrates, although we need further evaluation of experimental conditions and performance for such purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The target capture design reported herein can potentially be used to identify additional mutations responsible for various phenotypes in the rat, which is a suitable model organism for comparative studies of diseases and other traits. The potential mutations include not only those in coding regions but also those in CNSs, which might correspond to regulatory mutations. By further analyzing these mutations, we will deepen our understanding of the relationships between the genotypic and phenotypic variations associated with regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Animals</title><p>WTC/Kyo (NBRP Rat No. 0020), WTC-<italic>swh</italic>/Kyo (NBRP Rat No. 0287), PVG/Seac (NBRP Rat No. 0080), and KFRS4/Kyo (NBRP Rat No. 0572) rats were provided by the Japanese NBRP-Rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anim.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nbr/">http://www.anim.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nbr/</ext-link>) and maintained at the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, under a specific pathogen-free environment.

SAMtools (v0.1.12a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] was used for file format conversion and indexing.

To calculate basic statistics, we considered a read to be on target if the read overlap a target region by at least 1&#160;bp. Quality score recalibration was conducted with the BaseRecalibrator utility in the GATK, using known SNVs and small INDELs collected from dbSNP (Build 138; April 25, 2013).
