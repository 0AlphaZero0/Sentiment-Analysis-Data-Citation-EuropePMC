However, nonencapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>) have also been isolated globally, mainly in carriage studies. It is unknown if non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> evolve sporadically, if they have high antibiotic nonsusceptiblity rates and a unique, specific gene content. Here, whole-genome sequencing of 131 non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates sourced from 17 different locations around the world was performed. Results revealed a deep-branching classic lineage that is distinct from multiple sporadic lineages. The sporadic lineages clustered with a previously sequenced, global collection of encapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>) isolates while the classic lineage is comprised mainly of the frequently identified multilocus sequences types (STs) ST344 (<italic>n</italic> = 39) and ST448 (<italic>n</italic> = 40). All ST344 and nine ST448 isolates had high nonsusceptiblity rates to &#946;-lactams and other antimicrobials. Analysis of the accessory genome reveals that the classic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> contained an increased number of mobile elements, than Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> and sporadic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>. Performing adherence assays to human epithelial cells for selected classic and sporadic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> revealed that the presence of a integrative conjugative element (ICE) results in increased adherence to human epithelial cells (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). In contrast, sporadic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> lacking the ICE had greater growth <italic>in vitro</italic> possibly resulting in improved fitness. In conclusion, non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates from the classic lineage have evolved separately. They have spread globally, are well adapted to nasopharyngeal carriage and are able to coexist with Ec-<italic>Sp.</italic> Due to continued use of PCV, non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> may become more prevalent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pneumococcal isolates</kwd><kwd>whole-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>integrative conjugative elements</kwd><kwd>antibiotic nonsusceptibility</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is an important human pathogen usually surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule which is considered to be a major virulence factor. Some isolates do not possess a capsule and are referred to as nonencapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>). Although generally considered less virulent than encapsulated strains, non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> are also isolated from sterile sites and make up 10% of those isolated from the nasopharynx (<xref rid="evu263-B19" ref-type="bibr">Finland and Barnes 1977</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B6" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al. 2003</xref>). This may be an underestimate as non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> form small rough colonies on agar plates which might be overlooked. Furthermore, the proportion of pneumococci colonizing the nasopharynx of young children that are non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> may be increasing in the current era of vaccines directed against polysaccharide capsules (<xref rid="evu263-B35" ref-type="bibr">S&#225;-Le&#227;o et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Some non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> clones have been repeatedly isolated worldwide, particularly sequence types (STs) ST344 and ST448 indicating intercontinental spread that may reflect an adaptive advantage in transmission. These types are associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis (<xref rid="evu263-B31" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B34" ref-type="bibr">Porat et al. 2006</xref>). non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> are also particularly associated with cocolonization with other pneumococci in the nasopharynx, offering frequent opportunities for recombination (<xref rid="evu263-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brugger et al. 2009</xref>). Finally, non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> may be repositories of antibiotic resistance genes which could be transferred to encapsulated pneumococci (<xref rid="evu263-B24" ref-type="bibr">Hauser et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chewapreecha et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies of encapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>) have attempted to define the pan genome of the species, but the gene content of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> has not been systematically studied (<xref rid="evu263-B32" ref-type="bibr">Obert et al. 2006</xref>). Genes exclusively and consistently present in non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> (i.e., part of the core genome in this group, but not in other pneumococci) may be an adaptation for colonization in the absence of capsule. Sequencing of the capsule region of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> has revealed the presence of coding sequences (CDS) named <italic>aliB</italic>-like open reading frame (ORF)1 and ORF2 due to their homology to <italic>aliB</italic> which encodes the substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter for branched-chain amino acids (<xref rid="evu263-B23" ref-type="bibr">Hathaway et al. 2004</xref>). <italic>AliB-like</italic> ORF1 and ORF2 have recently been shown to play a role in sensing and responding to peptides in the environment (<xref rid="evu263-B9" ref-type="bibr">Claverys et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hathaway et al. 2014</xref>). Both <italic>AliB</italic> and <italic>AliB-like</italic> ORF2 have been reported to play a role in colonization (<xref rid="evu263-B28" ref-type="bibr">Kerr et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hathaway et al. 2014</xref>). <italic>AliB-like</italic> ORFs have also been found in the capsule region of the closely related species <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae</italic> as well as preceding the capsule genes in pneumococci of serotypes 25F and 38 (<xref rid="evu263-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bentley et al. 2006</xref>). <xref rid="evu263-B36" ref-type="bibr">Salter et al. (2012)</xref> found another novel gene, a putative surface-anchored protein in place of capsule genes which was designated <italic>nspA</italic>. The same gene was called <italic>PspK</italic> and was revealed to increase adherence to epithelial cells within other studies (<xref rid="evu263-B33" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B27" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to employ whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis to define the phylogenetic population structure of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> and their relationship to Ec-<italic>Sp.</italic> We aimed to reveal whether non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> are members of a separate lineage from Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> and whether there are non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>-specific genes which might shed light on the mechanism of colonization and which we investigated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. We were also interested in the possible role of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance and so determined the resistance of the strains to a panel of antibiotics and investigated the alleles of relevant genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sequencing of a Reference Isolate</title><p>We sequenced the non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolate 110.58 (ST344) on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform to obtain a fully assembled reference genome. Sequence assembly yielded one major contig of 2.29 Mb and three small contigs at low coverage. The major contig was subsequently closed by running a second assembly. This was used as the reference sequence for subsequent analysis and has the accession number CP007593. The reference genome 110.58 consisted of 2,287,774 bp (39.7% GC content). Gene prediction and annotation was performed using Prodigal (version 2.60) and RAST server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rast.nmpdr.org/">http://rast.nmpdr.org/</ext-link>, last accessed December 1, 2014), respectively.

The isolates were checked for the presence of contamination by growing on blood agar plates and colony purified. Subsequently, optochin susceptibility was determined for all isolates followed in case of optochin resistance, by testing of bile solubility. In addition, the absence of <italic>cpsA</italic> was verified by real time polymerase chain reaction using the primers as described (<xref rid="evu263-B21" ref-type="bibr">Hathaway et al. 2007</xref>). The optochin susceptibility and bile solubility tests are consistent with the species assignment of <italic>S. </italic><italic>pneumoniae</italic>, whereas the absence of <italic>cpsA</italic> is consistent with the presence of a true, nonencapsulated isolate, that is, an isolate without the first gene of the capsule operon. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for all isolates except the nine from Australia for which only DNA was available. Disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin testing was performed using standardized methods (<xref rid="evu263-B11" ref-type="bibr">Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2012</xref>).

RD<sub>1</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 contains 35 COGs for the majority of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> upstream of SPN23F08840 (translation initiation factor IF-3) which are absent in all Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu263-F4">fig. 4</xref>). More than half of the COGs (20; 56%) are annotated as hypothetical protein with unknown function. Among those remaining are mobilization and conjugation proteins indicating that the genes of RD<sub>1</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 are part of a mobile element. The functional importance of RD<sub>1</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 within non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> has yet to be revealed. However, the presence of RD<sub>1</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 had no influence on the adherence potential of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to Detroit nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu263-F6">fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><p>RD<sub>2</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 is situated between the ribosomal protein L33 (SPN23F21670; 110.58_2260) and a zinc ABC transporter (SPN23F2201; 110.58_2284). In contrast to RD<sub>1</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344, RD<sub>2</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 is present in non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> and Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> but there is considerable diversity. Among the genes which are uniquely present within non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> there is a beta galactosidase, an outer membrane lipoprotein and a putative zinc metalloprotease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T2">table 2</xref>). These genes replace an arginine deaminase system (ADS) which is found within the Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T2">table 2</xref>). ADS is thought to influence the arginine metabolism (<xref rid="evu263-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kloosterman and Kuipers 2011</xref>) and genetic inactivation of the ADS affects colonization and dissemination in mice (<xref rid="evu263-B38" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al. 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>High Antibiotic Resistance within non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic></title><p>An alternative hypothesis for the global success of ST344 and ST448 is a high antibiotic resistance in these clones. Therefore, 123 of the 131 isolates were tested for susceptibility to the main antibiotic classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). The three major genes which determine &#946;-lactam susceptibility or resistance are the penicillin-binding proteins found on either side of the &#8220;capsule&#8221; locus (<italic>pbp2x</italic> and <italic>pbp1a</italic>) and elsewhere in the genome (<italic>pbp2b</italic>). Therefore, we analyzed the sequences of all three <italic>pbp</italic> genes to determine allelic combinations associated with increased MIC toward penicillin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">supplementary figs. S2&#8211;S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p><p>Overall, the majority of ST448 and other classic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). In contrast, the classic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates of ST344 had a MIC of at least 0.06 &#181;g/ml but not more than 2.0 &#181;g/ml for penicillin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). This may indicate a well-adapted balance between a basic tolerance toward penicillin without having the cost for fitness loss as shown recently for isolates with very high penicillin resistance (<xref rid="evu263-B41" ref-type="bibr">Trzcinski et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>With regard to non-&#946;-lactam antibiotic resistance, 95% of ST344 isolates (<italic>n</italic> = 36) were resistant toward both tetracycline and erythromycin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). The presence of <italic>tet</italic>(<italic>M</italic>) was confirmed in all the tetracycline nonsusceptible isolates. However, three additional isolates carrying the <italic>tet</italic>(<italic>M</italic>) gene were found to be susceptible due to disruption of the gene leading to a frameshift mutation.</p><p>As for macrolide resistance, 36 isolates of the classic (ST344) and 7 of the sporadic lineages were fully resistant due to the presence of the <italic>ermB</italic> rRNA methylase. Four isolates initially presented erythromycin resistance but clindamycin susceptibility despite <italic>ermB</italic> being present. Subsequent erythromycin&#8211;clindamycin <italic>D</italic>-test revealed inducible expression of the resistance phenotype for these isolates. Additionally, five isolates presented intermediate erythromycin resistance due to the presence of the <italic>mel-mef</italic> efflux pump. The presence of the <italic>mel-mef</italic> efflux pump is normally not as strongly associated with sequence clades, an observation consistent with our data (<xref rid="evu263-B12" ref-type="bibr">Croucher et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). The <italic>ermB</italic> gene has been shown to be carried by the <italic>Tn</italic>917 or Omega resistance cassettes (<xref rid="evu263-B12" ref-type="bibr">Croucher et al. 2013</xref>). The same was true for the non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates for which the Tn917 and/or Omega resistance cassettes were identified within ICE<sub>2</sub><italic>Sp</italic>ST344 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu263-F4">fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>As for sulfa drugs, ST448 isolates were generally susceptible to trimethoprim&#8211;sulfamethoxazole with the exception of those from Thailand (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and Kenya (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Within these, resistance-conferring mutations were detected in the genes <italic>dyr</italic> (encoding dihydrofolate reductase) and <italic>folP</italic> (dihydropteroate synthase). For ST344 all but the oldest isolate of the collection (Alaska 1 from 1998) were resistant to sulfa drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>) indicating a worrying evolution of ST344 toward high antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary Rates within ST344 and ST448</title><p>Previous studies revealed that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> recombines at different rates across different lineages. In particular, it has been found that a specific NT-lineage (BC3-NT) identified in a refugee camp on the Thailand&#8211;Myanmar border had very high frequencies of uptake and donation of DNA fragments compared with encapsulated lineages (<xref rid="evu263-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chewapreecha et al. 2014</xref>). However, as BC3-NT strains clustered with the sporadic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> isolates within our global collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu263-F1">fig. 1</xref>), we wondered whether the classic ST344 and 448 had similar recombination rates to BC3-NT. Furthermore, we were interested in analyzing whether the hot spot for recombination differs from those previously published within different lineages. In order to determine recombination rates, whole-genome alignments were generated for ST344 and ST448 isolates using the PacBio sequenced genome 110.58 as a reference. We then calculated the rates of recombination in ST344 and ST448 as the ratio of the number of homologous recombination events to the number of mutations (<italic>r</italic>/<italic>m</italic>) according to previously described methods (<xref rid="evu263-B15" ref-type="bibr">Croucher et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evu263-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chewapreecha et al. 2014</xref>). The estimates for the <italic>r</italic>/<italic>m</italic> by recombination event per mutation were 0.18 (95% CI 0.12&#8211;0.26) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.02&#8211;0.28) for the ST344 and ST448 isolates, respectively. These values are lower than for the recently described, sporadic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>, BC3-NT for which <italic>r</italic>/<italic>m</italic> was 0.3 (<xref rid="evu263-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chewapreecha et al. 2014</xref>) and approximately similar as for multidrug resistant Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> PMEN14 (0.17), PMEN1 (0.1), and PMEN2 (0.17) (<xref rid="evu263-B12" ref-type="bibr">Croucher et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="evu263-B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The low <italic>r</italic>/<italic>m</italic> values within ST344 and ST448 are surprising as it is generally assumed that the absence of the capsule as a physical barrier facilitates DNA exchange (<xref rid="evu263-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chewapreecha et al. 2014</xref>). However, the low values suggest that the classic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> clones ST344 and ST448 are stable, fit and well adapted even though they lack the major virulence factor of the capsule.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombination Hotspots within ST448 and ST344</title><p>Despite a general absence of recombination in ST448, frequent recombination sites were detected for the isolates from Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and the refugee camp on the Thailand&#8211;Myanmar border (<italic>n</italic> = 8; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

A driving force for the latter is probably the high antibiotic consumption within the camp as the recombination hotspots are <italic>pbp2x</italic>, <italic>pbp2b</italic>, and <italic>pbp1a</italic>, genes involved in penicillin resistance. Recombination within these genes was also detected within the worldwide ST344 collection, though the evolution went the &#8220;opposite&#8221; way, that is, toward gaining antibiotic susceptibility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">supplementary fig. S6</ext-link>). The four outgroup isolates of this clone (Portugal 21, Switzerland 10, Portugal 9, Alaska 1) had a mean MIC for penicillin of 0.6 &#181;g/ml (&#177;0.2 &#181;g/ml) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Of the remaining ST344 isolates, all but two had lower penicillin resistance. This could be the result of opposing selection pressures: antibiotic-mediated selection versus the cost of acquiring resistance on strain fitness. However, as the number of sequenced isolates was limited, this inference may change with further sequencing. Penicillin-resistant strains have been shown previously to be less fit than susceptible strains in the absence of penicillin (<xref rid="evu263-B41" ref-type="bibr">Trzcinski et al. 2006</xref>). For the ST448 isolates, all but nine were fully susceptible to penicillin (eight isolates from Thailand and one from Australia; <xref ref-type="table" rid="evu263-T1">table 1</xref>). It is possible that there is a higher antibiotic pressure present in these two settings and therefore an expansion of a resistant subclone from within the susceptible lineage. Further hotspots of recombination affect choline-binding proteins like <italic>lytB</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">supplementary figs.

This is why a thorough understanding of the types of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> and their importance is urgently needed. Performing WGS of a global collection of non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> we clearly showed a distinct lineage of classical non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>. This lineage is dominated by, but not restricted to, ST344 and 448. The other non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> named here as &#8220;sporadic&#8221; cluster with encapsulated strains. Compared with Ec-<italic>Sp</italic>, classic non-Ec-<italic>Sp</italic> have a very high number of mobile elements (e.g., ICEs) resulting in an increased genome size and adherence to epithelial cells but a lowered potential of planktonic growth as shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">Supplementary methods</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">figures S1&#8211;S6</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evu263/-/DC1">tables S1-S4</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution online</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
