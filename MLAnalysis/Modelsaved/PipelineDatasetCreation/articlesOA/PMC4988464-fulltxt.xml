Consequently, this lipogenic enzyme has gained tremendous biomedical importance. The role of FASN and its inhibition is being extensively researched in several clinical conditions, such as cancers, obesity, and diabetes. X-ray crystallographic structures of some of its domains, such as &#946;-ketoacyl synthase, acetyl transacylase, malonyl transacylase, enoyl reductase, &#946;-ketoacyl reductase, and thioesterase, (TE) are already reported. Here, we have attempted an <italic>in silico</italic> elucidation of the uncrystallized dehydratase (DH) catalytic domain of human FASN. This theoretical model for DH domain was predicted using comparative modeling methods. Different stand-alone tools and servers were used to validate and check the reliability of the predicted models, which suggested it to be a highly plausible model. The stereochemical analysis showed 92.0% residues in favorable region of Ramachandran plot. The initial physiological substrate &#946;-hydroxybutyryl group was docked into active site of DH domain using Glide. The molecular dynamics simulations carried out for 20 ns in <italic>apo</italic> and <italic>holo</italic> states indicated the stability and accuracy of the predicted structure in solvated condition. The predicted model provided useful biochemical insights into the substrate&#8211;active site binding mechanisms. This model was then used for identifying potential FASN inhibitors using high-throughput virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute database of chemical ligands. The inhibitory efficacy of the top hit ligands was validated by performing molecular dynamics simulation for 20 ns, where in the ligand NSC71039 exhibited good enzyme inhibition characteristics and exhibited dose-dependent anticancer cytotoxicity in retinoblastoma cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human fatty acid synthase</kwd><kwd>dehydratase</kwd><kwd>comparative modeling</kwd><kwd>molecular docking</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type I fatty acid synthase (FASN), the cytosolic enzyme that synthesizes fatty acids, is present as a single integrated protein complex in animals.<xref rid="b1-bbi-10-2016-143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The molecular weight of this multifunctional enzyme is 270 kDa and is arranged in head-to-head orientation forming a homodimer. Structurally, each monomer unit has N-terminal domains consisting of &#946;-ketoacyl synthase, acetyl transacylase/malonyl transacylase, and dehydrase (DH), while the C-terminal domains are enoyl reductase, &#946;-ketoacyl reductase, thioesterase, and acyl carrier protein (ACP). Catalytic activity of the enzyme is initiated when a saturated acyl moiety is attached to the cysteine group of &#946;-ketoacyl synthase and the malonyl moiety is attached to 4-phosphopantetheine group of ACP, which acts as a flexible arm in substrate transfer.<xref rid="b2-bbi-10-2016-143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In prokaryotes and plants, Type II FASN catalyzes fatty acid biosynthesis and is present as individual proteins.</p><p>DH domain functions by removing the hydroxyl group from the &#946;-OH group from the fatty acid substrate carried by ACP to the different domains for the biosynthetic process producing fatty acids.

A grid box was set covering the volume of active site region with van der Waals radius scaling to 1.0 with partial cut-off of 0.25 to soften the potential for nonpolar parts of receptor, where other atoms are free of scaling. Glide standard precision mode, where the ligand sampling was set flexible, was used for the docking of substrate. Ligands were set to select only less than 300 atoms and less than 50 rotatable bonds with van der Waals scaling factor of 0.8 with partial cut-off of 0.15. Out of the 1000 poses generated per docking run, at least 10 poses per ligand were selected. The pose selection criterion was a minimum threshold of 0.5 kcal/mol in the postdocking minimization analysis. Glide score, an empirical scoring function, was used to find the affinity and binding mode of substrate, which uses OPLS 2005 force field as scoring function.

The total energy and the potential energy were found to be &#8722;477,196.42 and &#8722;586,776.71 kJ/mol. The trajectory was analyzed for 20 ns and found to remain stable throughout simulation process. The RMSD was plotted for 20 ns simulation and remains stable from 10 ns to the completion of 20 ns simulation with minimal standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 6D</xref>). Similarly, the compactness of the predicted structure was analyzed using radius of gyration plot. The protein remained compact throughout the simulation process within the limit of 1 &#197; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 9A</xref>), thereby not requiring extended production run.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrostatic potential and active site prediction</title><p>Electrostatic potential maps, solvent excluded, solvent accessible were also predicted for the modeled structure. These maps help in understanding the overall charge distribution and solvent accessibility of the predicted model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). This in turn helps in designing suitable ligands to active site cavity of predicted model. Previous studies point out that DH domain has conserved catalytic active site region formed by HIS<sup>878</sup> from first pseudo subunit and ASP<sup>1031</sup> of second subunit which is anchored by GLN<sup>1035</sup> among all species.<xref rid="b9-bbi-10-2016-143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Hence, the receptor grid box was set incorporating these residues along with other active site residues for docking.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate docking and postdocking simulation</title><p>The &#946;-hydroxybutyryl group was docked to modeled DH domain using Glide 5.8 (Schr&#246;dinger, LLC). The four-carbon &#946;-hydroxybutyryl is the initial substrate for DH domain during the seven-cycle synthesis of 16-carbon palmitate. LigPrep 2.6 (Schr&#246;dinger, LLC) was used to build the four-carbon substrate and was subsequently docked to respective active site. The docking score for &#946;-hydroxybutyryl-DH domain was &#8722;4.67 kcal/mol, and the docking energy was &#8722;14.07 kcal/mol. The oxygen group of the substrate shows strong hydrogen bonding with GLN<sup>1035</sup> backbone atom, which assists in anchoring ASP<sup>888</sup> that in turn is involved in substrate &#946;-OH quenching. The substrate also forms hydrogen bond interactions with ALA<sup>888</sup> and ASP<sup>1031</sup> side chain residues, which are the main hydroxyl abstracting residues from the substrate during the catalytic reaction. The substrate also fitted well between the two nonidentical pesudodimeric domains along the helix tunnel. These interactions collectively infer that substrate to be docked well within the main catalytic diad residues that are involved in the enzymatic process, indicating the proper and stable docking of the substrate. Furthermore, few weak interactions were also observed in the active cavity bound with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p>Now to understand the stability of holo enzyme and the most favorable binding mode with its substrate, MD simulation was carried out for 20 ns using Desmond. The protein showed negative charge of &#8722;8 and the substrate with 0. Therefore, the system was built and neutralized by adding eight Na<sup>+</sup> ions at 12.162 mM concentration. The total energy and the potential energy were found to be &#8722;665,529.48 and &#8722;816,135.84 kJ/mol. RMSD graphs were plotted to understand the changes in active site region of the protein after substrate docking. The RMSD mean of 2.689 &#197; with an SD of 0.298 &#197; was observed during the 20 ns simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 6A</xref>). The results showed no significant increase in deviation till the completion of 20 ns. Similarly, the substrate also remained intact with the protein throughout 20 ns simulation showing lesser deviation when comparing with the <italic>apo</italic> form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 6D</xref>). This implies that the substrate has fitted well in its actual active site confining to the proper holo structure with the substrate complex. The substrate showed very good H-bond interaction with the important catalytic diad residue ASP<sup>1031</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 5A</xref>). The radius of gyration was also calculated for the complex structures having 0.699 &#197; deviation with an SD of 0.123 &#197;, which showed the highly compact nature of these proteins during the entire 20 ns of MD simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 9B</xref>) Furthermore, the docked complexes showed very minimal deviation from their original conformations obtained from apo protein and were within the limit of 1 &#197;.</p><p>All these findings strongly suggested the high stability of predicted DH domain. Presubstrate binding and postsubstrate binding generated RMSF graphs that clearly showed the decrease in overall flexibility of the residues in <italic>holo</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 10B</xref>). The RMSF analysis further revealed that no residues went beyond the value calculated for <italic>apo</italic> enzyme. All these results imply good quality of the predicted model, which can be used to understand structure&#8211;function relationships and new ligand identification. The backbone H-bond interaction with ALA<sup>888</sup> was observed with substrate and maintained for 92% of simulation time of 20 ns. Furthermore, side chain H-bond interaction with ASP<sup>1031</sup> was observed for 99% of simulation time and also with TYR<sup>999</sup>. Additionally, the presence of few hydrophobic interactions with the residues present in the tunnel region indicated the proper docking and placement of the substrate (similar to native state conformation at the start of the simulation period) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-bbi-10-2016-143">Figs. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-bbi-10-2016-143">8A</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>HTVS and postdocking analysis of anti-cancer ligands</title><p>Postoptimization using LigPrep, the 231,617 compounds available in the NCI database were sequentially docked against human fatty acid DH domain using Glide.

Even though the second ligand NSC201397 showed 0 violation with Lipinski&#8217;s and Jorgensen&#8217;s rules, it showed high predicted activity to CNS.

So the system was equilibrated by adding nine Na<sup>+</sup> ions of concentration 12.35 mM. Energy minimization and dynamic simulation were performed for 20 ns. The RMSD backbone deviation of 2.94 &#197; was observed, and followed by the mean RMSD of 2.02 &#197; with an SD of 0.4 &#197; was observed during 20 ns simulation period for the DH protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 6B</xref>). The ligand RMSD was found to have lesser deviation with the protein backbone indicating that protein and ligand are in stable conformation without much deviation during simulation period. The interaction diagram of ligand with the protein residues during simulation indicates that 91% H-bond interaction with the side chain of TYR<sup>999</sup>, 99% side chain H-bond with GLN<sup>1035</sup>, which anchors one of the main catalytic diad residues ASP<sup>1031</sup> in the native state for the proper catalytic activity, and 96% H-bond with backbone of ALA<sup>888</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 7B</xref>).<xref rid="b5-bbi-10-2016-143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Ligand contact map also indicated that ionic interaction were observed with His<sup>878</sup>, an important substrate proton quencher and H-bond contacts with ALA<sup>888</sup>, TYR<sup>999</sup>, TYR<sup>1001</sup>, ASP<sup>1031</sup>, and GLN<sup>1035</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 8B</xref>). More water bridges mediated ligand and protein interaction stabilization with residues ARG<sup>883</sup>, PHE<sup>886</sup>, TYR<sup>891</sup>, GLN<sup>921</sup>, ARG<sup>997</sup>, and PRO<sup>1049</sup>. NSC71039&#8211;enzyme complex RMSF was found to be lesser than 1.2 &#197;. The RMSF plot indicates that important residues and helix tunnel involved in the substrate binding remains to be less fluctuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 10C</xref>). The Rg deviation was found to be 0.639 &#197; with an SD of 0.141 &#197; indicating that enzyme complex is in good compact state without much deviation during the simulation with the ligand&#8211;NSC71039 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 9C</xref>).</p><p>Using simulation studies, the second selected inhibitor NSC201397 was studied for its complex with the DH enzyme over 20 ns. The protein had a charge of &#8722;8 and ligand with 0 charge, so eight Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added with concentration of 10.977 mM. Energy minimization was carried out and proceeded to dynamic simulation for 20 ns. The RMSD graph for the complex indicates converging after 10 ns throughout the simulation period. The backbone RMSD shows the deviation of 3.2 &#197; with a mean and SD of 2.243 and 0.474 &#197;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 6C</xref>). The ligand RMSD shows lesser deviation with the protein indicating a good binding nature of the ligand within the protein active site without much deviation from its positioning. The ligand contacts with protein indicated that even though the docking score was higher when comparing with the substrate, no stable H-bond interaction &gt;30% was formed with any of the important residue involved in catalysis or also with the tunnel region (Results not shown). Most of the hydrophobic contacts were formed with HIS<sup>878</sup>, LEU<sup>885</sup>, TYR<sup>891</sup>, LEU<sup>919</sup>, ALA<sup>922</sup>, LEU<sup>1048</sup>, PRO<sup>1049</sup>, and ALA<sup>1102</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-bbi-10-2016-143">Fig. 8C</xref>).
