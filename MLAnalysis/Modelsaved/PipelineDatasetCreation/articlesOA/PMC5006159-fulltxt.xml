Autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in SepSecS&#8211;Ala239Thr, Thr325Ser, Tyr334Cys and Tyr429*&#8211;induced severe, early-onset, neurological disorders in distinct human populations. Although harboring different mutant alleles, patients presented remarkably similar phenotypes typified by cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, seizures, irritability, ataxia, and extreme spasticity. However, it has remained unclear how these genetic alterations affected the structure of SepSecS and subsequently elicited the development of a neurological pathology. Herein, our biophysical and structural characterization demonstrates that, with the exception of Tyr429*, pathogenic mutations decrease protein stability and trigger protein misfolding. We propose that the reduced stability and increased propensity towards misfolding are the main causes for the loss of SepSecS activity in afflicted patients, and that these factors contribute to disease progression. We also suggest that misfolding of enzymes regulating protein synthesis should be considered in the diagnosis and study of childhood neurological disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>:selenocysteinyl-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> synthase (SepSecS; <italic>SEPSECS</italic>) is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the terminal reaction of selenocysteine synthesis. SepSecS converts the phosphoseryl (Sep) group into the selenocysteinyl (Sec) moiety in a mechanism that requires selenocysteine tRNA (tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>) and a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The product of SepSecS catalysis, Sec-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, is an obligate substrate for selenoprotein synthesis, thus suggesting that the catalytic activity of SepSecS is indispensable for the human selenoproteome integrity.</p><p>Recently, two research groups reported that four distinct mutations in human <italic>SEPSECS</italic> caused congenital cerebellar atrophy termed pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2D (PCH2D). Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting different cerebral structures, particularly the brainstem and cerebellum. Most PCH types result from mutations in genes important for tRNA splicing and aminoacylation and RNA transport&#8211;<italic>EXOSC3</italic> in PCH1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <italic>TSEN</italic> and <italic>SEPSECS</italic> in PCH2 and PCH4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <italic>RARS2</italic> in PCH6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and <italic>CLP1</italic> in PCH10<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In the first report, genome-wide sequencing revealed that patients were either compound heterozygous for Ala239Thr (A239T) and Tyr334Cys (Y334C) or homozygous for Y334C in <italic>SEPSECS</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although unaffected at birth, patients rapidly presented profound mental retardation, progressive microcephaly, severe spasticity, and seizures and typically survived to only 10&#8211;12 years of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Magnetic resonance imaging found evidence of progressive cerebellar atrophy followed by cerebral atrophy of both white and gray matter. In the second study, whole-genome sequencing revealed children suffering from progressive encephalopathy were compound heterozygous for missense Thr325Ser (T325S) and nonsense Tyr429* (Y429*) mutations in <italic>SEPSECS</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These patients similarly suffered from progressive cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, neonatal irritability, and debilitating spasticity. Neuropathological analysis revealed severe atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellar cortex with loss of both white and gray matter. This subset of patients also exhibited a slight reduction in selenoprotein levels, suggesting that SepSecS catalysis was impaired.</p><p>Given that <italic>SEPSECS</italic> is responsible for the formation of only 25 human proteins, its involvement in the development and progression of PCH2D is perplexing. The human selenoproteome is pivotal for the maintenance of the cellular redox potential (e.g. thioredoxin reductases), regulation of the overall metabolic rate (e.g. iodothyronine deiodinases), removal of reactive oxygen species and prevention of oxidative damage (e.g. glutathione peroxidases; GPx, and methionine sulfoxide reductases), and selenium homeostasis (e.g. selenoprotein P) (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The embryonic lethal phenotype of mice in which particular components of the selenocysteine-synthetic and decoding machinery were deleted demonstrates the importance of the selenoproteome to the mammalian organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Hence, studying how point mutations in <italic>SEPSECS</italic> exert cerebellar dysfunction will shed light onto the role of selenoproteins in the maintenance and development of the human brain.</p><p>Comparative analysis of protein sequences showed that these pathological mutations altered conserved residues in SepSecS. While Ala239 and Thr325 are conserved to a reasonable degree, both Tyr334 and Tyr429 are highly conserved in archaea and eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In addition, the crystal structure of human SepSecS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> provided a platform for studies on structural and functional effects of these point mutations. Previous structural work has shown that SepSecS is an obligate tetramer held by interactions between two homodimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Although the homodimer interface harbors four seemingly equivalent catalytic pockets and tRNA-binding sites, the enzyme can simultaneously bind, and presumably act on, only two tRNA substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. When bound to two tRNAs, one of the SepSecS homodimers always serves as a non-catalytic unit that binds Sep-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and positions the Sep group into the catalytic site of the neighboring catalytic dimer. It has been proposed that the A239T variant of SepSecS most likely lost the ability to bind tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, whereas the catalytic activity of the Y334C variant is likely diminished<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Furthermore, the premature stop codon in the Tyr429* variant would result in deletion of elements important for both the integrity of the active site and productive binding of tRNA<sup>Sec&#8201;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. By contrast, the T325S variant most probably would display only slightly reduced catalytic activity when compared to the wild type (WT) enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, because predictions derived from structural modeling are limited in their scope, the exact effect(s) of the pathogenic mutations on SepSecS function remained poorly understood. Given that <italic>SEPSECS</italic> mutations are the main cause of these severe cerebellar disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, insights into the structure of the mutant SepSecS enzymes may facilitate our understanding of disease etiology and progression.</p><p>Herein, we pursued a detailed characterization of four pathogenic variants of SepSecS by X-ray crystallography, transmission electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and other biophysical methods. Our findings show that Y429* expresses at low levels and is completely insoluble, while the A239T, T325S, and Y334C variants are prone to misfolding. The T325S and Y334C variants are capable of forming tetramers that bind tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, but these tetramers exhibit decreased stability. Our findings suggest that decreased protein stability and the tendency of the SepSecS variants to misfold are the underlying cause of cerebellar atrophy in afflicted patients.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mapping pathogenic mutations onto the structure of human SepSecS</title><p>The crystal structure of human SepSecS allows precise mapping of the mutations implicated in the development of early-onset neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Genome-wide sequencing identified patients as harboring either compound heterozygous A239T/Y334C or T325S/Y429* or homozygous Y334C mutations in <italic>SEPSECS.</italic> Ala239 is located in helix &#945;8 near the site that interacts with the variable arm of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, and is distant from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Ala239 is infrequently replaced with Ser in some species and is mostly conserved throughout eukaryotes and archaea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. We have previously postulated that the A239T variant would bind tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> with less affinity compared to WT SepSecS, but that its catalytic function would be unaffected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. On the other hand, Thr325 is located in helix &#945;12 and ~15&#197; away from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). While conserved in eukaryotes, archaeal orthologs utilize Ser at this position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. We hypothesized that the insertion of Ser in position 325 could introduce a kink in &#945;12, thereby altering both the orientation of PLP and the overall conformation of the active site in human SepSecS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These changes would presumably yield a mutant enzyme that binds the tRNA substrate with high affinity, but that is incapable of catalyzing the chemical reaction with the same efficiency as the WT enzyme. The side chain of Tyr334 is in helix &#945;13 near the active-site pocket. This particular residue is highly conserved in eukaryotes and archaea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Asn285, and this interaction may help stabilize a loop that carries Lys284 and the covalently attached PLP cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We speculated that the Tyr&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;Cys mutation would alter the architecture of the active site in the Y334C mutant enzyme, diminishing its catalytic activity but not its ability to bind to tRNA<sup>Sec&#8201;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Lastly, Tyr429 is located before strand &#946;14. Premature abortion of protein synthesis would yield a truncated enzyme devoid of strand &#946;14, loop &#946;14-&#945;15, and the C-terminal helix &#945;15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Loop &#946;14-&#945;15 establishes a side of the catalytic groove, and helix &#945;15 provides residues that bind the 5&#8242;-end of tRNA<sup>Sec&#8201;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Given these important functions, we hypothesized that the Y429* variant, even if it were to somehow adopt a proper quaternary structure, would not be capable of promoting selenocysteine synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pathogenic variants are less soluble than WT SepSecS</title><p>Although the exact location of the mutations was suggestive, their exact effects on the structure and function of the enzyme remained unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. This ambiguity prompted us to pursue biophysical characterization of the SepSecS variants. However, poor expression and insolubility hindered our efforts to obtain pure recombinant mutant protein constructs. Because pathogenic SepSecS variants were insoluble when expressed in BL21(DE3), they were subsequently transformed into SoluBL21(DE3), a bacterial strain engineered to increase solubility of recombinant proteins, and different growth and induction conditions were tested (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The expression of soluble A239T and Y334C was achieved at +20&#8201;&#176;C in LB supplemented with 0.4&#8201;M sucrose, whereas Y429* expressed at low levels and as insoluble protein regardless of the incubation temperature, induction point, or the growth media used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Due to insolubility of Y429*, we focused our efforts on characterizing A239T, T325S, and Y334C mutant enzymes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pathogenic variants of SepSecS co-purify with the bacterial chaperone GroEL</title><p>We have previously shown that the functional unit of SepSecS, able to bind tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and promote catalysis, is a homotetramer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. As pathogenic mutations may alter the structure of this functional core, we set out to determine if the variants can form a stable tetramer in solution.</p><p>First, we analyzed the composition of soluble fractions of the SepSecS variants on a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column. Our results show that all three variants exhibit an additional peak that elutes significantly earlier (~55&#8201;min) than the tetramer peak (~70&#8201;min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The A239T variant elutes exclusively in the &#8216;early&#8217; peak, as does the majority of Y334C. However, a miniscule fraction of Y334C does form tetramers. By contrast, only a small fraction of the T325S mutant enzyme is found in the &#8216;early&#8217; peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>.), and this fraction is less than that of A239T and Y334C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we analyzed the protein content of both peaks by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). The SDS-polyacrylamide (PA) gel revealed that the 70&#8201;min peak primarily consists of pure SepSecS, as indicated by a single band at ~60&#8201;kDa. However, the &#8216;early&#8217; peaks of A239T (A239T<sub>55</sub>), Y334C (Y334C<sub>55</sub>), and T325S (T325S<sub>55</sub>) are impure and consist of two major bands migrating at ~60&#8201;kDa and ~65&#8201;kDa. This led us to speculate that A239T<sub>55</sub>, Y334C<sub>55</sub>, and T325S<sub>55</sub> contain SepSecS (MW ~60&#8201;kDa) that co-purifies with the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL (MW ~65&#8201;kDa). To test this, we performed Western blot analyses using anti-GroEL and anti-His antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The blots confirmed that the ~60&#8201;kDa band is indeed SepSecS, that the ~65&#8201;kDa band is GroEL, and that GroEL is present in the &#8216;early&#8217; peaks only. In contrast, the same analysis of the tetramer fractions of the WT, T325S<sub>70</sub> and Y334C<sub>70</sub> did not reveal the presence of GroEL.</p><p>Further, we analyzed both the 55&#8201;min and 70&#8201;min peaks by blue-native (BN) PAGE. The aim was to visualize the oligomerization status of the variants and whether they are bound to GroEL. The WT SepSecS and T325S<sub>70</sub> and Y334C<sub>70</sub> assemble into tetramers, indicated by the band between 242&#8211;480&#8201;kDa (theoretical tetramer MW ~230&#8201;kDa). These fractions also exhibit higher-order oligomers (MW &gt;480&#8201;kDa), which appear as a ladder of bands extending to the top of the gel. In contrast, the A239T<sub>55</sub>, T325S<sub>55</sub>, and Y334C<sub>55</sub> samples contain a single band at ~720&#8201;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Western blotting using anti-GroEL antibodies confirmed that this ~720&#8201;kDa band contains GroEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Probing for His-tagged SepSecS in these fractions revealed that all variants exhibit a ladder-like appearance near the top of the gel, similar to the pure tetrameric samples (compare right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). However, in A239T<sub>55</sub> and Y334C<sub>55</sub> a distinct band at ~720&#8201;kDa that coincides with GroEL is present, thus implying that A239T and Y334C are bound to GroEL. Because A239T and Y334C do not exhibit bands between 242&#8211;480&#8201;kDa, we speculated that these variants are misfolded and thus incapable of assembling into functional tetramers. On the other hand, the banding pattern for T325S<sub>55</sub> almost exactly matches that of the WT SepSecS, T325S<sub>70</sub>, and Y334C<sub>70</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, lane 2), suggesting that T325S<sub>55</sub> adopts a tetrameric structure over time. It is also important to mention that both the native gels and Western blots indicated the presence of protein in the wells of the gel, implying that SepSecS variants may form even larger species (e.g. aggregates, oligomers) that are not amenable to electrophoretic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Lastly, Western blots of the native, but not SDS-PA gels (see above), showed that WT, T325S<sub>70</sub> and Y334C<sub>70</sub> contain some GroEL as well. However, unlike the SepSecS<sub>55</sub> fractions, the tetramers do not stably associate with GroEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Hence, we conclude that small quantities of GroEL represent the impurity that co-purified with SepSecS tetramers.</p><p>The visualization of the content of the 55&#8201;min and 70&#8201;min peaks using negative stain electron microscopy further corroborated our conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Namely, the 70&#8201;min peaks of WT, T325S, and Y334C contained homogenous SepSecS tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#8211;c</xref>), whereas the 55&#8201;min peaks of A239T, T325S, and Y334C showed particles whose size and shape are consistent with GroEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d&#8211;f</xref>) and in relative amounts consistent with that observed on the SDS-PA gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The A239T<sub>55</sub> and Y334C<sub>55</sub> samples almost exclusively showed these GroEL particles. The T325S<sub>55</sub> sample was more heterogeneous with aggregates and vesicular like particles with only a few GroEL particles.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Thr325Ser and Tyr334Cys do not affect the binding affinity of the SepSecS-tRNA complex</title><p>We have determined that, on average, one or two tRNAs bind to one SepSecS tetramer at a time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this study we asked whether tetramers of T325S and Y334C are capable of binding tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, in a similar manner as the WT enzyme. It is important to note that because A239T did not form stable tetramers, further biophysical characterization of this particular variant was not pursued. Because SepSecS binds unacylated tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> equally well as Sep-tRNA<sup>Sec&#8201;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and since it is challenging to synthesize stable Sep-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> in large quantities only unacylated tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> was used in this study.</p><p>To determine the stoichiometry of the mutant binary complexes we coupled a size-exclusion chromatography column to a SAXS detector (SEC-SAXS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The Guinier plot of the SAXS scattering data revealed the absence of higher-order oligomers and aggregates in both the T325S-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and Y334C-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Our data show that T325S-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and Y334C-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> complexes have a radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of 47.92&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.56&#8201;&#197; and 47.31&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.72&#8201;&#197;, respectively. These values are in agreement with the experimental R<sub>g</sub> of 48.54&#8201;&#197; for the WT binary complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we compared theoretical and experimental scattering curves for complexes containing various molar ratios between SepSecS and tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. Our results demonstrate that the experimental scattering curve derived from the mutant complexes superimposes well onto the theoretical scattering curve for SepSecS in complex with two tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, the crystal structure of the WT complex fits well into the SAXS envelopes of the mutant complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This argues that the previously observed arrangement of tRNAs bound to SepSecS and the architecture of the complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> is preserved in the T325S and Y334C variant tetramers. Based on the SAXS data, the T325S and Y334C mutations do not significantly alter the stoichiometry and architecture of the resulting binary complexes with tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tetramers of T325S and Y334C adopt the same structure as WT SepSecS</title><p>To establish whether mutations T325S and Y334C alter the structure of SepSecS, we solved crystal structures of holo T325S and the T325S-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and Y334C-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> complexes (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The binary complex crystals belonged to the trigonal space group and contained two SepSecS dimers and one tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> molecule in the asymmetric unit, whereas those of the holo T325S were of the orthorhombic space group with half of the SepSecS tetramer in the asymmetric unit (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>A global structural comparison showed that T325S and Y334C tetramers adopt the same structure as the WT enzyme (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). When all C&#945; atoms of the WT SepSecS were superimposed onto T325S and Y334C, low r.m.s.d. values of 0.97&#8201;&#197; and 0.98&#8201;&#197; were obtained, respectively. Inspection of the initial Fo-Fc electron density difference maps confirmed that Thr325 was substituted with Ser in the T325S variant (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) and that Tyr334 was replaced with Cys in Y334C (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). A closer inspection of the crystal structure revealed that the Thr325&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;Ser replacement does not cause any changes in the tetrameric structure of SepSecS (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Furthermore, we expected that replacing Tyr334 with a much shorter Cys residue would remove a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Tyr334 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asn285 (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This, in turn, could have resulted in repositioning of the PLP cofactor and presumably reduced catalytic activity of SepSecS. Surprisingly, in the Y334C crystal, the side chain of Cys334 coordinates two water molecules, which interact with the backbone carbonyl of Asn285 in the same fashion as the Tyr side chain in the WT enzyme (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that pathogenic mutations Thr325Ser and Tyr334Cys do not alter the three-dimensional structure of the SepSecS tetramer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pathogenic variants, T325S and Y334C, are less stable than the WT SepSecS</title><p>Our results suggest that T325S and Y334C mutations do not significantly alter the structure of the mutant tetramers or the stoichiometry and architecture of the binary complexes. The question then remains as to what caused the loss of SepSecS activity in patients harboring these variants. We hypothesized that T325S and Y334C could affect the overall stability of the variant tetramers.</p><p>To test this possibility, we used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to evaluate the melting curves of the tetrameric fractions of WT<sub>70</sub>, T325S<sub>70</sub>, and Y334C<sub>70</sub> SepSecS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The shape of the resulting melting curves for the variants is almost indistinguishable from that of the WT enzyme, but the corresponding melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The WT enzyme has a T<sub>m</sub> value of 70.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.0&#8201;&#176;C. While the tetrameric T325S<sub>70</sub> and Y334C<sub>70</sub> have T<sub>m</sub> values that are lower by ~5&#8201;&#176;C with T325S<sub>70</sub> having a T<sub>m</sub> value of 65.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8&#8201;&#176;C and Y334C<sub>70</sub> having T<sub>m</sub> of 64.6&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0&#8201;&#176;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We conclude that the Thr325Ser and Tyr334Cys mutations decrease the stability of SepSecS tetramers. Hence, the increased propensity of mutant enzymes to misfold and the decreased stability of the mutant tetramers may decrease the fraction of SepSecS molecules that can support selenoprotein synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies identified mutations in human <italic>SEPSECS</italic> as the cause of the development of severe disorders characterized by cerebellar atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Patients harboring A239T and Y334C mutant alleles and patients carrying T325S and Y429* all exhibited severe, progressive, cerebellar atrophy and other neurological damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Both studies suggested that loss of SepSecS activity may be the underlying cause of the observed pathological conditions, but there is little understanding for the mechanism of disease progression. In this study we examined how the pathogenic mutations in human <italic>SEPSECS</italic> affect the structure of the enzyme.</p><p>Our results revealed that the pathogenic SepSecS variants&#8211;A239T, T325S, and Y334C&#8211;are significantly less soluble than the WT enzyme. With the exception of Y429*, which never expressed to measurable quantities, expression of soluble variants required use of a specialized bacterial strain. Further, our results demonstrate that the majority of soluble A239T and Y334C associate with the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL, which is necessary for the proper folding of many bacterial proteins. Additionally, in a recombinant protein expression system GroEL may bind to the nascent recombinant protein to facilitate proper folding and to prevent accumulation of potentially toxic aggregates of misfolded proteins in the cell. Co-purification with GroEL suggests that the pathogenic variants of SepSecS have an increased propensity to misfold. The degree to which each of the variants co-purifies with GroEL was different, and thus could be used as an indirect measure of protein folding capability. For instance, A239T cannot be purified in the absence of GroEL, implying that this variant cannot fold into its native structure under the conditions tested. Indeed, soluble A239T does not adopt a tetrameric structure, a hallmark of catalytic SepSecS. In contrast, because only a small fraction of the T325S variant co-purifies with GroEL, it is likely the least damaging of the pathogenic variants. In contrast to the A239T variant, T325S contains a significant proportion of tetramers, and its fraction that co-elutes with GroEL is capable of adopting a tetrameric structure over time. While T325S in many ways resembles WT SepSecS, it is important to stress that this behavior was observed only when utilizing a bacterial strain engineered to enhance recombinant protein solubility (i.e. SoluBL21). Interestingly, tetramers of T325S and Y334C adopt the same structure. Taken together our data suggest that the A239T, T325S, and Y334C are likely to be completely inactive, partially active, and marginally active <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively. This analysis is in good agreement with the results of an indirect activity assay in the <italic>E. coli</italic> system that is based on the substitution of the bacterial selenocysteine synthase with the mutant human SepSecS enzyme. This activity assay indicated the A239T and Y334C mutations completely ablated enzyme activity, while the T325S mutation modestly diminished SepSecS activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, since tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is essential for mammalian development, it is reasonable to suggest that Y334C most likely exhibits marginal activity <italic>in vivo</italic> to explain the viability of the homozygous Y334C patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Furthermore, patients compound heterozygous for the T325S/Y429* exhibited a 15&#8211;40% decrease in selenoprotein levels compared to healthy patients. These data suggest that disease-causing mutations partially, but not completely, abolished SepSecS activity. In the case of the nonsense mutation, Y429*, we showed that SepSecS-Y429* expresses at extremely low levels as insoluble protein under all conditions tested. It is likely that the Y429* mRNA is targeted for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, while any truncated nascent polypeptide is targeted to the proteasome for degradation. A previous report using the <italic>E. coli</italic> activity assay found the Y429* variant to be completely inactive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Our studies enabled us to understand how particular mutations may affect the structure of SepSecS and selenoprotein synthesis. A239T and Y429* variants of SepSecS are most likely completely inactive due to their insolubility and inability to form productive tetramers. In contrast, T325S and Y334C are thought to be partially active since they are capable of forming soluble SepSecS tetramers that mimic the WT structure. The autosomal recessive inheritance of <italic>SEPSECS</italic> mutations in patients and the relative health of heterozygous parents harboring a single mutant allele suggest that one copy of WT SepSecS is sufficient for the development of a healthy organism. While loss of SepSecS activity would appear to be the most obvious effect of the mutations that contributes to disease pathology, this may not be their only detrimental effect. Native blot analysis of the GroEL-bound A239T and Y334C SepSecS variants suggested that they were misfolded and devoid of any tetrameric SepSecS. Thus, misfolding-induced cellular toxicity by the SepSecS variants may also play a role in disease pathology, especially considering that the brain is particularly susceptible to protein misfolding disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This is reminiscent of our recent report in which we suggest that misfolding of human glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) may be the cause of the early-onset neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Although unrelated enzymes, SepSecS and GlnRS are vital for protein synthesis with an important distinction is that GlnRS plays a more general role since glutamine is found in almost all proteins, whereas selenocysteine is limited to only 25 members of the proteome. Nevertheless, our results suggest that misfolding of enzymes involved in tRNA aminoacylation and protein synthesis could significantly impact both the development and maintenance of the brain.</p><p>Many questions still remain as to how decreased SepSecS stability contributes to disease progression. The importance of selenium to the brain is evident from animal studies demonstrating that the brain sequesters selenium at the expense of other organs during times of selenium deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This suggests that, although not dependent on a high level of selenium, the brain does require maintenance of selenium homeostasis at all times<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Still it is unclear why the cerebellum appears more susceptible to SepSecS mutations compared to other brain regions. A recent study, utilizing a neuronal-specific knockout of the murine tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene, yielded a phenotype characterized by severe cerebellar atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. A more specific knockout of the <italic>GPX4</italic> gene resulted in a less severe, cerebellar phenotype, suggesting that cerebellar development and maintenance may require particular selenoproteins. However, these studies did not directly examine the role of SepSecS in brain development. Additional studies investigating the status of the selenoproteome in cellular and mouse models in which <italic>SEPSECS</italic> is mutated are necessary.</p><p>Lastly, general questions about how defects in RNA processing contribute to PCH pathology remain unanswered. To date, there are 10 types of PCH. Mutations in 8 gene products, including SepSecS, which are involved in RNA processing and aminoacylation of tRNA have been implicated as the cause of PCH. Mutations in the <italic>EXOSC3</italic> gene, which encodes for a subunit of the RNA exosome, are responsible for PCH1B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Multiple subtypes of PCH2 and PCH4 are caused by mutations in <italic>TSEN</italic> genes that encode components of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. PCH6 is caused by mutations in <italic>RARS2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, which encodes the enzyme that charges mitochondrial arginine tRNA. Finally, PCH10 is caused by mutations in <italic>CLP1</italic>, a component of both the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex and the pre-mRNA cleavage complex II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Given that differential diagnosis of PCH is challenging due to the early onset of the disorder and rather uncharacteristic clinical presentation of symptoms, this list will almost certainly expand in the future. Indeed, at the time of writing additional two reports of autosomal-recessive cerebellar disorders due to mutations in <italic>SEPSECS</italic>, one of which detailed late-onset (adolescence) cerebellar degeneration, have been published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Currently, there are 12 known <italic>SEPSECS</italic> mutations that have contributed to disorders of cerebellar atrophy (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) causing much ambiguity in the literature regarding the nomenclature of <italic>SEPSECS</italic> phenotypes. A more unified understanding of the neurological phenotype caused by autosomal recessive inheritance of <italic>SEPSECS</italic> mutations would greatly aid understanding of disease progression and aid diagnosis.</p><p>Our study facilitates understanding of these childhood neurological disorders by demonstrating that disease-causing <italic>SEPSECS</italic> mutations destabilize protein structure and increase the propensity of SepSecS to misfold. Misfolding likely diminishes the catalytic activity of SepSecS and selenoprotein levels. Both insufficient selenoprotein levels and misfolded SepSecS may be responsible for the observed atrophy of cerebellar and cerebral structures. Further cellular and animal studies are necessary to delineate the roles of selenoprotein synthesis and misfolding in disease progression and understand why the cerebellum is particularly susceptible to mutations in <italic>SEPSECS.</italic></p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of SepSecS variants</title><p>Human <italic>SEPSECS</italic> was cloned into the pQE80 vector with an N-terminal His-tag.

Notably, in both the native gel and blots a substantial portion of protein does not enter the gel, suggesting that there may be higher order oligomers or aggregates species.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep32563-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Negative-stain electron microscopy of SepSecS WT, A239T, T325S and Y334C.</title><p>(<bold>a&#8211;c</bold>) Representative images of 70&#8201;min peak fractions of WT (<bold>a</bold>), T325S (<bold>b</bold>), and Y334C (<bold>c</bold>) indicating homogenous SepSecS tetramers.
