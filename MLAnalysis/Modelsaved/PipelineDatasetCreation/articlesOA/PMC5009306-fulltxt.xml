Here we found that the accumulation of the pathway intermediate cinnamic acid adversely affected pinocembrin production. Hence, a stepwise metabolic engineering strategy was carried out aimed at eliminating this pathway bottleneck and increasing pinocembrin production. The screening of gene source and the optimization of gene expression was first employed to regulate the synthetic pathway of cinnamic acid, which showed a 3.53-fold increase in pinocembrin production (7.76&#8201;mg/L) occurred with the alleviation of cinnamic acid accumulation in the engineered <italic>E. coli</italic>. Then, the downstream pathway that consuming cinnamic acid was optimized by the site-directed mutagenesis of chalcone synthase and cofactor engineering. S165M mutant of chalcone synthase could efficiently improve the pinocembrin production, and allowed the product titer of pinocembrin increased to 40.05&#8201;mg/L coupled with the malonyl-CoA engineering. With a two-phase pH fermentation strategy, the cultivation of the optimized strain resulted in a final pinocembrin titer of 67.81&#8201;mg/L. The results and engineering strategies demonstrated here would hold promise for the titer improvement of other flavonoids.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites, which have been of special interest due to their health-promoting benefits and their applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The pharmaceutical functions of these compounds have been linked to lower risks of many chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation and many other degenerative diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Pinocembrin (5,7-dihydroxyflavanone) shows a variety of biological properties and is one of the primary flavonoids isolated from a variety of plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Currently, pinocembrin is primarily obtained by extraction from plants, which is tedious and inefficient. Chemical syntheses also suffer from the demand for expensive substrates, catalyst instability and the production of isomers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. On the contrary, biosynthesis has several advantages, including the utilization of environmentally friendly feedstock, low energy requirements and low waste emissions. Therefore, biosynthesis-based pinocembrin production has emerged as an attractive approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Pinocembrin can be biosynthesized from the aromatic amino acid L-phenylalanine through four enzymatic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. L-phenylalanine is first deaminated to yield cinnamic acid by the action of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). The resulting cinnamic acid is converted to pinocembrin chalcone by 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) and chalcone synthase (CHS). Finally, pinocembrin chalcone is rapidly converted to pinocembrin under alkaline conditions or by chalcone isomerase (CHI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A number of studies have been published on the production of pinocembrin in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, because a multiple-gene pathway is required for the biosynthesis, the final yield of the compound is often limited by several deleterious effects, such as the low levels of available precursors or cofactors, the metabolic burden of heterologous protein production, or the accumulation of pathway intermediates that are inhibitory to the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To achieve a high yield of pinocembrin, researchers have focused mainly on redirecting the carbon flux to pathways responsible for the generation of malonyl-CoA in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In our previous study, we also found that overexpression of &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (FabF) could increase cellular malonyl-CoA levels and pinocembrin production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, this was accompanied by an accumulation of the intermediate, cinnamic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In this work, which used L-phenylalanine as an additive, we discovered that growth inhibition and a low pinocembrin titer were correlated with the accumulation of cinnamic acid, which has not been found before.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that imbalances within metabolic pathways could lead to the accumulation of intermediate metabolites in multiple-gene pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To address this problem, the combination of metabolic engineering and protein engineering has offered tremendous opportunities for customized optimization of multi-gene pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For example, Zhao and coworkers screened 18 gene combinations to decrease the dihydroquercetin accumulation and obtained a titer of 130.8&#8201;mg/L of catechin from 300&#8201;mg/L eriodictyol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. During naringenin biosynthesis, two additional copies of the CHS gene were introduced to alleviate the bottleneck downstream of coumaric acid, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in naringenin production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Similarly, changes in various promoters and gene copy numbers were combined to balance the upstream and downstream modules to produce a maximum titer of 1.02&#8201;g/L taxadiene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Through the <italic>in vivo</italic> evolution of stilbene synthase, the pinosylvin production was increased, which was accompanied by decreased accumulation of cinnamic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>In the present report, we found that the accumulation of cinnamic acid was disadvantageous for the pinocembrin production in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By screening heterologous gene sources of PAL and 4CL, we reduced the cinnamic acid level and obtained the optimized combination. Furthermore, PAL and 4CL were arranged into different plasmids to decrease the biosynthesis of cinnamic acid. Meanwhile, Site-directed mutagenesis of CHS and malonyl-CoA engineering strategy enabled further consumption of cinnamic acid and increase of pinocembrin production in <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The effect of cinnamic acid accumulation on pinocembrin synthesis</title><p>To induce the production of pinocembrin in <italic>E. coli</italic>, PAL from <italic>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, 4CL from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>A3 (2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, CHS from <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and CHI from <italic>Medicago sativa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> were both expressed in strain BL21 (DE3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, the BL21 (DE3) strain was successfully transformed with pET-YEPAL-SE4CL and pRSF-CHS-CHI. Furthermore, the different concentrations of L-phenylalanine ranging from 0&#8201;g/L to 2.00&#8201;g/L were added to identify the most suitable substrate concentration for pinocembrin production. When the cultures were supplemented with 0.50&#8201;g/L phenylalanine, the strain exhibited the maximum pinocembrin production of 1.71&#8201;mg/L. When the phenylalanine concentration was increased to 1.00&#8201;g/L, the pinocembrin production was unexpectedly decreased, but the level of cinnamic acid was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). With a further increase in phenylalanine concentration, the cinnamic acid level accumulated in the engineered strain was gradually increased and the pinocembrin production remained nearly unchanged. The OD<sub>600</sub> of the engineered strain was also decreased by the accumulation of cinnamic acid, and the final OD<sub>600</sub> was 2.82 in the cultures supplemented with 2.00&#8201;g/L phenylalanine.</p><p>Based on the above results, we speculated that the excessive accumulation of cinnamic acid <italic>in vivo</italic> might have a negative effect on pinocembrin production. To investigate the effects of cinnamic acid on pinocembrin production, the strain carrying pET-SE4CL and pRSF-CHS-CHI was constructed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, different concentrations of cinnamic acid ranging from 0&#8201;g/L to 0.44&#8201;g/L were added to the cultures to identify the suitable substrate concentration that permitted pinocembrin production. In the presence of 0.03&#8201;g/L cinnamic acid, the strain exhibited a maximum pinocembrin yield (6.83%). On the other hand, the strain displayed the highest pinocembrin production of 2.19&#8201;mg/L in the presence of 0.089&#8201;g/L cinnamic acid. Any further increase in the cinnamic acid concentration led to a decrease in the pinocembrin production. When the cinnamic acid concentration was increased to 0.44&#8201;g/L, the pinocembrin production was only 0.37&#8201;mg/L with a yield of 0.06%. Meanwhile, the OD<sub>600</sub> of the engineered strain was decreased as the cinnamic acid concentration increased, and the final OD<sub>600</sub> was 2.29 in the presence of 0.44&#8201;g/L cinnamic acid.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Optimization of the heterologous gene sources and expression to alleviate cinnamic acid accumulation</title><p>To alleviate the cinnamic acid overaccumulation, PALs and 4CLs from microorganisms and plants were screened for their effects.

Furthermore, we expressed the 4CL from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<italic>SE</italic>4CL) and <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> (<italic>PA</italic>4CL) because SE4CL favors cinnamic acid over <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid as a substrate, and <italic>PA</italic>4CL has a more diverse substrate specificity than other 4CL enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. CHS and CHI were cloned into the pRSFDuet-1 vector under the individual control of a T7 promoter, while different gene sources of PAL and 4CL were cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector. Therefore, four separate plasmids (pET-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL, pET-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL, pET-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL and pET-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL) were constructed as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary material</xref> and introduced into competent BL21 (DE3) cells harbored pRSF-CHS-CHI. Although the engineered strain carrying pET-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL and pET-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL accumulated 142.95&#8201;mg/L and 63.62&#8201;mg/L cinnamic acid, the strain carrying pET-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL and pET-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL showed reduced cinnamic acid level of 20.30&#8201;mg/L and 26.07&#8201;mg/L, respectively. In addition, the combination of the PAL from <italic>Bambusa oldhamii</italic> and 4CL from <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> proved to be the most productive pathway for pinocembrin biosynthesis, but only 2.34&#8201;mg/L pinocembrin could be detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To further decrease the cinnamic acid level, the expression levels of PAL and 4CL were altered by introducing the pTrc99a, in which the T7 promoter of pETDuet-1was replaced by a trc promoter and the copy number of the plasmids was the same (50 copies per cell). As we expected, the strains carrying pTrc-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL, pTrc-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL, pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL and pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL produced 35.84&#8201;mg/L, 28.68&#8201;mg/L, 15.47&#8201;mg/L and 21.53&#8201;mg/L cinnamic acid, respectively. The engineered strains produced 1.99&#8201;mg/L, 2.16&#8201;mg/L and 3.22&#8201;mg/L pinocembrin by using pTrc-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL, pTrc-<italic>YE</italic>PAL-<italic>BO</italic>PAL and pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>SE</italic>4CL, respectively. Notably, the strain carrying pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL led to a three-fold increase in the pinocembrin titer (up to 7.76&#8201;mg/L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). To determine whether the further decrease of cinnamic acid level had a positive effect on pinocembrin production, PAL and 4CL were cloned into the low-copy-number plasmids. When pACYC-Trc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-Trc-<italic>PA</italic>4CL and pRSF-CHS-CHI were biotransformed into the <italic>E. coli</italic>, the engineered strain only produced 1.36&#8201;mg/L pinocembrin and 5.16&#8201;mg/L cinnamic acid. The strain carrying pTrc-4GS produced 3.82&#8201;mg/L pinocembrin and 13.69&#8201;mg/L cinnamic acid. Moreover, no pinocembrin could be detected when the strain harbored pACYC-Trc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-Trc-<italic>PA</italic>4CL and pET-CHS-CHI. These results further suggested the accumulation of cinnamic acid would be adverse for pinocembrin production. Meanwhile, an appropriate cinnamic acid level in <italic>E. coli</italic> might be important for pinocembrin biosynthesis. Here, the strain carrying pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL exhibited the higher production and was used for the further investigation in the following study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Rational design of CHS to improve the CHS activity</title><p>We hypothesized that poor enzyme activity of CHS might limit the consumption of cinnamic acid, further affecting the biosynthesis of pinocembrin. With the aim of improving CHS activity for enhanced pinocembrin biosynthesis, we consulted the web-based service PROSITE to analyze the functional sites of known CHS enzymes. As a result, a conserved motif (RLMMYQQGCFAGGTVLR) of CHS was identified.

Fermentation studies demonstrated that there is an obvious correlation between the cinnamic acid and pinocembrin production within a certain range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The pinocembrin production and biomass were decreased as cinnamic acid accumulated, in spite of the addition of L-phenylalanine or cinnamic acid. The accumulation of cinnamic acid could be alleviated by reducing its biosynthesis and increasing its consumption.</p><p>First, we investigated the effect of four gene (PAL and 4CL) combinations on the cinnamic acid and pinocembrin production. PALs catalyze the deamination of phenylalanine to cinnamic acid and could be found in all higher plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The PALs from <italic>Bambusa oldhamii</italic> and yeast were selected as candidates because of their different activities when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Although 4CLs have been believed to be specific to plants, 4CL from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> shows more than 40% identity to plant 4CLs in the amino acid and favored cinnamic acid over <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid as the substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The 4CL from <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> displayed the highest pinocembrin production in a previous literature report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, 4CL from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> and <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> were used for the pathway with PALs. Results showed that the combination of <italic>BO</italic>PAL and <italic>PA</italic>4CL in the pinocembrin biosynthesis pathway was the most suitable configuration to yield high product titers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Although the level of cinnamic acid was significantly decreased (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), the difference in pinocembrin production was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). This might be ascribed to the level of gene expression and the burden associated with plasmid propagation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In previous studies, promoters of varying strength and plasmid copy numbers were utilized to adjust the gene expression levels and alleviate the metabolic burden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The promoter strength was estimated as T7&#8201;=&#8201;5, Trc&#8201;=&#8201;1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In addition, the gene copy numbers of pACYCDuet-1(p15A origin), pTrc99A (pBR322 origin), pETDuet-1 (pBR322 origin), and pRSFDuet-1 (RSF origin) that we used were 10, 40, 40 and 100, respectively. After using promoter and plasmid replacement strategy, the strain carrying pTrc-<italic>BO</italic>PAL-<italic>PA</italic>4CL showed a decrease of 85% cinnamic acid than the strain without pathway optimization. Meanwhile, the pinocembrin level displayed a 3.5-fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Protein evolution was crucial for the overall product titers, as the site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid 165 (S165M) increased the pinocembrin titer two-fold, whereas the cinnamic acid level remained almost the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Directed protein evolution could adapt the enzyme expression to the microbial host system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, there have been few reports about the CHS from <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. As part of our experiments performed to better understand the potential explanation underlying the catalysis of CHS, a conserved motif (RLMMYQQGCFAGGTVLR) of CHS from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was revealed by PROSITE. The consensus pattern of CHS was R-[LIVMFYS]-x-[LIVM]-x-[QHG]-x-G-C-[FYNA]-[GAPV]-G-[GAC]-[STAVK]-x-[LIVMF]-[RAL] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>), where C is the active site residue. However, S165 of CHS from <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> does not belong to the [FYNA]. F and A were nonpolar amino acid, whereas Y, N and S are all polar uncharged amino acids. The site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the positive effect of a nonpolar amino acid (A165 and F165) led to the accumulation of 13.05 and 12.62&#8201;mg/L pinocembrin, a 68% and 63% increase, respectively, compared with S165 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Of note, the mutant strain S165M produced the highest titer of pinocembrin.</p><p>To understand the structural consequences of substitutions at the S165, we generated a structural model for CHS using SWISS-MODEL. A structural model for the chalcone synthase of <italic>Alfalfa</italic> (PDB code: 1BI5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) served as template for the calculated model because this enzyme shares 94.09% sequence identity with <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> at the protein level. Although the substitution was in close proximity to the assumed active sites of the CHS dimer, its position was not involved in electron transfer reactions. S165 is located at the beginning of a long &#945;-helix and is surrounded by the &#946;-strand at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). The substitution of serine with a hydrophobic amino acid (M, F and A) at this position could achieve a stable structure for CHS. This might ultimately have led to the observed improvement of the CHS activity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The hydrophobicity values of Pro and Trp were &#8722;1.6 and &#8722;0.9, which were similar to that of Ser (&#8722;0.8)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Their hydrophobicity was lower than that of other nonpolar amino acids. Furthermore, the hydropathicity values of Leu, Ile and Val were 3.8, 4.5 and 4.2, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The substitution with amino acids with high hydrophobicity showed a negative effect on the pinocembrin production. Therefore, the inclusion of hydrophobic amino acids (M 1.9, F 2.8, or A 1.8) was beneficial for CHS activity and pinocembrin production.</p><p>The low intracellular malonyl-CoA availability restricts the efficient production of flavonoids in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Therefore, three strategies for increasing the intracellular malonyl-CoA level were also adopted to achieve a further improvement in pinocembrin production. Overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, anaplerosis of the acetate pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> have been proven to be efficient means to increase the intracellular malonyl-CoA level. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, these approaches showed the desired effects as the malonyl-CoA level significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Due to the increase in malonyl-CoA availability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), the cinnamic acid production by the engineered strain was decreased compared to the control. Moreover, the pinocembrin production was increased to 40.05&#8201;mg/L. Production potential of the optimal strain was tested in a 1.4-L batch fermenter with two-phase pH strategy and a final titer of 67.81&#8201;mg/L total pinocembrin was obtained with a productivity of 1.88&#8201;mg/L/h. Our present work demonstrated that the accumulation of cinnamic acid could be decreased by a step-wise metabolic engineering strategy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All constructed strains and plasmids are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>.
