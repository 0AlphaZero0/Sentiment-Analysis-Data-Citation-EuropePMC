They are the exclusive site of photosynthesis in higher plants, and are also responsible for the biosynthesis and storage of various metabolites (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Leister, 2014</xref>). The formation of a photosynthetically active chloroplast from a proplastid is controlled by both the plastid and nuclear genomes and accompanied by the rapid development of the thylakoid membrane; this is influenced by ambient conditions such as light and temperature (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Mullet, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">L&#243;pez-Juez, 2007</xref>). Increasing evidence has suggested that chloroplast biogenesis is a highly regulated process.</p><p content-type="indent">Low temperatures are a major abiotic source of stress during rice growth. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in low-temperature stress on chloroplast development are not fully understood. Temperature-sensitive leaf variegation and chlorophyll-deficient mutants have been used as powerful models to elucidate the genetic network of chloroplast development because the degree of leaf variegation is regulated by developmental and environmental cues. In addition, leaf variegation and chlorophyll-deficient mutants are powerful tools that can be used to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying chloroplast biogenesis and chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis and metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In rice, numerous leaf variegation mutants have been discovered and these are classified according to their phenotype as albino, chlorina, stripe (st), virescent (v) and zebra (<uri xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/top/top.jsp">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/top/top.jsp</uri>).

The phenotype of these mutants is normal or near normal at permissive temperatures but abnormal under higher or lower temperatures. The rice mutants <italic>v1</italic>, <italic>v2</italic>, and <italic>v3</italic> are early virescent mutants that develop albino leaves at restrictive low temperatures (20 &#176;C) but nearly normal green leaves at permissive higher temperatures (32 &#176;C), which suggests a temporal responsive factor that governs aberrant chloroplast development under low temperature conditions (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kusumi and Iba, 2014</xref>). The <italic>V1</italic> gene that encodes the chloroplast-localized protein NUS1 has been reported to play a role in the regulation of chloroplast rRNA metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kusumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). NUS1 is involved in the establishment of the plastid genetic system during early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kusumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).

The <italic>V3</italic> and <italic>St1</italic> genes encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), respectively, and reduced RNR activity can impair chloroplast DNA replication in developing leaves and ultimately lead to the virescent phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">At present, a number of chlorophyll-deficient mutants are being studied in rice. <italic>TCD9</italic> encodes the &#945; subunit of a housekeeping chaperonin Cpn60 protein involved in mediating the folding of newly synthesized, translocated, or stress-denatured proteins, and it is responsible for the albino phenotype of rice at low temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).

In field conditions, sudden low-temperature periods often occur in spring during early seedling development. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that rice has developed a mechanism to ensure that leaf and internal chloroplast development is not hindered by low temperature-induced retardation (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kusumi and Iba, 2014</xref>). The identification of mutants with a low temperature albino phenotype and cloning of the relevant genes are extremely important processes for elucidating the mechanisms underlying chloroplast development at low temperatures. To date, low temperature-sensitive albino rice genes have been cloned, including <italic>V1</italic>, <italic>V2</italic>, <italic>V3</italic>, <italic>ST1</italic>, <italic>OsV4</italic>, <italic>WLP1</italic>, and <italic>TCD9</italic>.

In this work, we isolated and characterized a new rice temperature-sensitive albino mutant, <italic>tcd5</italic>, which presents a phenotype similar to the reported <italic>v1</italic>, <italic>v2</italic>, and <italic>v3</italic> mutants. The <italic>tcd5</italic> mutant produced albino leaves at low temperatures (20 &#176;C) but normal leaves at higher temperatures (32 &#176;C). These changes in leaf colour were accompanied by changes in the chlorophyll content and chloroplast development.

However, the genes involved in chloroplast development were dramatically altered. Significant increases were observed in NEP and PEP, which participate in transcribing the plastid gene expression machinery and activating photosynthetic apparatus expression, which is consistent with the function of the V1 and V3 genes. Genes functioning in the establishment of the photosynthetic apparatus, including <italic>psaA</italic>, <italic>psbA</italic>, <italic>LhcpII</italic> and <italic>RbcL</italic>, were obviously inhibited.
