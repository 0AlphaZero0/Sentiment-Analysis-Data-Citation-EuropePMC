In skeletal muscle, a reduced oxidative capacity is also associated with the development of T2DM.

Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity demonstrated a robust day-night rhythm, with a significant time effect in ADP-stimulated respiration (state 3 MO, state 3 MOG and state 3 MOGS, p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05). Respiration was lowest at 1&#160;PM and highest at 11&#160;PM (state 3 MOGS: 80.6&#160;&#177;&#160;4.0 vs. 95.8&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7&#160;pmol/mg/s). Interestingly, the fluctuation in mitochondrial function was also observed in whole-body energy expenditure, with peak energy expenditure at 11&#160;PM and lowest energy expenditure at 4&#160;AM (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001). In addition, we demonstrate rhythmicity in mRNA expression of molecular clock genes in human skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that the biological clock drives robust rhythms in human skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism.

In our modern &#8220;24/7&#8221; society, however, many individuals do not adhere to the lifestyle imposed upon us by nature. In this respect, epidemiological studies have shown that circadian misalignment &#8211; desynchronization between the intrinsic circadian and behavioral cycles, as is typical in shift-work &#8211; is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, intervention studies have shown that challenging behavior by controlled circadian misalignment results in metabolic aberrations like decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Circadian rhythms are governed by a central circadian clock, which is situated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and is sensitive to light as the most important time cue (<italic>Zeitgeber</italic>) <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, peripheral tissues have their own clocks. These peripheral clocks are synchronized by the central clock, but they can also be influenced by behavior, such as feeding or exercise <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The peripheral clock consists of transcriptional-translational feedback loops. The positive loop consists of the heterodimer of the CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) proteins. The negative feedback loop is mediated via heterodimers of the proteins PER (Period) and CRY (Cryptochrome), which repress CLOCK/BMAL1-controlled gene expression <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Interestingly, in mouse and cell models, several components of the molecular clock have been causally linked to mitochondrial metabolism <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, mitochondrial integrity and density <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, mitochondrial dynamics <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and metabolic flexibility <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. So far however, it is unknown whether mitochondrial metabolism also displays a day-night rhythm in human skeletal muscle. Such data would be relevant, since reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is associated with T2DM <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that disturbances in the day-night rhythm may affect muscle mitochondrial metabolism and thereby deteriorate metabolic health.</p><p>Here, we investigated whether skeletal muscle mitochondrial function displays day-night rhythmicity by taking multiple muscle biopsies from healthy, lean volunteers within a 24&#160;h period, under tightly controlled experimental conditions. We used a research setting that reflects real life conditions, with regular meals, physical activity and a regular sleep/wake cycle. For this reason we use the term &#8220;day-night rhythm&#8221; instead of &#8220;circadian rhythm&#8221; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We here show that gene expression in muscle displays rhythmicity, which is specifically evident for the core components of the molecular clock. Furthermore, we are the first to show the presence of a day-night rhythm in human skeletal muscle oxidative capacity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve young lean male Caucasian individuals (age&#160;&#177;&#160;SD: 22.2&#160;&#177;&#160;2.3 years, BMI&#160;&#177;&#160;SD: 22.4&#160;&#177;&#160;2.0&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated in this study. The participants did not engage in exercise more than 3&#160;h per week, were non-smokers, had no active diseases and used no medication, verified by a medical questionnaire. Participants were selected for having a regular sleep duration (normally 7&#8211;9&#160;h/night), not having done shift work or having traveled across more than one time zone for at least 3 months. A morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ-SA) was used to exclude extreme morning larks or night owls (MEQ-SA score mean&#160;&#177;&#160;SD: 50&#160;&#177;&#160;7). All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Maastricht University Medical Center, monitored by the Clinical Trial Center Maastricht and conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.

This lifestyle included (trying to) sleep every night from 11&#160;PM until 7&#160;AM, eating breakfast, lunch and dinner at regular times (at 9&#160;AM, 2&#160;PM and 7&#160;PM) with no in-between snacks or drinks other than water. In this period subjects refrained from alcohol and caffeine. Participants were instructed not to engage in exercise three days prior to the study. Two days before the study, we provided standardized meals (see below) to ensure standardized caloric and macronutrient intake for all participants. Lifestyle was monitored by accelerometry (activPAL3 physical activity monitor, PAL Technologies, Glasgow, UK) together with food- and sleep-diaries, which were checked at the start of the first study-day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design</title><p>Participants were admitted to the research unit at noon on study day 1 and stayed for 44&#160;h in total, under standardized conditions mimicking a real-life situation. The first study-day was mainly used to standardize and monitor meals, physical activity and bedtime. Meals were provided at fixed times (9&#160;AM, 2&#160;PM and 7&#160;PM). To prevent a sedentary lifestyle, participants went for a 15-minute low-intensity walk accompanied by a researcher, one hour after every meal. Directly hereafter, participants were instructed to stand for 15&#160;minutes before they were allowed to sit again. In-between meals, physical activity and tests, the participants stayed in a respiration chamber; a small room with a bed, toilet, sink, desk, chair, TV and computer. During the first study-day we performed no measurements. At 11&#160;PM, the lights of the respiration chamber were turned off and the participants were instructed to try to sleep. During this night, sleeping metabolic rate was measured by whole-room indirect calorimetry (Omnical, Maastricht Instruments, Maastricht, The Netherlands) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The second study-day, participants were awakened at 6:30&#160;AM. Hereafter, participants swallowed a telemetric pill for measurement of core-body temperature. Next, an intravenous cannula was placed in the forearm for subsequent blood-draws. The first blood-draw was at 8&#160;AM, followed by an indirect calorimetry measurement using a ventilated hood while awake and at rest in supine posture to calculate resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Directly hereafter, the first skeletal muscle biopsy was taken (described below). These measurements (blood draw, ventilated hood measurement and skeletal muscle biopsy) were repeated five times within 24&#160;h: at 8&#160;AM, 1&#160;PM, 6&#160;PM, 11&#160;PM and 4&#160;AM the next day. Additional blood samples were taken 2-hourly (10&#160;AM, 12&#160;PM, 2&#160;PM, 4&#160;PM, 8&#160;PM, 10&#160;PM, 0&#160;AM, 2&#160;AM, 6&#160;AM and 8&#160;AM). The timing of meals and physical activity was similar to study-day 1 and subjects stayed within the respiration chamber in-between measurements. After the 11&#160;PM biopsy, participants went back to the respiration chamber to sleep with lights off. At 4&#160;AM, the participant was awakened and the last measurements were performed, after which the subject was allowed to sleep until 7&#160;AM. After the 8&#160;AM blood draw the study protocol ended.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Study meals</title><p>Two days before the study and during the study participants were provided with standardized meals, according to Dutch and US dietary guidelines. Caloric intake for consumption at home was calculated by multiplying the estimated resting metabolic rate, obtained with the Harris-Benedict formula <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> with an activity factor of 1.5. Participants were provided with optional extra snacks to eat with their meals if they were still hungry, up to an activity factor of 1.7. For the first study-day in the laboratory, energy requirement was calculated by multiplying the estimated resting metabolic rate with an activity factor of 1.35, because of limited physical activity in the research facility. For the second study-day, energy requirement was calculated by multiplying the sleeping metabolic rate of the first study night (measured by whole-room indirect-calorimetry) by 1.5.</p><p>During the study days, participants received 3 meals daily. Breakfast accounted for &#8764;21 energy%, lunch for &#8764;30 energy% and dinner for &#8764;49 energy%. Daily macronutrient composition was &#8764;52 energy% as carbohydrates, &#8764;31 energy% as fat (&#8764;9% saturated) and &#8764;14 energy% as protein.

Each biopsy was taken from a separate incision at least 2&#160;cm from the previous incision, moving from distal to proximal. The first biopsy was randomly taken from the left or right leg, and each subsequent biopsy was taken from the other leg. Part of the biopsy was immediately placed in ice-cold preservation medium (BIOPS, OROBOROS Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) and used for measurement of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. For this analysis, intact muscle fibers were permeabilized and measured for oxygen consumption upon several substrates using an Oxygraph (OROBOROS Instruments).

Indeed, all subjects showed a characteristic day&#8211;night pattern in core-body temperature with highest temperature at the end of the day and a decrease in temperature after midnight <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, indicating that chronotypes were similar across participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Human skeletal muscle displays oscillations in RNA of metabolic and core molecular clock genes</title><p>During the second study day, we performed five consecutive skeletal muscle biopsies. To prevent meal interference, the biopsies were taken immediately before the three meals (8&#160;AM, 1&#160;PM, 6&#160;PM), before bedtime (11&#160;PM) and one time during the night (4&#160;AM) after waking up the participant.</p><p>To examine if skeletal muscle displays rhythmicity in gene expression, we analyzed RNA using DNA microarrays in subsequent biopsies from a single donor with a representative rhythm in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This analysis revealed that 14.5% of transcripts (4094 out of 28,168) displayed a cyclic expression peaking at different times, 75% of them corresponding to protein-encoding transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>A). Term enrichment against Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome databases indicated that gene clusters displaying a maximal expression in the late evening or during the night (11&#160;PM, 4&#160;AM) are notably related to the core clock machinery (4&#160;AM, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>B) including <italic>REV-ERB-&#945;</italic>, <italic>REV-ERB-&#946;</italic>, <italic>PER3</italic> and <italic>DBP</italic> and to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle/respiratory electron transport chain (11&#160;PM, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>C) such as components of NADH dehydrogenase complexes (<italic>NDUFA4</italic>, <italic>NDUFA8</italic>) and of ATP synthase (<italic>ATP5F1</italic>, <italic>ATP5G3</italic>, <italic>APTP5A1</italic>, <italic>ATP5L</italic>). Collectively, these analyses suggested the existence of a functional core clock machinery and oscillations in mitochondrial metabolism in human skeletal muscle.</p><p>Expression of core clock genes was validated in all participants by RT-QPCR assays. <italic>TTN</italic> mRNA expression, measured as an arrhythmic muscle filament gene, did not vary throughout the 24-hour period (p&#160;=&#160;0.331, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>A). <italic>CLOCK</italic> mRNA showed significant variation over time (ANOVA p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001), but rhythmicity was of rather low amplitude (JTK_CYCLE p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>B), consistent with previous observations in several mouse tissues <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. <italic>BMAL1</italic> mRNA exhibited a robust sinusoidal rhythm, with highest expression around midnight, and lowest expression in the morning and early afternoon (ANOVA p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001, JTK_CYCLE p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>B).

Both were confirmed to be rhythmic by JTK_CYCLE (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001).</p><p>Together, our data show robust rhythmicity of the molecular clock in human skeletal muscle, which is consistent with the demonstration of an oscillating molecular clock in other human cells and tissues like leukocytes <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, follicle cells <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and adipose tissue <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and in primary cultures of human muscle <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, micro-array analysis in sequential biopsies obtained from a single donor revealed cyclic expression of several clusters of genes, including genes involved in important mitochondrial pathways. A previous study investigating the molecular clock in human adipose tissue biopsies demonstrated peak-expression of BMAL1 at the very end of the light-phase, similar to our current results in human skeletal muscle <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, that study examined adipose tissue gene expression under a standardized circadian rhythm protocol with subjects in the resting condition and with hourly nutritional drinks, thereby limiting the influence of behavior on the core molecular clock expression. The similarity in results suggests that the molecular clock patterns we observe in skeletal muscle may indeed be dominated by circadian rhythmicity. This is further underscored by findings in animals, as in mouse skeletal muscle <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and mouse liver <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, BMAL1 mRNA is highest at the end of the dark-phase and beginning of the light phase. Since mice are nocturnal animals, this corresponds with a highest BMAL1 expression at the end of the active phase and beginning of the rest phase, similar to our findings in human skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Human skeletal muscle oxidative capacity displays a day-night rhythm</title><p>To investigate whether the rhythmicity in mitochondrial and molecular clock genes was also reflected in a day-night rhythm of muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, we performed high-resolution respirometry in freshly isolated permeabilized muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity demonstrated a clear day-night rhythm, with a significant time effect in ADP-stimulated (state 3) respiration fueled by different substrates (state 3 MO, state 3 MOG and state 3 MOGS p&#160;=&#160;0.042; 0.016; 0.042 respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>A). Mitochondrial state 3 respiration was lowest at 1&#160;PM, and highest at 11&#160;PM (state 3 MOGS: 80.6&#160;&#177;&#160;14.0 vs. 95.8&#160;&#177;&#160;16.3&#160;pmol/mg/sec, mean&#160;&#177;&#160;SD). Differences between these time-points were statistically significant for state 3 MO (p&#160;=&#160;0.032) and state 3 MOG (p&#160;=&#160;0.027), although it just did not reach significance for state 3 MOGS (p&#160;=&#160;0.132) after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. Furthermore, JTK_CYCLE analysis of mitochondrial respiration confirmed rhythmicity for state 3 MO (p&#160;=&#160;0.007), 3 MOG (p&#160;=&#160;0.039) and 3 MOGS (0.041). Maximally uncoupled respiration, reflecting the maximal capacity of the electron transport system, demonstrated similar oscillations although the effect of time did not reach significance (p&#160;=&#160;0.121, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>B). It is interesting to note that the difference in mitochondrial state 3 respiration between 1&#160;PM and 11&#160;PM was on average 20%, which is in the same range as the difference in mitochondrial function between patients with T2DM and BMI-matched controls <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, indicating that the magnitude of the day-night rhythm in mitochondrial function is of physiological relevance. Previous studies in animal models of metabolic diseases do show disrupted circadian rhythmicity in the molecular clock of metabolic tissues and in plasma metabolites <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and it is therefore tempting to speculate that day-night rhythmicity in muscle mitochondrial metabolism is altered in T2DM and pre-diabetic patients. Such disturbances in circadian rhythmicity of mitochondrial function may contribute to reduced metabolic flexibility that is observed in metabolically compromised individuals and thereby contribute to the development of metabolic diseases, consistent with findings that circadian misalignment is associated with obesity and T2DM <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. If this is indeed the case, restoring circadian rhythmicity may comprise a potential new basis for lifestyle advice and provide treatment options for T2DM.</p><p>How mitochondrial function can show circadian rhythmicity can not be completely revealed by the current study in humans. However, to investigate if the rhythm in mitochondrial respiration is caused by intrinsic variation in mitochondrial oxidative capacity, rather than by variation in mitochondrial density, we measured several markers of mitochondrial content. Mitochondrial-DNA copy number &#8211; the ratio between the DNA copy number of a mitochondrial (ND1) and a nuclear gene (LPL) &#8211; did not reveal a day-night rhythm (p&#160;=&#160;0.437, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;5</xref>A). Also, western blot analysis of structural subunits of the five mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes did not reveal a statistically significant effect of time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;5</xref>B&#8211;G). In addition, the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins VDAC and TOMM-20 did not display day-night rhythmicity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;5</xref>H&#8211;I). The non-mitochondrial protein SR-Actin was also stable throughout the day (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;5</xref>J). Together, these results suggest that in skeletal muscle, intrinsic mitochondrial function (rather than mitochondrial content) displays circadian rhythmicity.</p><p>We next investigated whether mitochondrial dynamics or mitochondrial biogenesis could play a role in the circadian rhythmicity of intrinsic mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial fission and fusion occur as a result of changes in energy demand, influence substrate metabolism and are controlled by the circadian clock in mouse liver <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Here, we quantified proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dynamics in skeletal muscle biopsies. PGC-1&#945;, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, did not show a significant difference over time (p&#160;=&#160;0.901, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;6</xref>A). Interestingly however, FIS1, a marker of mitochondrial fission, displayed significant time-differences, with a pattern matching the rhythm in mitochondrial oxidative capacity (p&#160;=&#160;0.016, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;6</xref>B), although JTK_CYCLE analysis did not confirm significant rhythmicity. PINK-1, a marker of mitophagy, displayed a rhythm opposing FIS-1, although this time-effect just did not reach statistical significance (p&#160;=&#160;0.061, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;6</xref>C). Noteworthy, in murine liver FIS-1 and PINK-1 24&#160;h expression patterns are also opposed <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, the mitochondrial fusion marker OPA-1 showed a significant decrease over time, across all time points (p&#160;=&#160;0.045, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;6</xref>D, without significant rhythmicity in JTK_CYCLE analysis). These results suggest that mitochondrial dynamics may be involved in governing mitochondrial capacity around the clock, although mechanistic studies in preclinical models are needed to further investigate underlying mechanisms.</p><p>The physiological relevance of the rhythmicity in oxidative capacity cannot be deduced from the current study. It is, however, interesting to note that aerobic performance also peaks later in the day <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our results could therefore form a physiological explanation for these findings. An earlier study found that chronotype influences the time-point of peak performance <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In our study, we only included participants with an average chronotype. Future studies will be needed to investigate whether early and late chronotypes have a different time-point of peak mitochondrial function.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Whole-body energy expenditure peaks before midnight</title><p>We next examined whether day-night rhythmicity in muscle mitochondrial function was also associated with rhythmicity in whole-body measures of energy metabolism. To this end, we performed indirect calorimetry analyses to determine resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation at the same time points of the muscle biopsies. Interestingly, similar to mitochondrial respiratory capacity, resting energy expenditure showed a significant time effect, with highest energy expenditure at 11&#160;PM (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001 for the time-effect; p&#160;=&#160;0.005 for Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc analysis 11&#160;PM vs 4&#160;AM; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;7</xref>A). It is well known that lowest levels of energy expenditure can be measured when subjects are asleep, denoted as sleeping metabolic rate. Even though the participants were awakened before measurements, resting energy expenditure was still lowest at 4&#160;AM. This clearly illustrates day-night rhythmicity in energy expenditure, independent of sleep. RER, carbohydrate oxidation and fat oxidation displayed variation with feeding and fasting periods, with a significantly lower carbohydrate oxidation and RER, and a higher fat oxidation in the fasted state (8&#160;AM and 4&#160;AM) and a higher carbohydrate oxidation and RER, and a lower fat oxidation in the fed state (1&#160;PM, 6&#160;PM and 11&#160;PM) (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001 for the time-effect in RER and carbohydrate oxidation and p&#160;=&#160;0.007 for the time-effect in fat oxidation, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;7</xref>B&#8211;D). Bonferroni-adjusted post-hoc analyses confirmed that RER, carbohydrate- and fat-oxidation were significantly different at 6 PM and 11&#160;PM, when compared with 8&#160;AM and 4&#160;AM (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;7</xref>A&#8211;D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><label>3.5</label><title>Plasma metabolites peak according to meals</title><p>To examine the diurnal pattern in circulating substrates, we took 15 blood samples throughout the second study-day to assess glucose, insulin, free fatty acids and triglycerides (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;8</xref>A&#8211;D). As expected, plasma glucose and insulin displayed marked peaks after the meals, with an overall maximum after the dinner, being the most energy-dense meal. Furthermore, plasma glucose increased slightly during the late evening and night, possibly reflecting an increase in endogenous glucose production together with decreased carbohydrate oxidation. Free fatty acids reflected the fasting-feeding pattern with increased free fatty acids before the meals and during the night when fat oxidation is highest and decreased free fatty acids after the meals. Plasma triglycerides displayed a rise throughout the waking hours with a peak after dinner, being the meal with the highest energy density. During the night, plasma triglycerides decreased again.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Circadian vs day-night rhythmicity</title><p>In this study, we aimed to examine changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and whole-body metabolism throughout 24&#160;h with a standardized protocol designed to mimic our daily lifestyle. To this end, our protocol included a normal sleep&#8211;wake cycle, normal meals with a regular calorie distribution and (limited) physical activity. As a result, our protocol does not allow us to evaluate the influence of the endogenous circadian clock <italic>per se.</italic> However, to control the influence of meals and physical activity, we performed our measurements under controlled conditions with meals and light activity bouts at least 3&#8211;4&#160;h before the measurements. Such a protocol therefore reflects day-night, and not circadian rhythmicity, and allows extrapolation of the results to a normal daily lifestyle. The demonstration of a day-night rhythm in mitochondrial function in lean volunteers allows future studies to investigate if such rhythmicity is disturbed in volunteers with compromised metabolic health, such as T2DM. If rhythmicity of mitochondrial metabolism is indeed disturbed in subjects with compromised metabolic health, this may open therapeutic strategies to restore circadian rhythmicity, possibly via REV-ERB-&#945; agonists or nutritional compounds as resveratrol, as they have previously been proven to be successful in mouse studies <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Furthermore, it may open a new field of research directed towards the timing of interventions that boost mitochondrial function, and ultimately these studies may reveal how circadian disruption can lead to metabolic disturbances, as has been demonstrated in both human and animal studies <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><label>3.7</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we here demonstrate the presence of a profound day-night rhythm in human skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity.

In addition, we found significant variations over time in proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, possibly linking the circadian clock with mitochondrial metabolism. Future investigations should increase the focus on the regulatory mechanisms underlying the current observations.

(A) Time-dependent gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis of RNA extracted from a single donor (N&#160;=&#160;1). Protein-encoding transcript expression patterns were visualized as a self-organizing map (Euclidean distance metrics). The color scale indicates upregulated genes (red) and downregulated genes (green) relative to the global median signal of each array. The arrow indicates clusters of genes showing the most prominent peak of expression at the indicated time point (4&#160;AM, cluster 1 and 11&#160;PM, cluster 2). (B and C) Gene annotation enrichment analysis. The genes extracted from cluster 1 and 2 were searched using multiple databases (GeneOntology Biological Processes, KEGG pathways and Reactome) and statistically enriched terms were determined using the Metascape tool. The most significantly enriched terms are indicated for cluster 1 (GO biological processes, panel B, peak expression 4&#160;AM) and cluster 2 (Reactome, panel C, peak expression 11&#160;PM). Statistically significant terms were hierarchically clustered and converted into a network. Each term is represented by a circle node, of which the size is proportional to the number of genes in the term. The color of the node indicates the statistical significance of the term belonging to the cluster (see color scale). The most significant term characterizing each cluster is indicated. Similarities between terms are indicated by connecting lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig><fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#160;3</label><caption><p><bold>Rhythmicity of core molecular clock genes in human skeletal muscle</bold>.
