Although an autosomal recessive form of the syndrome has been reported,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> most cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. High intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variations have been identified, and no genotype-phenotype correlation in the syndrome has been found based on the evaluation of the clinical variability in TCS.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Anticipation is often observed in TCS families due to ascertainment bias.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> TCS is likely in patients who are symmetrically affected, usually characterized by downward slanting palpebral fissures with lower eyelid coloboma, hypoplasia of the mandible and zygomatic, malformed ears, and conductive hearing loss due to atresia of the external ear canal.</p><p>The gene associated with the syndrome is <italic>TCOF1</italic>, which is located in 5q32-q33.1.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The gene contains 28 exons and several alternative splice sites.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> To date, &gt;150 different pathogenic mutations have been reported in the coding region of <italic>TCOF1</italic>, most of which are novel deletions or duplications leading to a premature stop codon.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Mutations in the promoter region have been proven to be functional,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> representing a different mechanism causing the syndrome. In mice, haploinsufficiency of <italic>TCOF1</italic> results in the depletion of neural crest cell precursors as the result of high levels of cell death in the neuroepithelium, which can lead to a reduced number of neural crest cells migrating into the developing craniofacial complex.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Recent research on <italic>TCOF1</italic> mutant mice has demonstrated that effective cavitation of the middle ear is intimately linked to the growth of the auditory bulla, a neural crest cell-derived structure that encapsulates all middle ear components, and that defects in those processes have a profoundly detrimental effect on hearing.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>TCS is thought to represent defective structures derived from the embryonic first and second branchial arches, which are involved in a number of syndromic microtia,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> including Goldenhar syndrome, Nager syndrome, and Miller syndrome. The overlap of patients with these syndromes may suggest a common genetic cause. Among the genes implicated in these syndromic microtia are <italic>GSC</italic> and <italic>HOXA2</italic>. A missense mutation in <italic>HOXA2</italic> has been shown to cause autosomal recessive microtia with cleft palate.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Similarly, a same-sense mutation and a missense mutation have been documented in 8 patients with isolated microtia.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We therefore report a mutational analysis of <italic>TCOF1, GSC</italic>, and <italic>HOXA2</italic> in 3 Chinese patients with TCS.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>All patients with a clinical diagnosis of TCS were recruited through the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University in China.

Analysis of patient 2's normal parents showed that the father possessed the 5-bp deletion, whereas his mother did not, indicating that the 5-bp deletion was inherited from the father. All of the alterations found within our subjects are described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The molecular mechanism responsible for TCS is still not defined; however, there has been remarkable work done in this area. First, haploinsufficiency has been proposed as one of the molecular mechanism underlying the disorder because deletion or insertion mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> were the most likely to result in the creation of a premature termination codon and a truncated protein. Second, as mutations that do not alter canonical splice signals but influence splicing have been recognized as a novel form of mutation,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> synonymous alterations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> should be further investigated with functional assays before excluding pathogenicity. And last, mutations in the promoter region of <italic>TCOF1</italic> could impair the DNA-binding to the YY1 transcription factor.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It suggests a possibility that changes outside of the coding region might alter expression level of functionally normal protein.</p><p>As previous studies mainly focused on the coding region of <italic>TCOF1</italic>, the current study detected all the exons and the exon-intron borders of <italic>TCOF1</italic> in addition to the 1200-bp upstream of <italic>TCOF1</italic>. We identified 1 novel SNP &#8722;26T&#8594;A in the promoter region of <italic>TCOF1</italic>; however, functional study of this abnormality is necessary to obtain more definitive information. It is interesting to note that only the father of patient 1 and mother of patient 2 possessed the 21968G&#8594;T alteration in the homozygous form, explaining the heterozygous genotype of their children. Also interestingly, patient 2's father possessed the 5-bp deletion, whereas his mother did not, indicating that the 5-bp deletion was inherited from the father. All of the novel variations could also be found in the control samples. Therefore, no pathogenic mutations were identified in our patients. A lack of mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> suggests that other novel genes or complex changes in gene regulatory networks might be responsible for TCS in the subjects analyzed.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> seem to be extremely variable, and TCS demonstrates great phenotypic variability.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Due to the clinical overlap, <italic>TCOF1</italic> was analyzed and excluded in patients with Goldenhar, Nager, and Miller syndromes.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Therefore, it is meaningful to clarify whether the patients with TCS have alterations in those genes related with other syndromes.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> HoxA2 is a key transcription factor during development of the second branchial arch that has a main contribution in development of the external and middle ear in mouse.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> GSC is a transcription factor that plays an essential role during the process of gastrulation in early embryonic development.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Mice with a homozygous disruption of <italic>gsc</italic> revealed multiple defects containing the lower mandible as well as components of the inner ear and the external auditory meatus.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Both of the genes have been identified responsible for the syndromic microtia.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We therefore sequenced all the exons of <italic>GSC</italic> and <italic>HOXA2</italic>; however, we did not find any mutations in these genes except one previously reported SNP 1244G&#8594;T in <italic>GSC</italic>. Although these syndromes all derived from first and second branchial arches in embryonic period, they might be altered by different genes and regulated by complex gene networks.</p><p>In the present study, we performed <italic>TCOF1</italic>, <italic>GSC</italic>, and <italic>HOXA2</italic> mutation analysis in 3 Chinese patients with TCS. We detected 12 polymorphic changes in <italic>TCOF1</italic>, 4 of which were novel. And we also excluded mutations of <italic>GSC</italic> and <italic>HOXA2</italic> in the 3 patients. Mutations in the <italic>TCOF1</italic> gene are not always found in patients with TCS.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These results suggest the possibility of genetic heterogeneity or the existence of different mechanisms leading to the syndrome. We hypothesized several possibilities to explain the undetected <italic>TCOF1</italic> mutations in these TCS patients. First, there may be another gene that might be located near <italic>TCOF1</italic> that is responsible for TCS. Second, nonsequential factors that can modulate the expression of <italic>TCOF1</italic>, for instance, the methylation of the gene or the mi-RNA regulation, may be involved. Further study is needed to explore the potential mechanism of these alterations in the occurrence of TCS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Grant sponsor: Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Major Basic Research Projects.
