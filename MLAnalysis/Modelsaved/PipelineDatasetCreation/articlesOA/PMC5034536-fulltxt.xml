SlyD is a two-domain enzyme containing both a PPIase FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain and an insert-in-flap (IF) chaperone domain. To date, the interactions of these domains with unfolded proteins have remained rather obscure, with structural information on binding to the FKBP domain being limited to complexes involving various inhibitor compounds or a chemically modified tetrapeptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have characterized the binding of 15-residue-long unmodified peptides to SlyD from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (TtSlyD) in terms of binding thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and site-directed mutagenesis. We show that the affinities and enzymatic activity of TtSlyD towards these peptides are much higher than for the chemically modified tetrapeptides that are typically used for activity measurements on FKBPs. In addition, we present a series of crystal structures of TtSlyD with the inhibitor FK506 bound to the FKBP domain, and with 15-residue-long peptides bound to either one or both domains, which reveals that substrates bind in a highly adaptable fashion to the IF domain through &#946;-strand augmentation, and can bind to the FKBP domain as both types VIa1 and VIb-like cis-proline &#946;-turns. Our results furthermore provide important clues to the catalytic mechanism and support the notion of inter-domain cross talk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that 15-residue-long unmodified peptides can serve as better substrate mimics for the IF and FKBP domains than chemically modified tetrapeptides. We furthermore show how such peptides are recognized by each of these domains in TtSlyD, and propose a novel general model for the catalytic mechanism of FKBPs that involves C-terminal rotation around the peptidyl-prolyl bond mediated by stabilization of the twisted transition state in the hydrophobic binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-016-0300-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase)</kwd><kwd>FK506-binding protein (FKBP)</kwd><kwd>Chaperone</kwd><kwd>Protein folding</kwd><kwd>Proline</kwd><kwd>Beta-turn</kwd><kwd>FK506</kwd><kwd>SlyD</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystal structure</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP/2007-2013 Biostruct X Nr 783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nordlund</surname><given-names>P&#228;r</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsr&#229;det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-5815</award-id><award-id>621-2013-5905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akke</surname><given-names>Mikael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>G&#246;ran Gustafsson Foundation for Research in Natural Sciences and Medicine </institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Peptide bonds are planar with &#969; dihedral angles of either ~0&#176; (<italic>cis</italic> form) or ~180&#176; (<italic>trans</italic> form). Due to unfavorable steric and electronic effects, the <italic>cis</italic> form is by far the least favored, except for peptidyl-prolyl bonds where the unique N-alkylation of proline markedly reduces the energy difference between the two conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The <italic>cis</italic> form is therefore much more commonly observed for prolines than for any other residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In folded proteins, prolines are predominantly found in &#946;-turns and other loop elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isoforms have different effects on the structure. Although both isoforms can be found in type IV &#946;-turns (a category with lax geometry requirements), the <italic>trans</italic> form specifically favors more narrowly defined types of turns, for example, I, II, and VIII, whereas the <italic>cis</italic> form is required for types VIa1, VIa2, and VIb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Protein folding requires that each proline in the sequence adopts the isoform compatible with the native fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, spontaneous <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization occurs very slowly due to the high energy barrier imposed by the partial double bond character of the peptide bond. Indeed, the isomerization correlation time typically falls in the seconds to minutes time regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nature has therefore evolved three families of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) to facilitate <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization: FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), cyclophilins, and parvulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These enzymes presumably all function by stabilizing the transition state, resulting in an effective rate constant for the catalyzed reaction of up to 10<sup>8</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but their mechanisms are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The first FKBP to be discovered was human FKBP12, which was identified as a binding partner of the immunosuppressive macrolide lactone FK506, hence the name of the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Since then, it has become clear that FKBPs are widespread in all branches of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. FKBPs often have additional chaperone or protein&#8211;protein interaction domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A particularly well-studied example is SlyD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This protein belongs to a prokaryotic subfamily, characterized by having an insert-in-flap (IF) chaperone domain inserted into the FKBP domain in place of the so-called flap loop (also known as the 80&#8217;s loop) found in FKBP12 and many other FKBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which both enables it to function as an efficient chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and increases its PPIase activity towards partially folded protein substrates by as much as 100&#8211;200 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The enzymatic activity of FKBPs has been studied in several ways, with the most popular method being a spectrophotometric assay that utilizes the modified tetrapeptide substrate analogue succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide (suc-ALPF-pNA) or variants thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Structures have been determined for numerous FKBPs in both the apo and inhibitor-bound forms. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two structures have been obtained with a bound peptide, which in both cases is suc-ALPF-pNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While chemically modified tetrapeptides are well suited for studying the effects of the residues neighboring the proline, they are not ideal substrate mimics, because they bind to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> SlyD with much lower affinity than refolding protein substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The low affinity of these peptides probably relates to the smaller interaction surface compared to protein substrates, but could also relate to their limited capacity to form naturally occurring structural elements, such as &#946;-turns. Structural insights into how substrates interact with the IF domain have so far been based on a single structure of the SlyD homologue SlpA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, in which an uncleaved purification tag is bound at the substrate binding site of the IF domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In order to improve our understanding of the mechanism of SlyD and of FKBPs in general, we set out to analyze the kinetics, energetics, and structural basis for substrate binding and inhibition of SlyD from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (TtSlyD) using 15-residue-long unmodified peptides, which we reasoned would be better mimics of natural unfolded protein substrates than the traditionally used 4-nitroanilide tetrapeptides. Indeed, these long peptides display much improved binding affinity and enzymatic turnover compared to the tetrapeptides. The enzyme peptide complexes are fairly heterogeneous in their structural and energetic aspects, but common principles could be identified for both the IF and the FKBP domain. Our results shed new light on how substrates are recognized, and have enabled us to propose a model for the catalytic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of TtSlyD, we characterized its substrate binding and catalytic properties, as well as the three-dimensional structures of a number of TtSlyD:peptide complexes, through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and site-specific mutagenesis.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Peptide binding studies</title><p>To identify peptides that overcome the limitations of currently used substrate mimics and are suitable for structural studies, we used ITC to characterize the binding of several different peptides to TtSlyD, as exemplified in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#8211;d</xref>. We mainly used 15-residue-long proline-containing segments from proteins that have previously been shown to bind to TtSlyD and/or other proteins from the SlyD family, namely RNase T1, which is a model protein for folding studies, and the ribosomal proteins S2 and S3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for the complete list of peptide sequences. Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the results of the binding studies. Interestingly, peptides derived from S2 and S3 display a dual binding mode with both a high- and a low-affinity binding site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). In order to identify the binding sites we next monitored peptide binding by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy using a variant of the S2 peptide (S2-P25A). Chemical shift perturbations on full-length TtSlyD (henceforth abbreviated TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>) upon addition of peptide clearly show binding to both the IF and FKBP domains (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e&#8211;g</xref>). Quantitative analyses of chemical shift changes as a function of added peptide enabled us to assign the stronger binding event to the IF domain and the weaker one to the FKBP domain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e&#8211;g</xref>). The highest affinities were obtained for the S2 peptide with K<sub>D1</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.161&#160;&#956;M and K<sub>D2</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;2.97&#160;&#956;M, followed by the S3 peptide with K<sub>D1</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.869&#160;&#956;M and K<sub>D2</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;22.94&#160;&#956;M (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Addition of 5&#160;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was required for dissolving some peptides at high concentration, histidine tag cleavage, or a change in temperature (20&#160;&#176;C versus 25&#160;&#176;C), had only minor effects on the affinity of the S2 peptide (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In general, peptide binding to TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> is driven by a favorable change in enthalpy (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A comparison of the thermodynamic fingerprints of the S2 and S3 peptides revealed that the slightly lower affinity of the S3 peptide to the IF domain is caused by a reduction in binding enthalpy (which is partly compensated by entropy), while the weaker binding of the S3 peptide to the FKBP domain is due to entropic effects (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For the T1 peptide, a single-site model was sufficient to describe binding to TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>, and the affinity was found to be much lower (K<sub>D</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;158&#160;&#956;M) than for the S2 and S3 peptides, which is explained primarily by an increase in unfavorable binding entropy. Notably, the affinities observed for the S2 and S3 peptides are in the same range or higher than for binding of a refolding protein substrate at high salt concentration to <italic>E. coli</italic> SlyD (K<sub>D</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.4&#8211;2.2&#160;&#956;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and significantly higher than the reported K<sub>D</sub> of ~44&#160;&#956;M estimated for binding of the suc-ALPF-pNA peptide to <italic>E. coli</italic> SlyD at high salt concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We therefore conclude that the S2 and S3 peptides can serve as improved substrate mimics for functional and structural studies of TtSlyD.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) binding studies.

However, this is not expected to appreciably affect the experiments, as the S2 peptide was found to bind with similar affinities in both the presence and absence of 5&#160;% DMSO</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>In order to characterize the requirements for binding, we next analyzed binding of a series of variants of the S2 peptide (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>. To test the sequence dependency, we used a set of peptides corresponding to different segments of the S2 protein: three peptides covered sequences shifted N-terminally by three, six, or nine residues, compared to the original S2 peptide (S2-minus1, S2-minus2, and S2-minus3), and two peptides were shifted C-terminally by three or six residues (S2-plus1 and S2-plus2). These peptides all retained the capacity for binding to both sites, though the affinities were most often reduced when compared to the original S2 peptide (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In most cases, enthalpy losses were to some extent compensated by reduced entropy penalties and, in some cases, even gains in entropy (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To study the length dependency, we used variants of the S2 peptide extended or truncated with up to eight residues. Extension of the peptide had minor to moderate effects on the affinity for the IF domain (up to threefold higher) and the FKBP domain (up to threefold lower) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Removing one or two residues from each side (S2-short2 and S2-short4) reduced the affinity for the IF domain about twofold and sevenfold, respectively, while the affinities for the FKBP domain remained relatively unperturbed. After removing an additional two to four residues (S2-short6 and S2-short8), the affinities were substantially reduced, and it was no longer possible to resolve the separate binding events (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The stoichiometries were, however, significantly higher than 1 after fitting to a single binding site model, indicating that these peptides may still engage both binding sites (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We also measured binding of an eight-residue-long peptide representing the plasmid-derived linker sequence bound to the IF domain in the crystal structure of SlpA (SlpA linker; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), which was found to bind with an affinity similar to that of the seven-residue-long S2-short8 peptide. We conclude that the sequence requirements for peptide binding to TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> are rather lax, which is in part because the enthalpic losses incurred by apparent sequence mismatching are readily compensated by gains in entropy, and that the affinity of binding to both domains is sensitive to the length of the peptide (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Next we tested the contribution of proline residues to the binding events. There are two proline residues in the S2 peptide, P25 and P29. Neither single mutations (P25A or P29E), nor double mutations (P25A/P29E or P25N/P29N) abrogated binding to any of the two domains, though the affinities were moderately reduced in most cases, and strongly so for the P25A/P29E double mutant (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, mutating the single proline residue in the SlpA linker peptide to threonine did not appreciably alter the affinity of this peptide for TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We therefore conclude that binding of substrates to TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> does not strictly require the presence of proline residues. Next, we tested binding of an S2 mutant peptide where the sole tryptophan residue was replaced by alanine (S2-W23A). This peptide retained the ability to bind to both domains of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>, albeit with moderately reduced affinities (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The results using point-mutated peptide variants thus further underline the lax sequence specificity of TtSlyD. The thermodynamic parameters of binding to the IF domain are similar for the wild-type and point-mutated peptides, but the enthalpies of binding to the FKBP domain are significantly reduced for the P29E, P25A/P29E, P25N/P29N, and W23A variants, which is again partly compensated for by gains in entropy (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also analyzed binding of the S2, S3, and mutated variants of the S2 peptide to a chimeric TtSlyD construct, in which the IF domain is replaced by the flap loop from human FKBP12 (henceforth abbreviated TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>). As expected, only one binding event was observed in this case (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, the affinities for the FKBP domain were found to be 1.5&#8211;4.8-times lower in the absence of the IF domain (except for the S2-W23A and S2-P25A/P29E peptides), which is primarily due to a more unfavorable binding entropy (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overall structure of TtSlyD in complex with peptides and FK506</title><p>Three structures of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> were known prior to this study (maximum resolution of 2.7&#8211;2.4&#160;&#197;): two apo structures [PDB: 3CGM and 3CGN] and one with the modified tetrapeptide suc-ALPF-pNA bound to the FKBP domain [PDB: 3LUO] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, no structures had been determined for TtSlyD, or any other member of the SlyD family, in complex with longer, unmodified peptides or with inhibitors. We therefore co-crystallized the full-length and &#916;IF constructs of TtSlyD with several of the peptides identified as substrates in the binding studies, namely the S2, S3, T1, S2-plus2, and S2-W23A peptides. In addition, we carried out co-crystallization with the FKBP inhibitor FK506. For phasing, we used both molecular replacement and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD), as detailed in the &#8220;Methods.&#8221; In total, we obtained five structures of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> and three of TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub> at a maximum resolution of up to 1.4&#160;&#197; (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, there is more than one molecule of TtSlyD in the asymmetric unit in several cases (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), which for TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 and TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-W23A display substantial differences in substrate binding (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In most of the TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> complexes, a peptide is bound to each of the IF and FKBP domains (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, the positions of the binding sites in the crystal structures are the same as in solution, as confirmed by mapping of the chemical shift perturbations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of structures.

Note that the TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 and TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2W23A structures display different peptide binding modes for the different TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> copies in their asymmetric units. TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 thus presents two different binding modes at the IF domains of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> molecules A and B (both are shown), while TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2W23A displays two different binding modes at the FKBP domain of molecules A and C contra molecules B and D (shown for molecules C and D).

The IF and FKBP domains are connected via loop<sub>65&#8722;70</sub> and loop<sub>118&#8722;125</sub>, which adopt the same conformations as previously described for other members of the SlyD family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, in spite of the loops being structurally well defined, some degree of bending must take place in these regions, because the relative orientation of the two domains is quite variable (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). A computational analysis suggests that there is a key pivot point in the hinge region comprising residues 62&#8211;64 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), which can be considered part of both the FKBP domain and the inter-domain connectors, and which is also conserved in many other FKBPs where it forms the N-terminal base of the flap loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A high mobility of the Y63 side chain is furthermore confirmed by aromatic <sup>1</sup>H&#8211;<sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of apo TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>, where Y63 is the only aromatic residue completely broadened beyond detection due to conformational exchange dynamics affecting both the &#948; and &#949; positions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As discussed further below, this variability is intimately connected with interactions between the side chain of Y63 and the peptides bound to the FKBP domain. The FKBP12 flap loop inserted into TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub> in place of the IF domain adopts essentially the same conformation as in full-length FKBP12 in the case of TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>:FK506, while it is partially disordered in TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>:S2-W23A and TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>:S3 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Structural flexibility. <bold>a</bold> Superimposition of the insert-in-flap (IF) domain for all molecules of the five full-length TtSlyD (TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>) structures.

Indeed, the only structure with a substrate-free IF domain is TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:FK506 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which was crystallized in the absence of a peptide. The binding site consists of a highly hydrophobic groove comprising V74, F79, F91, L103, V115, and F117, as well as the edge of the &#946;8&#8211;&#946;9 hairpin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The binding mode is highly variable among the structures. Moreover, in the case of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2, there are two TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> molecules in the asymmetric unit (molecules A and B), which bind the peptides in very different ways (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). The resolution of this structure is, however, rather low (2.9&#160;&#197;), and although the electron density map clearly shows that the peptide binds differently to the IF domains of molecules A and B, the side chains are poorly defined for the peptide bound to molecule B (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The S2 peptide inserts W23<sub>S2</sub> and I31<sub>S2</sub> into the binding groove of molecule A (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), whereas it appears to insert P29<sub>S2</sub> and F32<sub>S2</sub> in molecule B (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We therefore expected that a peptide where W23<sub>S2</sub> is mutated to alanine would bind similarly to the S2 peptide bound to molecule B in the TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 structure. Surprisingly, the structure of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-W23A revealed instead a third binding mode where F30<sub>S2</sub> and I31<sub>S2</sub> are inserted into the binding groove (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Furthermore, although the S2-plus2 peptide encompasses the same residues that form most of the intermolecular contacts in both the TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 and TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-W23A structures, including W23<sub>S2</sub>, P29<sub>S2</sub>, I31<sub>S2</sub>, and F32<sub>S2</sub> (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), it was found to bind in yet a fourth mode with V38<sub>S2</sub> and I40<sub>S2</sub> inserted into the binding groove (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Interestingly, although the binding mode is variable, three aspects are shared for all structures: (i) the peptides bind to the &#946;8&#8211;&#946;9 hairpin through &#946;-strand augmentation with two to four hydrogen bonds (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b&#8211;f</xref>), (ii) the peptides generally insert two hydrophobic side chains into the binding groove as detailed above (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b&#8211;e</xref>), and (iii) peptide binding does not perturb the hydrophobic groove (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The only exception to rule (ii) is the T1 peptide, which inserts only one hydrophobic residue (Y71<sub>T1</sub>; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), but this peptide also binds with much lower affinity than the S2, S2-W23A, and S2-plus2 peptides (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition to the shared core interactions, a number of highly variable peripheral interactions are also formed. These mainly include van der Waal interactions (in particular with the &#946;8&#8211;&#946;9 hairpin), but also some hydrogen bonds, as well as a single salt bridge in the case of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-plus2 (for more details, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The fact that rather extensive interactions are formed between the IF domain and the peptides is also reflected in the favorable binding enthalpy measured by ITC. Interestingly, the proline residues of the peptides bound to the IF domains are all in the <italic>trans</italic> conformer&#8212;with the possible exception of the S2 peptide bound to molecule B in the TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2 structure, where P29<sub>S2</sub> could be in <italic>cis</italic> configuration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>)&#8212;and in most cases do not form direct interactions with the IF domain.

Notwithstanding the listed similarities, there are, however, a number of differences between the two binding modes. Most notably, Y63 forms different interactions in the two forms apart from the shared potential hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of P29<sub>S2</sub>: in the VIa1 form, the hydroxyl group of the Y63 side chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the backbone nitrogen of F30<sub>S2</sub> and the carbonyls of M27<sub>S2</sub> and I31<sub>S2</sub> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), while in the VIb-like form, it is instead within hydrogen-bonding distance of the backbone carbonyl of P29<sub>S2</sub> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). In addition, a hydrogen bond is formed between F30<sub>S2</sub> and H119 for the VIb-like form, but not the VIa1 form, and several differences are also observed in peripheral interactions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Notably, K26<sub>S2</sub>, M27<sub>S2</sub>, and K28<sub>S2</sub> adopt almost the same conformations in both binding modes. The differences in binding mode of the VIa1 and VIb-like forms thus lie mainly in the residues that are found in the C-terminal direction from P29<sub>S2</sub> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Comparison of the binding modes of FK506 and the peptides</title><p>A comparison of the FK506 and peptide binding modes reveals that the interactions between FK506 and the backbone atoms of N35 and I37, which are mediated by the O2 carbonyl oxygen atom at C1 and the O10 hydroxyl group at C24, respectively, overlap with the two &#946;-strand type interactions formed by K28<sub>S2</sub> in the S2 and S2-W23A peptides (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). It furthermore shows that the pipecolinyl ring partially overlaps with the side chain of <italic>cis</italic>-P29<sub>S2</sub> in both peptide binding modes, but is in a roughly orthogonal orientation relative to these (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), which enables it to reach considerably deeper into the pocket. Moreover, there is a partial overlap between the large appendage at the C26 atom of FK506 and the side chain of M27<sub>S2</sub> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b&#8211;d</xref>). The pipecolinyl ring is flanked by a dicarbonyl moiety encompassing both an amide carbonyl at C8 and an &#945;-keto carbonyl at C9 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), which are both candidates for mimicking the carbonyl group of a bound proline residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The carbonyl at C8 is in the <italic>trans</italic> form, as was also observed in the FKBP12:FK506 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Yet, it still hydrogen bonds with Y63 similarly to the <italic>cis</italic>-P29<sub>S2</sub> residue of the type VIb-like peptide, though at a different angle (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). This is made possible through the rotation of the pipecolinyl ring described above combined with a difference in the proline phi and psi angles relative to the equivalent angles in FK506 and a slight change in the position of Y63 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The carbonyl group at C9 is almost orthogonal to the carbonyl at C8 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), which has been suggested to enable FK506 to mimic the twisted transition state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It does not form conventional hydrogen bonds, but points directly into a sub-pocket of the binding site formed by Y13, L15, and F128, with which it forms CH&#8211;O hydrogen bonds, as described above. As hinted above, the position of Y63 differs depending on which substrate is bound. Indeed, it does not only differ between FK506 and peptides, but also between peptides adopting different binding modes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). This may suggest that the flexibility of the hinge region encompassing Y63 is important for enabling the FKBP domain to adapt to different substrates. Furthermore, the different positions of Y63 also translate into different positions of the IF and FKBP domains relative to each other (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), which may be relevant in relation to the reported cross talk between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of binding modes for the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain. <bold>a</bold> Superimposition of the FKBP domains of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-W23A molecule B (<italic>purple</italic>), TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:S2-W23A molecules D (<italic>light blue</italic>), and TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:FK506 (<italic>yellow</italic>), showing the variation in interactions with the backbone of N35&#8211;I37.

We opted to use the S2-P25A peptide for these studies because it has the advantage over the S2 peptide that it contains only one proline residue (P29), making data interpretation more straightforward, while it still binds well to both domains (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The mutation with the strongest effect on PPIase activity was Y63A, which retained only 21&#160;% activity (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). It is therefore likely that this residue plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism, in keeping with its ideal position for forming hydrogen bonds with the substrate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). This interpretation is further supported by its high degree of sequence conservation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>) as well as the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> versus K<sub>D</sub> plot (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). However, the effect on activity is clearly not exclusively due to hydrogen bonds formed by the hydroxyl group, because the Y63F mutant retained as much as 76&#160;% activity (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Interestingly, the affinity of the FKBP domain was only negligibly decreased for Y63A, but was 1.7-times higher for Y63F with a significantly greater enthalpy and largely unperturbed entropy of binding as compared to the wild type (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This is similar to what has been observed for binding of FK506 or rapamycin to the equivalent Y82F mutant of FKBP12, where detailed analysis of the binding thermodynamics indicate that the effect of the mutation is due to altered solvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The second-most detrimental mutations were Y92A, M96A, and F128A, which each retained 30&#8211;40&#160;% activity (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). F128 forms part of the hydrophobic binding site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and is highly conserved (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), whereas Y92 and M96 are found in the dynamic &#946;8&#8211;&#946;9 hairpin of the IF domain and are rather poorly conserved (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Considering the effect of the binding affinity on k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), F128 seems to be as important for catalysis as Y63. Interestingly, while the absence of the IF domain has a positive effect on k<sub>cat</sub>, the Y92A and M96A mutations seem instead to have a negative effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). We hypothesize that the effect of these two mutations on the catalytic activity is due to interference with inter-domain cross talk (see &#8220;Discussion&#8221;).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Substrate selectivity of the IF domain</title><p>ITC experiments revealed that the IF domain binds long peptides with up to nanomolar affinity, and that substantial sequence variation of the substrate can be accommodated through enthalpy-entropy compensation. Notably, we also found that peptides without proline residues can bind to the IF domain, which is in line with a previous study showing that proline-free substrates can inhibit binding of proline-containing substrates to <italic>E. coli</italic> SlyD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Four structures were obtained with 15-residue-long peptides bound to the IF domain (Figs&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The peptides bind in the large hydrophobic groove delineated by the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix and &#946;8&#8211;&#946;9 hairpin through &#946;-strand augmentation, as was also previously observed for the linker of the uncleaved purification tag in the structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> SlpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and originally predicted based on structural analysis of apo TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

This highly adaptable binding strategy explains how the IF domain is able to bind extended/flexible polypeptide stretches containing hydrophobic residues in various different sequence contexts. Notably, such stretches are a hallmark of unfolded proteins, and the IF domain therefore seems ideally suited for its function as a folding chaperone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Substrate selectivity of the FKBP domain</title><p>Most of the peptides tested in the ITC binding studies were found to bind to the FKBP domains of both TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> and TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>, though the affinities were almost invariably highest for the former. Interestingly, as was also found to be the case for the IF domain, the presence of proline residues in the substrate is not a requirement for binding to the FKBP domain in vitro. It is questionable whether such proline-independent binding is physiologically relevant, but this could potentially be the case if the FKBP domain can serve as an auxiliary binding site for the chaperone domain, such as has been suggested for trigger factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], or if it can engage non-proline dimerization motifs of cognate interaction partners, such as has been described for human FKBP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

The peptide inserts a <italic>cis</italic>-proline residue into the hydrophobic binding pocket in all cases, except in the TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub>:S3 structure, where a <italic>trans</italic>-valine residue is inserted instead, thus further supporting the conclusion that proline residues are not essential for binding to the FKBP domain.

In the case of the cyclophilins, there has been some debate as to whether it is the part N- or C-terminal to the peptidyl-prolyl bond that rotates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The FKBP field has not seen a similar debate, which is probably mainly due to a dearth of informative substrate complexes. However, on the basis of the structures presented here, we find it most likely that FKBPs operate with C-terminal rotation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>), though we concede that a definitive conclusion regarding this question will require that structures representing the <italic>trans</italic> form are also obtained. The basis for our assertion is that the two residues N-terminal to the peptidyl-prolyl bond are anchored in the same way in both the type VIa1 and VIb-like binding modes through two &#946;-strand type hydrogen bonds supplemented by side chain interactions with the hydrophobic binding pocket (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), whereas the residues found C-terminal to the peptidyl-prolyl bond adopt very different positions in the VIa1 and VIb-like &#946;-turns, suggesting that this part would have more freedom to rotate during catalysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). In line with this, it has been shown that FKBP12 exhibits higher sequence specificity towards the residue that immediately precedes the proline than the one that immediately follows it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, we also found that FK506 forms two hydrogen bonds that mimic the &#946;-strand type hydrogen bonds formed by the peptides (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Moreover, this is not unique to TtSlyD:FK506, but is also commonly observed in structures of FKBP12:inhibitor complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Indeed, based on such structures, it was already predicted that peptides would bind via two &#946;-strand type hydrogen bonds in the same manner, as we have now observed for TtSlyD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the large appendage at the C26 position of FK506 overlaps with the side chain of M27<sub>S2</sub>, that is, the residue that precedes the proline by two positions. We therefore conclude that binding of FK506 involves several interactions that mimic those of the N-terminal part of a bound polypeptide, which supports the notion that this is the part that is kept anchored during catalysis.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Model for FK506-binding protein (FKBP)-mediated rotation around the peptidyl-prolyl bond. <bold>a</bold> S2-W23A peptide bound to full-length TtSlyD (TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>) molecule D (&#946;-turn type VIb-like binding mode).

The situation is, however, complicated by the fact that a <italic>trans</italic> amide carbonyl is found at the C8 position between the ring and the &#945;-keto carbonyl, which could also serve as a mimic of the proline carbonyl group. Interestingly, we found that Y63 hydrogen bonds to both the C8 carbonyl oxygen atom of FK506 and the <italic>cis</italic>-proline carbonyl atoms of peptides bound as a type VIb-like &#946;-turn (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). It may therefore be argued that FK506 mimics aspects of the type VIb-like <italic>cis</italic>-state, though it should be pointed out that the angles of the Y63-carbonyl hydrogen bonds are markedly different in the two cases, as a consequence of the different positions of the two carbonyl groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). A probably more significant observation is that the pipecolinyl ring is roughly orthogonal to the side chains of the <italic>cis</italic>-prolines of the bound peptides regardless of their adopted binding mode (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), and penetrates considerably deeper into the binding pocket. Indeed, under the premise that catalysis proceeds through C-terminal rotation around the peptidyl-prolyl bond, this finding strongly supports the notion that FK506 mimics the twisted transition state of the substrate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>The role of tyrosine-63 in the catalytic mechanism</title><p>In our mutational analysis of the binding site, the Y63A mutation was found to be the most severe, with a residual activity of only 21&#160;%. The corresponding Y82 residue in FKBP12 has been proposed to aid in catalysis by forming a hydrogen bond to the proline imide nitrogen, thereby lowering the rotational barrier of the peptidyl-prolyl bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In line with this, we found that the hydroxyl group of Y63 is indeed within hydrogen-bonding distance of the imide nitrogen of cis-P29<sub>S2</sub> in both the type VIa1 and VIb-like peptide binding modes, if applying a generous cut-off (the distances are 3.2&#8211;3.4&#160;&#197; for the former binding mode and 3.5&#8211;3.6&#160;&#197; for the latter). The hydroxyl group of Y63 is furthermore within hydrogen-bonding distance of the backbone nitrogen of F30<sub>S2</sub> and the carbonyls of M27<sub>S2</sub> and I31<sub>S2</sub> in the case of the type VIa1 binding mode (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), and of the P29<sub>S2</sub> carbonyl group in the case of the type VIb-like binding mode (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), which might implicate it in appropriately orienting the substrate in the binding site. The functional role of Y63 is, however, not entirely dependent on the hydroxyl group, given that the Y63F mutant retained as much as 76&#160;% activity. In line with this, a mutational study on human FKBP12 where the equivalent Y82 residue was replaced by each of the other 19 proteinogenic amino acids showed that aromatic residues, arginine, and proline retained or even improved activity, whereas most other residues caused a substantial reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, similar results have also been obtained for the equivalent Y100 residue in <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> FKBP35, except that arginine and, in particular, proline replacements were less well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, it may be noted that although Y63 is highly conserved, a phenylalanine is found in its place in some catalytically active FKBPs, for example, <italic>E. coli</italic> SlpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is therefore clear that other interactions must be able to partially substitute for any functionally important hydrogen bonds formed by the hydroxyl group, for example, CH&#8211;&#960;, CH&#8211;O, or CH&#8211;N hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waal interactions. In relation to this point, it may be noted that several putative CH&#8211;O hydrogen bonds between FKBPs and bound inhibitors have been identified in FKBP:inhibitor structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and that an NMR analysis of aromatic ring flips has identified a hydrogen bond between the &#950; hydrogen of F46 and rapamycin in the FKBP12:rapamycin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>Comparisons of the crystal structures obtained for TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> indicate that Y63 is found in a highly mobile hinge region, which we further confirmed by aromatic <sup>1</sup>H&#8211;<sup>13</sup>C NMR studies on apo TtSlyD.

This mobility of Y63 can be expected to enable a certain level of dynamic remodeling of the binding site, which could be important for allowing it to optimally interact with structurally different substrates and/or for adapting to their motions during catalysis. In conclusion, the role of Y63 is not yet fully clarified, but likely hinges on a combination of its ideal position for interacting with the substrate and its high level of mobility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Evidence for inter-domain cross talk</title><p>It has been reported that there is cross talk between the IF and FKBP domains in the sense that binding to one domain affects dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], substrate affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] of the other. Here we show that 15-residue-long peptides can be bound to each of the two domains at the same time, and that deletion of the IF domain results in reduced affinity and activity of the FKBP domain of TtSlyD. Interestingly, the reduction in affinity stems mainly from less favorable entropy, suggesting that it may be a consequence of the enhanced dynamics of the FKBP domain that reportedly results from substrate binding at the IF domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We furthermore show that mutating Y63 or H119, which are part of both the inter-domain connectors and the active site of the FKBP domain, increases the affinity of the IF domain up to fivefold, and that Y63 adopts different orientations depending on the substrate, which interestingly correlates with different positions of the IF and FKBP domains relative to each other (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). This may suggest that Y63 and the connector loops may be important for inter-domain cross talk, but more studies will be needed to confirm this. Finally, we show that mutating Y92 or M96 in the IF domain to alanine reduces the PPIase activity to 36&#8211;39&#160;% relative to the wild type without substantially affecting affinities, indicating that these mutations may affect the dynamics of catalytically important FKBP residues. In conclusion, our results clearly support the notion of inter-domain cross talk in SlyD, and highlight the need for further experiments to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Catalytic activity</title><p>Our NMR lineshape analysis of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> activity on the commonly used tetrapeptide (suc-ALPF-pNA) yielded k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;1.5 10<sup>6</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is in line with previously published values obtained for <italic>E. coli</italic> SlyD using a fluorescence-based assay (0.25&#8211;1.10 10<sup>6</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). The presence of the IF domain was found to have a small effect on the activity towards tetrapeptides, which contrasts with previous studies, where no effect was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This effect probably relates to the effect of the IF domain on the affinity of the FKBP domain. For partially folded proteins, similar k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values (0.6&#8211;1.2 10<sup>6</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) but much higher affinities have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, in these cases the absence of the IF domain decreased the activity by a factor of 100&#8211;200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our studies using 15-residue-long peptides paint a different picture. These peptides bind with affinities that are similar to those of partially folded proteins, and thus much higher than those of tetrapeptides. However, the NMR-derived activity for the S2-P25A peptide is 3.7 10<sup>8</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and thus a factor of 100-times higher than for both tetrapeptides and partially folded proteins. Indeed, the activity is of the same order as that of super-efficient enzymes, with k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> in the range 10<sup>8</sup>&#8211;10<sup>10</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, whose activity is considered diffusion-limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This might appear surprising given that TtSlyD does not have a defined optimal substrate, but rather catalyzes the isomerization of a broad range of proline-containing peptides that form variable contacts with TtSlyD. However, it can be explained on the grounds that the catalytic efficiency of TtSlyD is not hindered by substrate specificity. The IF domain was found to have a definite but small effect on the activity (2.5 10<sup>8</sup>&#160;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the absence of the IF domain), similar to what we observed for suc-ALPF-pNA. Our Michaelis-Menten analysis of TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub> with the S2-P25A peptide revealed k<sub>cat</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;700,000&#160;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and K<sub>M</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;2000&#160;&#956;M, a result that highlights the high efficiency of TtSlyD. For comparison, the homologous human FKBP12 yields a k<sub>cat</sub> above 10,000&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with suc-ALPF-pNA as a substrate (U Weininger, unpublished data), again indicating high catalytic efficiency. This contrasts with k<sub>cat</sub> values determined for partially folded protein substrates, which have been estimated to be around 1&#160;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our findings can be summarized as follows: a high catalytic rate constant of k<sub>cat</sub>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;10,000&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is obtained with both S2-P25A and the suc-ALPF-pNA tetrapeptide as substrates. However, because the longer S2-P25A peptide can make more contacts with the protein (enthalpy), or retain more flexibility (entropy) in the bound state, it has lower K<sub>D</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> values, resulting in higher activity (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>). By contrast, with partially folded proteins as substrates, one observes a very low k<sub>cat</sub> (which might be coupled to folding), a strong impact of the IF domain, and a lower overall activity than what is found using peptide substrates. Taken together, the available data suggest that while SlyD can isomerize various kinds of substrates, including partially folded or unfolded proteins, it is most efficient when acting on unfolded polypeptide chains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that 15-residue-long unmodified peptides bind to TtSlyD with affinities that are similar to those of partially folded proteins, but considerably higher than estimated for the chemically modified tetrapeptides that are typically used for functional studies on FKBPs. We therefore conclude that long unmodified peptides are better mimics of unfolded protein substrates than the classical tetrapeptides. We have furthermore shown that the enzymatic activity towards the 15-residue-long S2-P25A peptide is much higher than for both tetrapeptides and partially folded proteins, implying that TtSlyD is most efficient when acting on unfolded proteins. In addition, we have presented several structures of TtSlyD in complex with 15-residue-long peptides, which represent the first structures of an FKBP protein in complex with long unmodified peptides. These structures show that unfolded polypeptides bind to the IF domain in a highly adaptable fashion involving &#946;-strand augmentation and hydrophobic interactions, which agrees well with the low sequence specificity of this domain. Furthermore, they also show that substrates can bind to the FKBP domain as both types VIa1 and VIb-like &#946;-turns, indicating that FKBPs are functionally more versatile than previously appreciated. Based on a comparison of our structures, we have proposed a novel general model for the catalytic mechanism of FKBPs that involves C-terminal rotation around the peptidyl-prolyl bond mediated by stabilization of the partially rotated transition state in the hydrophobic binding site. Our results furthermore establish that Y63 (Y82 in human FKBP12) is important for the catalytic activity of TtSlyD. Why this is the case is still not entirely clear, but it likely relates to its ideal position for interacting with substrates bound to the FKBP domain and its high mobility. Finally, we have found further evidence for the previously reported phenomenon of inter-domain cross talk between the IF and FKBP domains, and propose that Y63 may also be important in this context. To sum up, we show in great detail how the IF and FKBP domains recognize unfolded protein mimics, and provide novel insights into the general catalytic mechanism of FKBPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Reagents</title><p>Isopropyl-&#946;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH, USA).

For complex formation, the protein was typically incubated with a threefold excess of peptide or the compound FK506 for at least 1&#160;hour prior to crystallization. Crystals were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 4&#160;&#176;C in 96-well crystallization plates using total drop volumes of 0.2&#8211;0.3&#160;&#956;l. Crystallization conditions varied depending on which ligand was used, but in all cases the pH was in the range of 5.0&#8211;8.0 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as precipitant (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The crystals were then cryoprotected by the addition of 20&#160;% glycerol to the original crystallization condition, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, after which X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Diamond or SOLEIL synchrotrons.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Crystallization conditions</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>No additives were used except for TtSlyD:T1, where 11&#160;% glycerol was present in the crystallant</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>X-ray structure determination</title><p>We used XDS and XSCALE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] for processing our X-ray diffraction data sets (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). With the exception of TtSlyD<sub>&#8710;IF</sub>:S2-W23A and TtSlyD<sub>&#8710;IF</sub>:S3, all structures represent different crystal forms (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), which is not unexpected considering the wide variability in ligands and crystallization conditions. For TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>, phasing was achieved using a previously determined structure of the protein [PDB: 3LUO] as the search model for molecular replacement in the Phaser program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] of the Phenix suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Generally, a good solution required that the FKBP and IF domains were placed separately. For TtSlyD<sub>&#8710;IF</sub>:S2-W23A, we noticed a quite strong anomalous signal in the data, and we therefore carried out SAD phasing in Phenix AutoSol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] instead of molecular replacement. The phasing statistics were as follows: Bayes-CC&#8201;=&#8201;57.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7.07 and FOM&#8201;=&#8201;0.492. The structure revealed that the signal stems from a number of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (the crystal was grown in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub>), as well as a metal ion coordinated by six histidines, which we have interpreted as a co-purified Ni<sup>2+</sup> ion (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Phases for the other two TtSlyD<sub>&#916;IF</sub> structures were obtained by molecular replacement in Phaser (though a considerable anomalous signal was also present in these data sets). For all structures, refinement was carried out using iterative cycles of manual rebuilding in Coot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and maximum likelihood refinement in Phenix refine version 1.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

We generally used isotropic B-factor refinement with translation libration screw (TLS) restraints, with one TLS group for each protein and peptide chain (and no groups for FK506 or solvent). The exceptions to this are the 1.4&#160;&#197; TtSlyD<sub>FL</sub>:T1 structure where we used anisotropic B-factor refinement without TLS, and the 1.75&#160;&#197; TtSlyD<sub>&#8710;IF</sub>:S2-W23A structure, where we used a combination of isotropic B-factor refinement with TLS (protein and peptide chains) and anisotropic B-factor refinement without TLS (ions).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Protein structure analysis</title><p>Analysis of hinge regions was performed using DynDom version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]; protein:substrate interfaces were analyzed using the PISA program version 1.51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; and conservation analysis was done using ConSurf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]: specifically, an alignment of 150 proteins (25&#8211;95&#160;% identical to TtSlyD) from UniRef-90 was used for coloring the structure by sequence conservation.
