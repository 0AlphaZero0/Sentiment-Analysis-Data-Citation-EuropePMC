Among them, amber codon suppression (genetic code expansion) has developed into an elegant tool to incorporate unnatural amino acids (uAA) at predefined sites in the protein backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>This method is based on the translation machinery evolved in archaebacteria, which are able to incorporate the 22<sup>nd</sup> amino acid L-pyrrolysine (Pyl) as building block in proteins during translation beyond the typically used 20 canonical amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pyl is encoded by an amber termination codon (UAG) within a gene and is recognized by its orthogonal suppressor tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup>. The transfer of Pyl to its specific tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> is catalyzed by a specific pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS). Due to high substrate side chain promiscuity of the PylRS enzyme, structural related Pyl analogues with distinct functional groups can be easily integrated to enable a broad chemical versatility for bioconjugation chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In fact up to 23 different functional uAA were shown to be incorporated using the native PylRS/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> pair originated from <italic>Methanosarcina barkeri</italic> (<italic>M. Barkeri)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Moreover, numerous PylRS mutants have been engineered with improved activities and for recognition of Pyl derivatives, which are not targeted by the native PylRS enzyme. Whereas other orthogonal synthetase-tRNA pairs derived from strains like <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> are confined to bacterial cells without further genetic modifications, the genes of the PylRS-tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> system from <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> species are of broad applicability and have been successfully transferred to incorporate uAA in proteins in more complex hosts such as yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or multicellular organisms such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p>Protein yields, however, are usually lower compared to the expression levels of the wild-type analogue. Optimization of uAA incorporation using amber codon suppression includes (i) variation of uAA addition (concentration and time of addition to the expression medium), (ii) expression control for the PylRS/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> pair as well as for the gene of interest and (iii) quantification of the desired product. Up to now, reports are based on gel electrophoresis analysis and, therefore, rather qualitative or average yields of purified protein are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, these do not allow online monitoring or high throughput screening of culture conditions as required for studies based on experimental design including the assessment of interactions among parameters (i.e. questions regarding the impact of one input parameter A depending on the level of another parameter B).</p><p>Consequently, we applied a high-throughput approach combined with online monitoring of microbial growth and product formation of a fluorescent reporter protein. Process parameters with relevance for the insertion of uAA by the PylRS-tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> system in <italic>E. coli</italic> were identified and optimized. The system was further consolidated by end point-detection of the uAA modified fluorescent reporter protein in the bacterial supernatant using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Introduction of unnatural amino acids into eGFP by amber codon suppression</title><p>Enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was used to monitor uAA incorporation with the pylRS/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> pair originated from <italic>M. barkeri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The amber codon (UAG) was integrated into the eGFP sequence at the N-terminus (residue #4; Lys4/uAA) to exclusively monitor eGFP formation as result of the successfully integrated uAA through amber codon suppression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The /tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> was constitutively expressed, whereas both the pylRS and the UAG-eGFP target gene were under lac operon control for induction with IPTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As substrates for the native PylRS/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup><sub>CUA</sub> pair two different well-recognized Pyl derivatives were chosen: Plk (propargyl-L-lysine; 1) and Alk ((S)-2-amino-6-((2-azidoethoxy) carbonylamino) hexanoic acid; 2; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The azide and alkyne functionalities of the selected uAA enable biorthogonal click chemistry as demonstrated by myoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or basic fibroblast growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and for site-specific protein modification of the glycocalyx on living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The formation of uAA-eGFP and biomass is monitored through the transparent bottom of microtiter plates with a screening platform constructed in-house in a modified BioLector setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An optical fiber connected to a fluorescence spectrometer was positioned below the microtiter plates and allowed non-invasive online monitoring without interrupting the orbital shaking movement required for oxygen supply and mixing of the culture. The optical fiber automatically moved so quickly from well to well such that continuous monitoring of up to 4 microtiter plates was achieved providing on the fly comparison of various process parameters through quasi-simultaneous read-outs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Introduction of unnatural amino acid into eGFP and high throughput screening. <bold>a</bold> The amino acid sequence of Lys-eGFP was extended with two Gly after position 1 and the unnatural amino acid was incorporated at the position of the amber stop codon TAG which was introduced at position 4 using (<bold>b</bold>) propargyl-L-lysine (Plk, <bold>1</bold>) or (S)-2-amino-6-((2-azidoethoxy)carbonylamino) hexanoic acid (Alk, <bold>2</bold>). <bold>c</bold> Beta barrel structure of eGFP (PDB ID: 2Y0G) with highlighted chromophore in the center and incorporation site for the unnatural amino acid at the N-terminus at position 4. <bold>d</bold> Non-invasive online monitoring of <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures, producing the unnatural amino acid containing eGFP.

Expression of Plk-eGFP and Alk-eGFP compared to Lys-eGFP (positive control) and to IPTG induced bacteria transformed with the pylRS/tRNAPylCUA pair but without the addition of the uAA (negative control) was analyzed in total cell lysates after 6&#160;h of expression by SDS-PAGE (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>,a) followed by Western blotting to confirm the protein&#8217;s identity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,b</xref>). As expected expression of wild-type Lys-eGFP was highest as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and in comparison to Plk-eGFP and Alk-eGFP, respectively. As next we isolated all eGFP constructs from cell lysates by metal ion affinity chromatography. Purification of all eGFP analogues resulted in high purity as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,c</xref>). eGFP fluorescence is linked to proper eGFP folding into the characteristic GFP &#946;-barrel structure (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). To investigate the effects of uAA insertion, which may interfere with the tertiary structure of eGFP, affecting its fluorescence properties, purified Plk-eGFP and Alk-eGFP were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy in comparison to the control protein (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Both eGFP analogues showed identical fluorescence signatures with &#955;<sub>max</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;510&#160;nm of eGFP as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], indicating that uAA insertion did not interfere with eGFP &#946;-barrel maturation. MALDI-MS analysis suggested N-terminal Met removal from all eGFP constructs upon translation through <italic>E. coli</italic> derived methionine amino peptidase (MetAP) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). This finding was corroborated by elastase digests of Plk-eGFP and Alk-eGFP followed by LC-MS/MS analysis confirming the insertion of Plk (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) and Alk (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>) at position #4 in the amino acid sequence. This characterized eGFP fluorescence reporter system marked the starting point for deploying the screening platform.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

ELISA measurements confirmed the formation of Plk-eGFP in induced cultures but the absence of eGFP in non-induced cultures (data not shown). We hypothesized that a superimposition of biogenic flavin fluorescence was the cause for the detected signal increase in non-induced cultures. In contrast to commercially available BioLector setups that rely on fixed combinations of excitation and emission filters for detection of fluorescence signals the monochromators of the in-house constructed HTMS enable measurements at all wavelength combinations in the UV-Vis range. With this system in our hands, we selectively monitored in parallel an additional flavin fluorescence intensity signal over the course of the cultivation (450/528&#160;nm, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, left axis, <italic>squares</italic>). For non-induced cultures (<italic>grey</italic>), this signal correlated well to the scattered light intensity indicating biomass formation (650/650&#160;nm, right axis, <italic>circles</italic>). Induced cultures (<italic>red</italic>) showed an over proportional increase driven by the overlapping fluorescence of the formed Plk-eGFP. By applying routinely used unmixing methods the eGFP fluorescence signal could be corrected by subtracting the flavin signal multiplied by the ratio of raw eGFP to flavin fluorescence intensity at the end of non-induced cultivations after 36&#160;h (I<sub>eGFP,corrected</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;I<sub>eGFP,raw</sub> &#8211; 0.47 I<sub>flavin</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As expected the corrected eGFP signal showed a strong increase during cultivation of induced cultures and alternated around zero for non-induced cultures (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

These parameters were systematically varied in parallelized cultivations and biomasses as well as Plk-eGFP formation were monitored online. The online monitoring experiments indicated a minor impact of the Plk concentration on biomass formation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Up until the end of the exponential growth phase after 12&#160;h the scattered light signals quantitatively reflecting biomass concentrations were very similar for 0&#8211;70&#160;mM Plk. After 12&#160;h cultures with high Plk concentrations (50&#160;mM, 70&#160;mM) showed lower growth rates resulting in 14&#8211;24&#160;% lower biomass at the end of the experiment. In contrast, Plk-eGFP formation strongly depended on Plk concentration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) peaking at the end of the growth phase after approx. 15&#160;h. Increasing the Plk concentration from 0&#8211;30&#160;mM strongly increased Plk-eGFP formation, while further supplementation up to 50&#160;mM Plk did not impact outcome. The observed drop in Plk-eGFP formation at 70&#160;mM possibly reflected growth limitations as indicated in the biomass signal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Online measurement of biomass and Plk-eGFP formation.

In contrast, eGFP fluorescence was detected within 30&#160;min after Plk supplementation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Especially late Plk supplementations after 10 or 12&#160;h of cultivation &#8211; when more biomass was present for eGFP formation &#8211; sparked a steep increase in eGFP fluorescence. The fast fluorescence response measured with the online monitoring system provided evidence that the PylRS catalyzed transfer of Plk to the tRNA was not rate limiting under the selected culture conditions and sufficient expression level of PylRS were achieved. Later Plk supplementation decreased eGFP fluorescence signals as compared to earlier time-points demonstrating the positive impact of early Plk supplementation on Plk-eGFP formation.</p><p>Induction with IPTG decelerated growth (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Supplementation with 150&#8211;500&#160;&#956;M IPTG retarded the end of the exponential phase by 1.5&#160;h as compared to non-induced cultures and decreased final scattered light intensity by about 20&#160;% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). These reductions in biomass following IPTG reflect the metabolic burden introduced by the heterologous protein production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The amount of formed eGFP was not impacted by c<sub>IPTG</sub> as tested within a range of 150&#8211;500&#160;&#956;M (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). t<sub>IPTG</sub> scarcely impacted biomass formation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Early induction after 4 or 6&#160;h slightly reduced growth rates reflecting the shift of cellular resources from biomass formation into eGFP formation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Consequently, earlier t<sub>IPTG</sub> resulted in higher eGFP formation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>).</p><p>Online fluorescence monitoring also showed a delay of at least 1&#160;h between IPTG supplementation and eGFP detection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). This is in contrast to shorter response time of about 30&#160;min following Plk addition (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Straightforward extrapolating of the optimized set point found for Plk-eGFP formation to Alk-eGFP resulted in immediately achieved concentrations of 2.56&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.13&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>-1</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, black bar; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Alk-38). The amount of supplied Alk critically drove uAA-eGFP formation as read from online monitored fluorescence (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Starting off these results, rapid process optimization for Alk by using 10&#160;mM Alk instead of 30&#160;mM Plk readily boosted maximum eGFP fluorescence intensities beyond the results obtained for Plk-eGFP, possibly reflecting a higher PylRS affinity for Alk in comparison to Plk. Nevertheless, both concentrations found for the optima (10&#160;mM for Alk and 30&#160;mM for Plk) were far beyond commonly applied uAA concentration, typically in the range of 1&#160;mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], although higher uAA concentrations have already been linked to increased target protein concentration as estimated after expression and purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, high uAA concentrations &#8211; as demonstrated for Alk and Plk here &#8211; are not cost-effective for large scale expression and are therefore still the limiting factor in genetic code expansion technology.</p><p>The HTMS allows for rapid screening and the examples provided above demonstrated the power of parallelized assessments, yielding rapid optimization of culture conditions while readily balancing the need for high titers and robust processes for reproducible batch-to-batch outcome. Optima identified for Plk-eGFP and Alk-eGFP concentrations approximated titers of wild-type, unmodified Lys-eGFP (4.98&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.23&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>-1</sup> produced under the same conditions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Lys) performing at 36&#160;% and 49&#160;% relative to the wild-type, respectively. Recent progress in the field of genetic code expansion can conveniently be screened and optimized by this setup.

For uAA-GFP, a very early induction optimum (t<sub>IPTG</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.2&#160;h) was determined with the two-stage screening. Induction after just 3&#160;h of cultivation already impaired target protein production by 15&#160;% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Furthermore, no deviations in growth rates were detected upon addition of up to 40&#160;mM of Plk (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This shows that unintended uAA incorporation into host protein that could reduce fitness and product formation capabilities is of no concern here. If that was the case, the optimal induction time would lie after the early exponential growth phase when further cell growth has a lesser effect on final product concentration. The early induction optimum also reflects the general need for early induction times when working within the specific context of uAA incorporation, caused by the additional requirement of tRNA<sup>uAA</sup><sub>CUA</sub> pair formation as compared to wild type expression. Previous studies already demonstrated the advantages of independently controlling the incorporation machinery versus the target gene, thereby fine-tuning protein ratios for uAA incorporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, the influence of the location of the amber codon within the gene &#8211; ranging from initial to terminal integration of the uAA at the ribosome &#8211; on eGFP expression levels can be detailed by the HTMS presented here.</p><p>High-throughput experimentation with concise optimization steps is highly beneficial to quickly adjust parameters for each target protein. Current studies starting off what is described here aim at expanding the application to non-fluorescent proteins. While the overall approach remains identical, these systems need to shift from monitoring of fluorescent proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) to other available online signals like biomass and oxygen transfer rate. Preliminary experiments already indicated that a measurement of the metabolic burden induced by heterologous protein formation can be used to assess non-fluorescent protein formation during genetic code expansion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a high throughput assessment platform designed for parallel screening and optimization studies.

A filling volume of 780&#160;&#956;L per well, a shaking frequency of 1000&#160;rpm and a shaking diameter of 3&#160;mm were used. The plates were sealed with a sterile self-adhesive polyolefin sealing foil (900371, HJ-Bioanalytik, Germany) to reduce evaporation while still allowing sufficient gas transfer. During cultivation, final concentrations of IPTG (0&#8211;1000&#160;&#956;M) and uAA (0&#8211;80&#160;mM) were adjusted by adding 20&#8211;70&#160;&#956;L of concentrated stock solutions after shortly reducing the shaking frequency to 100&#160;rpm. All media were supplemented with 100&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>-1</sup> carbenicillin and 34&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Online monitoring of uAA-eGFP formation and biomass growth (BioLector)</title><p>Scattered light and fluorescence measurements were performed through the transparent bottom of the microtiter plates with an in-house constructed screening system based on the established BioLector setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In short, a quartz/quartz multi-mode fiber (LUV 105&#160;&#956;m, LEONI, Germany) was moved sequentially below the wells of up to four microtiter plates by a Cartesian motion system (CMS, Bosch Rexroth, Germany). The fiber was connected to a spectrofluorometer with excitation/emission monochromators (Fluoromax-4, HORIBA Jobin Yvon GmbH, Germany) and allowed quasi-continuous and contactless measurements on up to 4 microtiter plates in parallel without stopping the shaking movement which otherwise might have resulted in cell sedimentation and oxygen limitation.</p><p>For each well eGFP fluorescence intensity (I<sub>eGFP,raw</sub>) was measured for 600&#160;ms at an excitation wavelength of 475&#160;nm, an emission wavelength of 507&#160;nm and a bandpass of 6&#160;nm. Flavin fluorescence intensity (I<sub>flavin</sub>) were measured for 600&#160;ms at an excitation wavelength of 450&#160;nm, an emission wavelength of 528&#160;nm and a bandpass of 6&#160;nm to correct the eGFP signal for biogenic autofluorescence (I<sub>eGFP,corrected</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;I<sub>eGFP,raw</sub> &#8211; 0.47 I<sub>flavin</sub>). Backscatter intensity as a signal for biomass was monitored for 900&#160;ms at 650&#160;nm with a bandpass of 4&#160;nm. Correlations between backscatter intensity, optical density and cell dry weight can be established as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For raw eGFP and flavin fluorescence measurements the mean relative standard deviations of two sets of triplicates (non-induced, induced) over a cultivation time of 36&#160;h (326 data points) were 1.15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.63&#160;% and 0.95&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.72&#160;% respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

The results of the first screening stage which considered the four process parameters (main effects) and linear interactions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) were used to estimate the design space for the second stage which additionally considered quadratic interactions in central composite face-centered design (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The model coefficients were scaled and centered to allow a comparison of effects and their significance was determined (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). The significant terms were used to construct a response surface model that predicts Plk-eGFP fluorescence as a function of Plk conc., IPTG conc. and IPTG time of addition. A validation run with 12 conditions plus center point was performed and showed that predicted and measured fluorescence intensities were in good agreement (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). A robust setpoint for Plk-eGFP formation was determined by Monte-Carlo simulation (50,000 predicted fluorescence intensities, minimum threshold: 710,000&#160;a.u., median: 739,511&#160;a.u., Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). Experiments were conducted in duplicates (triplicate for center points).

The amount of Plk-eGFP produced at the optimized set points was subsequently determined by ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>eGFP quantification by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)</title><p>Precultivations for ELISA measurements were performed as described for the online monitoring experiments. The main cultivation was conducted in shake flasks instead of microtiter plates to generate sufficient biomass for subsequent analysis. Cultivation conditions were the same as in the second precultivation step described above (V<sub>L</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;10&#160;mL, n&#8201;=&#8201;350&#160;rpm, d<sub>0</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;350&#160;rpm, T&#8201;=&#8201;30&#160;&#176;C). The production of uAA-eGFP was induced with a final IPTG concentration of 433&#160;&#956;M and 0&#8211;38&#160;mM uAA at the start of the cultivation. After 24&#160;h of cultivation, eGFP fluorescence was measured in 48-well FlowerPlates as described for the online monitoring experiments. Additionally, bacterial pellets from 8&#160;mL expression cultures were washed in PBS and resuspended in 1&#160;mL extraction buffer supplemented with extraction enhancer solution provided by the eGFP ELISA Kit resulting in a total volume of approximately 1.2&#160;mL bacterial suspension. 1&#160;mL of this suspension was transferred into a 2&#160;mL tube and 10&#160;&#956;L of a 0.1&#160;M PMSF solution as well as 0.5&#160;&#956;L poly(propylene) glycol were added. Cell lysis was performed with a SONOPULS Ultrasonic homogenizer HD 3100 system in six sonication cycles (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). Each cycle lasted for 30&#160;s applying 0.6&#160;s pulses in 1.2&#160;s intervals with an amplitude of 80&#160;% followed by a pause of 45&#160;s. After this procedure samples were centrifuged at 12.000&#160;g for 20&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C and aliquots of the supernatants were used for eGFP quantification. ELISA was performed following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Absorbance of the acidified 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;-tetramethylbenzidine diimine product was determined at 450&#160;nm using a Spectramax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
