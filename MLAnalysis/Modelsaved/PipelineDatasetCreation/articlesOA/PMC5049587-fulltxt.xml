Here, we assess the evolution and resistance acquisition dynamics of <italic>E. faecium</italic> in a clinical context using a series of 132 bloodstream infection isolates from a single hospital. All isolates, of which 49 (37&#8201;%) were vancomycin-resistant, underwent whole-genome sequencing. <italic>E. faecium</italic> was found to be subject to high rates of recombination with little evidence of sequence importation from outside the local <italic>E. faecium</italic> population. Apart from disrupting phylogenetic reconstruction, recombination was frequent enough to invalidate MLST typing in the identification of clonal expansion and transmission events, suggesting that, where available, whole-genome sequencing should be used in tracing the epidemiology of <italic>E. faecium</italic> nosocomial infections and establishing routes of transmission. Several forms of the Tn<italic>1549</italic>-like element&#8211;<italic>vanB</italic> gene cluster, which was exclusively responsible for vancomycin resistance, appeared and spread within the hospital during the study period. Several transposon gains and losses and instances of <italic>in situ</italic> evolution were inferred and, although usually chromosomal, the resistance element was also observed on a plasmid background. There was qualitative evidence for clonal expansions of both vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible <italic>E. faecium</italic> with evidence of hospital-specific subclonal expansion. Our data are consistent with continuing evolution of this established hospital pathogen and confirm hospital vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> patient transmission events, underlining the need for careful consideration before modifying current <italic>E. faecium</italic> infection control strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic></kwd><kwd>infection control</kwd><kwd>multi-locus sequence typing</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>vancomycin resistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><def-list list-type="simple" list-content="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations: </title><def-item><term>CC</term><def><p>clonal complex</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNV</term><def><p>single nucleotide variant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ST</term><def><p>sequence type</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VRE</term><def><p>vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VSE</term><def><p>vancomycin-susceptible <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WGS</term><def><p>whole-genome sequencing</p></def></def-item></def-list></notes></front><body><sec id="s1-1"><title>Data Summary</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Genome read data for all samples has been deposited into European Nucleotide Archive NA under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="PRJEB8624">PRJEB8624</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB8624">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB8624</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Annotated Plasmid pJEG050 has been deposited into GenBank under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="KR066794">KR066794</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/827342679">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/827342679</ext-link>/)</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Impact Statement</title><p><italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> has been identified as one of six key pathogens that are a threat to future healthcare provision. This is due to its ability to cause devastating infections in susceptible patients, which are difficult to treat as a result of <italic>E. faecium</italic> acquiring antimicrobial resistance, especially to first-line therapy such as vancomycin. Not surprisingly, hospitals implement several interventions to prevent spread of this organism especially if it is vancomycin-resistant. However, the utility of this strategy is unknown because of suboptimal understanding about the evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. We present a comprehensive analysis of the largest dataset to date of <italic>E. faecium</italic> from a single institution and also examine the context of our isolates in relation to other Australian isolates. Not only do we document the genomic plasticity we are able to show examples of recombination leading to novel MLST emergence and recreation of old MLST types. Sources of recombination are identified with further hospital adaptation documented. Antimicrobial resistance dynamics are explored with patient transmission events observed. Overall our results substantially add to the current debates around <italic>E. faecium</italic> infection control and will assist in forming policies of how to curb the ongoing spread of <italic>E. faecium.</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1-3"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enterococci form part of the normal gastrointestinal flora of healthy humans. Although two species, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, predominate, the clinical impact of <italic>E. faecium</italic> as a nosocomial pathogen has increased substantially and risen to prominence over the last two decades (<xref rid="mgen000048-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">Arias &amp; Murray, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Hidron1" ref-type="bibr">Hidron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Infections caused by <italic>E. faecium</italic> are difficult to treat, because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to a variety of antibiotics including vancomycin, regarded currently as first-line therapy (<xref rid="mgen000048-McGowan1" ref-type="bibr">McGowan &amp; Tenover, 2004</xref>). Consequently, vancomycin-resistant <italic>E. faecium</italic> (VRE) infections are associated with substantially higher patient morbidity and mortality compared with vancomycin-susceptible (VSE) infections (<xref rid="mgen000048-DiazGranados1" ref-type="bibr">DiazGranados <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Resistance to vancomycin in <italic>E. faecium</italic> is generally conferred by either the <italic>vanA</italic> operon, predominant in the United States (<xref rid="mgen000048-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">Arias &amp; Murray, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Courvalin1" ref-type="bibr">Courvalin, 2006</xref>), or the <italic>vanB</italic> operon common in Australia (<xref rid="mgen000048-Coombs1" ref-type="bibr">Coombs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), almost always carried on the transposable element Tn<italic>1549</italic> (or a closely related derivative) (<xref rid="mgen000048-Garnier1" ref-type="bibr">Garnier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).

Moreover, high levels of homologous recombination have been linked to the emergence of specific hospital-adapted clones (e.g. the group designated MLST clonal complex 17) with the vast majority of infection isolates clustering within clade A1 (<xref rid="mgen000048-Lebreton1" ref-type="bibr">Lebreton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Consequently, genome plasticity has been cited as evidence for the recent and ongoing evolution of <italic>E. faecium</italic> (<xref rid="mgen000048-de1" ref-type="bibr">de Been <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Howden1" ref-type="bibr">Howden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Willems123" ref-type="bibr">Willems <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) with clones thought to have received at least some genetic material from (colonizing) <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolates within the patient or the environment through cross-transmission (<xref rid="mgen000048-de1" ref-type="bibr">de Been <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, apart from the <italic>vanB</italic> operon, the identities, specific functions and overall contribution of imported sequences to a healthcare-associated phenotype remain poorly understood, reflecting perhaps the difficulty of assembling informative isolate collections and difficulties in determining specific recombination events. Although previous studies have reported signals for ongoing evolution, especially in favour of disease-causing clones (<xref rid="mgen000048-de1" ref-type="bibr">de Been <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Willems12" ref-type="bibr">Willems <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, 2005), none has examined the alternative hypothesis of new clone emergence as a result of continuous recombination.</p><p>In locations where VRE has become endemic much effort is put into preventing cross-transmission by screening at-risk patients and isolating VRE-colonized patients. Although these are logical responses to a serious problem, the effectiveness of these costly strategies is difficult to test objectively for several reasons: they are applied only where VRE infection is already a problem, they may be difficult to disentangle from changes in antimicrobial usage, and absolute infection rates may not be informative about the sources and transmission patterns of VRE in hospitals. One remedy for the lack of resolution provided by headline rates of infection has been the use of genetic information in the form of MLST to assess relationships between isolates and infer outbreaks. MLST remains the <italic>de facto</italic> standard for identifying outbreaks despite the potential availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS).</p><p>To better understand the dynamics of vancomycin resistance and its relationship to genome micro-evolution in a well-delineated population, we assembled and analysed whole-genome sequences of a substantial and comprehensive single-hospital collection of bloodstream <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolates with a high proportion of VRE. We used this information to investigate the role of recombination in the within-hospital evolution of the organism, including the emergence of vancomycin resistance, and to assess the overall relationships to external (other Australian) <italic>E. faecium</italic> isolates, which will further inform the current debates about the likely effectiveness of standard approaches for VRE infection control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1-4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Isolate collection</title><p>In total, 146 consecutive non-duplicate blood culture isolates from patients with confirmed <italic>E. faecium</italic> bacteraemic infection at a single institution, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) in Sydney, Australia, from two distinct time intervals (2004&#8211;2007 and 2011&#8211;2013), were identified for study (Table S1, available in the online Supplementary Material).

In one of these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mgen000048-f01">Fig. 1</xref>; indicated by the number 1), a recombination event across a single locus (<italic>atpA)</italic> resulted in the emergence of a new ST, 990, in two isolates and confirms the alternative hypothesis of new clone emergence as a result of continuous recombination. Conversely, one possible false-positive clustering resulted from the recreation of an already present ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mgen000048-f01">Fig. 1</xref>; red branches).</p><p>These observations when combined with clinical&#8211;epidemiological data would have resulted in incorrectly missing or assigning <italic>E. faecium</italic> outbreaks.

Inspection of the clonal phylogeny in conjunction with temporal signals of genetic clustering within our hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mgen000048-f01">Fig. 1</xref>) suggests a distinct common source or a history of progressively spreading institution-specific sublineages.

We conclude that although sequence types previously may have been a useful descriptor, for newly emerging clones and local populations, the ongoing and rapid nature of homologous recombination in <italic>E. faecium</italic> means that MLST is suboptimal in settings where WGS is available (<xref rid="mgen000048-Howden1" ref-type="bibr">Howden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="mgen000048-Willems123" ref-type="bibr">Willems <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In a widely accepted model, several factors contribute to the success of <italic>E. faecium</italic> and VRE in the hospital environment. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy selects for enteric carriage of <italic>E. faecium</italic> due to the organism's intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics. The increased dominance of <italic>E. faecium</italic> (rather than <italic>E. faecalis</italic>) within the gastrointestinal flora subsequently results in enhanced cross-transmission via surfaces and inter-personal contacts (<xref rid="mgen000048-Arias1" ref-type="bibr">Arias &amp; Murray, 2012</xref>) and invasive disease in a subset of colonized patients. This process is augmented by the hospital environment, which in turn has selected for specific <italic>E. faecium</italic> lineages such as CC17 that now predominate among hospital-acquired disease isolates but not among community isolates. Within this model, several questions have been considered, such as: what genetic alterations may have led to the emergence of dominant lineages, and what is the role of <italic>de-novo</italic> acquisition rather than transmission of vancomycin resistance in VRE epidemiology?</p><p>More recently, awareness has grown that VRE epidemiology is not as simple as the formation of VRE clones by <italic>vanB</italic> acquisition followed by their transmission (<xref rid="mgen000048-Howden1" ref-type="bibr">Howden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This has given rise to debates about the utility of current infection control strategies in controlling VRE, with some experts suggesting discontinuing infection control measures all together (<xref rid="mgen000048-Karki1" ref-type="bibr">Karki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It is important, however, not to consider the observed repeated <italic>de novo</italic> acquisition of vancomycin resistance as failure but rather the consequence of effective classical infection control measures, especially given the observation of a direct case-to-case transmission and genetically clustered VRE (consistent with chains of successive asymptomatic colonization events linking several patients).</p><p>Which strategies are most effective and should be employed to control VRE remains uncertain; for instance our data, with its evidence for multiple gains and losses of resistance, suggest that for all its importance in mortality, vancomycin resistance is less crucial to the biology of <italic>E. faecium</italic> at the population level and is independent of core genome adaptation to the hospital environment. In contrast, the dynamics of <italic>E. faecium</italic> seem well established, with selection of specific adaptive traits through genome plasticity leading to the formation and expansion of successful clones within the hospital. Understanding these dynamics in conjunction with those factors, which enable <italic>E. faecium</italic> to gain mobile genetic elements including vancomycin resistance, may unlock the secrets that allow successful containment of VRE. To achieve this, in our view, we will need to better characterize connections between <italic>E. faecium</italic> colonization and infection and substantially improve our understanding of the biology of Tn<italic>1549</italic>&#8211;<italic>vanB</italic> within commensals and the greater <italic>E. faecium</italic> population.</p><p>To address these important questions, further studies are required that include multiple different sources of isolates allowing for better characterization of the overall hospital VRE burden and the possible extent that transmission adds to this burden. As multiple rounds of gain and loss in non-selective circumstances (e.g. carriage within the hospital) must separate many of the infections, it is clear that future studies should include asymptomatic carriage and mild disease isolates in order to &#8216;join the dots&#8217;, both epidemiologically and in establishing how resistance and resistance-carrying organisms move around the hospital.</p><p><italic>E. faecium</italic> is a highly recombining, multi-resistant organism, which appears both to have initially adapted to the hospital environment and to have repeatedly evolved new clones that have competed with each other, while frequently gaining and losing vancomycin resistance. WGS in an institutional population study of disease cases has allowed us to demonstrate that classical genetic typing is unreliable and unsuitable for routine outbreak tracing where WGS is available, especially given the highly complex genomic relationships observed among isolates within and between institutions. For example, we emphasize the clear genomic clusters into which many isolates fall, finding evidence for cross transmission. In addition, VRE epidemiology may be institution-specific and is likely to be highly dynamic given the genome plasticity observed, suggesting an ongoing need for larger scale surveillance and carefully crafted genomic studies. Such studies will need to include carriage and other non-disease isolates to better determine the epidemiology of within-hospital <italic>E. faecium</italic> and VRE infections and the dynamics of vancomycin resistance acquisition. Together, these insights would support the development of optimized infection control strategies and interruption of transmission limiting the impact of these infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research was supported by Wellcome Trust grant 090532/Z/09/Z.
