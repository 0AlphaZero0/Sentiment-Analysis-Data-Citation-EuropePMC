In the present study, we investigated a pathophysiological significance of microRNA-188-5p (miR-188-5p) in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). We found that oligomeric A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> treatment diminished miR-188-5p expression in primary hippocampal neuron cultures and that miR-188-5p rescued the A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>-mediated synapse elimination and synaptic dysfunctions. Moreover, the impairments in cognitive function and synaptic transmission observed in 7-month-old five familial AD (5XFAD) transgenic mice, were ameliorated via viral-mediated expression of miR-188-5p. miR-188-5p expression was down-regulated in the brain tissues from AD patients and 5XFAD mice. The addition of miR-188-5p rescued the reduction in dendritic spine density in the primary hippocampal neurons treated with oligomeric A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> and cultured from 5XFAD mice. The reduction in the frequency of mEPSCs was also restored by addition of miR-188-5p. The impairments in basal fEPSPs and cognition observed in 7-month-old 5XFAD mice were ameliorated via the viral-mediated expression of miR-188-5p in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we found that miR-188 expression is CREB-dependent. Taken together, our results suggest that dysregulation of miR-188-5p expression contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by inducing synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits associated with A&#946;-mediated pathophysiology in the disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>MicroRNAs are non-coding RNA molecules with a length of approximately 22 nucleotides, which serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Moreover, the impairments in cognitive function and synaptic transmission observed in 7-month-old 5XFAD transgenic mice, which harbor 3 familial AD mutations of APP 695, namely the Swedish, Florida, and London mutations and 2 presenilin1 (PSEN1) mutations (M146L and L286V), were ameliorated via viral-mediated expression of miR-188-5p. miR-188-5p expression was reduced and Nrp-2 was up-regulated in brain tissues from AD patients and 5XFAD mice. miR-188 gene has a cAMP response element (CRE) in its potential promoter region which would be shared with chloride channel 5 (<italic>Clcn 5</italic>). We found that CREB regulates the transcription of miR-188.

These results suggest that the decrease in miR-188-5p expression causes down-regulation of dendritic spine density.</p><p>Next, we recorded mEPSCs and analyzed the frequency and amplitude to measure basal synaptic transmission. A single whole-cell recording method was employed to record vehicle-treated or 5&#8201;&#956;M A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>-treated rat primary hippocampal neurons transfected with IRES-mGFP plus microRNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h&#8211;k</xref>). mEPSC frequency in A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>-treated rat primary hippocampal neurons was significantly decreased compared to vehicle-treated neurons. However, in neurons treated with A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> plus 50&#8201;nM or 100&#8201;nM miR-188-5p oligonucleotides, the reduction in mEPSC frequency was almost completely reversed back to control levels. Again, this was a miR-188-5p-specific effect as neurons treated with A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> after co-transfection of miR-SC or miR-124 showed no effect on the attenuation of the A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>-mediated reduction in mEPSC frequency. Here, we also examined the effects of 2&#8242;-O-methyl (2&#8242;-O-Me) oligonucleotide for miR-188-5p (2&#8242;-O-Me-188-5p-AS), which serves as a miR-188-5p specific inhibitor on mEPSCs. First, the effects of 2&#8242;-O-Me-188-5p-AS on the level of miR-188-5p and miR-188-3p was examined, respectively. It was found that the level of miR-188-5p was significantly decreased by the treatment with 2&#8242;-O-Me-miR-188-5p AS for 6 days, while that of miR-188-3p did not show a significant change, indicating that 2&#8242;-O-Me-188-5p-AS serves as miR-188-5p specific inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).

These mice showed higher levels of freezing (59.33&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8.67%, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.047), similar to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p>Next we measured spatial working memory in 5XFAD mice using T-maze. These mice showed significantly reduced levels of spontaneous alternation performance (37.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.10, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.002), compared to wild-type mice (67.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.34; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Expression of miR-188-5p reversed the reduction in spontaneous alternation performance (56.82&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7.61, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.037).</p><p>To investigate the synaptic mechanisms underlying the enhancement of learning and memory by miR-188-5p, we first examined basal synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses through fEPSP recording. Consistent with previous observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, 5XFAD mice showed clear synaptic deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The relationship between the fEPSP slope and the fiber volley (FV) amplitude was significantly reduced in 5XFAD mice compared with wild-type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). However, FV amplitude stimulation intensity ratios were not different in all experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). These results imply that reduced synaptic transmission in 5XFAD mice might stem from deleterious effects of A&#946; on postsynaptic compartments rather than a reduced number of active presynaptic fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Unexpectedly, viral-mediated expression of miR-188-5p in the 5XFAD CA1 neurons significantly increased synaptic strength. The fEPSP slope to FV amplitude ratios of 5XFAD/miR-188-5p mice were almost indistinguishable from those of control mice.</p><p>We next examined the effect of miR-188-5p expression on synaptic LTP. Although repeated trains of theta-burst stimulation (4XTBS) induced synaptic potentiation at SC-CA1 synapses in all experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>), we could observe genotype-specific differences in magnitude and duration of potentiation. This observation is consistent with several previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. While control slices exhibited stable enhancement of synaptic transmission (147.02&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5.48% at 50&#8201;min after 4 X TBS), LTP in 5XFAD slices gradually decreased in magnitude toward baseline during the recording (121.5895&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.4389% at 50&#8201;min after 4 X TBS, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). Notably however, impaired LTP in 5XFAD mice almost completely recovered to a normal magnitude with miR-188-5p replenishment in CA1 neurons and no significant difference in LTP was detected between 5XFAD/miR-188-5p and wild-type mice (141.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.93% at 50&#8201;min after 4X TBS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). These results suggest that miR-188-5p replenishment rescues synaptic dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, and that dysregulation of an activity-regulated miR-188-5p might be associated with memory deficits in 5XFAD mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CREB regulates miR-188 expression</title><p>Here we set out to uncover the regulatory mechanism for miR-188 expression. We first tested whether LTP induction increases transcription levels of miR-188. We found that levels of miR-188 primary transcript (pri-miR-188) were significantly increased in rat hippocampal slices by chemical LTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), suggesting that miR-188 levels are likely up-regulated at the transcriptional level.</p><p>We then tried to identify transcription factors critical for LTP-mediated upregulation of miR-188-5p. To this end, we determined the genomic locations of <italic>MIR188</italic> gene in the rat genome via the UCSC genome browser, and found that <italic>MIR188</italic> gene is located at approximately 50&#8201;kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the <italic>Clcn5</italic> gene on the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that there was an expressed sequence tag (EST) containing <italic>MIR188</italic> gene (CB694421), suggesting that CB694421 might serve as pri-miR-188. Given this finding, we performed analysis on transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of CB694421 using TRANSFAC. We found one CREB binding site within 2&#8201;kb upstream from the 5&#8242; end of CB694421. Because the role of CREB in synaptic plasticity has been well established, we tested whether CREB is involved in the regulation of miR-188 expression. Knockdown of <italic>Creb</italic> using small interfering CREB RNA (si-CREB) indeed resulted in significant down-regulation of mature miR-188-5p levels in rat primary hippocampal neurons (56.63&#8201;&#177;&#8201;20.22%, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>), suggesting that CREB can regulate miR-188-5p expression. We also performed miR-188 promoter luciferase activity assay using rat primary hippocampal neuron cultures. The miR-188 promoter activity was suppressed by CREB knockdown (37.03&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10.66%, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>) compared to control siRNAs. Taken together, these data suggest that LTP induction increases miR-188 levels potentially through CREB activation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of miR-188-5p to AD, which is reduced in the disease. A&#946; diminished the expression of miR-188-5p in rat primary hippocampal neurons. The addition of miR-188-5p rescued the oligomeric A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>-mediated reduction in dendritic spine density in primary hippocampal neurons and neurons from 5XFAD mice. In addition, the decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs induced by oligomeric A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> was restored by the addition of miR-188-5p in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we have shown that the impairments in cognition and fEPSPs observed in 7-month-old 5XFAD mice were ameliorated via the viral-mediated expression of miR-188-5p in the hippocampus.</p><p>LTP is believed to be a synaptic mechanism underlying the storage of long-term memories in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Therefore, enhancement of LTP by miR-188-5p expression explains the improved behavioral outcomes in 5XFAD mice. In line with this idea, decrease of miR-188-5p might be one of the possible mechanisms for the cognitive deficits in AD patients and 5XFAD mice. In addition, exogenous expression of miR-188-5p increased synaptic strength in 5XFAD mice. Considering the role of miR-188-5p in the regulation of dendritic spine density, this effect might have originated from restored spine density in 5XFAD neurons by miR-188-5p overexpression. Although molecular mechanisms underlying spine formation and synaptogenesis are relatively uncharacterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, our results suggest that miR-188-5p increases dendritic spine density through the downregulation of Nrp-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>Recently it has been reported that miR-188-3p targets &#946; site cleavage enzyme (BACE1) and miR-188-3p expression was significantly down-regulated both in the brains of AD humans and 5XFAD mice and that miR-188 expression is regulated by 2-arachidonoyl glycerol or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#947; (PPAR&#947;) agonists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

Chemical induction of LTP increased levels of pri-miR-188 in rat hippocampal slices (204.59&#8201;&#177;&#8201;38.87%, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.034; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p>A given microRNA may have multiple (up to several hundred) predicted gene targets, and ~60% of mRNAs have predicted binding sites for several microRNAs in their 3&#8242;UTRs.
