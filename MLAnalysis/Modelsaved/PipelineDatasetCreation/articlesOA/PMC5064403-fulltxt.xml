Calcimimetics, activators of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), provide an effective means of reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in sHPT. Polymorphism in CaSR gene (<italic>CASR</italic>) influences Ca-related parameters, however it was not shown in HD patients for <italic>CASR</italic> rs7652589. The minor allele at this polymorphism modifies the binding sites of transcription factors and CaSR expression. We hypothesized that <italic>CASR</italic> rs7652589 variants may also influence CaSR in end stage renal disease (ESRD). We aimed to determine the associations of rs7652589 with nephrolithiasis-related ESRD, Ca, P, ALP, PTH, response to treatment with cinacalcet, prevalence of coronary artery disease, and all-cause/cardiovascular mortality in HD patients (n&#8201;=&#8201;1162). Healthy individuals (n&#8201;=&#8201;918) were controls. This study shows that the A allele of rs7652589 is a risk allele for nephrolithiasis-related ESRD. The AA genotype is associated with more severe sHPT (higher Ca and PTH concentrations). The A allele is <bold>as</bold>sociated with reduced CaSR transcript level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. According to computational analysis, potential binding sites for GLI3, AHR and TP53 are removed by the A allele, whereas binding sites for SOX18 and TP63 are created.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Calcium (Ca) stones contribute to nephrolithiasis-related end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 26.7% of cases.

If possible influences of Ca-containing drugs were at least partially eliminated from the analysis, the AA genotype appeared significant independent determinant of higher Ca levels.

Hypercalcemic sHPT usually indicates tertiary HPT. HD patients bearing the <italic>CASR</italic> rs7652589 AA genotype seem to be more prone to this severe form of sHPT.

We have shown that potential binding sites for GLI3, AHR and TP53 are removed by the A allele, whereas binding sites for SOX18 and TP63 are added. We performed an analysis of the PO2F1 motif, of which Oct-1 is a member. In contrast to Vezzoli <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, our analysis does not support appearance of Oct-1 in presence of the A allele. This finding likely stems from the software differences between studies, as we find, that p-value alone of the PO2F1 motif is statistically highly significant. However applied in our work, false discovery rate filter marked PO2F1 motif above cut-off criteria. Therefore, our study suggests that Oct-1 may not be a down-regulator of CaSR expression in the A allele harbouring subjects as it was postulated by Vezzoli <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

Ca-containing drugs were administered the most commonly, serving as phosphate binders and Ca supplements. These drugs were usually started still prior to HD therapy, and their discontinuation was not possible due to ethical reasons. However, evaluations of patient compliance reveal poor adherence with drugs prescriptions in HD subjects: half were noncompliant with medication taking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.

The patient group included 1162 individuals. Nephrolithiasis-related ESRD was diagnosed if calculus formation caused obstructive nephropathy and/or chronic infective tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Patients who showed serum PTH of 1000&#8201;pg/ml or greater before the planned treatment with cinacalcet underwent 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy. Only those without scintigraphic suspicion of parathyroid gland adenoma qualified for this treatment. Serum PTH was checked in the treated group every 4 weeks, and cinacalcet doses were increased up to 180&#8201;mg per day, if well tolerated, until the PTH concentration decreased at least by 40% of the initial level, which was considered as a satisfactory response to treatment. Patients who did not exhibit sufficiently decreased serum PTH were referred to as non-responders to cinacalcet.</p><p>The principal dietary and pharmacological treatment of all patients was based on a standard of care according to the physician. Guidelines for this treatment based on recommendations of the Polish Society of Nephrology and the principal country consultants in nephrology.
