A recent study reported that OCT4A, which is crucial for establishment and maintenance of pluripotent cells, is expressed in oocytes, but maternal OCT4A is dispensable for totipotency induction. Whereas another study reported that OCT4B, which is not related to pluripotency, is predominantly expressed instead of OCT4A during early preimplantation phases in mice. To determine the expression states of OCT4 in murine preimplantation embryos, we conducted in-depth expression and functional analyses. We found that pluripotency-related OCT4 mainly localizes to the cytoplasm in early preimplantation phases, with no major nuclear localization until the 8&#8211;16-cell stage despite high expression in both oocytes and early embryos. RNA-sequencing analysis using oocytes and early preimplantation embryos could not identify the splice variants creating alternative forms of OCT4 protein. Forced expression of OCT4 in zygotes by the injection of polyadenylated mRNA clearly showed nuclear localization of OCT4 protein around 3&#8211;5-fold greater than physiological levels and impaired developmental competency in a dose-dependent manner. Embryos with modest overexpression of OCT4 could develop to the 16-cell stage; however, more than 50% of the embryos were arrested at this stage, similar to the results for OCT4 depletion. In contrast, extensive overexpression of OCT4 resulted in complete arrest at the 2-cell stage accompanied by downregulation of zygotically activated genes and repetitive elements related to the totipotent state. These results demonstrated that OCT4 protein localization was spatiotemporally altered during preimplantation development, and strict control of Oct4 protein levels was essential for proper totipotential reprogramming.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular reprogramming and differentiation are accompanied by dynamic transcriptional changes and transcription factors play central roles in both processes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Buganim <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Dramatic alterations of cellular fates occur during preimplantation embryo development (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burton &amp; Torres-Padilla 2014</xref>). In mice, after fertilization, most maternal factors are degraded and zygotic gene activation (ZGA) occurs by the 2-cell stage (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hamatani <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). An important transcription factor responsible for sustaining pluripotency is the POU5F1 protein (also known as OCT4) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nichols <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). In zebrafish, Oct4 is crucial for driving ZGA (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Leichsenring <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In mammals, although <italic>Oct4</italic> expression defines pluripotent stem cell fates dose-dependently (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Niwa <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>), maternal <italic>Oct4</italic> was shown to be dispensable for <italic>in vivo</italic> totipotential reprogramming during the preimplantation phase (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). However, Marti and coworkers showed that <italic>Oct4</italic> has two isoforms and <italic>Oct4B</italic>, which is not associated with pluripotency, was found to be predominantly expressed, whereas <italic>Oct4A</italic> was not expressed during early preimplantation phases of mice (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Marti <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).</p><p>The presence of <italic>OCT4B</italic> transcripts was reported in some human cell lines (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Atlasi <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In mice, <italic>Oct4B</italic> transcript was found in embryonic stem cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). The differing regions in the two Oct4 isoforms were the first exon in both mice and humans (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Atlasi <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). However, the Oct4 variants have not been identified in preimplantation phases in mice. These studies led us to question whether pluripotency-related <italic>Oct4</italic> is substantially expressed in murine early preimplantation embryos. In this study, we conducted deep expression analysis and dose-dependent functional analyses of Oct4 in the preimplantation stages in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Oocyte collection and embryo manipulation</title><p>All mice were maintained and used in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science and the National Research Institute for Child Health and Development of Japan (A2006-009-bib9).

Notably, at oocyte to 4-cell stages, the OCT4A staining patterns using the C10 antibody (Oct4-C10) did not show the nuclear localization typically seen in pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). At the 8-cell stage, Oct4 nuclear localization became partially apparent (88% embryos) and all examined morulae and blastocysts showed robust Oct4-C10 expression with nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Next, to quantify the nuclear protein levels of OCT4, the same laser intensity was applied to each sample (adjusted to the morula stage). The signals of oocytes, 1-, 2-, and 4-cell embryos decreased (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>), indicating that the OCT4 nuclear expression was high at the late stage of preimplantation; however, the mRNA levels in the morula stage were significantly lower than those of early preimplantation cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

</p><p>We also examined OCT4B expression states using a specific antibody (Oct4-N20). In contrast to Oct4-C10 results, we observed nuclear localized Oct4-N20 signals in 68% GV oocytes and 70% 1-cell embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3</ext-link>). However, we did not observe robust nuclear Oct4-N20 staining from 2-cells onward in most embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3</ext-link> and not shown), nor was observed with another Oct4-N20 antibody with a different lot number (not shown). We sought the splice variants of <italic>Oct4</italic> using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) data of germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). However, we did not identify the clear splice variants coding for <italic>Oct4B</italic> identified in human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Atlasi <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>). Considering the RNA-seq results, Oct4-N20 might therefore identify a nonspecific protein in mice. Although these results were inconsistent with a previous report (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Marti <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), Marti and coworkers did not presented the number of embryos in the analysis using Oct4-N20 antibody, and we could not directly compare our results with their findings.</p><p>To confirm the protein expression states of OCT4 by a different approach, we conducted Western blotting (WB) analysis using Oct4-C10 (hereafter, we refer to OCT4A as OCT4). Notably, OCT4 protein was detected in MII oocytes and 2-cell embryos as well as morulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>), rejecting the possibility that <italic>Oct4</italic> mRNA was not translated until the morula stage. Next, to examine absolute expression levels, we prepared 100 cells from oocyte to morula stages respectively (i.e., 100 oocytes, 100 zygotes, 50 2-cell embryos, 25 4-cell embryos and 7&#8211;10 morulae), and performed SDS-WB analysis. This showed that OCT4 protein levels from oocytes to 4-cells were markedly higher than in morulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>), indicating that the protein level per cell was not dramatically increased in morulae exhibiting nuclear localization of the protein by IF.</p><p>The possibility for the inconsistent results of IF and SDS-WB might be different protein localization. Generally, Oct4 is localized in the nuclei in pluripotent cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Marti <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yasuhara <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). We examined whether the protein detected by SDS-WB analysis in early preimplantation embryos was derived from the nucleus or cytoplasm. The nuclei of 1- and 2-cell embryos were removed to separate the nuclei and cytoplasm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 5</ext-link>). SDS-WB analysis revealed that the majority of the Oct4 protein was localized in the cytoplasm in both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that in oocytes and early preimplantation embryos, OCT4 protein mainly localized to the cytoplasm but localized specifically to the nucleus at the late preimplantation stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Exogenous OCT4 expression in zygotes shows nuclear localization</title><p>To gain further insight into OCT4 protein expression states, we constructed Oct4 overexpressing embryos (Oct4-OE) by polyadenylated mRNA injection of various concentrations (50, 100 and 200&#8201;ng/&#956;L). For an injection control, to allow for the toxicity of injected mRNA, we prepared 130&#8201;ng/&#956;L <italic>Egfp</italic> mRNA that corresponded to 200&#8201;ng/&#956;L <italic>Oct4</italic> mRNA molecules. Injection was performed 1.5&#8211;2.5&#8201;h after insemination to adjust fertilization and injection timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p>We first examined whether exogenous OCT4 protein could localize to nuclei at the zygote stage by IF analysis. Zygote nuclei exhibited dose-dependent IF signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe marked cytoplasmic expression even when high-intensity laser excitation was applied to Oct4-OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, SDS-WB analysis using Oct4-OE (100&#8201;ng/&#956;L) zygotes revealed high expression of exogenous Oct4 protein in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that the C-10 antibody could not identify cytoplasmic OCT4 protein in the IF assay.</p><p>Next, we quantified the total levels of OCT4 nuclear protein. We first applied SDS-WB using the nuclear fraction of Oct4-OE at the 2-cell stage and ES cells with RNAPII as the nuclear internal control. However, we found that RNAPII expression states differed between 2-cell embryos and ES cells: RNAPII of ES cells was robustly detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (not shown), consistent with a recent report using DT40 cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hsin <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Therefore, we performed quantitative analysis using IF data with the C-10 antibody and compared the observed levels of Oc4-OE with those of blastocysts, which are pluripotent cells. Comparison with blastocyst nuclei showed that the total nuclear levels of OCT4 protein in Oct4-OE (50&#8201;ng/&#956;L) and (100&#8201;ng/&#956;L) were more than 3.5- and 5.3-fold increased respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results revealed that the levels of exogenously expressed OCT4 nuclear protein were higher than those under physiological conditions.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that OCT4 protein localization was spatiotemporally altered between the early and late preimplantation phases. Given that exogenous OCT4 protein could be present in the nucleus, the conformation of OCT4 protein under physiological conditions at early preimplantation phases might differ from that in late preimplantation embryos or pluripotent cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Exogenous Oct4 expression impairs developmental competency in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>Because <italic>Oct4</italic> regulates cell fates in a dose-dependent manner in mammals (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Niwa <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>), we wondered whether the lack of nuclear OCT4 protein in early preimplantation phases had biological meaning during reprogramming into totipotency. To gain insight into the effect of exogenous expression of Oct4 on development, we cultured Oct4-OE. Within 24&#8201;h after insemination, over 95% Oct4-OE and controls had developed to the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The developmental rate to the blastocyst stage in the control group was 77% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). However, at 48&#8201;h, &gt;95% Oct4-OE high concentration groups (100 and 200&#8201;ng/&#956;L) were arrested at the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). In addition, although over 80% low Oct4-OE group developed to the 4-cell stage, only 38% embryos developed to blastocyst stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). In contrast, Oct4 depletion by siRNA injection (Oct4KD) also caused developmental failure of &gt;60% of embryos after the morula stage, consistent with a previous study (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 6</ext-link>). Taken together, these results indicated that Oct4 overexpression with nuclear localization from the zygote stage negatively influenced developmental competency in a dose-dependent manner.

</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of transcriptome state on Oct4-overexpressing embryos</title><p>To determine the cause of developmental failures by Oct4-OE (50&#8201;ng/&#956;L: low), we conducted gene expression analysis. We first examined the gene expression states in the morula cells in Oct4-OE (low) and Oct4KD embryos. Because most of the transcription factors related with pluripotency commence transcription at the morula stage (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>), we carried out qPCR using 21 pluripotency- and 7 epigenetic modification- related genes. Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that the Oct4-OE (low) group was categorized with the control groups (si-RNA control and Egfp-OE), whereas Oct4KD was clearly divided (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</ext-link>). The lack of total <italic>Oct4</italic> mRNA and protein upregulation in Oct4-OE (low) suggested that external <italic>Oct4</italic> was degraded by the morula stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7B and C</ext-link>). The developmental failure of Oct4-OE (low) was not obviously caused by dysregulation of major transcription factors associated with pluripotency, whereas <italic>Cdx2</italic>, <italic>Tet2</italic> and <italic>Uhrf1</italic> were markedly repressed and <italic>Eomes</italic> was upregulated in Oct4KD embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</ext-link>). Thus, although the transcriptional states differed, both treatments led to similar embryo phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>), demonstrating that strict expression levels of <italic>Oct4</italic> are required for proper development <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our study showed that high levels of exogenous OCT4 expression caused complete 2-cell arrest, implying that ectopic expression of OCT4 might affect ZGA. To elucidate the cause of the 2-cell arrest in Oct4-OE, we examined transcriptional states at the 2-cell stages of Oct4-OE (100&#8201;ng/&#956;L: high) and controls using RNA-seq at 30&#8201;h after insemination. In Oct4-OE, 29.4% genes with &gt;5 FPKM were differentially expressed over two-fold. There were markedly more downregulated than upregulated genes in Oct4-OE (1718 (25.4%) vs 268 (4.0%) genes respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Although the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were randomly distributed among all chromosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 8</ext-link>), ribosome-related genes and <italic>Zscan4</italic> family genes (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zeng &amp; Schultz 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zalzman <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>), which were specifically expressed at the 2-cell stage, were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 9</ext-link>). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Oct4-OE downregulated genes were significantly enriched for ZGA-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, ectopic expression of <italic>Oct4</italic> caused the disruption of a 2-cell-specific transcriptional program including ZGA.

We found that the pericentromeric heterochromatin region (PHC), which normally showed intense DAPI staining, dramatically differed between Oct4-OE (high) and control. At the 2-cell stage, PHC of normal embryos forms a ring-like structure (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Puschendorf <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>), exhibited by most control embryos in this study by 30&#8201;h after insemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, in Oct4-OE, a dot pattern (chromocenter-like structure) rather than a ring-like formation developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). At the 2-cell stage, PHC is specified by H3K9me3 and Ring1b (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Puschendorf <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>); this modification pattern was also observed for Oct4-OE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">C</xref>).

Furthermore, exogenous <italic>Oct4</italic> expression impeded development in a dose-dependent manner. In murine ES cells, <italic>Oct4</italic> defines pluripotency in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Niwa <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). This study demonstrated that this principal is also true for cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. A high dose of Oct4-OE resulted in dysregulation of ZGA-related genes and of certain types of repetitive sequences at the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), suggesting that these were the major causes of developmental arrest, whereas a low dose of Oct4-OE and Oct4 KD embryos led to the developmental failure at the late preimplantation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). At the late preimplantation phases, numerous pluripotency-, epigenome-, and differentiation-related genes are activated (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hamatani <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Conversely, the dysregulation of DNA methylation-related factors and <italic>Eomes</italic>, associated with trophectoderm development (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Russ <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>), were observed in Oct4 KD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</ext-link>). Thus, we believe that these integral abnormalities of DNA methylation and proper lineage commitment might result in developmental arrest. However, we observed no marked changes in the expression of major transcription and epigenomic factors in Oct4-OE (low) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</ext-link>), suggesting that the reasons underlying developmental arrest differ and that the transcriptome analysis might help identify dysregulated genes in Oct4-OE (low). These results clearly indicated the importance of maintaining proper OCT4 expression levels for proper embryonic development. Moreover, it has been reported that ectopic expression of OCT4 <italic>in vivo</italic> causes dysplasia in epithelial tissues (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hochedlinger <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). Thus, the spatiotemporal regulation and fine-tuning of OCT4 protein is essential for cellular reprogramming and integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Our findings also suggested that the silencing of <italic>Oct4</italic> function caused by its absence in the nucleus during early preimplantation phases might be essential for totipotency acquisition in early preimplantation development.
<fig fig-type="figure" id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Model for the establishment of totipotency by OCT4 expression states. The nuclear presence of OCT4 and its level govern developmental competency.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rep-152-417-g008"/></fig>
</p><p>In this study, we found that exogenous expression of OCT4 resulted in marked changes in heterochromatin conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), indicating that Oct4 potentially regulates chromatin states. Consistent with this notion, OCT4 has been shown to play an important role in chromatin opening at the 8-cell stage (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Whether OCT4 directly mediated chromatin alteration remains unknown. However, recently, Nanog was shown to regulate heterochromatin organization by directly binding to pericentromeric regions in ES cells (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Novo <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). Thus, OCT4 might control chromatin states via direct binding at many promoter regions. Consistent with this notion, we observed changes in the expression of many OCT4-binding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the dynamic alteration of chromatin configuration in Oct4-OE (high) at the 2-cell stage was accompanied by the loss of the ring-like structure and resulted in a dot-like structure at pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The dot-like structure at constitutive heterochromatin is a feature of embryos at the 4-cell stage onward (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Puschendorf <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Moreover, given that the S phase of the cell cycle in Oct4-OE proceeded faster than that in the control at 30&#8201;h after insemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B&#8211;D</xref>), at which point a clear dot-like structure in Oct4-OE was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), cell cycle acceleration by Oct4-OE (high) would result in chromatin alteration.</p><p>One of the remaining questions is what mechanisms are involved in OCT4 protein localization? The Oct4-C10 antibody was frequently reported (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bedzhov &amp; Zernicka-Goetz 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>), and we also confirmed the specificity by SDS-WB using Oct4-KD and Oct4-OE embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 12</ext-link>). In oocytes, the splice variants were not identified by RNA-seq analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>). Using RNA-seq data in 2-cell embryos, we confirmed no splice variants created alternative form of OCT4 protein in the 2-cell embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 13</ext-link>). Therefore, the possibility that OCT4B was predominantly expressed in early preimplantation phases like humans was denied.</p><p>Another possibility is that OCT4 conformation might differ between early and late preimplantation phases. To test this, we conducted native-PAGE followed by WB analysis using embryos showing OCT4 negative staining by IF. However, OCT4 protein was detected in oocytes and 2-cell embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 14A</ext-link>), suggesting that there are other causes for its differential localization, e.g. differences in post-translational modification such as phosphorylation of OCT4, which was shown to affect protein localization (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Recently, the phosphorylation of nuclear localization signal has been important for shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm in RNF12/RLIM, essential for X chromosome inactivation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). To test the possibility, we conducted Phos-tag SDS-WB analysis using preimplantation embryos and the nuclei and cytoplasm of Oct4-OE. The results showed no clear difference in the band shift pattern among the preimplantation embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/content/full/REP-16-0277/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 14B</ext-link>). Thus, other post-translational modifications or nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins might regulate Oct4 protein localization in preimplantation embryos.</p><p>The time at which OCT4 cytoplasmic localization begins also remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that OCT4 nuclear localization caused a dynamic change in chromatin conformation. Interestingly, this dynamic chromatin remodeling was observed in germ line reprogramming phases (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Saitou <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), and <italic>Oct4</italic> has been used as a marker for primordial germ cells (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto &amp; Abe 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). However, these studies were based on <italic>Oct4</italic> transgenic mice, which have exogenous <italic>Oct4</italic> promoter sequences with a GFP marker (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimizu <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). Therefore, whether internal OCT4 protein localizes to the nucleus in primordial germ cells is unknown. A previous study using mice with <italic>Oct4</italic> knockout in primordial germ cells found that OCT4 deletion around embryonic day (E) 10.5 caused germ cell loss (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kehler <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), suggesting that OCT4 localizes to the nucleus until E10.5. Another IF-based study showed that OCT4 protein expression localized to the nucleus of germ cells at E12.5, although the antibody used in the study was not Oct4-C10. Nevertheless, considering that the antibody identified the nuclear OCT4 protein (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), it can be concluded that OCT4 protein localizes to the nucleus of germ cells until E12.5. Therefore, scrutinizing the expression states by IF during germ cell development will be informative and will provide new aspects of <italic>Oct4</italic>-mediated reprogramming machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p>This is linked to the online version of the paper at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-16-0277">http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-16-0277</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; a grant from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to H A and A U; a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (21390456); a grant from JST-CREST to H A; and a JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) to A F (26861350).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr Kikugawa (DNA Chip Research Inc.) and Y Takahashi (Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co, Ltd) for assistance with bioinformatic analysis and we offer our gratitude to all of the members of the Umezawa and Akutsu laboratories for their helpful comments.
