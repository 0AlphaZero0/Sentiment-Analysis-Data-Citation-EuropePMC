We identified more than 7000 unique differentially expressed transcripts that segregated into four major clusters with distinct temporal profiles and functional categories. Functional categories related to response to wounding, response to oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and angiogenesis were inferred from the early up-regulated genes, while functions related to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodelling, muscle development and myofibrillogenesis were inferred from genes up-regulated 30 days post-lesion, when new small myofibres were visible at the site of injury. Remarkably, a large set of genes previously reported to be up-regulated in hyperplastic muscle growth areas was also found to be overexpressed at 30 days post-lesion, indicating that many features of the transcriptional program underlying muscle hyperplasia are reactivated when new myofibres are transiently produced during fish muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study demonstrate a coordinated expression of functionally related genes during muscle regeneration in fish.

Muscle fibre hyperplasia in fish occurs in two successive phases. In the first phase, which generally occurs during the larval period, new fibres are formed in a discrete, continuous layer at the surface of the primary myotome. This first phase is called stratified hyperplasia. In the second phase of hyperplasia, new fibres are formed throughout the entire myotome, producing the typical mosaic appearance observed in a muscle cross section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mosaic hyperplasia which is powered by resident quiescent satellite cells scattered throughout the myotome on the surface of the myofibres, eventually stops when approximately 50&#160;% of the maximum body length is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, using a <italic>myog:GFP</italic> transgenic line, we recently showed that small-diameter fluorescent myofibres can be produced <italic>de novo</italic> in wounded post-hyperplastic muscles of aged trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This neomyogenesis, which evokes muscle regeneration following injury in adult mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], indicates that the myotome of aged trout still contains myogenic cells that can be reactivated <italic>de novo</italic> when the microenvironment is permissive, such as after damages. The regeneration of muscle in adult fish has been rarely described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and very little is known regarding the transcriptional networks that are activated during fish regenerative myogenesis in fish. Moreover, the relationships between molecular programs that control regenerative myogenesis and muscle hyperplasia have yet to be defined. In this study, we used Agilent-based microarray platform to conduct a time-course analysis of transcript expression in the regenerating muscle of aged trout. We also compared the gene transcription profiles of regenerating muscle with the molecular signatures associated with muscle hyperplasia which we previously defined using laser capture microdissection combined with the same Agilent-based microarray platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p>To analyse changes in gene expression profiles during muscle regeneration, we carried out, in 29 month-old trout, a time-course analysis of the transcript expression in muscle pieces excised one centimeter beneath the dorsal fin, before injury (time 0) and at the site of injury 1, 8, 16 and 30 days after lesions were made. In our experiments, we wounded the myotomal muscle in aged trout, as aged trout no longer spontaneously produce the new small myofibres that are produced by juveniles, as shown in the <italic>myog</italic>:GFP transgenic line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At each time point, four (time 0) or five (1, 8, 16, and 30 days post lesion) distinct individuals were sampled for histological analysis and gene expression profiling. At day 1 after injury, transverse sections at the sites of lesion showed severe loss of muscle tissue. Extensive muscle damage with necrotic myofibres and inflammatory cells were visible from day 8 to day 16. At day 30 post injury, the damaged muscle regenerated new small myofibres (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Haematoxylin and eosin histological stains of control (<bold>a</bold>) degenerated (<bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>) and regenerating (<bold>d</bold>) trout muscle.

We observed that most of these genes were up-regulated in regenerating muscle sampled 30 days post-injury (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), a stage which is concomitant with the formation of new myofibres (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

Among the genes encoding immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface proteins that were up-regulated in both hyperplastic area and regenerating muscle, we found the promyogenic cell surface receptors <italic>ncam1</italic>(<italic>cd56</italic>), <italic>m-cadherin</italic> (<italic>cadherin 15</italic>) and <italic>n-cadherin</italic> (<italic>cadherin 2</italic>), as well as <italic>Kin of Irre3</italic> and <italic>jam2b</italic>, which are both critical for myocyte fusion in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

The local environmental factors up-regulated in hyperplastic area and during muscle regeneration included <italic>follistatin a</italic> and <italic>wfikkn2</italic>, which both inhibit myostatin activity, as well as <italic>secreted frizzled-related protein 2</italic>, the notch ligands <italic>deltad</italic> (<italic>dld</italic>) and <italic>delta-like protein a</italic> (<italic>dla</italic>), <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor</italic> and <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor 2</italic>, <italic>interleukin 18, neurotrophin 4, fibroblast growth factor 10, stromal cell-derived factor-2-like protein 1, galectin-3, anterior gradient protein 2</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). In addition, as the same Agilent-based microarray platform was used for the gene expression profiling of both regenerating muscle and hyperplastic growth zones, we reliably calculated that nearly 80&#160;% (26/33) of distinct myofibrillar protein encoding genes (e.g. troponins, myosin chains, myosin binding proteins, tropomyosins, alpha actins) up-regulated in injured-muscle compared to non-injured muscle were also overexpressed in hyperplastic growth zones. In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> is shown the expression, during muscle regeneration, of myofibrillar protein encoding genes up-regulated in both hyperplastic area and regenerating muscle. Taken together, all these data indicate that a large subset of the genes highly expressed in hyperplastic growth zones and predicted to be important for myotube formation was reactivated during regenerative myogenesis, this was especially the case at 30 days post-lesion, when new myofibres formed at the site of the lesion.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Supervised clustering of some hyperplasia-correlated genes (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) during degeneration/regeneration of trout muscle. <bold>a</bold> transcriptional regulators, <bold>b</bold> epigenetic transcriptional regulators, <bold>c</bold> immunoglobulin domain-containing membrane receptors, <bold>d</bold> secreted factors and <bold>e</bold> myofibrillar proteins.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Validation of the microarray gene expression data</title><p>In order to confirm the significance of differential mRNA expression pattern observed in the microarray data, Real time PCR analysis was performed on selected genes (MyoD1a, myogenin and cadherin 15 (M-cadherin)) that exhibited distinct temporal profile during muscle regeneration. For the three genes tested, the temporal expression patterns revealed by microarray and real time PCR data were very similar (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we explored the temporal changes in gene expression during trout muscle regeneration following mechanical wounding. Muscle regeneration has been rarely described in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and virtually nothing is known regarding the genetic pathways that regulate regenerative myogenesis in this taxon. A striking feature of muscle regeneration is that muscle neofibres have not been observed in trout even 16 days post-lesion, whereas in mice, the damaged muscle is largely repaired by the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is likely because the injured trout were maintained at a low temperature of approximately 7&#176;C throughout the experimental period. As a result of the slowness of muscle repair in trout, regenerating myofibres were observed only in muscle sampled 30 days post-lesion. In line with this, functional categories related to myogenesis and myofibrillogenesis were found in the two clusters that contained genes that were up-regulated at 30 days during the regeneration process. The first cluster (cluster I) consisted of genes that first decreased in expression early after injury, reflecting the loss of muscle tissue caused by muscle crushes, and then increased at 30 days post-injury. This first cluster with a myogenic signature included genes encoding <italic>mef2a</italic> and <italic>mef2c</italic> which play essential roles in muscle differentiation during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and during muscle regeneration, as shown by the impairment of regenerative myogenesis in mouse resulting from the combined deletion of the <italic>mef2</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, NFIX, which was also found in cluster I, has recently been shown to be required for the proper timing of muscle regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The second cluster (cluster IV) with a myogenic signature included genes for which the expression levels peaked only at 30 days post injury and largely exceeded their expression levels found in non-injured muscle. This cluster was highly enriched with genes involved in mitotic cell cycle, blood vessel development and extracellular matrix organization. The activation of myogenic and angiogenic programs has also been reported during exercise-induced contractile activity that leads to increased muscle mass in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, genes that mediate immunity-related inflammatory processes and responses to wounding, which were concentrated in cluster III, are not activated in zebrafish hypertrophying muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The specific inflammatory signature found in regenerating muscle is consistent with the extensive necrosis and the immune response that follow injury in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, macrophages which are present throughout the entire regeneration process, not only have a role in the phagocytosis of damaged myofibres, but also exert effects on myogenic precursor cell proliferation (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]).</p><p>Remarkably, a large part of the genes that were up-regulated in the hyperplastic growth zones of the late embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] were also strongly overexpressed in regenerating muscle sampled at 30 days post-injury, a stage at which new small myofibres were apparent. The finding of a large set of conserved genes in two forms of myogenesis suggests that this set is important for regulating post- embryonic myotube production. Among the genes that were up-regulated in both conditions were the canonical myogenic regulators (<italic>myod</italic>, <italic>myf5</italic>, <italic>myogenin</italic> and <italic>mrf4</italic>) which are indicative of satellite cell activity. In line with the overexpression of mrfs during trout muscle regeneration, it has been reported that <italic>myf5</italic> and <italic>myod</italic> are up-regulated in the regenerating muscle of zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Beside the canonical myogenic regulators, several transcriptional regulators with poorly documented functions in myogenesis were found; for example, we noted the up-regulation of genes encoding Sox proteins, myc paralogues and many homeodomain-containing transcriptional factors. Moreover, chromatin remodeling proteins including arginine N-methyltransferases (PRTMs) such as Prtm5, and SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling enzymes such as Brg1/Smarca4, were up-regulated in the two forms of myogenesis. Prtm5 has a major role in controlling MRF expression and myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while Smarca4/Brg1 has been shown to maintain myogenic gene expression during skeletal myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Notable, the proteins belonging to the Polycomb groups, which have been found to be highly expressed in hyperplastic growth zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], were not up-regulated during muscle regeneration. Taken together, our data suggest common and distinct epigenetic processes during muscle fibre hyperplasia and adult muscle regeneration. Many genes encoding Ig-domain-containing transmembrane proteins were also up-regulated in hyperplastic growth zones and regenerating muscle. Among these, we identified <italic>Jam</italic> receptor and <italic>kin of Irre 3</italic>, which are critical for cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and many promyogenic cell surface receptors, such as M- and N- cadherin and NCAM, which influence cell-cell interactions during myoblast differentiation and fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, c-met was also up-regulated in the two forms of myogenesis. The proto-oncogene c-met, a tyrosine kinase receptor activated by hepatocyte growth factor, is involved in myoblast motility and myocyte fusion during adult skeletal muscle regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Among autocrine and/or paracrine factors up-regulated in hyperplastic areas and in regenerating muscle were found several regulators of the TGF&#946;/BMP signaling pathway such as <italic>wfikkn2, follistatin</italic> A and <italic>gremlin-1</italic>. Wfikkn2 and follistatin A both sequester myostatin, while Gremlin-1 exerts antagonistic interaction with BMP2 and BMP4. Also the common transcriptional signature included the secreted ligands <italic>deltaD</italic> and <italic>delta-like protein A</italic> that both regulate the Notch signaling on which depend satellite cell activation and adult muscle regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Sharp up-regulation of <italic>sfrp2</italic> (<italic>secreted Frizzled-related protein 2</italic>) was also observed in hyperplastic growth zones and during regenerative myogenesis, suggesting an active inhibition of the Wnt pathway in both situations. Although the functional significance of SFRP2 activity on myogenesis remains to be established, it is interesting to note that the up-regulation of this gene has also been reported in regenerating muscle in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor</italic> and <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2</italic> were also up-regulated in the hyperplastic growth zones and during regenerative myogenesis. <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor</italic> is a unique nuclear/growth factor that is involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration of various cell types and has been shown to be induced in the regenerating liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finally, it is interesting to note that almost all myofibrillar protein encoding genes up-regulated in injured compared to non-injured muscle, were also found in the molecular signature of the hyperplastic growth zones. This further confirms the view that a large part of the transcriptional programs underlying muscle hyperplasia is reactivated in aged trout when new myofibres are transiently produced after muscle injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we used an Agilent-based microarray platform to carry out a time-course analysis of transcript expression during muscle regeneration in aged trout that no longer exhibit muscle hyperplasia. We identified more than 7000 unique differentially expressed transcripts that segregated into four major clusters with distinct temporal profiles and functional categories. We found that a large subset of these genes were also up-regulated in hyperplastic muscle growth zones. Notably, those genes potentially involved in differentiation and fusion of myogenic cells. The finding of a large set of conserved genes in two forms of myogenesis provides a valuable resource for further analysis of novel genes that are potentially involved in vertebrate muscle regeneration and myogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>Fish used in this study were reared and handled in strict accordance with French and European policies and guidelines of the INRA PEIMA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (B29-777-02), which specifically approved this study.
