Prostate tumor overexpressed-1 (PTOV1), first identified in prostate cancer, is a key factor in tumor progression and correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes. HPV infection status was tested by HPV E6-targeted multiplex real-time PCR and p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses were used to examine the mRNA and protein expression levels of PTOV1 in eight paired LSCC samples. IHC was performed to assess PTOV1 protein expression in 196 paraffin-embedded, archived LSCC samples. PTOV1 protein and mRNA expression was increased in LSCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissue samples. High expression of PTOV1was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage by the X<sup>2</sup> test. Multivariate analysis revealed that PTOV1 and HPV status were independent prognostic indicators of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009 for OS, <italic>P</italic> = 0.005, <italic>P</italic> = 0.012 for PFS, respectively). Our study provides the first evidence that the combination of PTOV1 expression level and HPV status provides more prognostic information compared with HPV status alone with the significance still exists in the HPV negative subgroup.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prostate tumor overexpressed-1</kwd><kwd>laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd><kwd>HPV</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck represents more than 90% of all head and neck cancers, and ranks as the sixth most common cancer worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With an annual estimated 159,000 new cases and 90,000 related deaths, laryngeal carcinoma is largest contributor to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human papillomavirus (HPV), especially type 16, is emerging as an important factor in developed countries, and HPV-induced HNSCC has distinct epidemiology and biology, especially a more favorable prognosis, compared with the HPV negative HNSCC [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In clinical practice, treatment decision-making in LSCC is mostly based on the TNM staging system in the absence of a universal prognostic staging system to predict clinical outcomes for patients [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in addition to the traditional clinical staging system and pathological standards, novel loss of function alterations of the alterations of the EGFR mutation, overexpression gene P53 and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2 also found in laryngeal tumors and have prognostic value for clinical outcome [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, none of these biomarkers has considered the HPV status, which is also an important determinant of survival outcome.</p><p>The prostate tumor overexpressed-1 (PTOV1) gene has 12 exons and is located on a region of chromosome 19 (19q13) that is amplified in HNSCC [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>PTOV1</italic> was first identified in prostate cancer during a differentially screening for genes expression [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, PTOV1 is involved in the development and progression of human malignancies, such as lung, endometrium, bladder, kidney and ovary cancer [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, little is known about the expression and clinical significance of PTOV1 in LSCC.</p><p>Ectopic expression of PTOV1 promoted entry into the S phase of the cell division cycle to promote mitotic activity [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. High levels of PTOV1 in prostatic tumors correlate with the Ki67 proliferative index, indicating that increased PTOV1 expression is functionally related to the cells' proliferative status [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Marques <italic>et al</italic>. reported that PTOV1 enhanced the expression of c-Jun protein at the post-transcriptional level, and is required for cell invasiveness and motility [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

PTOV1 protein and mRNA levels were elevated in human LSCC, with a positive PTOV1 staining rate of 94.5% in the archived LSCC biopsies. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high PTOV1 expression is an independent predictor of poor OS and PFS. It strongly supported the hypothesis that this protein is involved in the progression of LSCC and may represent a biomarker for the identification of subsets of LSCC patients with a more aggressive form of the disease. Additionally, our data provided evidence that using the combination of PTOV1 and HPV status improves the prediction reliability of outcome, with the best outcome being observed in the HPV-positive/PTOV-negative subgroup, and the worst in the HPV-negative/PTOV-positive subgroup, which might warrant more aggressive treatment.</p><p>Ectopic expression of PTOV1 was first identified in prostate cancer [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Aberrant PTOV1 expression increased the number of cells that entered into the S phase of the cell cycle and increased tumor cell proliferation capacity; thus contributing to their biological behavior [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PTOV1 is a mitogenic protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm to assist the translocation of the lipid-raft associated protein Flotillin-1 to the nucleus and the activation of mitogenic activity [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. High levels of PTOV1 in prostatic tumors also correlated significantly with the Ki-67 proliferative index and its nuclear localization, suggesting a functional relationship between PTOV1 overexpression, proliferative status and nuclear localization [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subsequently, the role of PTOV-1 overexpression in the proliferative status of tumor cells has been implicated in other neoplasms, such as breast, ovary and bladder cancers [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, overexpression of PTOV1 in primary and metastatic tumors significantly increases the translation of active c-Jun and its nuclear localization [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. C-jun is a major transcriptional factors of the AP-1 complex and regulate a variety of cellular fates, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The role of AP1 complexes in promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis is well established [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. C-Jun is a transcription factor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is essential in a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cancer stem cells biology and tumor initiation and propagation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, we assumed that PTOV1 is a positive regulator of LSCC tumor cell proliferation and progression that acts <italic>via</italic> the transcription factor c-Jun and its downstream genes. However, the exact mechanism needs further investigation.</p><p>LSCC is predominantly found in men, with a male to female ratio of approximately 6:1 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This gender discrepancy may be ascribed to the enhanced activity and elevation of the androgen receptor (AR) in men, which promotes the growth of LSCC[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PTOV1 has been mapped to 19q13, which harbors a large number of genes whose expression are stimulated by androgens, and PTOV1 itself is activated by exposure to androgens [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consistent with the AR-related theory above, our study revealed that males tend to be with the characteristics of high PTOV1-expressing, and might need more aggressive treatment strategy than females with the equivalent TNM stage.</p><p>In many other malignancies, multiple molecular markers, such as CD44, mircroRNAs expression are being used increasingly to predict prognosis and guide treatment [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. HPV-positive head and neck cancers have better prognosis than HPV-negative ones, especially given the general trend of earlier diagnoses of the more symptomatic laryngeal cancers [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the frequency of HPV detection in laryngeal lesions varies between 8% and 60%, leaving some uncertainty whether HPV-related laryngeal cancers represent a clinical subset unique from carcinomas with non-viral origins [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The early identification of PTOV1 expression in laryngeal lesions could also be a clinically independent biomarker to predict disease progression and survival. Our study has combined the PTOV1 and HPV status to evaluate the prognostic significance in LSCC. Our data provide evidence that using PTOV1 in conjunction with HPV improves the prediction of outcome in LSCC, especially for patients with HPV-negative/PTOV1-positive tumors, which might warrant more aggressive treatment. The significance of HPV-negative/PTOV-positive or HPV-positive/PTOV-negative was not observed, which may relate to tobacco or alcohol use of HPV-positive patients and the small sample size of the patients [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be studied.</p><p>In conclusion, high PTOV1 expression was associated with advanced clinical stage and might stimulate LSCC development and progression. Additionally, we demonstrated that a combination of HPV and PTOV1 status provides more prognostic information for LSCC than HPV alone. Thus, PTOV1 might represent a useful molecular biomarker of poor prognosis in LSCC. Clinical diagnosis combined with the usage of these biomarkers may improve stratified prognosis estimation and help to identify high-risk LSCC patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment. However, while this study offers some preliminary data on a role for PTOV-1 in laryngeal carcinoma, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PTOV-1 in LSCC development and progression require further investigation. The main limitation of the manuscript is the lack of the cell-functional experiment to further demonstrate the mechanism of the association of the high-expression of the PTOV1 and the poor prognosis in LSCC</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients and tissue specimens</title><p>This study was conducted on a total of 196 paraffin-embedded LSCC samples that were histologically and clinically diagnosed at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2000 and 2009.
