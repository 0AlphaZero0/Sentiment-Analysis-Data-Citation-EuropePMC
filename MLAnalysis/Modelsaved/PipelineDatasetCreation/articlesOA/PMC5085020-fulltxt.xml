International guidelines recommend a target range of international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.0&#8211;3.0 for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). We analysed the time in this therapeutic range (TTR) of VKA-treated patients with newly diagnosed AF in the ongoing, global, observational registry GARFIELD-AF. Taking TTR as a measure of the quality of patient management, we analysed its relationship with 1-year outcomes, including stroke/systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding, and all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Results</title><p>TTR was calculated for 9934 patients using 136,082 INR measurements during 1-year follow-up. The mean TTR was 55.0%; values were similar for different VKAs. 5851 (58.9%) patients had TTR&lt;65%; 4083 (41.1%) TTR&#8805;65%. The proportion of patients with TTR&#8805;65% varied from 16.7% in Asia to 49.4% in Europe. There was a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of stroke/SE, 1.5-fold increase in the risk of major bleeding, and 2.4-fold increase in the risk of all-cause mortality with TTR&lt;65% versus &#8805;65% after adjusting for potential confounders. The population attributable fraction, i.e. the proportion of events attributable to suboptimal anticoagulation among VKA users, was 47.7% for stroke/SE, 16.7% for major bleeding, and 45.4% for all-cause mortality. In patients with TTR&lt;65%, the risk of first stroke/SE was highest in the first 4 months and decreased thereafter (test for trend, p = 0.021). In these patients, the risk of first major bleed declined during follow-up (p = 0.005), whereas in patients with TTR&#8805;65%, the risk increased over time (p = 0.027).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A large proportion of patients with AF had poor VKA control and these patients had higher risks of stroke/SE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Our data suggest that there is room for improvement of VKA control in routine clinical practice and that this could substantially reduce adverse outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01090362">NCT01090362</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Bayer Pharma AG</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kakkar</surname><given-names>Ajay K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an educational research grant from Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pharma.bayer.com">http://pharma.bayer.com</ext-link>) to the Thrombosis Research Institute, London, UK (AKK), which sponsors the GARFIELD-AF registry.

Despite the beneficial benefit/risk ratio of NOACs, VKAs have remained a frequently used therapy in clinical routine. The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD&#8211;Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) is an observational study of patients newly diagnosed with non-valvular AF evaluating the management of these patients in clinical routine worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The registry started in 2009, at the end of the VKA-only era, providing insights into changes in treatment patterns over time.</p><p>An analysis of the first 10,614 patients included in the GARFIELD-AF registry has shown that the patients&#8217; stroke risk profile does not always match the prescribing pattern of anticoagulants [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 2013 publication describes the baseline characteristics and initial therapeutic management of patients with non-valvular AF, with and without antithrombotic treatment, and indicates that anticoagulant drugs are frequently not being used according to stroke risk scores and guidelines, with overuse in patients at low risk and underuse in those at high risk of stroke. This is a crucial finding for the use of VKAs since these anticoagulants have a narrow therapeutic window and need to be individually dosed based on international normalised ratio (INR) control. According to international guidelines, the optimal INR range to minimise ischaemic stroke and bleeding is between 2.0&#8211;3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Various methods are used to describe the quality of INR control, e.g., proportion of time in therapeutic range (TTR), frequency in therapeutic range (FIR), and levels of anticoagulation in narrow INR bands of 0.5. Recently, we showed that TTR and FIR are not equivalent and should not be used interchangeably [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our earlier analyses also suggested that TTR may be preferable to FIR because it takes into account the time between INR readings. However, both methods refer to a predefined target range of INR and so information about over- or underanticoagulation is not obtained.</p><p>In this paper, we analyse the TTR of VKA-treated patients enrolled prospectively in the GARFIELD-AF registry and analyse the relationship between TTR and 1-year outcomes (stroke/systemic embolism [SE], major bleeding, and all-cause mortality).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>GARFIELD-AF is a worldwide observational prospective registry of adults with newly diagnosed non-valvular AF [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Patients on VKA treatment at enrolment, but with fewer than three readings during the follow-up, were excluded from the analysis. Patient-level TTR was estimated by linear interpolation according to Rosendaal et al. [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], using 2.0&#8211;3.0 as the target INR range. TTR was estimated using INR readings until discontinuation or interruption of VKA, an outcome event, or the end of follow-up.

VKAs remain a commonly prescribed anticoagulant therapy in patients with AF, even after the introduction of NOACs. This paper is the first publication of GARFIELD-AF analysing outcomes related to quality of VKA control. The analysis includes 9934 VKA-treated patients with at least three INR readings, out of a total of 39,898 patients recruited in GARFIELD-AF from 2010 to 2015 in 35 countries. All patients had newly diagnosed non-valvular AF and were followed up for 1 year.</p><p>European and American guidelines for stroke prevention in AF recommend an INR range of 2.0&#8211;3.0 for patients treated with VKA [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although country- and region-specific guidance may differ. The Japanese Circulation Society recommends an INR of 2.0&#8211;3.0 for all patients with AF except those aged &#8805;70 years, for whom 1.6&#8211;2.6 is recommended [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is supported by the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society statement on antithrombotic therapy of patients with non-valvular AF [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Federation of Dutch Thrombosis Services, until recently, defined the target INR range of 2.5&#8211;3.5 and the therapeutic range of 2.0&#8211;3.5 [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For the purposes of these analyses, we applied the target INR range of 2.0&#8211;3.0 and a cut-off TTR of 65% as the measure of the quality of patient management. In international guidelines, the cut-off of TTR varies between 60% and 70% [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and NICE uses TTR of less than 65% as an indicator for poor control [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Real-world data from our study indicate that a TTR target of at least 65% is often not achieved in routine clinical practice, regardless of the type of VKA. For all VKAs used in GARFIELD-AF including warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and others, the mean TTR values were below 65%. In addition, we observed marked regional variations in TTR, with the proportion of patients with TTR&#8805;65% varying from 16.7% in Asia to 49.4% in Europe. The low proportion of patients with TTR&#8805;65% in Asia is consistent with a previous analysis from GARFIELD-AF showing that patients in Asia had lower INR values than those in other regions of the world [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It may be that physicians in Asia target a lower INR than those in other regions (as per the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society guidelines for patients aged &#8805;70 years [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Our analysis also showed that patients in Asia had a lower frequency of INR measurements.</p><p>Since TTR does not provide information about over- or underanticoagulation, additional information in this regard can be obtained by the percentages of INR values within, below, or above the target range of 2.0&#8211;3.0. Only 51.4% of all INR values measured were within range, whereas 32.1% were below and 16.5% above this range. Thus, underanticoagulation is more frequent than overanticoagulation in this global registry. This confirms the conclusion from a previous meta-analysis and meta-regression on quality of VKA control and outcomes in patients with AF where patients on VKA were frequently outside the target INR range and tended to be underanticoagulated rather than overanticoagulated [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164076.s005">S3 Table</xref>, there was a clear predominance of primary ischaemic strokes over primary intracerebral haemorrhages in both TTR groups, although this was much more pronounced in patients with TTR&lt;65%. Suboptimal anticoagulation control determined by TTR&lt;65% was associated with a predominance of ischaemic stroke events, especially in the first 4 months of follow-up. When all types of stroke were taken together, an increased risk of 1-year stroke/SE was observed with TTR&lt;65%, compared with TTR&#8805;65%. This trend was also apparent for major bleeding, and all-cause mortality, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164076.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In our study, the population attributable fraction, i.e. the proportion of events attributable to suboptimal anticoagulation among VKA users, was 47.7% for stroke/SE, 16.7% for major bleeding, and 45.4% for all-cause mortality. An advantage of our analyses is that they reflect the use of VKAs in real life, where VKA treatment in patients with AF usually is not initiated with overlapping treatment with heparin to overcome the prothrombotic activity of VKA in the initial treatment period.</p><p>Putting these results into perspective, it is apparent from the literature that optimisation of VKA control has not improved over time. Hylek et al. [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] analysed the lowest effective intensity of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with nonrheumatic AF and stated that tight control of anticoagulant therapy to maintain the INR between 2.0 and 3.0 is a better strategy than targeting lower, less effective levels of anticoagulation. More recently, Gallagher et al. [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in a retrospective study of the medical records from 37,907 patients with AF from the UK General Practice Research Database found that TTR was a strong predictor of stroke. Another retrospective study based on Swedish registries, especially AuriculA, a quality register for AF and oral anticoagulation, was recently published [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In total, 40,449 patients with non-valvular AF started on warfarin were monitored until treatment cessation, death, or the end of the study. The authors concluded that well-managed warfarin therapy is associated with a low risk of complications and is still a valid alternative for prophylaxis of AF-associated stroke. They also emphasised that individual TTR is a strong indicator of probability for both bleeding and thromboembolic events and should be maintained at 70% or greater.</p><p>Since all of these analyses were conducted in non-Asian countries, future analyses will need to show whether the target INR range of 2.0&#8211;3.0 can also be used generally for Asian patients to optimise clinical outcome.</p><p>As GARFIELD-AF enrols newly diagnosed patients with non-valvular AF, an additional analysis of 4-month rate ratios by TTR for stroke/SE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality was performed to have a special focus on the initial treatment phase, which is the most critical phase for patients treated with VKA due to the potential prothrombotic effects of these drugs in the early period of therapy [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In patients with TTR&lt;65%, the highest rate ratios of stroke/SE and major bleeding were observed during the first 4 months after enrolment and the rates declined in the second and third 4-month periods. Conversely, in patients with TTR&#8805;65% the risk of stroke/SE did not show a trend over time but the risk of major bleeding was highest in the third 4-month period. The latter finding confirms a previous publication reporting an increase of bleeding over time in patients with venous thromboembolism who are anticoagulated with VKA [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The authors compared major bleeding in patients with prolonged and short treatment and found major bleeding rates of 2.4% and 0.9%, respectively. They concluded that their analysis of pooled data showed an increase in major bleeding during the entire study period (risk ratio 2.609, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.49, p = 0.0006). The risk of all-cause mortality increased over time in patients with TTR&#8805;65%. This may be due to reasons not related to anticoagulation therapy and will be explored in more detail in future analyses of GARFIELD-AF, after outcome data of all cohorts have become available. As shown in the listing of the corresponding types of stroke in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164076.s005">S3 Table</xref>, there was an accumulation of ischaemic stroke events for the TTR&lt;65% group during the first 4 months of treatment, whereas the number of haemorrhagic strokes remained unchanged over time, i.e. three events in each 4-month period. Whether this can be attributed to the vulnerable phase of the initiation of VKA, or to patient-related factors, cannot be concluded at the present time and needs further exploration after the termination of this global registry, when the outcome results of all VKA patients from GARFIELD-AF become available. However, these 4-month analyses are in line with the findings of Azoulay et al. [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that patients initiating warfarin are at an increased risk of stroke during the early period of treatment, supporting the hypothesis that warfarin may induce a transient hypercoagulable state at the start of treatment. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>Our analyses confirmed that poor VKA control correlates with poor clinical outcomes&#8212;and this finding is applicable in global patient populations treated under the conditions of different health care systems, although the target INR range of 2.0&#8211;3.0 has not been unanimously recommended in all regions and countries participating in GARFIELD-AF. A limitation of this analysis is that TTR was used as a proxy for the quality of patient management. It is a time-dependent variable but it was used as if it was constant over time. Thus, our findings cannot be used to inform patient prognosis nor treatment decisions regarding anticoagulation for individuals with AF [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although the SAMe-TT<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> score is helpful in predicting the probability of anticoagulation control with VKAs and clinical outcomes, such studies have only been performed for homogeneous patient populations from single countries [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These are mainly retrospective [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], single-centre [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164076.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studies, one of which included only patients who were stable on acenocoumarol, with high initial TTR at study entry [<xref rid="pone.0164076.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this analysis, the mortality rate was not high; more patients died than had either first stroke/SE or major bleed events. This competing risk of outcomes could have affected the cause-specific rates for stroke/SE and major bleeding, especially in the latter two 4-month intervals. The event rates for these same outcomes were low, especially in the subgroup of patients with TTR&#8805;65% within each 4-month period. Furthermore, there is potential bias in the analysis from the fact that poor TTR is more likely in the presence of concurrent illnesses or procedures (not requiring VKA interruption) that could expose the patient to adverse outcomes, in addition to a poor TTR.</p><p>Among the strengths of this paper is that, in contrast to many previous publications on outcomes in patients with AF treated with VKAs, GARFIELD-AF is a global registry reflecting routine clinical practice worldwide, across various health care systems and settings. This is also the first publication of TTR data from a global registry of newly diagnosed patients with AF that reports on a wide range of VKAs, including warfarin, phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol, and others. Furthermore, the data are prospectively collected and potential change of patient care can be timely assessed in the near future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These contemporary analyses of VKA control and outcomes in GARFIELD-AF show that patients with poor VKA control have higher risks of stroke/SE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality than patients with good control, which suggests that overall meticulous VKA management would potentially lead to fewer adverse outcomes. In patients with poor VKA control, the risks of stroke/SE and major bleeding are highest in the first 4 months of treatment. The data also show that the optimal management of VKA for stroke prevention is still a challenge in routine clinical practice. Despite the plethora of publications emphasising the necessity of laboratory-controlled dosing using predefined INR target ranges and the use of VKA for many decades, continuing educational activities are needed to improve stroke prevention in patients with AF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164076.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>GARFIELD-AF Registry Investigators.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0164076.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164076.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Central ethics committees and regulatory authorities.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0164076.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164076.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Number of patients enrolled per country.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0164076.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164076.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Four-month rate ratios by TTR level.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0164076.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164076.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Types of stroke by 4-month intervals in patients with proportion of time in therapeutic range &lt;65% and &#8805;65%.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0164076.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the physicians, nurses, and patients involved in the GARFIELD-AF registry.
