<italic>Leishmania</italic>. Around 12 million people are affected by this disease worldwide. The mechanism of action of most of the anti-leishmanial compounds remains largely unknown. The first line treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis involves the administration of antimony based compounds. Treatment of
<italic>L. major</italic> amastigotes with Sb(V) has been found to induce apoptosis by the induction of oxidative-stress and increase in intracellular calcium
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Non-antimony based treatments such as miltefosine, topical formulations of paromomycin are cost effective, convenient and less toxic than antimony based compounds. Amphotericin B being a liposomal formulation is expensive, has a low therapeutic index and is difficult to administer
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Newer formulations for the treatment of this disease include the administration of miltefosine. Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine), originally an anticancer drug has been reported to induce apoptosis of
<italic>L. major</italic> amastigotes in the infected macrophages
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However the growing problem of drug resistance to the existing chemotherapeutics as well as the quick adaptability of the parasite to the host immune responses has necessitated the development of newer treatment strategies for leishmaniasis
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>Sphingolipids like IPC, form an important component of the parasitic membranes
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. IPCS (inositol phosphorylceramide synthase) is an enzyme involved in the sphingolipid metabolism of protozoans and other fungal species
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The relative importance of IPCS in
<italic>Leishmania</italic> has been identified through biochemical network modeling
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. IPCS catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to IPC which forms the most predominant sphingolipid of the parasite
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). IPCS also maintains the concentration of DAG and ceramide, both of which serve as secondary messengers in several signal transduction events
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. IPCS localizes into the lipid rafts of the Golgi complex
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Lipid rafts have been proposed to involve in a wide array of events like trafficking of lipid modified proteins in addition to playing an important role in the formation of signal transduction complexes
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. IPCS has been important for maintaining the viability and the infectivity of several fungal species like
<italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>,
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> and pathogens like
<italic>Leishmania</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly there is no mammalian equivalent of this enzyme and the major sphingolipid in the host is sphingomyelin instead of IPC. Hence IPCS has been considered as a choke point enzyme in the sphingolipid metabolism of
<italic>Leishmania</italic> thereby serving as a druggable target for the treatment of several fungal and protozoan diseases like leishmaniasis.
<italic>Lmj</italic>IPCS comprises of 338 amino acids and has 6 transmembrane domains and belongs to the PAP2c family
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. IPCS is encoded by the AUR1 gene. IPCS protein present in fungi exhibits sensitivity to antifungal agents like galbonolide A, aureobasidin A, macrolidegalbonolide and khafrefungin

<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. IPCS has been recently discovered in
<italic>Leishmania</italic> and to the best of our knowledge there are no reports of inhibitor design against this protein. This paper explores the possibility of targeting IPCS for the development of anti-protozoan compounds. An
<italic>in silico</italic> approach for drug design has led to the development of five novel coumarin derivatives. The refinement and validation of the docked complexes has been done using molecular dynamics simulations to map the protein ligand interactions. Based on the
<italic>in silico</italic> findings, the promising candidates were considered for further experimental evaluation and validation.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>Role of IPCS in the sphingolipid metabolism of

<italic>in silico</italic> approaches like computer based docking which involves the generation of a comprehensive set of ligand conformations that are eventually scored and ranked according to their stability and affinity for the protein.

Molecular docking of the inhibitors with the IPCS protein revealed the binding modes of inhibitors. To account for the flexibility of the protein and ligand and to determine the binding affinity of the inhibitors with the IPCS protein, a 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the docked complexes was carried out. Binding mode analysis revealed that the binding modes obtained after MD simulation were more or less similar to that obtained post docking (

IPCS is an important target because there is no mammalian equivalent of this enzyme. The authors have utilized the state-of-the art computational techniques molecular docking and molecular dynamics to confirm the binding mode and its interaction with the enzyme. The analysis explain that the high number of H-bond acceptors, donors and hydrophobic groups introduce strong interactions of the ligand within the binding site of the enzyme. The cytotoxicity profile of the selected inhibitors provides additional information about the coumarin derivatives. Thus, this study is a good starting point for focusing coumarin derivatives as inhibitors targeting against Leishmania. In the future study, it can be extended to modify these molecules to further enhance the interaction with IPCS and other experimental studies to confirm the binding affinity.</p><p>I have read this submission.

</p><p> Author&#8217;s response: The authors have accepted the suggestion made and have now included a figure showing the binding cavity that was predicted for the IPCS protein around which the grid box was centered during docking.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>In the material and methods it would be appreciated to have an idea where the center of the grid is (may be with a figure).</italic>
</p><p> Author&#8217;s response: Figure 3 has been included keeping in mind the suggestion made.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Can you explain why you chose a grid with large dimensions?</italic>
</p><p> Author&#8217;s response: The inhibitors designed have not yet been reported. As there are no studies indicating the exact binding site in the IPCS protein, we have made binding site prediction and the grid box dimensions have been adjusted to incorporate most of the amino acids that fall in the binding site.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>The analysis of the viability raises a question. Why the surface p1 is not the same between control and compound? To compare the stats it should be the same size here it is half. Also from fig 6 compound 3 it seems that a lot of data were excluded from P1 area? Can you explain?</italic>
</p><p> Author&#8217;s response:&#160; The P1 area has been demarcated as per the untreated macrophages (control). As was a decrease in granularity of macrophages post treatment, the cells had lower SSC, however the viability of the cells has not decreased. As per the author&#8217;s knowledge about flow cytometry, the P1 area has to remain the same both for the control and treated samples.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>As perspective are you planning on testing in vitro the efficiency of compound 3 and have an idea of binding affinity?</italic>
</p><p> Author&#8217;s response:&#160; At present, the authors don&#8217;t have idea of the binding affinity of compound 3. Such studies can be done in future.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
