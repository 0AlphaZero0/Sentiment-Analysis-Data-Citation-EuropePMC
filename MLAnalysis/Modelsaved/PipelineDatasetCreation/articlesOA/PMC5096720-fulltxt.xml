Death from disseminated candidiasis in a significant percentage of cases is due to fungal invasion of the kidney, leading to renal failure. Treatment of candidiasis is hampered by drug toxicity, the emergence of antifungal drug resistance and lack of vaccines against fungal pathogens. IL-17 is a key mediator of defense against candidiasis. The underlying mechanisms of IL-17-mediated renal immunity have so far been assumed to occur solely through the regulation of antimicrobial mechanisms, particularly activation of neutrophils. Here, we identify an unexpected role for IL-17 in inducing the Kallikrein (Klk)-Kinin System (KKS) in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-infected kidney, and we show that the KKS provides significant renal protection in candidiasis. Microarray data indicated that Klk1 was upregulated in infected kidney in an IL-17-dependent manner. Overexpression of Klk1 or treatment with bradykinin rescued IL-17RA<sup>-/-</sup> mice from candidiasis. Therapeutic manipulation of IL-17-KKS pathways restored renal function and prolonged survival by preventing apoptosis of renal cells following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection. Furthermore, combining a minimally effective dose of fluconazole with bradykinin markedly improved survival compared to either drug alone. These results indicate that IL-17 not only limits fungal growth in the kidney, but also prevents renal tissue damage and preserves kidney function during disseminated candidiasis through the KKS. Since drugs targeting the KKS are approved clinically, these findings offer potential avenues for the treatment of this fatal nosocomial infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the causative agent of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC, thrush), dermal and vaginal candidiasis. However, the most severe <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-induced disease is disseminated candidiasis, a frequent nosocomial infection associated with a high mortality rate. During disseminated candidiasis, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> form invasive hyphae that damage target organs, particularly kidney and liver. Previous studies have identified an essential role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in controlling systemic infection through regulation of neutrophils. We show here for the first time that IL-17 also regulates the renal protective Kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Our discovery of a connection between IL-17 and the KKS suggests a new, previously unanticipated avenue for the treatment of renal damage in disseminated candidiasis. These findings have potential translational significance<bold>,</bold> as agonists of the KKS are in routine clinical use. Therefore, these results not only identify downstream mediators that could serve as novel drug targets, but could possibly be used to guide decisions on whether targeting these mediators could be a useful therapeutic option in conjunction with current antifungal therapies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK104680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>Partha S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI107825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaffen</surname><given-names>Sarah L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Grant support from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: DK104680 to PSB and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: AI107825 and DE022550 to SLG.

However, the most severe <italic>Candida</italic>-induced disease is a systemic form of bloodstream candidiasis. Disseminated candidiasis is the fourth most common hospital acquired infection and is associated with a 40&#8211;60% mortality rate [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Intravascular catheters, abdominal surgery, prolonged use of antibiotics and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for this disease, and contribute to the concerning rise in the incidence of candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Available antifungal medications are limited by drug-drug interactions, drug resistance, toxicity and high treatment costs. To date, there are no effective vaccines to fungal pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to develop alternative, safe and ideally inexpensive approaches to treat this fatal infection.</p><p>Candidiasis is often treated effectively with azoles, amphotericin B and echinocandins [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The extensive and prolonged use of antifungal medications to treat systemic fungal infections, however, has led to drug resistant fungal strains and host toxicity [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, novel antifungals or improved therapeutic strategies are still needed. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies combining azoles with other drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, amiodarone or retigeric acid B yielded encouraging results [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These data justify the concept of novel combination therapies to treat candidiasis at lower dosage in preclinical animal models.</p><p>Death due to sepsis is a frequent outcome of disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, in 30&#8211;40% adults and 50% neonates, <italic>Candida</italic> hyphae invade and injure the kidney, leading to irreversible damage and fatal renal failure [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once <italic>Candida</italic> invades the kidney, a robust innate response dominated by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages contributes to pathogen clearance and sets the stage for the adaptive immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During the course of fungal clearance, both innate effector cells and kidney-resident cells release tissue repair enzymes and anti-inflammatory proteins. While necessary to repair injured tissue, these factors also limit bystander damage caused by innate immune cells.</p><p>Considerable data implicate IL-17 (IL-17A) in immunity to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. For example, IL-17RA<sup>-/-</sup>, IL-17RC<sup>-/-</sup>, ROR&#947;t<sup>-/-</sup> and IL-17A<sup>-/-</sup> mice are all susceptible to systemic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At mucosal surfaces, IL-17 mediates antifungal activity by driving the expression of antimicrobial peptides and chemokines that facilitate neutrophil influx [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unlike mucocutaneous candidiasis, which affects individuals with compromised IL-17 signaling, systemic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection normally impacts individuals with no known underlying genetic defects in IL-17 signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One recent study reported that IL-17 also acts on NK cells to drive the production of GM-CSF, with protective activities in disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of local IL-17-mediated antifungal activities within the kidney still remain unclear.</p><p>The Kallikreins (Klk) are a family of fifteen related serine proteases. Klk1 in particular plays a critical role in renal function and pathology [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Klk cleave kininogens to generate kinin peptides, known as bradykinin and kallidin. Collectively, this system is termed the Kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005952.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Bradykinin signals through two receptors; bradykinin receptor &#946;2 (Bdkrb2) is constitutively expressed, whereas Bdkrb1 is inducible upon inflammatory signals. The primary known function of the KKS is to regulate blood pressure by promoting vasodilation [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, studies in animal models implicate the KKS in regulating inflammation, tissue repair and homeostasis during kidney injury [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The renal protective function of the KKS is mediated through upregulation of tissue repair proteins, inhibition of profibrotic factors, and control of apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistently, polymorphisms in KKS-related genes (<italic>ACE</italic>, <italic>BDKRB2</italic>, <italic>NOS3</italic>, <italic>KLK1)</italic> are associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic renal injury in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While it is clear that the KKS protects the kidney in disorders associated with sterile inflammation, its role in renal immunity in infectious settings is less well defined.</p><fig id="ppat.1005952.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005952.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The expression of Klk is impaired in IL-17RA<sup>-/-</sup> kidney following <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection.</title><p>

However, renal infections occur via hematogenous routes or from ascending spread from the bladder or urethra [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In recent years, considerable data have implicated IL-17 in immunity against disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is unclear how IL-17 regulates immunity within the kidney, the most heavily colonized organ during blood-borne <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection. In the present report, we have identified renal-protective kallikreins as novel IL-17 target genes in systemic candidiasis, thereby revealing a new connection between IL-17 and KKS-mediated renal defense. IL-17 not only limits fungal growth in the kidney, but also prevents renal tissue damage and preserves kidney function during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005952.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Consequently, therapeutic manipulation of the IL-17-KKS pathways protected mice from early mortality in disseminated candidiasis. Our data provide important and potentially translatable insights into the renal functions of IL-17 in the context of this fatal hospital-acquired infection.</p><p>Kidney-specific immune responses are mediated by both kidney-infiltrating immune effectors and kidney resident cells. Although IL-17RA is ubiquitously expressed, most documented IL-17R signaling occurs in non-hematopoietic cells, particularly cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A recent study also suggested a role for IL-17RA signaling in NK cell development in the context of disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], although this report conflicts with a study showing that NK cells are redundant for antifungal defense in immunocompetent hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consistent with the latter finding, we and others have observed upregulation of transcripts encoding IL-17A and IL-17-responsive genes in the kidney [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We also showed that kidney resident cells express the IL-17R and are responsive to IL-17 [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Taken together, these results argue that there is a bona fide, kidney-specific role of IL-17 in immunity to candidiasis.</p><p>Unlike mucocutaneous candidiasis, disseminated infection typically occurs in individuals with no known defects in IL-17 signaling pathways. In line with these observations, we were intrigued by the surprisingly different gene profile seen in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-infected kidney compared to prior studies involving mucosal <italic>Candida</italic> infection such as the tongue [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results highlight the fact that different cell types &#8220;interpret&#8221; IL-17 signals differently, with non-identical patterns of gene expression depending on setting. Therefore, lessons derived from studies of anti-<italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> immunity at mucosal sites cannot always be applied to local kidney immune responses. Although we show that IL-17 (in conjunction with TNF&#945;) induces <italic>Klk1</italic> gene in primary RTEC, there is little known about <italic>Klk1</italic> gene regulation at the transcriptional level. We have identified conserved CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP)-&#946; binding sites within the putative proximal promoters of the <italic>Klk1</italic> gene, hinting that IL-17 may regulate <italic>Klk1</italic> expression in a C/EBP&#946;-dependent manner. Indeed, C/EBP&#946;<sup>-/-</sup> mice are susceptible to systemic candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Since TNF&#945; is required for protection against disseminated candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], further studies should focus on <italic>Klk</italic> gene expression in the kidney of TNF&#945;-deficient mice.</p><p>Klk1 cleaves kininogens to form bradykinin, a process known as the bradykinin-dependent pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, Klk1-mediated activation of PAR4 induces cytokine production and prevents apoptosis in RTEC, known as the bradykinin-independent pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mice deficient in specific PARs or treated with PAR antagonists exhibited compromised renal inflammatory changes [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, the contribution of PARs in IL-17-Klk1-mediated renal protection is unknown. Moreover, the relative contributions of Bdkrb1 and Bdkrb2 in renal defense against candidiasis need to be determined, which is possible with specific knockout mouse strains.</p><p>Our data show that bradykinin treatment improved renal function as early as 7 days p.i. Interestingly, serum creatinine and BUN levels did not correlate with the survival benefit at late time points, the basis for which is unclear. Late mortality despite improved renal function likely indicates side effects of bradykinin in mice. Although bradykinin has been implicated in causing angioedema [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], mice treated with bradykinin did not show any signs of angioedema following fungal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005952.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Additionally, bradykinin at the dose levels used in this study did not seem to exert any long term consequences on blood pressure. Therefore, these studies argue against the likelihood of bradykinin toxicity and point towards alternative possibilities to explain the lack of correlation between kidney function and survival benefit. First, extremely short half-life of bradykinin (approx. 30 sec) and internalization of bradykinin receptors may lead to bradykinin unresponsiveness at the late time points. Second, daily administration of bradykinin may lead to the activation of a negative feedback regulatory mechanisms leading to increased degradation of bradykinin by Angiotensin converting enzymes. Finally, bradykinin has been shown to modulate glomerular function by regulating podocyte permeability [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], an effect independent of its renal tissue protective function. Given the potential side effects in bradykinin therapy, future studies investigating these questions could help better understand the means to harness the beneficial impact of IL-17-KKS axis without compromising the safety in treatment against disseminated candidiasis.</p><p>An Ab targeting IL-17 (secukinumab) was approved in 2016 to treat moderate-severe plaque psoriasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Abs against IL-17/IL-17RA are in clinical trials for other autoimmune conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005952.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. One obvious concern with anti-IL-17 therapy is compromising IL-17-driven antifungal immunity. Although systemic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection has not been reported thus far with secukinumab, patients on this medication may have a higher risk of developing disseminated candidiasis in the face of predisposing factors, such as an indwelling catheter, abdominal surgery or long-term antibiotic use. Our data show that activation of the KKS pathway restored protection in IL-17RA<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Thus, drugs targeting the IL-17-KKS axis may be considered to treat or prevent disseminated <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection in patients receiving anti-IL-17 therapy.</p><p>Amphotericin B, azoles and echinocandins are used to treat systemic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infections, but there are concerns due to drug-resistance and toxicity. Here, we show proof-of-concept that combination therapy with bradykinin and low-dose FLC is effective in treating candidiasis in mice. Notably, the survival rate of mice treated with the combination therapy was similar to the survival rate in mice given four times the FLC dose. This approach may be especially valuable for anti-fungal drugs such as amphotericin B due its intrinsic renal toxicity. Future studies will test the efficacy of combination therapy with amphotericin B and bradykinin, once we have access to oral or injectable form of amphotericin B suitable for administration in mice. In addition, the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, known to increase the levels of bradykinin and are routinely used to treat patients with obstructive nephropathy, need further evaluation in pre-clinical animal models of disseminated candidiasis. Overall, our data show that defining the IL-17 anti-fungal pathway has highlighted a potentially translatable and testable approach to treating systemic candidiasis. Additionally, the novel convergence between IL-17 and the KKS pathways in renal defense against fungal infection represents a major advance in our understanding of IL-17 signaling in the kidney inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Habor, ME).

IL-17 in turn binds its receptor (IL-17RA/RC) on kidney-resident target cells, activating downstream signaling events leading to expression of IL-17-responsive cytokines, chemokines and AMP genes. Innate effectors (neutrophils, macrophages) recruited in response to IL-17-induced signals facilitate fungal clearance. IL-17 also induces expression of kallikreins in target cells. Kallikreins cleave kininogens to form bradykinin. Activation of bradykinin receptors (Bdkrb) on renal cells prevents apoptosis and controls of tissue damage.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1005952.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank GPCL core, University of Pittsburgh and William Horne for help with the Illumina microarray experiments and Immunology Flow Core for flow cytometry.
