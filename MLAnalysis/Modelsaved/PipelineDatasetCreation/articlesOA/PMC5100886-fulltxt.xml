Jujube witches&#8217;-broom a phytoplasma disease of <italic>Ziziphus jujuba</italic> is prevalent in China and is a serious problem to the industry. However, the molecular mechanism of the disease is poorly understood. In this study, genome-wide identification and analysis of microRNAs in response to witches&#8217;-broom was performed. A total of 85 conserved miRNA unique sequences belonging to 32 miRNA families and 24 novel miRNA unique sequences, including their complementary miRNA* strands were identified from small RNA libraries derived from a uninfected and witches&#8217;-broom infected <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic> plant. Differentially expressed miRNAs associated with Jujube witches&#8217;-broom disease were investigated between the two libraries, and 12 up-regulated miRNAs and 10 down- regulated miRNAs identified with more than 2 fold changes. Additionally, 40 target genes of 85 conserved miRNAs and 49 target genes of 24 novel miRNAs were predicted and their putative functions assigned. Using the modified 5&#8217;-RACE method, we confirmed that <italic>SPL</italic> and <italic>MYB</italic> were cleaved by miR156 and miR159, respectively.

It is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for at least 3,000 years, because its fruit contains high vitamin C content, abundant phenolic compounds, carbohydrate, minerals, cyclic AMP and other important nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Jujube witches&#8217;-broom (JWB) disease is prevalent in China and causes serious problems to the industry [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is caused by phytoplasmas which are bacteria without cell walls that were first discovered in the phloem of plants in 1967 by Yoji Doi and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Phytoplasmas are transmitted by phloem-sucking leafhoppers and Chinese Jujube plants infected with phytoplasmas display a variety of symptoms, such as small leaves, yellowing, witches&#8217;-broom, phyllody, stunting, sterile flowers and finally death after a few years of infection [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Phytoplasmas are very destructive agricultural pathogens, and have devastating effects on over 1000 plant species worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>A previous study of Mexican lime trees infected with phytoplasma identified several candidate genes and proteins that might be involved in the interaction of Mexican lime trees with the phytoplasma [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although some progress has been made in understanding the regulation that is involved in plant-phytoplasma interactions [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the molecular mechanisms involved in the JWB disease and the symptoms are poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, many studies have shown that small RNAs (sRNAs) have numerous roles in the development of plants, defense against viruses and transposons, chromatin modifications, responses to biotic and abiotic stresses etc. In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two major classes of small RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. miRNAs are produced from the primary miRNA transcripts with internal stem-loop structures, whereas siRNAs are derived from dsRNAs transcripts. To regulate gene expression, the generated sRNA are loaded into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to guide and interact with homologous RNA or DNA molecules for direct RNA cleavage, translational repression or DNA methylation [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>High-throughput sequencing provides a comprehensive means of identifying and studying the expression of small RNAs. miRNAs play an important role in disease resistance in plants [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], for example, a total of 87 differentially regulated miRNAs have been identified to be responsive to fungal stress in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, to our best knowledge, there is no report on miRNAs associated with JWB in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic>. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of witches&#8217;-broom disease associated with miRNAs is potentially important for developing efficient methods to control the disease. With the aim of identifying miRNAs involved in JWB disease, we constructed two small RNAs libraries from the sprig leaves of uninfected wild type (ZZN) <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic> plants and plants with JWB disease (ZZD). miRNAs and their targets were identified from both small RNA libraries and differentially expressed miRNAs associated with JWB disease were determined.

A growing number of pathogen-responsive miRNAs have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To our best knowledge, the small RNAs of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic> have not been previously reported. In this study, a total of 85 conserved miRNA unique sequences belonging to 32 miRNA families and 24 novel miRNA unique sequences, including their complementary miRNA* strands were identified in two libraries derived from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic> wild type (ZZN) uninfected leaves and leaves infected (ZZD) with JWB disease. 40 target genes of 85 conserved miRNAs and 49 target genes of 24 novel miRNAs were predicted using computational analysis, and their functions were putatively assigned. We also identified differentially expressed miRNAs associated with JWB disease between ZZN and ZZD libraries. The targets of miR156 and miR159 were validated using the modified 5&#8217;-RACE method.</p><p>The regulatory mechanism of miRNAs involved in witches&#8217;-broom phytoplasma response is a complicated problem. Currently there are only two reported studies involving witches&#8217;-broom phytoplasma responsive miRNAs, which consist of the investigation of Mexian lime infected by <italic>Candidatus</italic> Phytoplasma aurantifolia [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and mulberry infected by aster yellows phytoplasma [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both these studies concluded that the differentially expressed miRNAs in healthy and phytoplasma infected plants involved in modulating multiple pathways such as hormonal, nutritional, and stress signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. They also concluded that these responsive sRNAs may work cooperatively in the response to phytoplasma infection and be responsible for some symptoms observed in the infected plants [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Compared to these two studies, among the 85 conserved witches&#8217;-broom phytoplasma responsive miRNAs identified in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>jujuba</italic>, only 3 miRNA families, including miR156, miR172 and miR477, were also differentially expressed in <italic>Candidatus</italic> phytoplasma aurantifolia infected Mexican lime and aster yellows phytoplasma infected in mulberry. Therefore, the expression patterns of miRNAs responsive to the phytoplasma infection were diverse in different plants.</p><p>In this study, among the differentially expressed miRNAs, miR156 was the most up-regulated differentially miRNAs, suggesting that miR156 may play an important role in response to JWB. In both libraries, all the up-regulated miRNA sequences with a greater than 3.5 fold change were members of miR156 family. The SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) genes were the targets of miR156. Our results showed that miR156 was up-regulated in the infected sprig leaves, meanwhile miR172 was down-regulated. A previous study showed that the overexpression of miR156b in Arabidopsis increased axillary branching [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which is similar to the symptom of the witches&#8217;-broom disease [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, APETALA2 was regulated by miR172 through direct RNA cleavage or translational repression [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, we found the expression levels of miR172 was down-regulated, suggesting that the expression levels of APETALA2 gene was increased, which takes part in regulating flowering time and floral organ identity [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, some <italic>SPL</italic> genes, such as <italic>AtSPL9</italic>, positively regulate the expression of miR172. This forms the miR156-<italic>AtSPL9</italic>-miR172 regulatory pathway [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, the miR156-<italic>SPL9</italic>-miR172 regulatory pathway may be also conserved in response to phytoplasma infection. The expression changes of miR156 and miR172 might leads to the symptoms of the JWB diseases such as development of green leaf-like structures instead of flowers and sterility of flowers. MiR159 is the most abundant miRNAs in both libraries, which targets the mRNAs of MYB transcription factors. The expression level of miR159 was down-regulated in the ZZD library. It has been suggested that the overexpression of <italic>MYB33</italic> leads to rolled leaf and shorter petioles [<xref rid="pone.0166099.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166099.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
