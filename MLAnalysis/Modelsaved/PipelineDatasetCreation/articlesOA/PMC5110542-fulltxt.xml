The environmental enrichment paradigm is a rat model of resilience to addiction-like behavior, and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype may lead to novel targets for pharmacotherapeutics to treat cocaine addiction. We investigated the differential regulation of transcript levels using RNA sequencing of the rat nucleus accumbens after environmental enrichment/isolation and cocaine/saline self-administration. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of 14,309 transcripts demonstrated that many biofunctions and pathways were differentially regulated. New functional pathways were also identified for cocaine modulation (e.g., Rho GTPase signaling) and environmental enrichment (e.g., signaling of EIF2, mTOR, ephrin). However, one novel pathway stood out above the others, the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway. The RA signaling pathway was identified as one likely mediator of the protective enrichment addiction phenotype, an interesting result given that nine RA signaling-related genes are expressed selectively and at high levels in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). Subsequent knockdown of <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> (an RA degradation enzyme) in the NAcSh of rats confirmed this role by increasing cocaine self-administration as well as cocaine seeking. These results provide a comprehensive account of enrichment effects on the transcriptome and identify RA signaling as a contributing factor for cocaine addiction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>drug dependence</kwd><kwd>stimulants</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>differential rearing</kwd><kwd>self-administration</kwd><kwd>regionally enhanced gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">DA029091, DA007287, UL1TR01439</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Institute on Drug Abuse<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000026</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000065</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="58"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Some people experimenting with cocaine become addicted at first exposure, while others are resistant, even after many exposures. These important individual differences in vulnerability to addiction are a function of the interaction between genes and the environment (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">McGue et al., 1996</xref>). Genetic factors that play an essential role in individual differences in susceptibility to drugs of abuse are well studied; however, environmental influences on gene expression is an area in need of further study (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Thiriet et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Environmental enrichment is a non-drug, non-surgical, non-genetic manipulation producing a protective addiction phenotype in rodent models (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bardo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chauvet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Thiel et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Solinas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alvers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chauvet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nader et al., 2014</xref>). In the enriched condition (EC), animals are group-housed with access to children&#8217;s plastic toys which are changed and rearranged daily, while those in the isolated condition (IC) are single-housed without disturbance. In drug self-administration studies, EC rats self-administer less cocaine than IC rats in the acquisition, maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement phases of cocaine self-administration (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective phenotype of environmental enrichment may help uncover novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of addiction.</p><p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an essential brain region for reward (among several regions) and altering the expression of genes in the NAc shell affects cocaine self-administration in rats (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). First we utilize quantitative RNA sequencing to analyze expression of 14,309 transcripts in the NAc of EC and IC rats self-administering cocaine or saline. Next, a transcriptomic analysis of topographical gene expression was performed to identify genes expressed selectively in the mouse NAc shell, using tools and data from the Allen Brain Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. The convergence of RNA-seq and topographical gene expression analyses pointed clearly to retinoic acid (RA) signaling as the most promising pathway to target.</p><p>As the active metabolite of vitamin A, RA acts as an essential molecule in multiple biological processes, such as embryonic development (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rhinn and Dolle, 2012</xref>), immune response (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mielke et al., 2013</xref>), cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and maintenance of the nervous system (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Maden, 2007</xref>). There is increasing evidence that RA plays an important role in the adult brain (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Maden, 2007</xref>). Although no study has yet reported on the role of RA in addiction-related behavior <italic>per se</italic>, there is some evidence that double null mutants of the RA receptor &#946; (RAR&#946;) with the retinoid X receptor RXR&#946; or RXR&#947; decrease dopamine D2 receptor expression selectively in the shell of the NAc (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Krezel et al., 1998</xref>). These rats displayed decreased cocaine-stimulated locomotor activity; however, they also had severe decrements in the rotarod task and spontaneous locomotor activity.</p><p>Retinoic acid is highly concentrated in the brain, including the striatum (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Napoli, 2010</xref>). RA is synthesized in the cytoplasm in two steps: first, retinol is oxidized to retinaldehyde via retinol dehydrogenase (<italic>Radh a.k.a. Adh</italic>). Then, retinaldehyde is irreversibly converted to RA through retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (<italic>Raldh</italic> a.k.a. <italic>Aldh1a1-3</italic>). Excess RA is degraded by <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> into polar metabolites (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Maden, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that knockdown of <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> via a novel adeno-associated viral vector increases cocaine self-administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>For the RNA-seq study, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Houston, TX, USA) arrived at 21 days of age and were enriched or isolated for 30 days before behavioral testing. EC rats (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were group-housed in a large metal cage (70 cm &#215; cm 70 &#215; 70 cm) with 14 hard children&#8217;s plastic toys changed and rearranged daily. This density (245 cm<sup>2</sup>/rat) was higher than a majority of environmental enrichment studies, but was still more than double that required by NIH. EC rats were split into two cages after 50 days of age. IC rats (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were single housed in standard polycarbonate cages. These conditions produce a resistant (i.e., EC) and susceptible (i.e., IC) behavioral addiction phenotype (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While it is true that short term isolation is a stressor, enriched rats (even at lower density) show greater signs of chronic stress, even though these rats do not show outward signs of stress (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Crofton et al., 2015</xref>). Rats remained in these homecage conditions throughout all behavioral tests, except during testing. For vector injection and behavioral tests, male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained at 225&#8211;249 g. Rats were pair-housed and maintained in a controlled environment (temperature, 22&#176;C; relative humidity, 50%; and 12 h light/dark cycle, lights on 0600 h) in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) approved colony and procedures were approved by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Intravenous Cocaine Self-Administration with Environmental Enrichment</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg, IP) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IP), and implanted with an indwelling Silastic catheter (0.2 mm I.D.; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) into the jugular vein. The catheter passed under the skin to exit on the rat&#8217;s back. The catheters were infused with 0.1 ml of a sterile saline solution containing heparin (30.0 U/ml), ticarcillin (250,000 U/ml) and streptokinase (8000 IU/ml) daily, to prevent infection and maintain catheter patency throughout the duration of experiments.</p><p>One week after catheter surgery, rats were allowed to self-administer 0.5 mg/kg/infusion cocaine (National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, MD, USA) or saline under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule for 2 h/day for 14 days. The session terminated when the rat received 30 infusions to eliminate cocaine intake differences between EC and IC rats.

The right side was used for protein quantification (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lichti et al., 2014</xref>). The RNA was extracted and purified with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). cDNA libraries were created by reverse transcribing the RNA and creating the second strand. Blunt ends were phosphorylated and &#8220;a-tailed&#8221; so that adapters could be ligated to both ends. Adapters were individually &#8220;bar coded&#8221; and thus samples were not pooled despite having 4 samples per flow cell, yielding <italic>n</italic> = 7&#8211;8 for each condition (total <italic>N</italic> = 30). RNA was sequenced with a HiSeq 1000 system from Illumina. cDNA was amplified using &#8220;bridge&#8221; amplification. Base calls were made using fluorescently labeled nucleotides. More than 100 million reads with 50 bp (paired-end reads) were mapped for each rat and quality was checked with FastQC (v0.9.1) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Andrew, 2010</xref>). Reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (RN4) using Tophat2 (v2.0.4) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and Bowtie2 (v2.0.0.6) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) software packages. The R package EdgeR (v.3.0.8) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) was then used for analysis using the log-transformed &#8220;trimmed mean for <italic>M</italic>-values&#8221; (TMM) method for normalization and tag-wise dispersion using &#8220;count&#8221; data. A likelihood ratio <italic>F</italic>-test was used for generating <italic>p</italic>-values to compare EC vs. IC rats and cocaine vs. saline. Cross-validation of RNA-seq results was achieved by looking at correlation of expression between qPCR and RNA-seq for Fabp5 (Forward: 5&#8242; CTTGCACCTTGGGAGAGAAG 3&#8242;, Reverse: 5&#8242; CATCTTCCCGTCCTTCAGTT 3&#8242;) and Hspa5 (Forward: 5&#8242; AACCAAGGATGCTGGCACTA 3&#8242;; Reverse: 5&#8242; ATGACCCGCTGATCAAAGTC 3&#8242;), with the qPCR being normalized to Reep5 (Forward: 5&#8242; GGTTCCTGCACGAGAAGAACT 3&#8242;; Reverse: 5&#8242; GAGAGAGGCTCCATAACCGAA 3&#8242;) (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S6</xref></bold>). The Fabp5 was chosen because it is in the RA pathway and selectively expressed in the NAc shell, both aspects central to this paper. Hspa5 (Bip) was chosen because it has extremely high expression levels, and because we have studied this transcript with cocaine in the past (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pavlovsky et al., 2013</xref>). Using qPCR to cross-validate the RNA-seq data is somewhat problematic. Our conclusion is that using a less accurate and less precise method to validate a more accurate and precise method is difficult at best. The problem encountered is that qPCR needs to be normalized to a control or &#8220;housekeeping&#8221; transcript. The variance from the transcript of interest gets compounded with the variance inherent in the housekeeping gene, increasing variance. Multiple transcripts were assessed for normalization and the end results were quite different depending solely upon which normalization gene was chosen. Many traditional &#8220;housekeeping&#8221; transcripts were regulated (e.g., <italic>gapdh</italic>) or trended toward regulation (e.g., &#946;-actin) by enrichment and/or cocaine. In the end, Reep5 was chosen because it was a housekeeping gene not regulated by cocaine or enrichment. However, the variability of the Reep5 expression among samples washed out main effects.</p><p>The quantitative transcriptomic data have been deposited in NCBI&#8217;s Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE88736<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)</title><p>In order to study the biological functions and pathways regulated by cocaine and environmental enrichment, transcripts significantly regulated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were analyzed with IPA. Canonical Pathways, Upstream Regulators, Diseases and Biological Functions, and Networks were used to identify significantly regulated transcript sets. Because regulation of any given gene could be a statistical anomaly (i.e., false positive), bioinformatic analyses have been developed under the assumption that regulation important for function will occur in a coordinated fashion at multiple targets within a given pathway. Thus, the IPA analysis assesses over-representation of multiple targets within known pathways. For this analysis, the list of significantly regulated genes is further analyzed for significantly regulated pathways, thus minimizing the effect of individual false positives. Preliminary analysis of ribosomal proteins, tyrosine phosphatases, de-ubiquitinating enzymes and proteasomal proteins, all of which show highly coordinated regulation (see <bold>Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4A,B</xref></bold>) demonstrate that the <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 cutoff does <bold>not</bold> produce an overabundance of false positives.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA)</title><p>To complement the IPA analysis and avoid the problems of Type I vs. II error, normalized expression intensity (normalized by EdgeR using TMM) of all identified transcripts were analyzed by GSEA. The normalized enrichment score (NES) indicates the degree to which this gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of the ranked list of genes in the expression dataset (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). In IPA analyses, a p-value cutoff is required to decide whether transcription is significantly regulated or not. The problem of setting a cutoff is that high stringency introduces false negative results (i.e., high Type II error), whereas low stringent cutoffs introduce false positive results (i.e., high Type I error). To complement the IPA analysis and avoid the problem of Type I vs. II error, normalized expression intensity of all identified transcripts were analyzed by GSEA. In the GSEA analysis, all transcripts are ranked by a signal2noise metric (the difference of means scaled by the standard deviation), and the significance of a given set of genes is determined using a running-sum statistic to determine rank-order over-representation. Thus, this analysis produces a statistic at the gene set level without the need for a p-value cutoff. Gene sets were from the Broad Institute&#8216;s set (v.4.0) of curated gene sets [C2.all], gene ontology gene sets [C5.all] and transcription factor target gene sets [C3.tft]. In GSEA, the Enrichment Score (ES) for the gene set is the degree to which this gene set is overrepresented (i.e., &#8220;enriched&#8221;) at the top or bottom of the ranked list of genes in the expression dataset. NES indicates the enrichment score for the gene set after it has been normalized to adjust for size of the gene set.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative Proteomics</title><p>A secondary analysis of our previously published liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) protein data from these same rats (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lichti et al., 2014</xref>) was used to corroborate RNA results where appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Topographic Transcriptomic Analysis</title><p>The regional specificity of gene expression within the brain strongly suggests that genes are not expressed where they are not needed.

The genes with a regional enrichment score of 1.25 fold or higher (&gt;250 genes) were then culled by individual manual inspection to remove genes whose enrichment fold change was clearly driven by experimental artifact such as bubbles, debris, misalignment and high expression in nearby regions (e.g., Islands of Calleja, NAc core, olfactory tubercles, etc.) to yield 178 genes. These 178 genes were submitted to IPA analysis. Once the RA signaling pathway was identified, manual curation of sagittal sets for RA signaling genes without coronal sets was used to identify additional targets (Rbp1 and Rdh10) with shell-specific expression.

Separately, a topographic transcriptomic analysis identified RA-related genes and RA target genes as being selectively expressed in the NAc shell, further highlighting the likely importance of RA in addiction-related behavior. These results generated a hypothesis-driven experiment that confirmed the role of RA in addiction-related behavior.</p><sec><title>Cocaine Transcriptomic Effects</title><p>In the upstream analysis of cocaine-regulated transcripts, cocaine itself and CREB1, an important mediator of the effects of psychostimulants (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carlezon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pliakas et al., 2001</xref>), ranked at the top of the list as upstream regulators, strongly supporting that cocaine-regulated transcription seen here agrees with previous studies. Our prior research demonstrated that enriched rats have less phospho-CREB in the NAc and that decreasing CREB function in the accumbens shell produces a behavioral phenotype identical to that of environmental enrichment (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bowling and Bardo, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), an interesting behavioral phenotype marked by increased sensitivity to the rewarding effects of stimulants (as measured by CPP) coupled with decreased self-administration (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pliakas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Environmental Enrichment and Transcription</title><p>Compared to the cocaine main effect, there were approximately 5X more transcripts significantly regulated by environmental enrichment, revealing that environment has a much more extensive impact on gene expression than cocaine exposure. Transcription factors were the most regulated gene sets by environmental enrichment. Another impressive difference between EC and IC rats is the regulation of transcripts involved with EIF2 signaling. Even though <italic>Eif2</italic> itself is not regulated at the mRNA level, decreased upstream inhibitors of <italic>Eif2</italic> and upregulated downstream ribosomal subunits suggests regulation of the protein translation process. In addition to protein synthesis, the protein degradation system is also altered by enrichment. Prior research from this laboratory demonstrated that expression of ubiquitin target proteins is different in EC and IC rats (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Ubiquitination is also important in differential expression of proteins from the current rats (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lichti et al., 2014</xref>). The current mRNA data revealed increased transcription of ubiquitin and proteasomal subunits, but reduced mRNA expression for deubiquitinating enzymes in the NAc, possibly suggesting enhanced protein degradation in EC rats. Taken together, enhanced protein translation and degradation likely indicate more rapid protein turnover in EC rats compared with IC rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Retinoic Acid Signaling</title><p>Retinoic acid genes are selectively expressed in the NAc shell, as shown by a topographic transcriptomic analysis of the Allen Brain Atlas and the published literature (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">McCaffery and Drager, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zetterstrom, 1999</xref>). Given the importance of the NAc shell to addiction, the RA signaling pathway offers promising targets for novel therapeutic development for cocaine addiction. One previous report found that constitutive whole-body RAR&#946;/RXR&#946; or RAR&#946;/RXR&#947; double null mice had a selective decrease of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the shell of the NAc, with concomitant decrements in locomotor and rotarod performance (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Krezel et al., 1998</xref>). Thus far, however, there have not been any other systematic studies aimed at understanding RA signaling and addiction.</p><p>The current report provides converging evidence from the Upstream Regulator analysis (predicting function) of environmental enrichment and the vector knockdown of Cyp26b1 suggesting that RA signaling activity in the NAc shell increases susceptibility to drug taking. Given that every core component of the RA signaling pathway involves protein interactions with small molecules (i.e., retinoids) this pathway is a prime candidate for the development of selective small molecule inhibitors as possible pharmacotherapeutics for cocaine addiction. One advantage of choosing targets in this pathway is that nine components of this pathway have some enhancement of expression in the NAc shell (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>), providing some degree of regional selectivity and thereby decreasing the likelihood of unwanted side effects. These regionally-enhanced components include the binding proteins <italic>Stra6. Rbp1</italic>, and <italic>Fabp5</italic>, the synthesis enzymes <italic>Adh10.
