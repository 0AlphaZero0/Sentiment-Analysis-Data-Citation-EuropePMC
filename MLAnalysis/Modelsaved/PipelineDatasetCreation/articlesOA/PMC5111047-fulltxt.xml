In order to gain a greater understanding of epigenetic effects in societies, we investigated DNA methylation in the termite <italic>Zootermopsis nevadensis</italic>. Termites are the most ancient social insects, and developmentally distinct from highly-studied, hymenopteran social insects. We used replicated bisulfite-sequencing to investigate patterns of DNA methylation in both sexes and among castes of <italic>Z. nevadensis.</italic> We discovered that <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> displayed some of the highest levels of DNA methylation found in insects. We also found strong differences in methylation between castes. Methylated genes tended to be uniformly and highly expressed demonstrating the antiquity of associations between intragenic methylation and gene expression. Differentially methylated genes were more likely to be alternatively spliced than not differentially methylated genes, and possessed considerable enrichment for development-associated functions. We further observed strong overrepresentation of multiple transcription factor binding sites and miRNA profiles associated with differential methylation, providing new insights into the possible function of DNA methylation. Overall, our results show that DNA methylation is widespread and associated with caste differences in termites. More generally, this study provides insights into the function of DNA methylation and the success of insect societies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Phenotypic plasticity is a highly important mechanism whereby a single genotype can produce multiple phenotypes based upon environmental variation. Social insects represent excellent models for studying phenotypic plasticity. In insect societies, individuals can develop distinct social phenotypes (castes), usually through the integration of information from the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Indeed, the production of castes is one of the major factors responsible for the ecological dominance of social insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity, such as that displayed in insect societies, requires epigenetic information. Epigenetic information is not coded in the standard complement of DNA bases but nevertheless results in heritable changes in gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. One important and widespread form of epigenetic information is the methylation of DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> which has been identified as a functional epigenetic mechanism in diverse eukaryotes including plants, animals, and fungi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Consequently, DNA methylation represents an extremely important form of epigenetic information across eukaryotic systems.</p><p>DNA methylation has been implicated as an important component of the determination of social insect caste<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Indeed, knockdown of the putative mediator of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (DNMT3) was shown to have a direct impact on the production of castes in the honey bee<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. DNA methylation has further been associated with alternative splicing differences between honey bee castes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, linked to modulation of context-dependent gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and found to display differences between castes in hymenopteran social insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>However, the function of DNA methylation in social insects remains controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Indeed, recent studies have questioned whether previously implemented statistical approaches robustly support meaningful differences in DNA methylation among social insect castes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus the questions of whether DNA methylation is associated with the generation of social phenotypes, and how such associations may vary among species, remain unclear. Notably, a major gap in our understanding of DNA methylation arises because almost all prior work on epigenetic effects in social insects has been conducted in the social Hymenoptera (ants, social bees, and social wasps)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Termites (epifamily Termitoidae) represent an entirely novel origin of sociality in insects, and are distinct from the Hymenoptera in many ways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Termites evolved from wood-dwelling roach-like ancestors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and separated from the hymenopteran social insects over 350 MYA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Termites also possess a hemimetabolous system of development, whereby juveniles become more and more adult-like at each of multiple molts. This differs greatly from the holometabolous hymenopteran insects where the final larval instar goes through metamorphosis during the pupal stage, resulting in drastic morphological changes ultimately leading to the adult form. Thus, the developmental program that underlies termite societies differs substantially from that found in social Hymenoptera. In lower termites, for example, workers are composed of multiple, developmentally progressive instars. Furthermore, final worker instars are poised to develop into either soldiers, winged reproductives, or neotenics, which are a specialized worker-derived reproductive form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Termite developmental plasticity is largely informed by hormonal (endogenous) and environmental (exogenous) cues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Moreover, termite castes are arguably more protean than those in the social Hymenoptera. Termites further differ from hymenopteran social insects in that both sexes are often represented in all castes in the colony (e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), allowing for an examination of caste differences whilst controlling for sex. Moreover, preliminary research indicates that termites possess a functional suite of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, as well as putatively high levels of DNA methylation in their genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, suggesting the possibility that DNA methylation may have important functions in termites. Thus, termites are an enticing system for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying caste differentiation and development, and provide an under-studied alternative to the hymenopteran social insects.</p><p>In order to gain a greater understanding of the function, evolution, and importance of epigenetic information in social insects, we investigated the distribution and levels of DNA methylation and gene expression in both sexes of the final larval instars (workers) and winged reproductives (alates) of the termite <italic>Zootermopsis nevadensis</italic>. This species is common in the cooler coastal and higher elevations of the western USA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. It belongs to the lower termites that live inside of wood and that do not forage outside. This type of social organization is associated with little or no brood care by workers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, workers of <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> frequently engage in anal feeding as part of their social interactions. Workers eventually develop into either alates, neotenic reproductives or the altruistic soldiers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Alates leave the colony, mate and found a new colony as a queen and king pair. When the queen or the king dies, they are replaced by neotenics that mate with their brothers or sisters. Older colonies of <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> therefore show different levels of inbreeding depending on the number of replacement reproductives. <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> thus represents an interesting termite system in which to study DNA methylation in the context of sociality.</p><p>Overall, we found that DNA methylation was considerably higher and targeted to more genes in termites than in any other social insects studied to date. Moreover, patterns and levels of DNA methylation were more similar to non-insect invertebrates than to other previously-analyzed holometabolous insects. We also found that termite morphs displayed many differences in DNA methylation, the great majority of which occurred between castes. Differential methylation was also related to alternative splicing, and showed enrichment for multiple regulatory sites. Thus, our results provide insight into the evolution and regulatory function of DNA methylation in insects and expand our understanding of DNA methylation&#8217;s link to phenotypic plasticity in insect societies.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Termite genes are highly methylated</title><p>We sequenced the methylomes and transcriptomes of male workers, female workers, male alates, and female alates (AM, AF, WM, WF) from a single <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> termite colony. Methylome sequencing was replicated twice, and transcriptome sequencing was replicated three times, for each sample type (8 total methylomes, 12 total transcriptomes). This provided four replicates for comparisons of DNA methylation between caste and four replicates for comparisons of DNA methylation between sexes. Methylomes and transcriptomes were derived from whole body minus guts. Methylome data were obtained from pooled individuals, whereas transcriptome data were obtained from individual termites.</p><p>We found exceptionally high levels of DNA methylation in termites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and S1). Over 12% of genomic CpGs and 58% of exonic CpGs were methylated when considering data pooled across all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). The average methylation fraction (percentage of methylation) across all exonic CpGs was 44.1%. In addition, over 70% of genes featured significant methylation targeted to one or more exons (77.6% of genes as exons&#8201;+&#8201;introns). Levels of DNA methylation showed good agreement with previously-published measures of CpG depletion (r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.635, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Among genes methylated in our pooled data, the majority (88.5%) were methylated in all samples, with only 5.1% methylated in less than half (4/8) of our samples. We also found that termites displayed considerable methylation throughout genes, with DNA methylation increasing from 5&#8242;&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;3&#8242; within the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a,c</xref> and S2). We further observed that regions downstream of methylated genes exhibited considerable methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a,c,d</xref> and S2,S3). This contrasts with the distribution of DNA methylation in hymenopteran insects, where DNA methylation is preferentially targeted near gene starts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>DNA methylation was targeted to both exons and introns in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, with considerable methylation in introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a,b</xref> and S1). Indeed, although a higher proportion of CpGs were methylated in exons, over twice as many mCGs existed within introns because introns are considerably larger than exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). However, the difference between exon and intron methylation was low when limited to exons for which data on both up- and down-stream introns were available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Overall, this result is in stark contrast to that seen in holometabolous insects, where exons show much higher levels of methylation than introns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>We found that methylated and unmethylated gene sets were enriched for particular functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7</xref>). Specifically, methylated genes were most highly enriched for functional terms related to fundamental cellular processes (e.g. ATP binding, DNA repair, histone modification), while unmethylated genes were associated with terms associated with more developmentally- or temporally-regulated genes linked to organismal development (e.g. odorant binding, development of primary sexual characteristics, <italic>Wnt</italic> signaling pathway). We found that the most highly methylated genes (top 3 DNA methylation deciles; 3,072 genes) showed functional enrichment of terms associated with more fundamental regulatory processes such as chromatin modification, protein binding, helicase activity, metabolic processes, and regulation of gene expression, while the most lowly methylated genes (bottom 3 DNA methylation deciles) were functionally enriched for more dynamic terms such as &#8220;signaling receptor activity&#8221;, transmembrane transport of various molecules, cell periphery, and circadian behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S8</xref>). These general associations are similar to those seen in other insects. Thus, despite the stark differences in levels and intragenic patterning of DNA methylation in termites and holometabolous insects, the types of genes targeted by DNA methylation are conserved across insects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Regions of vertebrate-like methylation within the <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genome</title><p>The majority of methylated CpGs in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> exhibited high levels of DNA methylation, with 87.5% of methylated CpGs possessing &gt;50% methylation fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). However, a minority of CpGs displayed low levels of methylation or were essentially unmethylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Similarly, genes tended to fall into two distinct classes, where some genes were essentially unmethylated and others were highly methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and S1).</p><p>We found that methylated genes tended to be clustered together within the <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genome, and were much more closely-spaced than unmethylated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1d</xref> and S3). Indeed, clusters of methylated genes resulted in large regions of highly-methylated CpGs, wherein regions up to hundreds of kilobases in size possessed high levels of DNA methylation at the majority of CpG sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1c,d</xref> and S3). Within such methylation &#8220;blocks&#8221; in termites, the great majority of unmethylated CpGs corresponded to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,f</xref>). Furthermore, due to the increased evolutionary mutability of methylated cytosines, within such regions, CpG densities were depleted everywhere but within gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This results in such regions showing intriguing similarities to patterns of methylation in vertebrates, where CpGs are methylated everywhere but within gene promoters.</p><p>We found that several classes of DNA repeats were methylated, as is the case in vertebrate systems. However, the interpretation of this finding in termites was complicated by the fact that many repeats fell within introns, which were often highly-methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>. We thus examined genic repeats (those intersecting exons or introns) and non-genic repeats separately. We found that, a low proportion of non-genic repeats showed at least some DNA methylation, which was higher within non-genic-repeat elements than in surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1g</xref> and S4). Interestingly, genic repeats intersecting exons appeared to have lower levels of methylation than the exon they fell within (Wilcoxon rank-sum pvalue: &lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). However, the majority of gene-intersecting repeats fell within introns, where repeats were more highly methylated than the containing intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1g</xref> and S4). Despite this, we found that for both methylated exons and introns, those containing repeats were, in general, less methylated than those without (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, some repeats did appear to be methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, although the level and prevalence of repeat methylation is lower than seen in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Conservation of methylation in orthologous genes of social insects</title><p>Unlike many insects examined to date, the <italic>majority</italic> of <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genes are methylated (74% methylated in at least one sample, 66% methylated in all 8 samples), and at higher levels (but see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Moreover, 12% of genomic CpGs and 58% of exonic CpGs were methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> (at least two samples; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). In contrast, only 1&#8211;2% of genomic CpGs are methylated in other social insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We thus contrasted DNA methylation in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, where ~75% of genes are methylated, with DNA methylation in hymenopteran social insects, where ~35% of genes are methylated (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>: 38.2% 4,946/12,961, <italic>C. floridanus</italic>: 35.7% 5,538/15,510).</p><p>Overall, we found that almost all genes that were methylated in the <italic>C. floridanus</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic> were also methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> (only 71 of 5,019 shared orthologs were methylated in ants and bees but not in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2c</xref> and S6). In contrast, there were many genes methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> that were unmethylated in <italic>C. floridanus</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (1027/5,019 shared orthologs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Genes methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, but not <italic>C. floridanus</italic> or <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, were highly enriched for terms relating to tissue- or temporal-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S9</xref>). This result is consistent with the fact that highly-methylated genes in the Hymenoptera are primarily ubiquitously-expressed housekeeping genes. Thus, for example, genes methylated only in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> showed greater than 10-fold enrichment for many terms, including rhythmic process, sensory perception of chemical stimulus, and growth factor activity (13.6, 14.8 and 22.16 fold enrichment, respectively). Moreover, despite the lineage specific methylation of these genes, their mean methylation level was considerable (median methylation fraction: 0.64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and reached methylation levels similar to other methylated genes in the <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA methylation is associated with gene expression</title><p>We found that levels of DNA methylation were positively associated with gene expression level (rho: 0.348, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.179, p: &lt;0.0001). However, genes of intermediate methylation level were the most highly, and ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Level of DNA methylation was also negatively correlated with expression variance between samples (rho: &#8722;0.356, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.155, p: &lt;0.0001) and within-morph replicate variation (CV; rho: &#8722;0.449, R<sup>2</sup>: 0.279, p: &lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus genes showing variation in expression across samples tended to show low levels of methylation.</p><p>In order to isolate the strongest predictors of DNA methylation in termites, we performed regression analysis between DNA methylation level and gene expression variables (i.e., gene expression level, coefficient of variation, specificity), as well as intergenic distance, average exon count and general measures of gene conservation. We also leveraged the stranded nature of our RNA-seq protocol to produce a measure of anti-sense expression, which was incorporated into our combined model.</p><p>We found the strongest predictors of levels of DNA methylation in the combined model framework were expression CV and between-sample expression difference, which were both strongly negatively associated with genic DNA methylation level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that the level of antisense gene expression was more strongly associated with DNA methylation level than gene expression level from the sense strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). This suggests that DNA methylation&#8217;s association with gene expression level and variation may be driven, at least in part, by an interaction between DNA methylation and intragenic antisense transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We next examined DNA methylation&#8217;s relationship with gene expression among recently-expanded gene families<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We found gene expression level and expression breadth were much more strongly associated with DNA methylation level among recently-duplicated genes with at least one methylated copy than among all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore, when considering only methylated genes, the relationship between DNA methylation level and gene expression variables was even stronger among methylated genes that were recently duplicated, despite the strong reduction in association when considering all (non-duplicated) methylated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Castes show strong differences in DNA methylation</title><p>Overall, we found that a very high proportion of genes possessed regions differentially methylated between phenotypes (castes or sexes). In total, 2,749 genes (of 10,974 tested genes) possessed significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs), defined as 200&#8201;bp windows showing significant differential methylation, between phenotypes. Interestingly, relatively few genes were differentially methylated between sexes (368 genes). Instead, the vast majority of differentially methylated genes (DMR-containing genes: DMGs) arose between the reproductive and worker castes (2,720 genes; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S5 and S7</xref>). Even more surprisingly, we found that the great majority of these caste-DMGs exhibited higher methylation in alates than workers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the great majority of significant differences in DNA methylation between phenotypes consisted of genes exhibiting higher methylation in the alate caste.</p><p>Recently, the importance of DNA methylation in the determination of caste has been called into question, with many early genome-wide studies of DNA methylation&#8217;s relation to caste differentiation being criticized for their lack of replication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In order to address this issue in our data, we compared the observed number of DMRs between castes and sexes to the number of DMRs observed when replicates were randomly shuffled. Our results from this analysis show that the number of observed differences in DNA methylation between castes was far higher than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>). On the other hand, the number of sex differences observed were only marginally higher than that expected by chance. Based upon these tests we find strong evidence for caste differential DNA methylation, further supporting its association with termite caste in our data.</p><p>DMGs were enriched for multiple functional categories related to development and environmental responsiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S11</xref>). For example, multiple development-associated terms showed greater than two-fold enrichment among DMGs (e.g. embryonic pattern specification, motor activity, regulation of Rho signal transduction; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S11</xref>). Moreover, several terms showed greater than five-fold enrichment among DMRs (double-stranded RNA binding, regulation of cell projection organization, and GTPase binding; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S11</xref>).</p><p>We observed that DMGs showed a signal of increased expression in the morph of hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9</xref>). However, this association was weak and not significant in every instance. Furthermore, DMGs were significantly less variably expressed between replicates of the same morph, and showed less <italic>absolute</italic> expression difference between morphs when compared to genes that were not differentially methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S10</xref>). We further observed that DMGs were more likely to be conserved across insects than methylated genes. DMGs were also less likely to be duplicated when compared to methylated genes that did not contain DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S10</xref>).</p><p>Notably, DMGs were more likely to feature at least one alternatively spliced variant than unmethylated genes or methylated genes without DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of genes significantly differentially spliced between caste or sex was significantly higher for genes containing caste- or sex-specific DMRs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). That is, differential methylation between phenotypes was associated with alternative splicing differences between the same phenotypes. We further found that DMRs were located significantly closer to differentially-spliced exons than nonDMRs within differentially spliced DMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Finally, we found that genes methylated only in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> and not in ants or bees showed higher overall levels of alternative splicing, when compared to genes methylated in all species. Indeed, DMGs methylated only in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> showed almost two-fold more alternative splicing than non-DMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

Importantly, our control sequences were centered on methylated cytosines that did not differ between phenotypes (non-DMCs), in order to control for composition biases associated with CpG-centered sequences and CpG depletion commonly found in methylated regions.</p><p>We found that DMCs exhibited significant enrichment for multiple TFBS motifs including those related to several key developmental TFs with existing orthologs in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>. While the majority of these TFBSs were enriched only among caste-specific DMCs, several TFBSs were enriched surrounding sex-specific DMCs.

The majority of identified motifs were long (&gt;15&#8201;bp) and exhibited considerable similarity to known <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S14</xref>). We thus utilized putative mature miRNA sequences from <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> to examine the enrichment of miRNAs surrounding DMCs.</p><p>We found that multiple miRNA-like sequence motifs were likely to be found within DMCs relative to control sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref> and S15). We found that, in the great majority of cases, only one of the two mature miRNAs produced from the putative associated miRNA hairpin showed significant overrepresentation among DMCs. For example, all 267 hits for the miRNA zne-mir-6012 were to the 5-prime mature miRNA, whereas there were no hits to the 3-prime miRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S15</xref>). miRNAs have classically been most strongly implicated in post-transcriptional silencing, through binding to 3&#8242;UTRs of mRNAs. Thus we examined the genic distribution of our miRNA-hitting DMCs, expecting many to fall within the putative 3&#8242;UTR of the target genes. Interestingly, we found that the majority of DMCs that featured at least one significant mature miRNA motif fell within exons or introns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S16</xref>; ~86%); only ~8.5% fell within 2&#8201;kb downstream of a given gene model. Thus, the majority of DMC-surrounding sequences that feature significant similarity to miRNAs fall within gene bodies and not 3&#8242;UTRs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest DNA methylation is targeted to many more <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genes than in the hymenopteran social insects.

The phylogenetic distribution of well-characterized DNA methylomes is highly biased to holometabolous insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and preliminary evidence in several hemimetabolous insects suggests that DNA methylation may exist at higher levels in hemimetabolous insects in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, the higher levels of methylation seen in termites may reflect an ancestral loss of DNA methylation in the Holometabola, and not an expansion of methylation in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>. Nevertheless, the strong functional enrichment of genes methylated only in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> suggests that genes methylated solely in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> show greater developmentally or temporally-regulated expression than genes methylated in both Hymenoptera and termites.</p><p>We also observed that methylated genes were often clustered together within the <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genome. These highly methylated regions were punctuated by unmethylated CpGs, which often corresponded to gene promoters, resulting in the emergence of CpG-enriched promoters, surrounding by CpG-depleted, highly-methylated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The lack of methylation of such promoters bears striking resemblance to the CpG islands seen in vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, raising the intriguing possibility that DNA methylation in termites provides a glimpse at an ancestral state in the evolution of vertebrate CpG islands.</p><p>DNA methylation was strongly and negatively associated with expression noise (between-replicate expression variance). Interestingly, previous studies, even in mammals, have observed a negative relationship between intragenic DNA methylation and gene expression noise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, suggesting a conserved function of DNA methylation may be to suppress transcriptional noise.</p><p>Strikingly, we found the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression level or breadth to be much stronger among gene families having undergone recent duplication. This suggests that DNA methylation may play a novel role in regulating the expression of recently-duplicated genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. These observations are in agreement with at least one study in honey bees where DNA methylation was observed to regulate the neofunctionalization of a duplicate gene, supporting a role for DNA methylation in contributing to functional diversification of duplicate genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Alternatively, in our data, DNA methylation may simply correlate better with gene expression within rapidly sub-functionalizing gene duplicates due to the duplicate&#8217;s rapid loss of function.</p><p>We compared replicated DNA methylation between males and females and between reproductive and worker termite castes. We found substantial differences in methylation between castes, and to a lesser degree sexes, demonstrating that developmental phenotypes of termites do display methylation differences. We assayed DNA methylation at the whole organism level. Therefore, the methylation differences we uncovered may reflect allometric variation between castes or sexes arising from whole body analyses. Thus further analyses of tissue-specific methylation would be of interest and help in ascertaining the exact tissues causing the differences between termite phenotypes. In addition, analyses of time matched samples would help isolate the effects of age on DNA methylation, which may also be a contributing factor to the methylation differences we observed. We also note that our analyses were centered on a single <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> colony. Thus further analyses of DNA methylation from more colonies would help determine if methylation differences are affected by genetic and environmental variation arising from colony differences.</p><p>Our finding of differential methylation between social insect phenotypes stands in contrast to recent studies that did not detect methylation differences between castes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, analyses of false discovery in our data strongly support the existence of methylation differences between termite castes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>). It is possible that the behavioral plasticity arising from individuals oscillating between reproductive and non-reproductive states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> may not be associated with DNA methylation differences. In contrast, the more permanent changes in phenotype observed here may be associated with methylation differences. That is, irreversible developmental canalization, as studied in this investigation, may be associated with methylation differences whereas reversible behavioral switching may not. More generally, the effects of DNA methylation on caste differentiation may differ among species. Regardless, it is clear that more careful analyses is required to determine if methylation differences actually do exist between social insect castes and if the observed levels of caste-biased methylation reflect differences between termites and hymenopteran social insects or are representative of adaptations in juveniles versus adults.</p><p>We found that the majority of differences in DNA methylation existed between castes, with far fewer existing between sexes. Both caste- and sex-specific differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were less variably expressed, but showed considerably higher levels of alternative splicing than non-DMGs. Importantly, we also found that both caste- and sex-DMGs exhibited higher proportions of <italic>differential</italic> splicing between castes and sexes, respectively. Notably, differences in DNA methylation in bees and ants have been linked to differences in alternative splicing, and it is hypothesized that this relationship may underlie DNA methylation&#8217;s impact on caste determination in social insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Thus, our results suggest that the connection between alternative splicing and differential methylation may be a broadly-conserved mechanism linking alternative phenotype to differential methylation in insects. The connection between alternative splicing and differential methylation may be stronger in termites than other insects, however, as we found that differential methylation was more strongly associated with alternative splicing in genes methylated in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> only but not Hymenoptera.</p><p>Gene body DNA methylation differences have been experimentally implicated in the regulation of differential splicing in mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In most cases, DNA methylation differences impact splicing through an alteration of a transcription factor&#8217;s (TF) binding accomplished either directly through methylation&#8217;s impact on TF binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> or by altering local chromatin resulting in changes to DNA accessibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Indeed, these same mechanisms are thought to underlie the observed strong negative association between mammalian promoter methylation and expression level of the associated locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, as methylated promoters are associated with a less accessible chromatin state and an inability to initiate transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Furthermore, at least one study has implicated DNA methylation in modulating context-dependent expression of target genes, possibly through an interaction with antisense transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that multiple transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs were associated with differential methylation in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic>, suggesting that methylation is linked to alterations in TF binding in termite genes. We further found that many of these binding sites exhibited enrichment in regions differentially methylated only between caste or sex. Notably, many of these enriched TFBSs were associated with developmental processes. Therefore, in termites, differential methylation is targeted to many regions potentially bound by important regulators of development. Thus DNA methylation may represent an important evolutionarily-conserved molecular mechanism that impacts developmentally-important TF binding.</p><p>Surprisingly, we also found multiple mature miRNA or miRNA-like sequences associated with differentially-methylated cytosines of the <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> genome. Although the canonical role of miRNAs is the regulation of translation, emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs can also impact the epigenome as well as the process of transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In addition, several components of the RNAi pathway have been shown to associate with euchromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in a smRNA-guided manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Thus, our results suggest DNA methylation may also play a role in altering the binding of regulatory RNAs in termites. This is bolstered by the observation that genes in differentially methylated regions that contain miRNA motifs were considerably enriched for multiple developmentally-associated functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S17</xref>). This further suggests that DNA methylation&#8217;s interaction with miRNA binding is functionally important to insect development. Typically, miRNA genes produce two complementary mature miRNA templates; however, for the majority of miRNAs, only one of these two templates is utilized by the components of the RNAi pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Thus, the fact that most of these focal miRNAs were only enriched for one of each pair of mature miRNAs supports the functional role of this association. Overall, the enrichment of specific regulatory motifs surrounding regions of differential methylation may reflect a major functional role for differential methylation in the phenotype-specific alteration of regulatory binding. This may, in fact, be one of the major ways in which DNA methylation impacts gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p><p>Many of the TF and miRNA motifs significantly associated with variation in termite methylation have developmental functions in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> For example, two of the top TFs (Eip74EF and forkhead), as well as one miRNA (miR-125), in this category are directly associated with the regulation of ecdysone in <italic>D. melanogater</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Ecdysone is an important molting regulatory hormone in insects and implicated in the regulation of caste in both hymenopteran social insects and termites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. It is possible that this enrichment of regulatory sites within DMRs is a novel (or expanded) association, and is related to the higher level of DNA methylation in termites. Indeed, a great many methylated or differentially-methylated CpGs are found within introns and other non-coding gene-proximal sequences in <italic>Z. nevadensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S6</xref>), which are generally unmethylated in other insects with DNA methylation. Although the observed relationship between DNA methylation and the putative motifs is suggestive of an important role for DNA methylation in gene regulation, it will be important to validate these results experimentally in order to determine if DNA methylation does, in fact, affect the action of TFs or miRNAs, particularly given the high level of divergence between termites and flies.</p><p>In conclusion, our study revealed that (i) levels of DNA methylation were much higher in termites than in the majority of other insects, (ii) DNA methylation was associated with gene expression, (iii) many significant differences in methylation existed between castes but few between sexes, (iv) caste and sex specific differentially-methylated genes showed higher levels of alternative splicing differences, and (v) regions surrounding differentially methylated cytosines were enriched for multiple regulatory motifs. Thus our study greatly increases the current knowledge of DNA methylation&#8217;s relationship to alternative phenotype across insects, and further provides a possible mechanism whereby DNA methylation may effect differential gene regulation in insects. Finally, our results highlight the general utility of termites as a developmental and evolutionary contrast to hymenopteran social insects, and illustrate termites as an excellent model for future molecular studies of epigenetic underwriting of insect caste and development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biological samples</title><p>A colony of <italic>Zootermopsis nevadensis nuttingi</italic> was collected in its entirety within a wood log from Pebble Beach near Monterey, California, United States in October 2013.
