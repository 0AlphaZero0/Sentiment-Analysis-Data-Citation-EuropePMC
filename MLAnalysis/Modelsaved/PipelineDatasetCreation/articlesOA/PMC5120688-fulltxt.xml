Due to their experimental simplicity and capacity to process large cohorts of samples, label-free quantification approaches are most frequently used. While data-dependent acquisition (DDA) selects precursor ions according to their abundances, data-independent acquisition (DIA) approaches implement a parallel fragmentation of all precursor ions, regardless of their intensity or other characteristics, thereby enabling to establish a complete record of the sample<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In recent years, several data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometric strategies including SWATH-MS<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra), HDMSE<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (high definition MSE), and AIF<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> (all-ion fragmentation) were established that circumvent some of the problems arising from data-dependent acquisition (DDA), such as stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, under-sampling<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and long instrument cycle times<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p id="P3">In addition to the mass spectrometric method applied, computational methods, e.g. for raw data processing, protein database searching, and statistical analysis of the quantitative data, critically impact the results of quantitative proteomics analyses. As such, evaluating the correctness and relative performance of these methods is essential<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Quantitative proteomics would greatly benefit from an objective comparative benchmarking of the performance and robustness of the various computational approaches and software solutions available or currently in development. Meaningful and unbiased comparisons of software tools and their appropriate use are challenging for a number of reasons<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>: methods and algorithms may be assessed by scientists lacking relevant expertise, the tested method may suffer from insufficient documentation, or the interpretation of the test results may be subjective<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. In addition, benchmarking requires high-quality standardized data sets, defined metrics and dedicated software to implement and analyze these metrics, not only to compare existing methods but also to evaluate potential improvements and pitfalls when new methods are developed.</p><p id="P4">To address these challenges, we developed a computational benchmarking framework for label-free quantitative proteomics, LFQbench, that analyzes and processes data acquired from hybrid proteome samples<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> containing several proteomes mixed in defined proportions. To demonstrate the approach, we applied LFQbench to evaluate the performance of the DIA approach SWATH-MS, which provides high-throughput, accurate quantification, and reproducible measurements within a single experimental setup<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. We centrally acquired high quality benchmarking data sets using different instrument platforms and acquisition modes, and focused our comparative analysis on five widely-used analysis tools for SWATH-MS data: four &#8216;peptide-centric&#8217; query<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> tools (OpenSWATH<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, SWATH2.0, Skyline<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, and Spectronaut<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and the &#8216;data-centric&#8217; approach DIA-Umpire<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. While the former use MS/MS libraries to extract groups of signals that reliably represent a specific peptide, followed by statistical methods to distinguish true from false matches<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, the latter assembles &#8220;pseudo&#8221; tandem MS spectra that can be identified and quantified with conventional database-searching and protein-inference tools without an assay library<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. All respective software developers participated in our study, ensuring an optimal analysis workflow and parameters for each SWATH software tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">As a benchmarking sample, two hybrid proteome samples consisting of tryptic digests of human, yeast and <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins were mixed in defined proportions<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) to yield expected peptide and protein ratios of 1:1 for human, 2:1 for yeast, and 1:4 for E.coli proteins if samples A and B are compared. This sample set is referred to as HYE124 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). While the absolute amounts of individual proteins are not known, these samples provide a defined ground truth for bioinformatics analysis, i.e., defined relative changes between samples, and a sufficiently large number of peptides to enable the in-depth evaluation of both precision and accuracy of relative label-free quantification<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. We analyzed HYE124 samples A &amp; B in technical triplicates on two different instrument platforms (TripleTOF 5600 and TripleTOF 6600) using two different SWATH-MS acquisition modes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), generating a total of four benchmark datasets. To individually address the effects of SWATH window number (32 vs. 64 windows) and window size (fixed vs. variable), we generated a second sample set with higher ratio differences (termed HYE110, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">online methods</xref>), which was analyzed in four different acquisition modes on the TripleTOF 6600 platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This allowed us to test the performance of the software tools on data generated using a variety of instruments and settings of different sensitivity and co-fragmentation frequency.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Data Evaluation Software: LFQbench</title><p id="P6">To standardize the complex evaluation process of label-free quantification performance and to make it transparent, we developed the LFQbench software tool. LFQbench is an R-package that implements automated calculation of metrics for precision (coefficients of variation of reported peptide and protein intensities between replicates) and accuracy (deviations from expected abundance ratios) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) of label-free quantification<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, as well as the performance in separating proteins ratios for the different species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) in hybrid proteome sample sets. LFQbench directly imports results from label-free quantification software tools, applies filter criteria defined by the software developers of our study and computes protein level quantification information. Next, LFQbench evaluates and graphically represents precision and accuracy of label-free quantification experiments based on hybrid proteome samples. This resource provides current and future software developers with a standardized set of reports on protein and peptide level that enable an in-depth performance evaluation of their software tools. LFQbench is fully compatible with data from hybrid proteome samples acquired on other instrument platforms<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> enabling the objective assessment of other variables, such as different acquisition schemes, or the comparison of different MS platforms. In addition, LFQbench provides a data simulator, which enables the users to visualize both an &#8220;ideal&#8221; dataset and the effects of commonly observed problems, e.g., incorrect background subtraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).

The latter provided between 15% and 137% more peptide identifications and between 14% and 102% more protein identifications in the HYE124 sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), largely due to its higher resolution chromatographic system. Next we analyzed the effect of SWATH window setups on quantification results. For the HYE124 sample, depending on MS instrument and software, the 64w setup provided between 9% and 54% higher numbers of peptide identifications and between 9% and 37% higher numbers of protein identifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) compared to the 32w setup. Additionally, the 64w setup resulted in approximately 2-fold higher median signal to noise ratio compared to the 32w setup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This is most likely due to a decrease in interferences derived from co-fragmentation of other precursors. The HYE110 sample was further acquired with two additional windows schemes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Again, we observed the highest median signal to noise ratio for the 64 variable window setup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Both the increase in the number of windows and the switch from fixed to variable windows, contributed to these effects to a similar extent. The variable (optimized) windows setups provided between 3% and 29% more peptide identifications and between 4% and 25% more protein identifications compared to fixed windows setups. 64 windows setups provided up to 32% more peptide identifications and up to 21% more protein identifications than 32 windows setups.</p><p id="P8">The results from the HYE124 dataset showed that the change of swath window size had the largest impact on the results of SWATH2.0 (49%-54% increase in peptides), while the instrument type had the largest effect on results provided by DIA-Umpire (99% - 137% increase). Generally, all tools benefitted more from changing instrument type than from changing window size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We observed a very high technical reproducibility of reported peptide intensities (R<sup>2</sup>:0.92-0.99 depending on software tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), and CVs below 14% in HYE124 sample) within each dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, CVs reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), and a good correlation (R<sup>2</sup>:0.78-0.91) between datasets for all library-based tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). For all subsequent analyses, we focused on the HYE124 dataset generated by the TripleTOF 6600 using 64 swath windows, which generated the highest number of identifications among the acquired datasets. Results from other settings are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8</xref>, and in ProteomeXchange repository.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Label-free quantification performance: First Iteration</title><p id="P9">We performed two analysis iterations to clearly illustrate the advantages of our benchmarking data set for the future development of software tools for label-free proteomics. In the first iteration, the developers analyzed the datasets with the latest publicly available version of each software tool, using optimized parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), and a retention time window width and m/z tolerance agreed on by the developers of library-based tools. We ran LFQbench on the data provided by the developers and sent them the results to identify pitfalls in the software workflows. Next, we initiated an open discussion among developers, who improved their tools by implementing solutions to issues uncovered in the first analysis step, which were then validated in a second iteration.</p><p id="P10">First, we analyzed the relative quantification accuracy of proteins quantified by either single or multiple peptides. Single hit proteins consistently showed a higher quantification variance than proteins defined by multiple peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, we required at least two peptides to report a valid quantification value of a protein. Additionally, we required a protein to be quantified in at least two replicates in one sample to reduce the number of false negative proteins (human proteins falsely reported to be exclusive for one of the samples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Analysis of results provided by the five software tools in their initial setting revealed both a similar dynamic range in intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>) and a similar performance in terms of quantification precision and accuracy for high abundance proteins. Across all software tools, protein ratios within the lowest intensity tertile displayed the highest variance (average standard deviation for <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins distribution = 0.68) and differed most from the expected values (average absolute difference for <italic>E. coli</italic> distribution = 0.51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Results improved with increasing peptide signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 11-13, and Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and the best results were obtained in the highest intensity tertile, as indicated by lowest variances (average standard deviation for E.Coli proteins distribution = 0.38) and deviations from the expected ratios (average absolute difference for E.Coli distribution = 0.06). We observed marked differences in the lower abundance range between the software tools as indicated by systematic deviations from the expected values for low intensity signals in OpenSWATH, Spectronaut, and Skyline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8</xref>). This indicated a potential issue with background subtraction leading to a systematic underestimation of abundance ratios for <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast proteins. The observed deviations of the lower abundant proteins impaired the correct separation of the human and yeast low abundance proteins, indicating that it would not be possible to faithfully determine 2-fold expression changes in the lower intensity range. Similar results were obtained on the peptide level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Of note, DIA-Umpire and SWATH 2.0 also directly reported quantification results at the protein level (&#8220;Built-in&#8221;). However, we found that the TOP3 based approach to infer protein level quantification used in this study generally resulted in lower variances and better quantification accuracy for both SWATH 2.0 and DIA-Umpire than the built-in methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). When evaluating the absolute quantification results provided by DIA-Umpire, we observed marked differences to values reported by the library-based tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>). The analysis of the fragments used for quantification revealed that fragment intensity rankings were different between DIA-Umpire and the library based tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 16</xref>), resulting in the selection of different fragments for quantification and thus explaining the observed differences.</p><p id="P11">Compared to DIA-Umpire, library-based software tools showed lower numbers of incomplete protein quantification cases (cases with at least one missing value among the six injections (three replicates of A and B samples) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>). In the case of SWATH 2.0, no incomplete cases were observed in the first iteration data, as cross-annotated signals are not required to match the retention time of their corresponding identified seeds, which may lead to false-positive cross-annotations skewing the quantification values.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Label-free quantification performance: Second Iteration</title><p id="P12">All improved software tools evaluated in the second iteration of the study showed improved precision and/or accuracy of quantification results on both peptide and protein levels compared to their first iteration results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8, Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For a detailed analysis of the improvements, we focused on the reported quantification ratios of <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins at the lowest intensity tertile as the precision and accuracy of quantification are strongly dependent on the signal intensity<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 E</xref>, other species and tertiles shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 11-13</xref>). OpenSWATH and Spectronaut improved quantification accuracy of the <italic>E. coli</italic> peptides and proteins due to an improved background subtraction. DIA-Umpire and SWATH 2.0 improved peptide quantification precision in all tertiles, as wrong quantification values were removed. Skyline generally improved peptide and protein quantification precision. Notably, all four independent datasets of HYE124 produced a very similar pattern of improvements in iteration 2, indicating that no overfitting was generated at the software tools improvement.</p><p id="P13">To validate the performance of the second iteration tools, we used them for the analysis of the HYE110 sample set, which provides more challenging ratios between the samples, as the signals are closer to the noise threshold in one of the samples. As expected, we observed that precision values of peptides and proteins of yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> were better in HYE124 due to the higher ratio differences in HYE110 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8</xref>). The higher ratio samples also produced more incomplete cases, i.e., proteins with fewer than six quantification values. For yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins, this rate increased to up to 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>). The higher number of incomplete cases also resulted in more human proteins falsely reported to be present exclusively in one of the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 10 and 18</xref>). Spectronaut and OpenSWATH produced the lowest numbers of false reports, followed by Skyline and SWATH2.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>), while DIA-Umpire reported the highest numbers. While cross-annotation of signals between runs may reduce this source of potentially false quantification results, stringent control is required, e.g. by retention time alignment, to avoid matching the wrong signals.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Integrated analysis of tools</title><p id="P14">In the HYE124 dataset, the library based tools identified in the iteration 2 between 35,489 and 42,517 peptides mapping to between 3,673 and 4,692 proteins. Notably, we observed an exceptional overlap between these tools, as 93% of all identified peptides and 95% of proteins were identified by at least three out of the four library-based tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 A</xref>). The overlap of all five tools was 22,407 peptides and 3,064 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>). On the peptide level, the results provided by the library-based tools covered 65% of the sequences provided by DIA-Umpire, which additionally identified 12,748 sequences not found by the library-based approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>), in part due to slightly different search parameters. Only 288 sequences of those identified exclusively by DIA-Umpire were present in the assay library and may potentially be false negative cases for the library-based workflow. Notably, the overlap on protein level was remarkably higher (86%), similarly to the typical overlap between different DDA search engines<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, indicating that DIA-Umpire may cover additional peptides not included in the assay library, e.g. singly charged peptide ions (726 peptides), which are usually not triggered for MS/MS in DDA experiments and thus not included in the consensus library. The number of peptides per protein was similar for all library-based tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 19</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Notably, most proteins exclusively reported by DIA-Umpire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>) were in the lower intensity range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 C</xref>) and identified by peptides, which were not included in the transition library used for this study. To exclude possible false positive identifications by DIA-Umpire, we reanalyzed the dataset using a dedicated library covering 6,826 of the 9,813 human peptides identified exclusively by DIA-Umpire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file</xref> DIAumpire_human_peptides_lib.txt). More than 99% of the 6,826 peptides in this library were detectable by at least two library-based tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 20</xref>), which picked the same respective peaks as DIA-Umpire in 98% of the cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 21</xref>). This orthogonally validated the peptides identified exclusively by DIA-Umpire and thereby confirmed that our initial library was not complete even as we generated the library from triplicate injections of the three species separately to reduce sample complexity.

Analyzing one of the injections, we found that all tools pick the same peak (based on retention time) in more than 98% of the cases. All library-based tools each had less than 0.3% of outliers, and DIA-Umpire has approximately 1%. This emphasizes the robustness of SWATH, as even orthogonal identification methods (library-based vs. pseudo-spectra database search) agree in about 99% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Peptide intensities reported by library-based tools show a very high correlation (R^2: 0.93 &#8211; 0.97). The observed differences between DIA-Umpire and any library-based tool (R^2: 0.73 &#8211; 0.75) in the first iteration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>) were reduced in the second iteration (R^2: 0.76 &#8211; 0.80) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These differences are likely due to the selection of different fragments used for quantification, as about 30% of the top two most intense fragments reported by DIA-Umpire were not included in the DDA library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 16</xref>). Since DIA-Umpire relies on correct matching of MS1 precursors with their fragments, even high intensity precursors may not be identified by DIA-Umpire due to interferences in the MS1 space (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 22</xref>). Notably, these differences did not negatively affect the relative quantification accuracy of DIA-Umpire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">We present a complete methodology to benchmark the robustness of proteomic label-free quantification workflows, based on high-complexity benchmarking samples and the LFQbench software.

In the second iteration, all software tools provided highly accurate relative label-free quantification results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and achieved a practically perfect separation of the human and yeast proteins (2-fold expression changes), even in the lowest intensity tertile. In the HYE124 dataset, SWATH-MS provided high precision and accuracy of label-free quantification, and allowed to reproducibly quantify close to 5,000 proteins in this highly complex sample set. This level of performance is similar to other label-free quantification approaches<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, and renders SWATH-MS a valid alternative to isotope-labeling based methods, as similar performance metrics can be achieved<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Future improvements in instrumentation regarding dynamic range, acquisition speed, and analyte separation (by higher resolution chromatography or the inclusion of ion mobility separation) are likely to further boost the performance of SWATH-MS workflows, but will also depend on the availability of deep coverage assay libraries<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.

In this study, we established an FDR threshold of 1% for all software tool reports (report files from each software tool were whether previously filtered - Spectronaut and DIA-Umpire, or filtered by FSWE &#8211; OpenSWATH, SWATH 2.0, and Skyline). In the case of SWATH 2.0, the iteration 2 has been performed by filtering results by FDR in FSWE, and thus the original file is the same for both iterations. In addition to the built-in protein quantification reported from DIA-Umpire and SWATH 2.0, provided peptide quantification data from each tool were used to quantify proteins using the TOP3<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> quantification model implemented in LFQbench and agreed among software developers in this work.

The scaling factors were applied to transform both corresponding peptide and protein quantification reports.</p><p id="P43">The software reports of each dataset (sample, instrument, swath windows setup) were processed separately.

If the standard deviation of a group of peaks was higher than 0.2 minutes, the reported peak (of one software tool) that deviated most from the average retention time was considered an outlier. To avoid ambiguous cases, in which more than one reported peak is deviated from the average, we removed from the standard deviation calculation the most deviated outlier, and checked if the new standard deviation was below the selected threshold (0.2 minutes).

First column must contain identification names of quantified proteins or peptides. One of the other columns must be named &#8220;species&#8221; and must contain the species names as plain text e.g. HUMAN, YEAST, ECOLI, PIG, etc. of the quantified protein or peptide. All other columns should contain quantitation readings in different experiment runs in the order of samples and in equal numbers of replicate experiments for each sample (e.g. A1, A2, &#8230;, An, B1, B2, &#8230;, Bn).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>File format conversion</title><p id="P53">The FSWE (Format SoftWare Exports) module homogenizes the results exports from different software tools, and applies a peptide-protein quantitation model. This module accepts plain text format reports in both long and wide formats, and it can be easily adapted for reading any kind of quantitation report provided in plain text format by all software tools. For each file format, the following parameters must be configured: value name for the quantitative value (<italic>quantitative.var</italic>), protein name (<italic>protein.var</italic>) (protein names must include a species tag), injection filename (<italic>filename.var</italic>), sequence including modifications (<italic>sequence.mod.var</italic>), precursor charge state (<italic>charge.var</italic>), string to report missing values (<italic>nastrings</italic>), the input format (<italic>input_format</italic>, options: &#8220;long&#8221;, &#8220;wide&#8221;). Additionally, Q-value column (<italic>qvalue.var</italic>) and a threshold (<italic>q_filter_threshold</italic>) may be reported for filtering by Q-values. LFQbench provides predefined settings for a set of software tools namely DIA-Umpire, OpenSWATH, SWATH 2.0 (PeakView), Skyline and Spectronaut including parameter schemas for the built-in protein quantitation in DIA-Umpire and SWATH 2.0. The interface function <italic>FSWE.addSoftwareConfiguration</italic> allows an easy definition of further parameter schemas if needed. The species tags, experiments, samples and injection names must be specified before converting software reports. The interface function <italic>FSWE.generateReports</italic> produces two output files for each software tool report: a peptide report and a protein report. The peptide report sums the quantitative values (<italic>quantitative.var</italic>) of the different precursor charge states (<italic>charge.var</italic>) reported for each peptide (<italic>sequence.mod.var</italic>). It converts reported modifications to the UniMod format, then it removes duplicated precursor extractions (based on <italic>sequence.mod.var</italic> and <italic>charge.var</italic>), it filters the data by a Q-value threshold (<italic>q_filter_threshold</italic>), and it removes precursors labeled as decoy (<italic>decoy.tag</italic>), and peptides shared between species. The protein report estimates a quantitation value for each protein group (<italic>protein.var</italic>) by using a TOP3 approach: the three most intense peptide quantitative values of each individual run are averaged (a minimum of two peptides is required). Produced peptide and protein reports can be directly used in the main LFQbench module. FSWE filters results at the protein level, only proteins having quantification values in at least two technical replicates in at least one of the samples are considered for further analysis. If a quantification value is absent in one or two technical replicates, LFQbench calculates the average of the reported values. If a quantification value is missing in all three replicates this leads to an invalid quantification ratio.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Intensity scaling</title><p id="P54">Software tools may report quantitation values in different ways. To enable a direct comparison between different software tools, peptide and protein reports can be scaled to a reference using the interface function FSWE.scaleIntensities. The function scales quantitation values of each input file in the specified folder by using a linear regression through the origin of the data within the 98th percentile of the peptide quantitation values of each software tool to the peptide quantitation values of the specified reference software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>LFQbench analysis</title><p id="P55">For the main analysis, LFQbench reads quantitative values from a valid input file, process them in multiple steps and produces a result set object which summarizes the input data and contains statistics and evaluation metrics based on the evaluated data. A first process checks input data validity (see Input data format section). The second step removes from the dataset quantitative amounts below a user-defined threshold. Next, missing value and identification statistics are calculated. At the next stage, peptides or protein amounts are optionally converted to relative values by transforming the original quantitative values to parts per million of the total amount in individual experiment runs. For the evaluation of technical reproducibility, LFQbench calculates dispersion of quantitative values as coefficients of variation for each identified peptide or protein among technical replicates of each sample. After assessing the technical variance, quantitative values in replicate runs are used to calculate sample average amounts for each peptide or protein. To generate a basis for the evaluation of the relative quantitation performance, logarithmic (log<sub>2</sub>) ratios of sample average amounts are calculated for each identification and each sample pair in the present dataset (e.g. log<sub>2</sub>(A/B)). LFQbench estimates the validity range of log-ratios as a maximum difference of a user controlled factor (default 5) times the standard deviation from the average log-ratio value for each species. Outlier log-ratios that are out of validity range are dropped and remaining log-ratios are shifted by the median log-ratio of the predefined background species to center the data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Finally, global and local metrics for the evaluation of precision and accuracy of quantification, and species separation ability are calculated and stored in the result set.

proteome-hybrid samples A and B were prepared containing known quantities of peptide digestions of human, yeast, and E.Coli organisms. The samples were analyzed in three technical replicates in SWATH-MS acquisition mode on two different MS instrument platforms (TripleTOF 5600 and TripleTOF 6600) with/using two different swath windows setups (32 fixed size windows and 64 variable size windows). This resulted in four benchmarking datasets. The datasets were analyzed in five software tools: OpenSWATH, SWATH 2.0, Skyline, Spectronaut, and DIA-Umpire. Benchmark analyses of each dataset and software tool were performed based on the output reports generated by the newly developed benchmarking software LFQbench.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="emss-69887-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Protein level LFQbench benchmark results.</title><p>After parameter optimization in a first iteration of analyses, intensities reported by each software tool were fitted to PeakView intensity scale using a linear model fixed in the origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 25</xref>). Intensities of multiply charged precursors were summed up, and averaged across all technical replicates of each sample. Protein quantities were estimated in each technical replicate by the average of the three most intense peptides reported for each protein. Single hit proteins (a single peptide detected in a protein) were discarded. In the present figure only data derived from TripleTOF 6600 with the 64 swath window setup are displayed. Corresponding data for the other instrument and acquisition setups are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>. (a) Log-transformed ratios (log2(A/B)) of proteins (human proteins in green, yeast proteins in orange, and E.Coli proteins in purple) were plotted for each benchmarked software tool over the log-transformed intensity of sample B for the first and second iteration (sample size n between 3,795 and 4,692 proteins). Dashed colored lines represent the expected log2(A/B) values for human, yeast, and E.Coli proteins. Black dashed lines represent the local trend along the x-axis of experimental log-transformed ratios of each population (human, yeast, and E.Coli).
