They can be found in various plants growing in the tropics, temperate regions and in boreal forests <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Endophytes are valuable as they produce a variety of bioactive compounds <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. They are also known to have biocontrol potential against several important plant pathogens <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, either by inducing plant defense mechanisms <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> or by promoting plant growth <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The presence of endophytic biocontrol agents (BCAs) in the plants is advantageous as endophytes are protected from adverse soil conditions <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Several studies have reported the successful use of endophytic BCAs, mainly on vegetable and fruit crops. Chinese cabbage seedlings treated with the endophyte <italic>Heteroconium chaetospira</italic> were resistant to the pathogen <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic>
<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Endophytes were also able to protect tomatoes <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, banana <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, barley and beans <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, against their respective pathogens. In addition, the presence of endophytes also improved plant growth. Improved vegetative growth was observed in maize, tobacco and parsley treated with endophytic <italic>Pirifomospora indica</italic>
<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as well as pigeon-peas and bananas treated with non-pathogenic <italic>Fusarium</italic> isolates <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Improved plant growth leads to robust plants which are less susceptible to pathogen infection. Endophytic BCAs have also been tested on oil palm to control <italic>Ganoderma boninense</italic> (Gb) and these include endophytic bacteria <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>
<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and species of the mycoparasitic <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Application of endophytic BCAs was however, less effective than chemicals in controlling diseases <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Several factors contribute to this, with nonconductive soil conditions (abiotic and biotic factors) as the primary cause of concern. Soil factors are hypothesized to have inhibited the growth of BCAs, leading to poor (or absence of) disease control by BCAs <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It was further explained that the survival of introduced BCAs may have been impeded by the intense competition by indigenous microbiota in the soil, or by the poor physicochemical soil conditions <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this study, we propose that the colonization behavior and proliferation potential of endophytes <italic>in planta</italic> may be a contributing factor influencing their subsequent biocontrol activity. The ability of endophytes to colonize plant tissues successfully is essential for controlling plant diseases and providing benefits to plants. Their ability to proliferate indicates how readily endophytes are able to adapt and grow inside the plants. This hypothesis is novel, and suggests that the manner endophytes colonize, grow and proliferate in host tissues is important to their subsequent effectiveness as BCAs. The colonization and proliferation potential of endophytes <italic>in planta</italic> could be determinative factors that subsequently impact disease suppression.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, the colonization and proliferation potential of endophytes was compared to the oil palm pathogen (<italic>Ganoderma boninense</italic>, Gb) and studied using a model host plant (oil palm). The endophytes (WAA02, T2, BTF08) selected were known BCAs that are antagonistic toward Gb <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cubense</italic> race 4 (FocR4) <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The colonization and proliferation potential of endophytes was compared to Gb as both endophytes and pathogen compete for similar niche. Gb is a pathogen rampant in the tropics, but the infection and colonization of oil palm by Gb are poorly understood <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Gb is known to be able to colonize young oil palm tissues, but only cause disease symptoms at a later growth stage, suggesting that Gb remained a successful colonizer of host tissues for a relatively long period of time <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this study, assessments were carried out using three approaches. Plating and PCR were first conducted to demonstrate that endophytes and pathogen are able to enter into plant tissues. PCR further identified the correct species of endophyte (and pathogen) present in the tissues. Growth of endophytes and pathogen was then assessed via ergosterol quantification assay. Ergosterol assay was adopted in this study as it has been widely used as an indicator to estimate fungal biomass in various environments such as air <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, food <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, leaf litter <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, mycorrhizal roots <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and soil <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Strong correlations between ergosterol content and fungal biomass revealed the specificity of ergosterol as indicator of fungi <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Ergosterol assay also detects presence of fungi in plant tissues effectively as ergosterol is present in fungal cell membranes while absent (or is a minor constituent of cell walls) in higher plants <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Ergosterol quantification is more useful than the direct microscopic count, fluorescence microscopy, leaf clearing or staining method, as these methods often lead to under- or over-estimation of fungal biomass due to conversion factors <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Ergosterol is also a better biomarker compared to chitin and ATP, due to its specific association with fungi <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Ergosterol assay has recently been used to detect Basal Stem Rot (BSR) disease caused by <italic>Ganoderma boninense</italic> in oil palm <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In short, this study attempts to understand the colonization behavior and proliferation potential of introduced endophytes <italic>in planta</italic>. This study is important as efficient colonization and proliferation potential may be a contributing factor to their subsequent biocontrol activity, leading to successful control of plant diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Fungal isolates</title><p>The endophytic isolates (WAA02, T2, BTF08) were isolated from stem tissues of <italic>Portulaca</italic> weed (WAA02) and <italic>Musa</italic> spp. (BTF08, T2) <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and have shown moderate antifungal activity toward <italic>G. boninense</italic> (Gb) with percentage of inhibition of radial growth of 39.64, 47.75 and 13.51%, respectively <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The pathogen <italic>Ganoderma boninense</italic> (Gb) was obtained from Professor Dr. Sariah Meon from University Putra Malaysia. All isolates were cultured and maintained on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) (Merck, New Jersey, USA) (incubated for 7 days, at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C). The endophytes WAA02, T2 and BTF08 were subjected to DNA sequencing and the sequences of these isolates were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Maryland, USA) database with the respective accession numbers assigned: <italic>Diaporthe phaseolorum</italic> (KT964567), <italic>Trichoderma asperellum</italic> (KT964564) and <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic> (KT964566). The standard curve for each isolate was constructed to determine the amount of fungal inoculum used to inoculate ramets in subsequent experiments <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The standard curve for each isolate was constructed using 14-day-old cultures cultivated in Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) (Merck, New Jersey, USA). Fungal mycelium was first established in PDB and incubated for 14&#160;days at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C, filtered, added into sterile distilled water (SDW), and homogenized into broth culture using a handheld LabGEN 125 homogenizer (Cole-Parmer, Illinois, USA). The broth culture was then diluted to 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12 and 0.1&#160;mL of the contents from each dilution was pipetted and plated on PDA plates (supplemented with 0.01&#160;g&#160;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of Rose Bengal (Acros Organics, Fisher Scientific, USA)). The absorbance reading for each dilution was also read at 600&#160;nm using TECAN&#174; Infinite M200 Multi Detection Microplate Reader Part (M&#228;nnedorf, Switzerland). The inoculated plates were incubated for 7&#160;days at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C. Colonies formed on the plates were then enumerated, and the absorbance values and colony forming units (cfu&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) were estimated from the standard curve. The inoculum for each isolate is adjusted to 6 log<sub>10</sub> cfu&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Colonization potential of endophytes and pathogen determined via plate assay and PCR detection</title><p>Tissue-cultured oil palm ramets were gratefully supplied by Applied Agricultural Resources (AAR) (Selangor, Malaysia). The ramets were of 13&#8211;15&#160;cm in height, and of 3&#8211;4 leaf stage. Ramets were transplanted into pots containing 1&#160;kg of sterilized soil mixture (2:1 ratio of black soil: burnt soil). Inoculation was performed separately by soil-drenching with 100&#160;mL of inoculum (6 log<sub>10</sub> cfu&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) according to the following treatments: W (+isolate WAA02), T (+isolate T2), B (+isolate BTF08), C (+control containing SDW and G (+pathogenic isolate Gb). A total of 12 ramets per treatment were prepared and at each sampling interval (day 1, 3, 5 and 7), 3 ramets were sampled (triplicates) per treatment for analysis. All ramets were incubated in semi-controlled conditions (shaded-greenhouse) for 7&#160;days with conditions of approximately 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C and a photoperiod of 12&#160;h.</p><p>On the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th days after inoculation, ramets were sampled and washed under running tap-water for 15&#160;min. The ramets were cut and divided into root, stem and leaf tissues. The leaf tissues were then cut into 1&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;1&#160;cm segments whereas the stem and root tissues were cut randomly to a length of 1&#160;cm each. The tissues were then subjected to triple sterilization, beginning with 40% household bleach for 5&#160;min and subsequently into 50, 70, 90 and 100% ethanol for 2&#160;min (each immersion). A quick rinse in sterilized distilled water was performed and repeated thrice prior to injuring (by making incisions to the surface of the tissues) the outer layer of the ramet tissues using sterilized scalpel <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Injured sites function as outlets for endophytes to grow out from the tissues. Each piece of the injured tissue segment was then placed on PDA supplemented with Rose Bengal (0.033&#160;g/L) (Acros Organics, Fisher Scientific, USA) and incubated at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C for 7&#8211;14&#160;days. Growth of fungal mycelium from injured sites indicated growth of endophytes. In addition, the remaining tissues from each part of the ramet were used for DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from 100&#160;mg of tissues collected from each ramet part (root, stem and leaf, respectively) using the GF-1 Plant DNA Extraction Kit-50 preps, as described by the manufacturer (Vivantis&#174;, California, USA). The genomic DNA was amplified using universal primers ITS1 (5&#8242;-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3&#8242;) and ITS4 (5&#8242;-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3&#8242;) under the following reaction conditions: amplification process was initiated by pre-heating of 1&#160;min at 95&#160;&#176;C, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 95&#160;&#176;C, 30&#160;s, annealing at 60&#160;&#176;C, 40&#160;s, extension at 72&#160;&#176;C, 90&#160;s and a final extension at 72&#160;&#176;C, 5&#160;min <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Subsequently, the PCR products were purified using the Wizard&#174; SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega&#174;, Wisconsin, USA) and outsourced to First Base&#174; Technologies (Malaysia) for sequencing. The sequence results were compared to the database from NCBI using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST.cgi" id="ir005">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST.cgi</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Correlation between ergosterol content and fungal mycelium biomass</title><p>This experiment determined the correlation between ergosterol content and fungal biomass, to reflect that ergosterol content could be used to estimate the fungal biomass (mycelium weight). To achieve this, isolates were inoculated into 200&#160;mL PDB (Merck, New Jersey, USA) and incubated in static batch culture manner for 14&#160;days at 28&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;&#176;C. After 14&#160;days, fungal mycelium was filtered with miracloth (Merck, New Jersey, USA), rinsed with sterile distilled water (SDW) and the mycelium was frozen overnight. The next day, frozen fungal mycelium was macerated in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar until fine powder was obtained. The powdered mycelium was weighed to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0&#160;g and each specific weight was then used for ergosterol detection using microwave-assisted extraction and subjected to High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis as described below.

Non-inoculated ramets served as control. There were 8 ramets assigned to each treatment where each ramet represented each harvest day. Three inoculated ramets were sampled per treatment as triplicates, at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 throughout the 49&#160;days incubation period. Whole ramet (approximately 1&#160;g&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1&#160;g) was sampled and macerated in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar, until fine powder was achieved. The powdered samples were then subjected to microwave-assisted extraction, followed by ergosterol quantification using HPLC. For microwave-assisted ergosterol extraction <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the powdered sample was transferred to a Pyrex test tube with a Teflon screw cap (16&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;150&#160;mm). Four mL of methanol (Merck, New Jersey, USA) and 1.0&#160;mL of 2&#160;M sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) were then added and the mixture heated with a conventional microwave (Panasonic, Osaka, Japan) at 70&#160;&#176;C for 15&#160;s. The mixture was then allowed to cool for 30&#160;s and neutralized with 2&#160;M hydrochloric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). The neutralized mixture was extracted three times with 2&#160;mL of HPLC grade pentane (Merck, New Jersey, USA). Pentane was then evaporated (via water bath at 35&#160;&#176;C, overnight) and the extracts dissolved in 500&#160;&#956;L methanol and filtered through a 0.22&#160;&#956;m PTFE membrane syringe filter (Fisher Scientific, New Hampshire, USA). The filtered samples were then quantified using HPLC with the following conditions: 100% HPLC grade methanol for mobile phase, a Chromolith 2.0&#160;&#956; C18 reverse-phase column (Merck, New Jersey, USA), flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.0&#160;mL&#160;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and the wavelength for the diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, California, USA) was 282&#160;nm. Injection volume was determined at 20&#160;&#956;L per sample and the average ergosterol retention time was approximately 5.1&#160;min <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Quantification of ergosterol was determined by comparing peak areas against pure ergosterol standard (&gt;95.0% HPLC pure) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) which was constructed with 25&#8211;300&#160;&#956;g pure ergosterol (standard calibration curve) for each run.

Nevertheless, these ergosterol levels showed no significant increase over time, suggesting that the endophytic isolates WAA02, T2, BTF08 and pathogenic isolate Gb were present in the seedlings but were not be able to proliferate inside the ramets (internal tissues). This was further concurred by the insignificant <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.150, 0.079, 0.545, and 0.734 obtained, respectively, using Tukey&#8217;s HSD test. Further data on N (sample size used to generate data at each time point), mean values, standard error and significance (<italic>P</italic> values) is presented in Supplementary Data. Ergosterol was absent in non-inoculated ramets (treatment C) throughout the 49&#160;days (data not shown).</p><p>For isolate WAA02, 2.26&#160;&#177;&#160;0.45&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> of ergosterol was detected after 49&#160;days incubation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This ergosterol concentration was equivalent to approximately 0.29&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06&#160;g of fungal mycelium, derived from the standard curve of HPLC responses (peak area) of mycelium weight (g) against concentration of ergosterol (&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). The ergosterol and biomass equivalent for WAA02 was significantly higher than most isolates, especially Gb. Proliferation potential of Gb was very poor in the plant tissues, evident by the significantly lower ergosterol content of 0.49&#160;&#177;&#160;0.16&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, in which an estimate of 0.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02&#160;g fungal biomass was obtained (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For isolates T2 and BTF08, their proliferation potential was similar, with ergosterol content of 1.09&#160;&#177;&#160;0.23&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 0.82&#160;&#177;&#160;0.44&#160;&#956;g&#160;mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in T2 and BTF08, equivalent to mycelium weight of 0.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.01&#160;g and 0.03&#160;&#177;&#160;0.01&#160;g, in 1&#160;g of ramets, respectively (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Although weekly observations revealed that the growth of endophytes <italic>in planta</italic> was gradual (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and with insignificant <italic>P</italic>-value ranged from 0.085 to 1.000 using Tukey&#8217;s HSD test, endophytes did remain <italic>in planta</italic> and may proliferate gradually. Further data on N (sample size used to generate data at each time point), mean values, standard error and significance (<italic>P</italic> values) are presented in Supplementary Data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Discussion</title><p>Isolates WAA02, T2, BTF08 and Gb were successfully reisolated from all plant tissues (roots, stems and leaves). This confirms the ability of introduced endophytes to colonize host plants effectively <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The DNA sequencing results further validated that isolates recovered from the plant tissue sections were indeed the introduced endophytes using BLAST. The plating and PCR analysis detected the presence of isolates in the plant tissues, but does not provide information on the biomass abundance <italic>in planta.</italic> This has to be determined via quantitative PCR (qPCR) or estimation based on ergosterol content. Nevertheless, PCR was able to determine the type of isolate colonizing the tissues and is a more reliable method compared to the time-consuming process of microscopic identification. Microscopic identification is also limited by the morphology of fruiting structures that are difficult to determine and distinguish <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Detection of ergosterol in plant tissues was relatively inconsistent. Ergosterol detected from the day of inoculation may be attributed to mycelium fragments that presumably entered the host tissues via the xylem tissues. The irregularities in ergosterol detection for some sampling points (e.g. on 28th, 35th and 42nd day) may be attributed to the possibility that the biomass in tissues may have been diluted when tissues without biomass were pooled for assay, and vice versa. As such, this may have contributed to the inconsistent levels of ergosterol. All been said, the levels were insignificantly different from one another. It was also unexpected that ergosterol concentrations did not increase significantly throughout the 49&#160;days incubation period for all inoculated seedlings. This contradicted to the study by Mohd As&#8217;wad et al. <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This suggested that all isolates did not proliferate significantly inside plant tissues. Our results were similar to other studies where fluctuations in ergosterol concentrations were observed throughout the experimental period <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. They associated fluctuations in ergosterol concentrations to fungal physiology inside plant tissues or the variation in number of viable and non-viable spores <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It was proposed that ergosterol degrades when spore state changes from viable to non-viable spores. We therefore, postulate that each of the ramets in our study may have different amount of viable and non-viable spores, resulting in inconsistent ergosterol concentrations. This observation also highlighted the fact that proliferation ability of endophytes may be one influential factor determining biocontrol efficiency of endophytes in the field. We suggest that to overcome this limitation and determine proliferation ability of these selected isolates, quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be used as gene copy per genome will not be varied and affected by environmental conditions.</p><p>The proliferation potential of isolate WAA02 was greater than BTF08, T2 and Gb as WAA02 is a fast-growing isolate, and produces abundant hypha for colonization. It is suggested that perhaps the abundance of hypha present may have led to higher ergosterol levels, as ergosterol is a primary sterol found in the cell membrane of fungi <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The cell membrane acts as a barrier between an organelle and its environment, and also serving as a matrix for the association of proteins with lipids <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It was therefore expected that ergosterol would be detected for all isolates in this study, and that the ergosterol levels can be used as a measure of the proliferation potential of endophytes <italic>in planta</italic>. This observation agrees with many studies <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but this is the first reporting for T2 (<italic>T. asperellum</italic>) and BTF08 (<italic>P. citrinum</italic>). On the contrary, the slow-growing nature of BTF08 and Gb may have resulted in poorer proliferation rate (lower ergosterol content). These isolates may not grow and proliferate as well as WAA02 <italic>in planta</italic>. The poor growth of Gb <italic>in planta</italic> suggested that endophytes could be introduced prior to contact with Gb, and Gb may be excluded via competitive exclusion for space and nutrients <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Results from the ergosterol and fungal biomass analysis, have also suggested that different fungal species may have different ergosterol concentrations due to their sporulation and mycelium structure. When analyzed using the same biomass (2&#160;g), various ergosterol concentrations were derived. This is presumably due to the nature of fungi, having both free and esterified forms of ergosterol, which varies in ratio among different fungal species <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The free-forms are localized in cell membranes, while the esters are found in cytosolic lipid particles <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Ratios of these two forms have been known to serve as indicators to differentiate fungal species <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Nevertheless, in this study, the ratios were not further analyzed and the total ergosterol concentration is used instead to estimate proliferation of fungal isolates <italic>in planta</italic>. Overall, ergosterol is well known to be common in fungi and the detection method of ergosterol is established. In this study, we also used ergosterol to study the progressive growth and possible proliferation of endophytes in plants throughout a 49&#160;day period, rather than to just quantify the amount of fungi in the samples. Thus, we present a new application of a well-established technique in this study. In future, proliferation ability of endophytes can be fully described using ergosterol assay and qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Colonization and proliferation potential of introduced endophytes and pathogen in a host plant (oil palm) was established via plate assay, PCR and ergosterol quantification. Endophytic isolates (WAA02, T2, BT0F8) were found to have similar colonization potential with pathogen, colonizing roots to leaves within 7&#160;days of inoculation. Isolate WAA02 has better proliferation potential due to the higher ergosterol concentration and fungal biomass recovered. The increase in ergosterol levels throughout 49&#160;days was however insignificant, suggesting that proliferation may be absent or may occur very slowly <italic>in planta</italic>. This study strongly suggests that the selected endophytes could colonize the host upon inoculation, but proliferation occurs at a slower rate. This supports the hypothesis that colonization and proliferation potential may influence the biocontrol expression of endophytic BCAs. Investigation on extent of colonization by endophytic isolates via quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and endophytic factors that influence colonization behavior can be conducted in future.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p>ASYT and SR conceived and designed this research project.
