Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between antimicrobial use and MDRO detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there are few data to support the concept that reducing antibiotic use actually leads to improvements in antibiotic susceptibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, antimicrobial stewardship was demonstrated to reduce MDRO and was strongly recommended in clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends that governments implement antimicrobial stewardship programs directed at containing antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, a considerable gap exists between theory and clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Antibiotic use is increasing even in some countries such as Norwegian with a low antibiotic resistance rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In China, the overuse of antibiotics is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance isolates is higher than that in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Data reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH) National Antimicrobial Resistance Investigation Net (Mohnarin) indicates that antimicrobial resistance is rising steadily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 2011, Chinese MOH established policies concerning the antimicrobial stewardship to improve the intelligent use of antibiotics. Most hospitals in China gradually implemented the policies. These policies included restricting the kinds of antibiotics, setting the targets for antibiotic prescription in hospitalized patient and prophylactic use of antibiotics in clean operations (Please see the detail of polices in methods of <italic>Antimicrobial stewardship</italic>). However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have shown whether the antimicrobial stewardship can reduce infection or colonization with MDRO in critically ill patients. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the role of the antimicrobial stewardship on the antimicrobial consumption and infection or colonization with MDRO in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The pre-post study was performed in the ICU of a university-affiliated hospital. The protocol was approved by Nanjing Zhongda Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee (Approval Number: 2011ZDLL012.0). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or next of kin. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02128399).</p><p>The study was divided into two periods according to the intervention of antibiotics management policy, which started in June 2011. Phase 1 was defined as one year before the intervention (from June 2010 to May 2011). Phase 2 was defined as one year after the intervention (from June 2012 to May 2013). During the two phases of the study, all patients hospitalized in the ICU and patients discharged from ICU before the end of the two studied phases were eligible to participate in the study. We only selected the data of patients for their first admission to ICU. Screening for MDRO was performed in our ICU as part of an infection control policy, and microbiological cultures of different specimens were performed according to clinical status. Bacterial cultures from na<bold>s</bold>al swabs, lower respiratory tract secretions and the infected area were performed at the time of ICU admission and discharge.</p><p>We performed the same policy of screen during the two study periods. We also had taken executive infection control measures during this pre-post study period in our hospital. All of the patients were treated by the attending physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Antimicrobial stewardship</title><p>According to the protocol of antibiotic administrative group, our hospital was directed to implement the protocol in June 2011. The policy included antibiotic procurement was restricted to 50 agents in our hospital from June 2011. Meanwhile, targets for antibiotic prescription are set at less than 60 and 20% of all prescriptions for hospitalized patients and outpatients, respectively. Prophylactic use of antibiotics in clean operations should be lowered to 30% of patients and reduced to less than 24&#160;h&#8217; duration; and antibiotic utilization in hospitalized patients should be less than 40 Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 100 patient; rationality of antibiotic use, which includes timing, duration and appropriate medications should be more than 90%. In our hospital, special antimicrobial agents, such as carbapenem, glycopeptide, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline, must be approved by a designated doctor of pharmacy; in particular case, such as during salvage, doctors are permitted to urgently use these special antimicrobial no more than one day. The trained pharmacists and infection preventionists were all part of the antimicrobial stewardship in our hospital. They were responsible for monitoring these medications, and every month, they announced the antimicrobial agents in every clinic and department. If the individual department did not reach the targets which mentioned, the director of the department would provide the reason and be warned by the hospital. If there was no desirable reason why they could not achieve the targets, the salary of all the staff of the department would be deducted. During the study period, we practiced infection control measures according to the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection and definitions</title><p>Beginning in June 2011, the management of antibacterial drugs in clinical applications was implemented in every department in our hospital.

We collected information about ICU patients&#8217; microbiological culture results and antibiotic consumption between June 2010 and the end of May 2011. The antibiotic consumption data were obtained from the hospital computer center database.</p><p>We used the Defined Daily Dose DDD per 100 occupied bed-days to indicate antibiotic consumption in our hospital and every department.

We use laboratory tests to determine these MDRO. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) method was used to determine the bacterial drug resistance. MRSA was defined as Staphylococcus aureus resistant to oxacillin and VRE was defined as enterococci resistant to vancomycin.

We found that the incidence of VAP was significantly decreased after the intervention. However, the incidence of CRBSI and CAUTI did not change after the antimicrobial stewardship (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Infection with MDRO is frequently observed during clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], especially in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Preventing infection with MDRO is very important to our clinic workers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study concerning the effect of the antimicrobial stewardship program of Chinese MOH on colonized or infected with MDRO in critically ill patients. In the present study, we found that DDD in the hospital and in most departments decreased significantly after the implementation of the antimicrobial stewardship.</p><p>Consequently, the MDRO isolation in critically ill patients correspondingly decreased when they admitted into ICU. However, we found a low relationship between DDD in the ICU and increased MDRO rate from ICU admission to discharge. Moreover, we did not find a positive relationship between DDD in the ICU and MRDO at ICU or between the DDD of carbapenem and carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p><p>Antimicrobial stewardship can reduce the DDD in the entire hospital and in the majority of the departments. After the intervention, we found that the rational use of antibiotics had improved. In the preventative use of antibiotics in clean operation, for example, the percentage decreased from nearly 100 to 35%, which was in line with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, the DDD was decreased significantly from 96 to 65 in our hospital and was decreased in most departments (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Our results confirmed the previous results in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, our DDD is still higher than the standard claimed by the policy. Therefore, we should conscientiously execute this policy to improve antibiotic use.</p><p>Antimicrobial stewardship can help to decrease the MDRO isolation in critically ill patients. Along with the decrease in antimicrobial consumption in our study, the proportion of colonization or infection with MDRO in critically ill patients decreased significantly to 13%. Furthermore, we found a good positive correlation between antibiotic consumption and MDRO in our hospital (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated the association between antimicrobial use and MDRO detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Bassetti et al. found a significant correlation between antibiotic consumption and increased resistance for <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A recent study in China demonstrated that increased consumption of carbapenem may contribute to the development of resistance in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> to imipenem, meropenem, and other antimicrobials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, Most previous studies were demonstrated that with the increased consumption of antimicrobials, the MDRO increased correspondingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There was only the some correlation between MDRO and antimicrobial consumption. Whether the decrease antimicrobial consumption could reduce the MDRO was not very clear. Interestingly, we found that the proportion of patients colonized or infected with MDRO decreased along with reduced consumption of antibiotics.</p><p>In some departments, such as the thoracic surgery department, the DDD did not decrease; however, the MDRO isolation rates in this department decreased significantly in critically ill patients. Several reasons may explain this decrease. First, DDD did not equal to rational application of antimicrobials. Moreover, the sample from such departments was small and could not achieve significance. Finally, MDRO are easily transmitted from patient to patient through hand contact with doctors, nurses and hospital workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Additionally, critically ill patients were transferred several times to different departments before being initially admitted into the ICU. Therefore, the incidence of MDRO isolates in patients from different departments and throughout the hospital decreased, although DDD did not decrease.</p><p>Carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is a serious problem in the clinic, especially in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although the DDD of carbapenem did not decrease in the entire hospital and in the ICU, the carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates decreased both at the time of ICU admission and at ICU discharge. Moreover, we did not find a good relationship between carbapenem consumption and carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Because previous studies have examined whether carbapenem restriction can reduce the rates of carbapenem-resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and have had inconsistent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], further explorations are warranted to confirm these results.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, this study was performed in a single center. Because drug resistance rates vary among hospitals and units, the results may not be representative and reproducible in other institutions. However, in one hand, antibiotic overuse is common in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and antimicrobial stewardship can improve the use of antibiotics. In another hand, the results of antimicrobial consumption in our study was in line with previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the rational use of antibiotics could prevent antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that our study can benefit other hospitals.</p><p>Second, we did not analyze the individual risk factors for colonization or infection with resistant microorganisms. Factors that would affect the MDRO isolation, such as hand hygiene, isolating the high-risk patients, and taking precautions, were not analyzed. However, during this pre-post study period in our hospital, we had taken executive infection control measures. We found that the compliance of hand hygiene did not significantly change in our department. Therefore, we believe that the decrease of DDD is an important factor for reducing the rate of MDRO. We also plan to investigate and analyze the risk factors concerning infection and MDRO.</p><p>Third, we did not screen the MDRO since rectal swabs, and the proportion of undetected MDRO colonizations could consequently be high. However, the policy of screen was the same during the two periods, therefore, it will not be influence our results hugely.</p><p>Finally, our study did not address the issue of antibiotic use and resistance in the community. The consumption of antimicrobials in agricultural industry may also promote antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the MDRO isolation of patients who arrived from emergency department also decreased from 40 to 18% and may not affect our results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study has demonstrated that the antibacterial drug clinical application management established by China&#8217;s Ministry of Public Health can improve the rational use of antibiotics and reduce the antibiotic consumption. Consequently, with the decrease of DDD in the hospital, the proportion of colonization or infection with MDRO correspondingly decreased. There was a significant positive relationship between the proportion of all critically ill patients colonized or infected with MDRO at the time of ICU admission and the DDD of the all hospital. However, this relationship did not exist in the local department or DDD of the individual medication.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p>
