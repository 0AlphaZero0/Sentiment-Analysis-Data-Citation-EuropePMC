Comprehensive studies detailing the regulatory role of TFs during this reprogramming process could help increase its efficiency. This study aimed to find the TFs with the greatest influences on the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts, and to further understand their roles in the regulation of the gene expression program. Here, we used systems biology approaches to analyze high quality expression data sets in combination with TF-binding sites data and protein-protein interactions data during the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to iHeps. Our results revealed two main patterns for differentially expressed genes (DEGs): up-regulated genes were categorized as hepatic-specific pattern, and down-regulated genes were categorized as mesoderm- and fibroblast-specific pattern. Interestingly, hepatic-specific genes co-expressed and were regulated by hepatic-specific TFs, specifically <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. Conversely, the mesoderm- and fibroblast-specific pattern was mainly silenced by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) members, including <italic>Suz12</italic>, <italic>Mtf2</italic>, <italic>Ezh2</italic>, and <italic>Jarid2</italic>. Independent analysis of both the gene and core regulatory network of DE-TFs showed significant roles for <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, and PRC2 members in the regulation of the gene expression program and in biological processes during the direct conversion process. Altogether, using systems biology approaches, we clarified the role of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> as hepatic-specific TFs, and for the first time, introduced the PRC2 complex as the main regulator that favors the direct reprogramming process in cooperation with hepatic-specific factors.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research did not receive any external funding and was conducted using the authors&#8217; personal money.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

Every year, the number of required livers for transplantation exceed the number of donors [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The limit in the number of liver donors, high cost, and rejection of transplanted tissue require alternative strategies for tackling liver diseases [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, cellular differentiation and direct reprogramming are two alternative strategies for the generation of hepatocytes. The differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a multi-stage process that provides an unlimited number of hepatocytes, but poses risks for tumorigenesis, due to the possibility of residual undifferentiated cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other hand, the direct induction of somatic cells to a hepatic fate is a single step strategy for the generation of mature cells without tumorigenesis risks. Direct reprogramming is also faster and safer in comparison with the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Collectively, two approaches have been used to directly reprogram somatic cell identity. The first approach uses Yamanaka factors, Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2, Myc, and Klf4, beside additional factors that support direct conversion. The second approach involves applying a list of lineage specific transcription factors (TFs) and systematically eliminating unnecessary factors in order to achieve the most efficient combination. Several groups have used these approaches to generate different cell types, including neuronal cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], neural stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], cardiomyocytes [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In relation to the liver, Sekiya &amp; Suzuki (2011) have used the lineage-specific factor Hnf4a in combination with one of Foxa1, Foxa2, or Foxa3 to generate functional induced hepatocytes (iHeps) [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Lim et al (2016) used a combination of Klf4 and Myc as their Yamanaka TFs along with Hnf4a as their hepatic-specific factor to drive the direct conversion of fibroblasts into iHeps. This group was also able to obtain iHeps from fibroblasts by combining small molecules with Hnf4a [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Despite the extensive use of TFs for the generation of hepatocyte-like cells through direct reprogramming, the molecular mechanisms by which different TFs regulate the gene expression program have not been well understood.</p><p>The recent trend of generating large amounts of high quality expression data sets through high throughput technologies allows the unique opportunity to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation by analyzing the data using systems biology and bioinformatics approaches. Computational approaches are applicable to find the main regulators of gene expression and to dissect their behavior in different cellular transitions, including during differentiation, reprogramming, and direct reprogramming [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previously, several strategies have been suggested to predict the TFs involved in developmental processes. For example, CellNet has been used to compare the expression profile of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> counterparts of the same cell, in order to predict TFs that can potentially increase the efficiency of differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Also, D&#8217;Alessio et al. (2015) has proposed a systematic approach for finding cell identity regulators for a wide range of cells through the comparison of gene expression profiles [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another current strategy is through the use of Mogrify, which introduced a computational framework for predicting TFs for 173 cell types and 134 tissues [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our approach, besides predicting the TFs involved during differentiation, reprogramming, and direct reprogramming, we are also able to analyze their mechanisms during the regulation of the gene expression program and in their biological processes, and to rank their significance based on different computational factors [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In spite of the availability of such powerful strategies for predicting and dissecting the role of TFs during developmental processes as well as the availability of experimentally-obtained highly qualified expression data sets from the induction of fibroblast cells to cells of a hepatic fate, there has not been a comprehensive study performed on the regulation of gene expression during the direct conversion of fibroblasts into iHeps.</p><p>In this study, we established and investigated the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying the induction of hepatic fate from fibroblasts. Collectively, we used eight independent comparisons from six high quality expression data sets to understand the role of TFs in regulating the gene expression program and in biological processes duing the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts. Our results show two distinct patterns in the regulation of gene expression program: up-regulated genes were categorized as hepatic-specific genes and down-regulated genes were categorized as mesoderm- and fibroblast-specific genes. Interestingly, the hepatic-specific gene expression pattern was co-expressed and regulated by hepatic-lineage TFs, especially <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. Furthermore, the mesoderm and fibroblast gene expression pattern were mainly regulated by PRC2 members, including <italic>Suz12</italic>, <italic>Mtf2</italic>, <italic>Ezh2</italic>, and <italic>Jarid2</italic>. In summary, for the first time, we clarify the role of hepatic-lineage factors in the regulation of the gene expression program and introduce the PRC2 complex as a significant player during the direct conversion of fibroblasts into iHeps. We believe that our results improve our understanding on the regulation of the gene expression program that occurs duing the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts, and that these results will be useful for achieving a higher efficiency of this direct reprogramming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After careful literature mining for available expression data sets regarding the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from fibroblast, we chose six independent data sets. Data sets with accession numbers GSE29725, GSE23635, GSE67362, GSE52566, GSE48486, and GSE54066 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for analysis of gene expression regulation during induction of hepatic fate from fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>](<xref rid="pone.0167081.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For each data set, comparisons between samples were defined and then normalized data were loaded into Flexarray software in order to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their GEO platforms were downloaded for annotations [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To find DEGs, the fold change algorithm was applied for each data set and <italic>p-values</italic> were computed for the list of all genes in each data set, with <italic>p-value</italic> &lt;0.05 set as the filter. Finally, the lists of DEGs from all data sets were combined to identify common DEGs across all datasets. An additional criterion for considering a gene a DEG was that the gene needed to be present in at least four independent data sets. The human microarray data set with accession number GSE54066 was analyzed separately and was used to compare between human and mouse organisms. For transcription factors (TFs), because low level changes in their expressions can lead to dramatic alterations in the gene expression program, we set different criteria for TFs to be considered differentially expressed TFs (DE-TFs). We set a value of 1.5 fold changes or more for TFs to be considered DE-TFs. Furthermore, DE-TFs should also show the same pattern in at least three independent comparisons from the merged data sets.</p><fig id="pone.0167081.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0167081.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of analysis expression data sets for direct conversion of fibroblasts into iHeps.</title><p>Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified across different data sets.

This data can be used to identify DEG regulators. For example, ChEA deposits the data of binding sites for 234 TFs obtained from 274 publications, which taken together contains 564,752 regulatory interactions for TFs [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This database is mainly composed of TF binding sites obtained from ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, ChIP-PET, and DamID techniques.

Furthermore, another level of filtering was done by applying expression data on genes to select those genes that have expression fold change of 1.5. The TFs meeting these criteria were then considered to be differentially expressed TFs (DE-TFs). To provide a more accurate, informative, and comprehensive analysis, apart from regulatory interactions which exist between protein and DNA, we needed the interactions which exist between TFs themselves in order to construct TF protein-protein interaction networks. In this regard, we used the BioGRID database, which contains experimentally validated protein-protein interactions data (796,767 interactions from more than 50,000 published studies) [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and also a STRING database which bears both validated and predicted protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To increase the confidence of obtained interactions from the STRING database, we set a confidence score of 0.7 (high confidence). For both of these databases, downloaded interactions were filtered with the expression data to find and use only meaningful interactions. Protein-protein interactions were loaded into Cytoscape software to construct and visualize the protein-protein interaction networks.</p><p>To construct the gene regulatory network (GRN) and the protein-protein interaction network for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into iHeps, we integrated TF binding sites, protein-protein interactions, and the gene expression data into the Cytoscape software.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Ontology analysis of DEGs and constructed networks</title><p>To assign the function of DEGs and the constructed GRN to defined categories in the form of the most affected biological function, we used we used the ClueGO and CluePedia Apps [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] for the Cytoscape software [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

In this regard, apart from ontology analysis of the GRN, we applied centrality analysis to identify the most central genes of the constructed network. Degree is the simplest centrality index that calculates the number of direct neighbors of each gene which can be categorized into two indexes. The first one is out-degree, which are interactions that each gene makes with its neighbor, and the second one is in-degree which are interactions that each gene receives from other ones. We used out-degree to find the most central regulators of the GRN.

These data sets were generated from different labs using different strategies and different combinations of iHep-driving factors, including using episomal and viral vectors or using small molecules in combination with transcription factors (TFs). This analysis of different independent data sets leads to more reliable insights into the regulation of the gene expression program during the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts. Here, we identify the main affected biological processes and their regulators during direct conversion. In addition, we construct a core gene regulatory network (GRN) for the main regulators in order to understand their cross talk during the generation of hepatocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Regulation of the gene expression program</title><p>We used seven independent comparisons for mouse organisms to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are commonly affected during the induction of fibroblasts to a hepatocyte-like fate across all samples. To call affected genes DEGs, they should show significant expression changes in at least four of the seven comparisons. In addition, they should also have the same pattern in at least four comparisons. Based on these criteria, we found 671 DEGs during the direct conversion process, in which 247 were up-regulated and 424 were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167081.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Ontology analysis of up-regulated genes clearly revealed liver-related processes and functions, including epithelial cell differentiation, organic hydroxy compound metabolic process, regulation of protein secretion, protein localization to membrane, steroid metabolic process, and alcohol metabolic process. On the other hand, for down-regulated genes, we found fibroblast specific processes ranked as the most significant processes, including regulation of locomotion, cell migration, regulation of cell motility, anatomical structure morphogenesis, regulation of cellular component movement, and extracellular matrix organization. Therefore, during the induction of iHeps from fibroblasts, common DEGs generally appear to fit into two categories; either hepatic-specific functions or fibroblast-specific functions. Furthermore, it appears that hepatic-specific processes are significantly up-regulated, whereas fibroblast-specific functions are down-regulated.</p><p>To gain more insight into the regulation of the gene expression program during the induction of fibroblasts to iHeps, we looked for TFs involved in the regulation of DEGs and in the most affected biological processes. Collectively, we found 41 differentially expressed TFs (DE-TFs) to be involved in the regulation of DEGs during the induction of hepatocyte-like fate from fibroblasts. Besides constructing this more accurate gene regulatory network for direct conversion, we also analyzed the expression of hepatic-specific factors in the ChEA database, which did not contain ChIP experiments for mice, but did contain the data for humans. To this aim, we found human ChIP experiments for these factors and analyzed the correlation of their targets in both humans and mice. Finally, we found two TFs, <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>, for which their expressions significantly changed during direct reprogramming in both mice and humans. The expression of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> targets were also compared in mice and humans, and interestingly, their target genes showed a significant correlation between the two organisms. For both <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>, 78 percent of their target genes showed full correlation between both organisms. We added <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic> and their target genes to our data in order to construct a more accurate and complete gene regulatory network. In contrast to DEGs, the expression of most DE-TFs increased, so that, 28 out of 43 TFs were up-regulated whereas 15 of 43 were down-regulated.</p><p>A gene regulatory network was constructed to obtain more data regarding the accurate role of each DE-TF in the regulation of the gene expression program. Centrality analysis using degree index was applied on the constructed network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Interestingly, top regulators could be categorized into two subsets.

In addition to finding the main TFs involved in regulation of gene expression, we found the most regulated genes. These genes were involved in different biological terms, including metabolic process, cellular senescence, and heart development. For example, Nuak1, a regulator of cellular senescence for which its down-regulation extends the replicative time of fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], was found to be heavily regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0167081.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0167081.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Centrality and protein complexes during induction of hepatic fate from fibroblasts.</title><p>(A) Out-degree analysis was used to find the main regulators of the constructed GRN (B) and in-degree analysis was applied to identify the most regulated genes.

Our analysis revealed a single significant protein complex which contained PRC2 members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). On the other hand, analysis of protein-protein interaction network constructed using both predicted and validated interactions revealed one protein complex which contained HNF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

In addition, we found the regulators of DEGs and the biological processes in which they are involved in.

In addition, up-regulated targets of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> were analyzed and showed significant enrichment of hepatocyte functions, specifically metabolic processes, for example in: regulation of fatty acid process, digestive system process, and cellular metabolic processes or other aspects known to be important for hepatocyte biology, like heterotypic cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Collectively, these results indicate that <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> show notable common target genes for which a large portion of these target genes are up-regulated and that these up-regulated genes have considerable roles in hepatic-specific functions.</p><p>In addition to <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>, the role of PRC2 during the regulation of the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts was analyzed. PRC2 and its core catalytic enzyme, <italic>Ezh2</italic>, play significant roles during development through the silencing of gene expression by methylation of H3K27. Here, we found common target genes for all four identified members, including <italic>Suz12</italic>, <italic>Mtf2</italic>, <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Jarid2</italic>. From 68 of the common targets of PRC2 during the induction of hepatic fate, only ten of them were up-regulated and 58 of them were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Therefore, these results show that PRC2 is mainly involved in the down-regulation of the gene expression program. Ontology analysis reveals that most of the down-regulated genes are related to mesodermal development, for example: skeletal system morphogenesis, and metanephros development. Therefore, it seems that PRC2, through the down-regulation of genes involved in mesoderm development, prepare cells for their transformation into endodermal hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p>Apart from <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic> and PRC2 members, we sought to identify enrichment of other main regulators, including <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, and <italic>Ep300</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167081.s002">S2 Table</xref>).

In addition, we found these factors to be the main regulators of DEGs in the GRN and of DE-TFs in the core regulatory network. Despite the fact that Hnf4a and Foxa2 have been used in many studies for the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], their exact roles in regulating the gene expression program are still not very well understood. In contrast to direct reprogramming, the roles of these factors in the regulation of gene expression program and cell fate decision have been studied comprehensively during development and differentiation.</p><p>Previously, the FoxA family of TFs was identified to be involved in the regulation of hepatic specification and differentiation. During gastrulation, Foxa2 was found to be expressed in the anterior primitive streak, which subsequently generates definitive endoderm and where Foxa2 expression remains high [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition to the anterior primitive streak and the definitive endoderm, this factor is expressed in the notochord and the mesoderm during development [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our results confirmed the importance of Foxa2 in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In addition, polarity and proper cellular junctions are abolished in endodermal cells that carry the mutant Foxa2 gene [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Foxa2 is also involved in the establishment of epithelial fate while also inhibiting mesenchymal fate [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Studies show that in mouse embryo, deficiency for both FoxA1 and FoxA2 severely abolished the expression of the Afp gene, which in turn diminished the capacity of the endoderm to respond properly to extracellular signals and subsequently induced hepatic specification [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Foxa1 and Foxa2 are known as pioneer transcription factor during the specification of hepatocyte because of their ability to displace the repressive histone linker H1 and expose DNA to other TFs to initiate the expression program toward a hepatocyte fate [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>A significant and central role of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4A) had been found to be in the regulation of all functional characteristics of human hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which we also obtained through our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In humans, HNF4A clearly plays a role in the hepatic specification of definitive endoderm cells during differentiation. Using shRNA, DeLaForest et al (2011) diminished HNF4A expression, which subsequently disrupted many functions related to hepatocytes, including lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, carbohydrate metabolism, and molecular transport [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Interestingly, these processes were also identified in our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167081.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Furthermore, HNFA4 was previously found to play a role in the regulation of amino acid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and steroid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which we also saw in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167081.s003">S3 Table</xref>).

HNF4A has previously been shown to regulate the expression of genes related to all kinds of cell junctions and adhesion, including tight junctions, adherence junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions, through its binding to 29 promoters of 16 genes during the differentiation of PSCs into hepatocyte like cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A previous study has revealed the role HNF4A in stabilizing the complex network of TFs in hepatocyte cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], a fact also seen in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In addition, ChIP-chip studies in adult liver cells revealed that this factor was involved in the regulation of its own promoter in addition to other main liver transcription factors, which maintain the functionality and stability of liver [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Lastly, HNF4A has been shown to play a central role in the gene network that regulates the expression of hepatocyte TFs in the embryonic liver [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>The above studies regarding the roles of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> in both development and the generation of functional hepatocytes are extremely similar with the processes regulated by these factors during the induction hepatic fate from fibroblasts. Therefore, it seems that <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> mimic developmental processes during the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts.</p><p>In addition to Hnf4a and Foxa2, a number of studies used additional or completely different sets of hepatic-specific TFs including Hnf1a, Hnf1b, Foxa1, and Foxa3 [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We analyzed the expression of these TFs in our data and found that they were not significantly differentially expressed in at least three independent studies, and thus not categorized as DE-TFs and removed from our analysis. <italic>Hnf1a</italic>, <italic>Hnf1b</italic>, and <italic>Foxa3</italic> have been identified as DEGs in data sets from studies by Huang et al. (2011), and Sekiya et al. (2011) [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We used common DEGs and DE-TFs with defined criteria for our analysis, so despite the fact that these factors have been used in a number of studies, the heterogeneity in their expression precluded their use in our analysis.</p><p>Although there is a lack of studies regarding the role of PRC2 members in the direct generation of iHeps from fibroblasts, their importance during development and during the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent state are better understood. More recently, the role of PRC2 during development, during differentiation toward a hepatic fate, and during its maturation into a hepatocyte were documented. PRC2 has a very significant role in maintaining the pluripotent characteristics of pluripotent stem cells and also in preparing them for correct differentiation upon receiving the appropriate signals [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Ezh2, via its methyl transferase activity, acts as a core catalytic member of the PRC2 and has a very important role in normal development. It was reported that mouse embryos deficient for Ezh2 cannot properly complete the early stages of development [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, it was shown that Suz12 is crucial for the precise development of mice. The absence of Suz12, is concomitant with the misregulation of genes which are important for mouse development [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Suz12 mainly occupies the promotor regions of TFs and of developmentally determinant genes in embryonic stem cells, and helps regulate their expression [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The functionality of PRC2 depends on the collaboration of Ezh2 and Suz12 with other members For example, it has been demonstrated that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) deficient for Eed also have dramatically compromised levels of Ezh2 protein [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Emerging evidences show a crucial contribution of PRC2 members in the regulation of the gene expression program during different stages of hepatocyte generation. For example, it was shown that in ESCs with Suz12 knockdown are unable to generate endoderm cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Also, it was documented that ESCs with Ezh2 and Eed deficiency show dramatic abnormalities in their differentiation and commitment toward mesoendodermal cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. After specification of hepatic cells from a pancreatic lineage, Ezh2 is a crucial regulator of the growth and maturation of specified hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This specification from a pancreatic lineage occurs through histone acetylation by Ep300 factor followed by histone methylation by Ezh2 [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It was further shown that loss of Ezh2 leads to considerably lower amounts of liver tissue at E8.5 [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. More interestingly, the role of Ezh2 was shown in later stages of hepatocyte development and proliferation, where the self-renewal characteristics of hepatocyte progenitor cells were abolished upon deprivation of Ezh2 [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Loss of Ezh2 activity caused changes in levels of H3K27me3, which abolished hepatic progenitor maturation and liver maturation, revealing a crucial role for this factor [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study revealed the important roles of EZH1 and EZH2 in the normal physiology of the liver. Bae et al., (2015) showed that deficiency of these two factors led to the low regeneration capacity of liver cells during injury and toxic stress [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, many reports have demonstrated the role of PRC2 members in reprogramming, besides their roles in development. For example, it was shown that the Ezh2 core catalytic of PRC2, which is also a H3K27 methyl-transferase, plays a crucial role during the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotency states [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. It has been shown that the expression of Ezh2 continually increased during the reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotency state [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In addition, it has been well-documented that not only did repressing expression of this methyl-transferase lead to a significant reduction of reprogramming efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], but also that overexpressing it could enhance the efficiency and numbers of the obtained iPSC clones [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Experiments on other members of the PRC2 complex, Eed, Jarid2, Mtf2, and Suz12, showed that down-regulation of these factors resulted in decreased reprogramming efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Jarid2 and Mtf2 function as modulators of PRC2, and also act as repressors of developmentally important genes during the conversion of somatic cells into iPSCs [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]</p><p>Taken together, our results show significant roles for PRC2 during the induction of hepatic fate from fibroblasts. Our systems biology approach revealed that PRC2 was involved in the silencing of mesoderm- and fibroblast-specific gene expression. Also, PRC2 members present in the same protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) were found to be the main regulators of DEGs and DE-TFs. In addition, it seems that PRC2 in cooperation with <italic>Ep300</italic> repress pancreatic lineage-specific gene expression and favor the generation of hepatocytes.</p><p>In addition to <italic>Hnf4a</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, and the PRC2 complex, we also identified other TFs that could play a role during direct reprogramming. For example, using Yamanaka factors including Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc in combination with lineage specific factors has been another strategy for direct reprogramming process [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The significant presence of <italic>Klf4</italic> in the regulation of DEGs and DE-TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) supports the fact that <italic>Klf4</italic> can be used as a candidate factor to increase the efficiency of the induction of hepatic fate from fibroblasts. For example, interestingly, Lim et al. (2016) showed that using Klf4 and Myc in combination with hepatic-specific factors led to a significant increase in the efficiency of the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, this study showed Klf4 and Myc are not crucial for the induction hepatocyte-like cells but increase the efficiency of the process. Therefore, it seems that testing other identified master regulators in combination with hepatic-specific factors or PRC2 members could lead to better protocols for the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts.</p><p>It will also be useful to consider other possible interactions and roles for the DE-TFs we identified. For example, it was previously shown that HNF4A and TCF4 recognize considerable numbers of common DNA sequences and compete together to regulate the expression of these shared genes [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It is possible that this may be occurring for <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Tcf3</italic> TFs, and since we found the hepatic-specific factor <italic>Hnf4a</italic> to be up-regulated and <italic>Tcf3</italic> to be down-regulated, the direct reprogramming process might be favored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167081.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In addition, some TFs that may play roles during direct conversion may not have been identified using our analysis for several reasons, including heterogeneity in expression, lack of high throughput data or lack of related information in sources and databases. For example, we found <italic>Pparg</italic> to be a DE-TF that plays a role in the regulation of the gene expression program, but we did not find <italic>Ppara</italic> as a regulator of the constructed gene regulatory network. Because of the importance of <italic>Ppara</italic> in the metabolism of liver cells [<xref rid="pone.0167081.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], it also might play a role during the induction to a hepatic fate from fibroblasts. <italic>Ppara</italic> was considered a DE-TF in five out of the eight comparisons in our analysis (data not shown), but the ChEA database from which we recruited TF-binding site data sets did not include any data sets for <italic>Ppara</italic>, therefore we did not consider it in our subsequent analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, our results revealed significant details regarding the factors and mechanisms involved in the regulation of the gene expression program during the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts. The eight independent comparisons used in our study provide a comprehensive view on the regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, we found two distinct groups of biological processes that were mainly controlled by two groups of regulators. Up-regulated DEGs were mainly categorized as hepatic-specific genes, and were co-expressed and regulated by hepatic-specific TFs, especially <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. On other hand, down-regulated genes were categorized as mesoderm- and fibroblast-specific genes, and their expression levels were mainly repressed by PRC2 members, including <italic>Suz12</italic>, <italic>Mtf2</italic>, <italic>Ezh2</italic>, and <italic>Jarid2</italic>. Altogether, using systems biology approaches, we clarified the role of <italic>Hnf4a</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic> as hepatic-specific TFs, and for the first time, we introduced the PRC2 complex as the main regulator that favors the direct reprogramming process in cooperation with hepatic-specific factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167081.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of common DEGs during induction to cardiomyocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167081.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167081.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Target enrichement analysis for Klf4, Pparg, Sox9, and Ep300 DE-TFs.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167081.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167081.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Ontology results for DE-TFs core regulatory network.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167081.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0167081.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chistiakov</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Liver regenerative medicine: advances and challenges</article-title>. <source>Cells Tissues Organs</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>196</volume>: <fpage>291</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>312</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1159/000335697</pub-id>
