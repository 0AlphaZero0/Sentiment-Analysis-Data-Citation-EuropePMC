Their functions remain as yet largely unknown. Mining potential stress responsive PPRs, and checking whether known PPR editing factors are affected in the stress treatments. It is beneficial to elucidate the regulation mechanism of PPRs involved in biotic and abiotic stress. Here, we explored the characteristics and origin of the 105 E subgroup PPRs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Phylogenetic analysis categorized the E subgroup PPRs into five discrete groups (Cluster I to V), and they may have a common origin in both <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and rice. An <italic>in silico</italic> expression analysis of the 105 E subgroup PPRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was performed using available microarray data. Thirty-four PPRs were differentially expressed during <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seed imbibition, seed development stage(s), and flowers development processes. To explore potential stress responsive PPRs, differential expression of 92 PPRs was observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedlings subjected to different abiotic stresses. qPCR data of E subgroup PPRs under stress conditions revealed that the expression of 5 PPRs was responsive to abiotic stresses. In addition, <italic>PPR96</italic> is involved in plant responses to salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and oxidative stress. The T-DNA insertion mutation inactivating <italic>PPR96</italic> expression results in plant insensitivity to salt, ABA, and oxidative stress. The PPR96 protein is localized in the mitochondria, and altered transcription levels of several stress-responsive genes under abiotic stress treatments. Our results suggest that <italic>PPR96</italic> may important function in a role connecting the regulation of oxidative respiration and environmental responses in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins</kwd><kwd>microarray analysis</kwd><kwd>seed imbibition</kwd><kwd>seed development stage(s)</kwd><kwd>flower development processes</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>abiotic stresses</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="8370"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are encoded by a large gene family in terrestrial plants. This family has 450 members in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, 477 members in rice, and 486 members in foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>) (Schmitz-Linneweber and Small, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Non-plant organisms contain very few PPRs (Lurin et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Andr&#233;s et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For example, PPRs are virtually absent from prokaryotes (Pusnik et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and the yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human genomes are predicted to contain only 5, 2, and 6 PPR genes, respectively, and it is clear that the family has expanded greatly in terrestrial plants (O'Toole et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The PPR gene family was identified serendipitously over a decade ago as a result of bioinformatic analyses of the incomplete <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome sequence (Small and Peeters, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The higher plant PPR proteins are characterized by tandem arrays of a degenerate 35-amino acid repeat motif and have functions in RNA or DNA modification, acting through sequence-specific binding (Saha et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, this family can be split into two subfamilies based on the structure of the repeated motif: the P subfamily and the PLS subfamily. Members of the P subfamily contain the canonical P motif common to all eukaryotes, while members of the PLS subfamily contain the P motif as well as two P motif-derived variants, the short (S), and the long (L) motifs. Based on the presence of conserved domains in the C-terminal region, the PLS subfamily can be further divided into the PLS, E (E/E+), and DYW subgroups (Lurin et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Andr&#233;s et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The majority of plant PPR proteins are predicted to be localized to mitochondria or chloroplasts. PPR proteins characterized to date have functions in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes, including cytoplasmic male sterility, photosynthesis, respiration, and embryogenesis. A few of these proteins have been shown to play roles in post-transcriptional processes associated with RNA in plant organelles (Zsigmond et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sung et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Murayama et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ye et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>There have been very few functional studies of PPR proteins relating to biotic and abiotic stress-response mechanisms in higher plants. To date, of the 450 predicted PPR proteins, only GUN1, PPR40, ABO5, PGN, AHG11, SLG1, and MEF11/LOI1 have been implicated with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> defense biotic or abiotic stress response (Koussevitzky et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zsigmond et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Murayama et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Yuan and Liu, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). GUN1 is implicated with plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, regulation of nuclear gene <italic>ABI4</italic> expression, and photooxidative stress responses (Koussevitzky et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). <italic>A. thaliana</italic> PPR40 is implicated with mitochondrial oxidative respiration that also contributes to abiotic stress tolerance (Zsigmond et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). ROS accumulation was increased and some stress-responsive gene expression were altered in the <italic>ppr40</italic> mutant grew in the culture medium contained ABA and salt (Zsigmond et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). ABO5 was required for <italic>cis</italic>-splicing of the mitochondrial <italic>nad2</italic> intron 3, and altered the expression of several stress-responsive and nuclear-encoded genes to affect the ABA signaling pathway (Liu et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The PGN functions in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis by regulating RNA editing events in mitochondria during abiotic and biotic stress responses may occur through the regulation of mitochondria-nucleus retrograde signaling (Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). AHG11 regulates the <italic>nad4</italic> transcriptional level and thus led to changes in oxidative levels by controlling RNA editing events in mitochondria and affecting plant responses to ABA (Murayama et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). SLG1 regulates the <italic>nad3</italic> transcript by regulating RNA editing events in mitochondria and affecting the expression of genes involved in the alternative respiratory pathway (Yuan and Liu, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). MEF11/LOI1 is involved in mitochondrial RNA editing, and regulates biosynthesis of isoprenoids, metabolites known to affect defense gene expression in response to wounding and pathogen infection (Kobayashi et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The prevalence of chloroplast- and mitochondrial-physiology in the findings of functional studies of many PPR proteins suggests that many of these proteins may play roles in regulating oxidation balance in cellular redox under different types of stress (Lurin et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Andr&#233;s et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Of the seven PPR proteins, GUN1, PPR40, and ABO5 belong to P subfamily, PGN, AHG11, and SLG1 belong to E subgroup, and MEF11/LOI1 belong to DYW subgroup which also contains E/E+ motif. Four members contain an E/E+ motif (MEF11/LOI1, PGN, AHG1, and SLG1), and those PPR proteins contain E/E+ motif (E and DYW subgroups) relating to biotic and abiotic stress-response by regulating RNA editing events in mitochondria and chloroplast (Kobayashi et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Murayama et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Yuan and Liu, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is thought that the E/E+ motif might have a common function among trans-factors of RNA editing in chloroplasts or mitochondria (Okuda et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). RNA editing is important for plants to maintain functional chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts. As a vital component, PPR protein provides specificity of each editing event. However, very little has been done to study how editing is regulated under different stresses and whether it can be used as a coping mechanism. It would be interesting to the field to check whether known PPR editing factors are affected in the stress treatments. However, there have been very few functional studies of PPR proteins relating to biotic and abiotic stress response mechanisms in higher plants.</p><p>To explore potential stress responsive PPR proteins, and checking whether known PPR editing factors are affected in the stress treatments.

The RNA editing is more complex in plants than that of other organisms. In organellar transcripts of higher plants, specific cytidine residues are converted into uridine residues. The post-transcriptional conversion of specific cytosines to uracil in mitochondrial and plastid transcripts is unique to land plants (Steinhauser et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Thirty-four sites are edited in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plastids (Chateigner-Boutin and Small, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), whereas more than 450 editing sites are edited in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mitochondria (Gieg&#233; and Brennicke, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Bentolila et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zehrmann et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In many cases, editing results in the restoration of conserved amino acid residues, a process that is essential for protein function in plastids (Bock et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Sasaki et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome contains more than 450 PPRs. Most of these are aimed at plastids and/or mitochondria (Lurin et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and their functions remain largely sparse (Schmitz-Linneweber and Small, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Of the 450 PPR proteins, the 105 E subgroup members may have a common functions as trans-factors of RNA editing in chloroplasts or mitochondria (Okuda et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). <italic>A. thaliana</italic> chloroplast editing trans-factors CRR4 and CRR21, for example, can regulate the activity of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (Kotera et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Okuda et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and each is required for the editing of a different C target in the <italic>ndhD</italic> transcript. The PPR protein named CLB19 was required for editing of C targets in <italic>rpoA</italic> and <italic>clpP</italic> transcripts (Chateigner-Boutin et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). <italic>A. thaliana</italic> PPR protein SLO1 is required for RNA editing of <italic>nad4</italic> and <italic>nad9</italic> in mitochondria; its absence affects plant growth and development. In addition, several PPR proteins that contain E/E+ motif are known to be implicated with abiotic stresses in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. These include: MEF11/LOI1, PGN, AHG1, and SLG1; all of these proteins have been implicated with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> biotic and/or abiotic stress tolerance (Sung et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Murayama et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Yuan and Liu, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The functional link of many PPRs in plastid and mitochondrial development and/or regulation suggests these proteins may play key roles in regulating oxidation balance in cellular redox that are elicited by different types of stress (Lurin et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Andr&#233;s et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, the phylogenetic relationships of the E subgroup PPR proteins in eudicot model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and monocots model plant rice were analyzed, revealing that all of the E subgroup PPR proteins can be categorized into five discrete groups (Cluster I to V) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). E subgroup PPR proteins in both species showed there generally appears an even mix of genes from both species, excepting Cluster II. The genes in Cluster II may have expanded after the separation of monocots and dicots. Additionally, gene structure and chromosomal distribution analysis showed that 87.6% of the E subgroup PPR genes lacked intron(s) and 14 (13.3%) of the PPR genes were found to be tandem repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome has undergone genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy, which has great impact on the amplification of members of a gene family in the genome (Seoighe, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Recent research showed that the expansion of PPR gene family prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes and the lycophytes in land plants, and tandem and segmental duplication are responsible for the expansion of the PPR gene family in vascular plants (Liu et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These results suggested that the E subgroup PPR genes may have a common origin in both eudicot model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and monocots model plant rice, and the expansion of this gene family occurred prior to the monocot/dicot divergence in land plants (O'Toole et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and the expansion of E subgroup PPRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> may results from localized gene duplications.</p><p>Microarray analysis of the expression of the E subgroup PPR genes at several stages of development of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> revealed that 25, 23, and 34 of these genes were differentially expressed at least one of the stages of seed imbibition, seed development stage(s), and flowers, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>). Notably, 11, 18, and 17 genes were preferentially expressed in imbibing seeds, SAM, and mature pollen, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>). This suggested that these genes may play important roles in important roles in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes.</p><p>Recently, three E subgroup PPR proteins were found to function in the highly complex ABA signaling network. The functions of PGNs in the regulation of ROS homeostasis in mitochondria may occur through the regulation of mitochondria-nucleus retrograde signaling when plants grow under abiotic and biotic stress conditions. (Laluk et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). SLG1 regulates <italic>nad3</italic> (mitochondrion complex I) transcription by regulating RNA editing events in mitochondria and affecting the expression of genes involved in the alternative respiratory pathway (Yuan and Liu, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the present study, analysis of publically-available microarray data suggested that several E subgroup PPR genes may participate in responses to abiotic stresses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S5</xref>). Mutant plants of the mitochondria-localized <italic>A. thaliana PPR96</italic> gene were insensitive to salt, ABA, and oxidative stress. This is the first E subgroup PPR gene mutant identified to be associated with plant resistance to abiotic stresses. We performed a preliminary phenotypic characterization of <italic>ppr96</italic> mutants plants under salt, ABA, and oxidative stress. It is unclear which specific RNA editing sites are deleteriously affected in the <italic>ppr96</italic> mutants. It is not clear whether the loss of <italic>PPR96</italic> function will potentially enhance or decrease ROS accumulation in seedlings in response to abiotic stress. qPCR showed that ABA treatment increased the <italic>AOX1d</italic> transcription level in the <italic>ppr96</italic> mutant as compared to Col-0. <italic>AOX1d</italic> encodes an AOX protein; these proteins are known to capture the excess electrons from ubiquitin to prevent the accumulation of ROS during stress (Navrot et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Whether the <italic>ppr96</italic> mutant can induce changes in mitochondrial electron transport also requires further investigation. Enhanced induction of <italic>AOX1d</italic> transcription suggests the activation of the compensatory AOX pathway in <italic>ppr96</italic> mutant mitochondria. These results suggest that PPR96 may play roles in connecting the regulation of both oxidative respiration and environmental adaptation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Additional physiological and biochemical experiments will need to be performed to further explore this supposition.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>ZX coordinated the project, conceived and designed experiments, and edited the manuscript; JL performed experiments, analyzed data, and wrote the first draft of the manuscript; JZ and PL analyzed data; MC provided analytical tools and managed reagents; CG contributed with valuable discussions; YM coordinated the project and contributed with valuable discussions.
