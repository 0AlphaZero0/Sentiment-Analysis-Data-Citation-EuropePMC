Juvenile ALS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. Mutations in <italic>ALS2, SETX</italic> and <italic>SPG11</italic> are known to cause familial jALS with slow disease progression (Orban et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In recent literatures, <italic>SIGMAR1</italic> have been reported to be a new causative gene of autosomal recessive jALS (Al-Saif et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ullah et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, in sporadic juvenile ALS patients, mutations in <italic>Fus</italic> are the most frequent genetic cause (H&#252;bers et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zou et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). On the contrary to slow progression in familial jALS, sporadic jALS patients with <italic>FUS</italic> or <italic>SOD1</italic> mutations experienced aggressive progression and short survival times (Zou et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Some of jALS causative genes have also been reported in other diseases, such as <italic>ALS2</italic> and <italic>SPG11</italic> causing hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) as well (Eymard-Pierre et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Klebe et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this report, we describe a jALS patient with a novel missense mutation in the <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene, which is a member of the intracellular phospholipase A1 gene family and involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function. Associations have been reported between mutations in the <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene and the SPG28 subtype of autosomal recessive HSP but have never been reported in jALS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The pedigree for the family is presented in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>.

In the patient, examinations revealed a steppage gait, atrophy of the bilateral interosseous and thenar muscles with a split-hand sign, mild weakness in the hands and lower limbs, hyperreflexia in all limbs with positive bilateral Babinski signs and Hoffmann signs, and disappearance of abdominal reflexes. Sensation and coordination were normal. As for the patients' parents and young brother, neurological examinations showed no muscle atrophy, normal tendon reflex and negative pathological reflex.</p><p>Needle EMG was performed on the patient.

The protein encoded by the <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene is a cytosolic protein with some mitochondrial localization and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics via phosphatidic acid (PA) (Baba et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The PA on the surface of mitochondria is known to regulate mitochondrial fusion. <italic>DDHD1</italic> is the first identified intracellular phospholipase A1 and preferentially hydrolyzes PA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>DDHD1</italic> pathogenic mutations cause reduced PA-PLA1 activity, and the resultant increased PA content on the surface of mitochondria might cause the impairment of mitochondrial fusion and lead to the dysfunction of mitochondria (Tesson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The previous study has showed the ectopic expression of <italic>DDHD1</italic> in HeLa cells induced mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas its depletion caused mitochondrial elongation. Gene disruption of <italic>DDHD1</italic> in mice caused sperm malformation due to mitochondrial organization defects (Baba et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In patients harboring pathogenic <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations, histochemical analyses in muscle showed mitochondrial alterations, and multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions were evident (Mignarri et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Besides, mitochondrial respiration rate, total cellular and mitochondrial ATP content were found to be significantly lower in lymphoblast from SPG28 patients (Tesson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In brain <sup>1</sup>H-MRS analysis, a mild pathological accumulation of lactate in the cerebrospinal fluid was detected in a SPG28 patient with 20 years of disease duration, (Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) but not other three patients with shorter disease duration. (Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mignarri et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)</p><p>In previous studies, 8 mutations of the <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene have been reported in autosomal recessive HSP patients, including three nonsense mutations, three frame-shift mutations and two mutations affecting the mRNA splicing site (Tesson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mignarri et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Miura et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All of these mutations predict changes in the protein translation of the DDHD domain, which is responsible for the phospholipase activity of the <italic>DDHD1</italic> protein, thereby leading to a loss of function in the protein and finally mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>In our report, the patient carried a novel homozygous c.1483A&gt;G (p.Met495Val) missense mutation located in exon 7 of the <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

In our report, the novel homozygous missense <italic>DDHD1</italic> mutation might cause jALS via mitochondrial dysfunction. Unlike the previously reported mutations, the new mutation may not change the protein primary structure but rather the three-dimensional structure of the DDHD domain, ultimately causing a loss of function in the protein. However, further functional studies are needed to confirm mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS patients with <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations.</p><p>Patients with <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations have presented pure or mildly complicated HSP in previous studies (Bouslam et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Tesson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mignarri et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Miura et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Tongue fasciculation with wasting have been reported previously, (Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) indicating that <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations may influence lower motor neuron (LMN) function. In this patient, muscle atrophy of hands with a split-hand sign was apparent, and needle EMG confirmed neurogenic damage in four regions. We believe that the decreased amplitude of compound motor action potentials was the result of severe LMN damage. Apart from motor system involvement, subclinical sensory axonal neuropathy was detected in this patient. In previous reports, clinical and subclinical sensory defects had been reported in HSP patients with <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations, which reflected <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations might cause sensory defects (Bouslam et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Liguori et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, subclinical sensory abnormalities, peripheral as well as central levels, could be found in ALS patients who didn't have other known potential causes of polyneuropathy, such as diabetes mellitus (Pugdahl et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Iglesias et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Isak et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A multicenter study reported 22.7% patients with ALS had sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) abnormalities in at least one nerve (Pugdahl et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Although pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sensory abnormalities remains to be further clarified, these findings reflected that ALS might be a multi-systemic disorder involving other systems than motor. In the revision of the EI Escorial criteria 2015, sensory impairment does not exclude ALS diagnosis. Besides, UMN and LMN impairment, rather than subclinical sensory impairment, was the dominant presentation in this patient. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with lab-supported probable jALS. Considering the clinical history of this patient and previously reported cases, we believe that jALS patients with <italic>DDHD1</italic> mutations could have slow disease progression, similar to that of other familial jALS patients.</p><p>In summary, this is the first case report about the relationship between <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations and jALS. Besides of dominant motor system involvement, subclinical sensory impairment was detected in this jALS patient. All of these findings reflected the clinically and genetically heterogeneity of jALS and further proved the genetic overlap between HSP and jALS. Meanwhile, further functional studies are needed to confirm the effects of <italic>DDHD1</italic> gene mutations in ALS pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Juvenile ALS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease.
