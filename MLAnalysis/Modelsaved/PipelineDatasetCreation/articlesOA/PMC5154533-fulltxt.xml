Some of these freeze-tolerant plants produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that offer frost protection by restricting ice crystal growth and preventing expansion-induced lysis of the plasma membranes. Despite the extensive <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of such proteins, the importance of IBPs in the freezing stress response has not been investigated. Using the freeze-tolerant grass and model crop, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, we characterized putative IBPs (<italic>Bd</italic>IRIs) and generated the first &#8216;IBP-knockdowns&#8217;. Seven IBP sequences were identified and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with all of the recombinant proteins demonstrating moderate to high levels of ice-recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity, low levels of thermal hysteresis (TH) activity (0.03&#8722;0.09&#176;C at 1 mg/mL) and apparent adsorption to ice primary prism planes. Following plant cold acclimation, IBPs purified from wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> cell lysates similarly showed high levels of IRI activity, hexagonal ice-shaping, and low levels of TH activity (0.15&#176;C at 0.5 mg/mL total protein). The transfer of a microRNA construct to wild-type plants resulted in the attenuation of IBP activity. The resulting knockdown mutant plants had reduced ability to restrict ice-crystal growth and a 63% reduction in TH activity. Additionally, all transgenic lines were significantly more vulnerable to electrolyte leakage after freezing to &#8722;10&#176;C, showing a 13&#8722;22% increase in released ions compared to wild-type. IBP-knockdown lines also demonstrated a significant decrease in viability following freezing to &#8722;8&#176;C, with some lines showing only two-thirds the survival seen in control lines. These results underscore the vital role IBPs play in the development of a freeze-tolerant phenotype and suggests that expression of these proteins in frost-susceptible plants could be valuable for the production of more winter-hardy crops.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002790</institution-id><institution>Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>388335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Virginia K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by the NSERC Discovery Grant(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp</ext-link>) to Virginia K.

Uncontrolled growth of ice crystals in the apoplast presumably sequesters water from intracellular compartments leading to cellular dehydration, loss of cell membrane integrity, physical rupture of plasma membranes and ultimately death [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Special adaptations allow certain plants to withstand freezing and prevent this cascade of damage. Such plants are termed &#8220;freeze-tolerant&#8221; and have a number of biochemical, metabolic and physiological mechanisms that help prevent cell death at sub-zero temperatures.</p><p>Induction of the freezing stress response is facilitated by exposure to low temperatures, a process known as cold acclimation. Since a crucial site of freeze injury is the plasma membrane, changes in composition are important for providing cryostability during freeze-thaw cycles. Although membrane modifications are species specific, they are commonly associated with an increase in phospholipid and unsaturated fatty acid content [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In some plants, the accumulation of compatible solutes that act as osmolytes, such as proline and glycine betaine, is reported to protect cells by preventing cellular dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, changes in gene expression can result in the upregulation of a number of highly-specialized proteins including cold-regulated (COR) proteins [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], cold-shock domain (CSD) proteins [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and ice recrystallization inhibition proteins (IRIPs) [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are also known as antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice-binding proteins (IBPs).</p><p>IBPs have been identified in a number of freeze-tolerant plant species including the grasses <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], <italic>Secale cereal</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as dicotyledonous plants such as the carrot <italic>Daucus carota</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These proteins have two well-documented properties: ice-recrystallization inhibition (IRI), which restricts ice crystal growth at temperatures close to melting, and thermal hysteresis (TH), or lowering of the freezing point in relation to the equilibrium melting point [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both properties are derived from the ability of IBPs to irreversibly adsorb to ice crystals, modifying their growth [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>As plant IBPs have low TH activities (measured in fractions of a degree) compared to those observed for IBPs from other organisms (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 5.5&#176;C in the yellow mealworm beetle [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), it has long been assumed that the primary function of most plant IBPs is the restriction of ice crystal growth [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Typically, IBPs are secreted to the apoplast where they can bind to embryonic ice crystals and prevent their growth into larger, more damaging extracellular ice crystals. However, it has been suggested that some IBPs may remain inside cells to offer intracellular protection from freezing damage [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The regulation of these proteins <italic>in planta</italic> is an understudied area of inquiry but may involve post-translational modifications (PTMs), including N-linked glycosylation [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and cleavage of the ice-binding domain from the full-length protein [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The growing body of evidence suggests that IBPs play a vital role in the freezing stress response in plants, as well in other species with such proteins. In plants exposed to low temperatures, IBP abundance increases in leaf and vascular tissues, as well as in the roots and crowns of some plants [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Transgenic studies have shown the capacity of plant IBPs, as well as IBPs produced by insects and fish, to elicit a freeze-tolerant phenotype to less hardy plants, as indicated by reduced electrolyte leakage and increased whole plant freezing survival assays [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in order to unequivocally demonstrate the crucial role these proteins play in the freezing stress response, an IBP-knockdown must be generated. The multicopy nature of IBP genes in freeze-avoiding metazoans including fish (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. 30&#8211;40 copies [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) and insects (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. ~ 17 copies [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), the paucity of sequence data available for most freeze-tolerant microbe and plant species, as well as inefficient transformation techniques available for some organisms, have hitherto precluded the generation of knockdown lines in many of these species.</p><p>Generation of knockdown mutants is possible using the annual temperate grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>. This model species is closely related to cereal grain species as well as forage grasses including <italic>L</italic>. <italic>perenne</italic>. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> has the ability to acclimate at low non-freezing temperatures and induce a freezing-tolerance stress response that includes cold-regulated induction of IBPs [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Importantly for the development of an IBP-knockdown, only 7 IBP genes have been identified in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> (<italic>BradiIRI</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), henceforth termed <italic>Bd</italic>IRIs. Here we verify that all 7 of these proteins function as IBPs through the characterization of both recombinantly-produced proteins and native isoforms. Additionally, because of the molecular tools available for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> as well as the relatively low IBP gene copy number, we were able to successfully design a microRNA construct to generate the first IBP-knockdown plants. By comparing the freezing tolerance capabilities of knockdown lines to their wild-type counterparts we have clearly established the protective role of these proteins in freeze-tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bioinformatics Analysis</title><p>Putative <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins were identified through a BLAST search against the published <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> genome using the amino acid sequence for the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>perenne</italic> IBP, <italic>Lp</italic>AFP (accession number AJ277399).

However, without a knockdown to verify the role of these proteins, these claims remained formally unsubstantiated. Accordingly, we have identified and functionally characterized 7 IBPs in the model cereal, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>, and generated knockdown lines with demonstrably reduced IBP activity. Using these knockdown lines we have now confirmed that IBPs are important players in the freezing stress response. In these plants specifically, and in conjunction with other transgenic expression studies (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0167941.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), our results highlight the value of IBPs as candidates for the development of freeze-tolerant crops.</p><p>Analysis of the ice-binding activity of wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> cell extracts showed that following a short cold acclimation period, these plants induced the expression of proteins capable of restricting ice crystal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g003">Fig 3</xref>), shaping ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g006">Fig 6</xref>) and depressing the freezing point (0.14&#176;C at 0.5 mg/mL). We isolated proteins that adsorbed to ice in order to validate the identity of native <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins. Somewhat surprisingly, only 2 of the 7 <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins (<italic>Bd</italic>IRI3 and <italic>Bd</italic>IRI4) were recognized following ice-affinity purification. This may be due to differing capacities for ice crystal adsorption, although this is not obvious from TH, IRI, or ice-shaping activities, except for the less active <italic>Bd</italic>IRI6 and <italic>Bd</italic>IRI7 proteins (<xref rid="pone.0167941.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Notably, these two isoforms have the least similarity to <italic>Lp</italic>AFP, and the reduced number of conserved ice-binding residues may result in a lower capacity for ice crystal adsorption. However, it is not known why peptides corresponding to the other three proteins were not recovered; we speculate that this could reflect varying isoform expression in leaves at this particular point in the cold acclimation process.</p><p>The isolated native <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins provided insight into the processing of IBPs <italic>in planta</italic>. Previous research has shown that some plant IBPs undergo PTMs, including N-linked glycosylation [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While glycosylation is necessary for the ice-binding activity of IBPs produced in <italic>Solanum dulcamara</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of IBPs produced in other plants have shown similar levels of ice-binding activity [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The identification of algorithm predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the coding sequences of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167941.s005">S2 Table</xref>) suggested that these proteins too, may be glycosylated. However, according to LC MS/MS analysis, the two <italic>Bd</italic>IRI isoforms recovered from ice-affinity purification were not glycosylated. IBPs isolated from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>aestivum</italic> are also not glycosylated [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and while the IBPs produced in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>perenne</italic> are postulated to be glycosylated, experiments with the bacterially-produced recombinant IBP have shown that ice-binding occurs through the protein backbone and glycosylation is not required for activity [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Together, this evidence suggests that while glycosylation may be an important PTM for the activity of some IBPs, it is likely not required for the activity of those produced in the Pooideae family of freeze-tolerant grasses.</p><p>In addition to glycosylation, some studies have suggested that IBPs from freeze-tolerant grasses may undergo specific proteolytic cleavage <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, the native <italic>Bd</italic>IRI3 and <italic>Bd</italic>IRI4 proteins appeared to have been fully processed, with no peptides corresponding to the N-terminal LRR domain identified in the ice-purified fraction. The processed proteins match algorithm-based predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with hydrolysis occurring three amino acids N-terminal to the ice-binding domain. It should be mentioned that studies with recombinant IBPs that are N-terminally tagged are capable of adsorption to ice (for example, <italic>Lp</italic>AFP [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Thus while even non-processed IBPs could adsorb to ice, it may be the case that removal of the LRR domain, which is predicted to have a concave structure on one surface, is required for maximal ice crystal adsorption, since efficiency of adsorption has been associated with the &#8220;flatness&#8221; of the ice-binding surface [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Following processing, the LRR domain itself could have a function, as suggested below.</p><p>Assessment of the ice-binding activity of the recombinantly-produced proteins revealed that all isoforms had the capacity to restrict ice crystal growth, depress the freezing point, and with the exception of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI7, shape ice (<xref rid="pone.0167941.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In addition to the lowest TH activities, ice crystals annealed in the presence of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI6 and <italic>Bd</italic>IRI7 were noticeably larger than those observed with the other five isoforms. However, the other recombinant isoforms with comparatively higher TH activity were still modestly lower (~0.1&#176;C at 1 mg/mL) (<xref rid="pone.0167941.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>) than <italic>Lp</italic>AFP (~0.3&#176;C at 1.5 mg/mL) [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and <italic>Dc</italic>AFP (~0.3&#176;C at 1 mg/mL) [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Nonetheless, the ice-binding activity of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI isoforms was substantially greater than purified proteins from winter wheat, which did not show TH or ice crystal shaping at reasonable concentrations (~ 0.33&#176;C at 60 mg/mL) [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While TH activity may be the hallmark property of IBPs, it is well documented that IRI activity is more functionally relevant in plants than in other freeze-avoidant species [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this regard, while <italic>Bd</italic>IRI isoforms 1&#8211;5 can most certainly be classified as IBPs, the lower IRI activity of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI6 and <italic>Bd</italic>IRI7 at concentrations below 1 mg/mL suggests that if these isoforms were expressed by themselves, they might not serve as effective IBPs <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>A marked difference in the activity levels of native extracts (0.14&#176;C at 0.5 mg/mL) and recombinantly-produced isoforms (0.06&#8211;0.09&#176;C at 1 mg/mL) (<xref rid="pone.0167941.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>) was observed. Initially, we hypothesized that glycosylation might be required for the optimal ice-binding activity of these proteins. However, since glycosylation was not seen in the two native IBPs identified after mass spectrometry, the enhanced ice shaping and TH activity seen with native proteins compared to the individual recombinantly-produced <italic>Bd</italic>IRIs could instead be explained by the presence of more than one isoform. Indeed, the expression of multiple IBPs is reported to enhance ice-binding and TH activity [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Additionally, since the recombinant proteins used in this study were those representing the full coding sequence and native <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins appear to be cleaved, it is possible that the absence of processing could also explain the discrepancy between ice crystal adsorption in the native and recombinant IBPs.</p><p>Having now verified the ice-binding activity of <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins, we generated four independent knockdown lines with attenuated IBP activity. The presence of transcript in knockdown lines indicated that the miRNA regulates expression by repressing the translation of the <italic>Bd</italic>IRI transcripts as has been seen with other miRNAs in plants [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The loss of ice-binding activity in transgenic lines was observed in crude cell extracts containing both intracellular and extracellular components, but also in the apoplastic extracts of IBP knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Most plant IBPs have been shown to localize to the apoplast [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and recent research has demonstrated that localization of IBPs to the extracellular space may be required for full freeze protection [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition to the identification of putative extracellular signal peptides in the N-terminal domain of all 7 <italic>Bd</italic>IRIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g001">Fig 1</xref>), the presence of IRI and TH activity, as well as ice shaping in the apoplastic extracts of wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> lines, suggests that <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins are localized to extracellular compartments.</p><p>Electrolyte leakage assays demonstrated that attenuation of IBP expression resulted in a loss of cell integrity at sub-zero temperatures when compared to wild-type <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Since electrolyte leakage is an indicator of the level of cell membrane stability [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the substantial increase in the percentage of leaked ions in the transgenic lines following freezing indicates an increase in membrane damage associated with the reduction in <italic>Bd</italic>IRI levels. Previous research has suggested that some plant IBPs could be affiliated with membranes, presumably to provide stabilization during freeze-thaw cycles [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, given the extracellular localization of these proteins, another possible explanation for the membrane protection is that IBPs restrict the growth of ice crystals in the apoplastic space during freezing, preventing physical damage to the membranes caused by the growth of large ice crystals. Additionally, it is thought that plasma membrane association occurs though the sugar moiety of antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and since <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins appear to be not glycosylated, an association with membranes may be unlikely.</p><p>Although it has long been speculated that IBPs are required for freezing protection, until now, there has been no direct test of the importance of this particular protein family for low-temperature endurance. Whole plant survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g012">Fig 12</xref>) revealed that all IBP knockdown lines had reduced rates of viability following freezing. Although a significant decrease in survival was only seen in two lines, it is noteworthy that viability was correlated with the level of ice-binding activity. Specifically, the knockdown line miRBdIRI-c, which retained the highest IRI and ice-shaping activity of all transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167941.g010">Fig 10</xref>) also showed the greatest freeze survival. This observation suggests that the level of IBP expression is important factor in determining the degree of freeze tolerance. Notwithstanding the low fecundity of the transgenic lines necessitating the limited number of plants for testing (N = 10), marked differences were still seen in three lines. We submit this is evidence of the importance of IBPs in the freezing-tolerance stress response in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>.</p><p>As indicated, in all independently derived lines, knockdown of IBPs resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes including lower seed set and germination rates, as well as reduced above ground biomass (<xref rid="pone.0167941.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Algorithm-based amiRNA target predictions, using the fully annotated <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> genome, did not identify any off-target &#8216;hits&#8217; and therefore, we suspect there is another explanation for this phenotype. One possibility is that these detrimental effects are directly attributable to the knockdown of the N-terminal LRR domain. LRR proteins have roles in inflorescence architecture, the development of floral meristem cells, floral organ abcission, plant defense and pathogen recognition, as well as microsporogenesis and male sterility [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. IBP transcripts have been identified in the embryos and seeds of closely related species [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and although the ice-binding &#223;-domain may not stable at standard growth temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0167941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], it is possible that the cleaved LRR domain could still accumulate in the apoplast at some stages of development. These observations, although preliminary, warrant the investigation of these additional phenotypes in future studies to fully understand the possible multifunctional roles of IBPs in plants.</p><p>To recapitulate, for the first time, we have generated an IBP knockdown to test the role of IBPs in plant freeze tolerance. The attenuation of expression of 7 proteins with confirmed ice-binding activity resulted in plants that suffered increased membrane damage and had lower rates of survival following freezing. Our results suggest that the freeze protection provided by <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins could be due to the restriction of ice crystal growth by these proteins. Given the pleiotropic effects incurred on these knockdown lines, future studies using spatial and/or temporally controlled promoter systems would be valuable in order to elucidate the specific roles of these proteins in plant systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167941.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Ice-recrystallization inhibition analysis of recombinant <italic>Bd</italic>IRI isoforms.</title><p>A dilution series was conducted on purified <italic>Bd</italic>IRI proteins and ice crystals were observed after annealing at &#8722;4&#176;C for 18h.
