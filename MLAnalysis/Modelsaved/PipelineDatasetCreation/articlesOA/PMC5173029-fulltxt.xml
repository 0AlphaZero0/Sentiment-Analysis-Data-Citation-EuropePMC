FIP-sch3 was identified in the ascomycete <italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>, making it the second FIP to be identified outside the order of Basidiomycota. Recombinant FIP-sch3 (rFIP-shc3) was produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified using GST-affinity magnetic beads. The bioactive characteristics of FIP-sch3 were compared to those of well-known FIPs LZ-8 from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> and FIP-fve from <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic>, which were produced and purified using the same method. The purified rFIP-sch3 exhibited a broad spectrum of anti-tumour activity in several types of tumour cells but had no cytotoxicity in normal human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Assays that were implemented to study these properties indicated that rFIP-sch3 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell migration in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The anti-tumour effects of rFIP-sch3 in A549 cells were comparable to those of rLZ-8, but they were significantly greater than those of rFIP-fve. Molecular assays that were built on real-time PCR further revealed potential mechanisms related to apoptosis and migration and that underlie phenotypic effects. These results indicate that FIP-shc3 has a unique anti-tumour bioactive profile, as do other FIPs, which provide a foundation for further studies on anti-tumour mechanisms. Importantly, this study also had convenient access to FIP-sch3 with potential human therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) are a class of small proteins that share similar sequence and structural characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As such, FIPs are assigned to their own family of proteins. FIP family proteins exhibit sequence identity that is greater than 57% and are made up of approximately 110 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa. FIPs lack His, Cys and Met residues but are rich in Asp and Val residues [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The crystal structures of FIP-fve from <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic> (PDB entry: 1OSY) [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], LZ-8 (FIP-glu) from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (PDB entry: 3F3H) [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and FIP-gmi from <italic>G</italic>. <italic>microsporum</italic> (PDB entry: 3KCW) have been resolved. FIP-fve and LZ-8 are homodimers, and FIP-gmi is a homotetramer. The FIP monomer displays an N-terminal &#945;-helix followed by a C-terminal fibronectin III (FNIII) domain. Natural FIP protein is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions within the N-terminal &#945;-helix. The C-terminal FNIII domain exists as an immunoglobulin-like &#946;-sandwich fold, which is where the main biological functions take place.</p><p>FIPs engage in various biological activities. This family of proteins can agglutinate erythrocytes, regulate immunity and inhibit tumour growth [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. FIPs regulate immunity by stimulating lymphocyte proliferation, inducing T<sub>H</sub>1-specific cytokine synthesis (interleukin-2, interferon-&#947;, and tumour necrosis factor &#946;), and inhibiting anaphylaxis [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The anti-tumour effects that are displayed by FIPs refer to the suppression of tumour cell proliferation, promotion of tumour cell apoptosis, the induction of tumour cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of tumour cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. FIPs have very broad potential future applications in medical care, and the anti-tumour effects in particular have attracted extensive attention.</p><p>By sharing considerable sequence and structural similarity, FIPs from different sources display diverse activities. For example, FIPs from <italic>Ganoderma spp</italic>. have strong anti-tumour activity, while FIP-fve from <italic>F</italic>. <italic>velutipes</italic> demonstrates significant anti-allergy activity [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Much progress has been made in the identification of distinctive FIPs. In the early days, FIPs were primarily identified by extraction or homologous cloning methods from Macrofungi. Extracting FIPs from Macrofungi was time-consuming and tedious and resulted in a low yield. Since 1989, only seven FIPs have been identified using the extraction method: LZ-8 [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], FIP-fve [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], FIP-vvo from <italic>Volvariella volvacea</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], FIP-gts from <italic>Ganoderma tsugae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], FIP-app from <italic>Auricularia polytricha</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], FIP-pcp from <italic>Poria cocos</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and FIP-tvc from <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Homologous cloning involves designing primers using known FIPs as templates and cloning FIPs in the same genus, so it is limited to identifying highly homologous proteins (identity&gt;90%), making it difficult to further characterize FIP proteins. Until now, only five FIPs have been identified using the homologous cloning method: FIP-gmi [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], FIP-gsi from <italic>Ganoderma sinense</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], FIP-cru from <italic>Chroogomphis rutilus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], FIP-gat from <italic>Ganoderma atrum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and LZ-9 [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, researchers have shifted away from the extraction or homologous cloning methods for identifying new FIPs and instead search for sequence similarity in the burgeoning genome databases. Two previously unknown FIP genes were quickly identified by genome mining and were largely produced using recombinant expression [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These two FIPs were very different from previously discovered FIPs: FIP-nha was the first FIP that was identified from the ascomycete <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic>, and FIP-ppl from <italic>Postia placenta</italic> was the only basidiomycete FIP to be identified outside the order of Macrofungi.</p><p>In this study, one new FIP protein, FIP-sch3, from <italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic> was discovered using genome mining. To produce sufficient FIP-sch3 for further study, recombinant expression was used. An alignment analysis indicated that the sequence characteristics of FIP-sch3 were more similar to those of FIPs from <italic>Ganoderma</italic> spp. than to those of FIP-fve, so the anti-tumour properties of purified FIP-sch3 were tested. First, the anti-tumour activities of purified FIP-sch3 were analysed in five different types of human cancer cells. Then, utilizing human lung adenocarcinoma A549 as a model cell line, the purified FIP-sch3 was subjected to proliferation, apoptosis and migration assays to evaluate the anti-tumour effects. Finally, the anti-tumour mechanism of rFIP-sch3 was explored using Real-Time PCR (qPCR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cloning of recombinant FIPs (rFIPs) and the construction of the expression vector</title><p>The nucleotide sequences of LZ-8, FIP-fve and FIP-sch3 were synthesised using GenScript (Nanjing, China) and were based upon the sequences that were identified in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> (GenBank: ACD44335), <italic>F</italic>. <italic>velutipes</italic> (GenBank: ADB24832) and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>chartarum</italic> IBT 7711 (GenBank: KEY70185), respectively.

SMPD1-mediated apoptosis has been suggested to predominantly involve the TNF receptor pathway [<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0168436.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These results suggest that rFIP-sch3 regulates various proteins that are involved in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis.</p><p>However, the current knowledge of the above mechanisms is limited, and the molecular targets and the regulatory network for rFIP-sch3 that encompasses proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction and migration suppression remain unclear and require further investigation. The anti-tumour mechanisms of rFIP-sch3 must be clarified to reveal potential applications. This study laid a preliminary foundation for further study of the anti-tumour mechanisms of rFIP-sch3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>FIP-sch3 is a novel FIP family protein that was identified by homology search. It displayed high sequence identity (&gt;40%) and evolutionary conservation with the previously reported FIPs. Moreover, rFIP-sch3 exhibited a broad spectrum of anti-tumour activity and obvious anti-tumour effects, such as proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and migration prevention in A549 cells. In addition, the anti-tumour mechanism of rFIP-sch3 was explored. Consequently, rFIP-sch3 has the potential to serve as an anticancer agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168436.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers for real-time PCR.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168436.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0168436.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>XF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>KQ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>TW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cong</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>QZ</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
