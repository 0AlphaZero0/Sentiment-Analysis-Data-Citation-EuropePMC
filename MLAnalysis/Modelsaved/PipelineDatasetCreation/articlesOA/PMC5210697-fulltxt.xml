Post-mortems were conducted on 58 carcasses (44 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, two common bottlenose dolphins, 12 short-beaked common dolphins) from South Australia during 2005&#8211;2013, including an unusual mortality event (UME) in St Vincent Gulf Bioregion (SVG) during 2013. Diagnostic pathology, circumstance of death, body condition, age and stomach contents were documented for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. At least 50 dolphins died during the UME, 41 were Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and most were young. The UME lasted about seven months and had two peaks, the first being the largest. Effect on the population is unknown. Diagnostic testing for morbillivirus was conducted on 57 carcasses, with evidence for infection in all species during 2011&#8211;2013. All tested UME bottlenose dolphins were positive for cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV), and the pathology included interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid depletion and syncytia. Concurrent pathologies, including lung parasite and fungal infections, and severe cutaneous bruising were observed in many dolphins. The event coincided with elevated water temperatures, a diatom bloom and significant fish die-offs. We conclude that the cause for the UME was multifactorial and that CeMV was a major contributor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>unusual mortality event</kwd><kwd>cetacean morbillivirus</kwd><kwd>Australia</kwd><kwd>Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin</kwd><kwd>environmental perturbation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder_name">Department for Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR)</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December, 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>An unusual mortality event (UME) of marine mammals is defined in the United States Marine Mammal Act as &#8216;a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response&#8217; [<xref rid="RSOS160838C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

A third, suspected, UME was observed in Western Australian Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins during 2008&#8211;2009 [<xref rid="RSOS160838C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In a review of emerging infectious diseases of cetaceans worldwide, Van Bressem <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] discussed four categories of pathogens: viruses (including cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV), papillomavirus and poxvirus), <italic>Brucella</italic> spp., <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> spp. and <italic>Lacazia loboi</italic> (lobomycosis). Pathogens that infect cetaceans may be host-specific (e.g. viruses) or host-opportunistic (e.g. bacteria, fungi and protozoa). Van Bressem <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] concluded that environmental degradation may have disturbed the evolutionary equilibrium between cetaceans and their pathogens, thus making some populations more susceptible to disease and mortality. The causes of UMEs are likely to be complex and involve a broad spectrum of factors in synergy. Van Bressem <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] noted that there is mounting circumstantial evidence that chemical pollution has increased the frequency and severity of some diseases in cetaceans and pinnipeds. Evidence for morbillivirus has been found in cetaceans from all ocean basins but sizable mortality events have not been documented for the Southern Hemisphere [<xref rid="RSOS160838C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Morbillivirus has been identified in six cetacean species from Australian waters [<xref rid="RSOS160838C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

At present, it is not considered a significant cause of cetacean mortality in Australia.

In Australia, stranding networks are usually run by state and territory wildlife agencies but there is rarely a comprehensive post-mortem programme of mortalities. In South Australia (SA) a stranding network began in 1990 and is coordinated by South Australian Museum (SAM), with input from other government and non-government agencies. Trends in stranding patterns have been summarized by Segawa &amp; Kemper [<xref rid="RSOS160838C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and circumstance of death (including a review of diseases) by Kemper <italic>et al</italic>.

Post-mortems have been conducted since the beginning of the stranding programme, with the most detailed results from 2005.</p><p>The aim of this study was to document an unprecedented dolphin mortality event that occurred in SA during 2013, and to identify patterns and possible causes associated with the event. The study included some data for mortality of SA dolphins prior to 2013. The duration and geographical extent of the UME, the species and ages of the animals involved, and their stomach contents are presented. Results of the diagnostic investigation to determine causes of death are described. A brief description of the epidemiology of morbillivirus during the event is also presented.

A post-mortem examination was performed on 45 carcasses (three species). To identify when morbillivirus first appeared in SA, 13 additional dolphin carcasses (two species) were selected, on the basis of histopathological findings (e.g. interstitial pneumonia), from archived samples from dolphins collected in SVG and elsewhere in SA during 2005&#8211;2012. Summary data are presented for all post-mortemed carcasses that were included in the study (electronic supplementary material). For dolphins that were collected, species identification was confirmed by examining skull and postcranial features. If not examined by post-mortem, species, sex and age were assigned using photographs and descriptions provided by observers. In these cases, limited information was gained on pathology (e.g. skin lesions, haemorrhaging) and overall body condition.

The 2014 strandings record returned to pre-2013 levels: 11 total dolphins, of which six were bottlenose dolphins. Annual count data elsewhere in SA (i.e. outside SVG) showed no peak in strandings during 2013: the 1990&#8211;2012 range was 9&#8211;41 (mean&#8201;=&#8201;24.2) and in 2013 the count was 22.

A second, smaller peak occurred during August and September, over a period of about 35 days.

During 2013 there was a different pattern, with a few strandings in January, followed by a substantial increase in March and April.

These findings provide additional evidence that 2013 was an atypical year for bottlenose dolphins in SVG.</p><p>Almost all the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins that died during the early part of the UME were neonates, calves and juveniles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS160838TB2">table 2</xref>).

Later, in the UME there was a more even spread of ages, with estimates of less than three months to 1 year for neonates and calves (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4) to 3&#8211;17 years for juveniles and adults (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6). Of the dolphins that died during the UME, 21 were males and 15 females. None of the collected females was pregnant or lactating.

Follow-up histopathology showed that 23 had infectious disease as a major cause of death. None was related to anthropogenic causes.

Although other infectious conditions were present in affected animals, the UME clearly coincided with the appearance of severe morbillivirus bronchopneumonia, and we conclude that morbillivirus was a major causative agent for the event. This UME is, to our knowledge, the first large marine mammal event linked to morbillivirus in the Southern Hemisphere. One other CeMV-related UME has been documented in Australia and another is suspected. Both were in Western Australia and involved Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins from small resident populations. The Swan River case [<xref rid="RSOS160838C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] documented six mortalities from a population of 20-25 dolphins and this exceeded the annual mean by six-fold. As in the SA UME, the Swan River 2009 event had two temporal clusters of mortalities but these involved different causes of death&#8212;the first related to CeMV and the second to extreme ulcerative dermatitis associated with presumed poxvirus infection [<xref rid="RSOS160838C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A suspected UME occurred in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins near Bunbury, Western Australia, during a 13-month period in 2008&#8211;2009. Four confirmed and three presumed mortalities were recorded out of 14 resident dolphins [<xref rid="RSOS160838C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Post-mortem examinations on four of the dolphins showed pathological evidence (lymphoid depletion, secondary bacterial and fungal infections, lungworm infections, poor body condition) similar to the Swan River UME, which suggests that the event was linked to CeMV.</p><p>Until the discovery of the Australian cases, bottlenose dolphins were involved in UMEs only along the east coast of the USA [<xref rid="RSOS160838C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Of the 18 cases in the USA since 1991, the cause of over 70% was considered undetermined, about 20% were caused by biotoxins and one was believed to be related to infectious disease. However, some of the events listed as &#8216;undetermined&#8217; were, at least in part, linked to morbillivirus: five confirmed and two suspected [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In a recent review of morbillivirus in cetaceans, Van Bressem <italic>et al</italic>.

Pathological evidence for the disease, with detection of the virus using IHC, was first reported in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Western Australia in 2009 [<xref rid="RSOS160838C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in a single common bottlenose dolphin from Queensland in 2010 [<xref rid="RSOS160838C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and in both these species during 2013 in this study.</p><p>The distribution of morbillivirus in infected dolphins collected from SVG during 2013 would have contributed significantly to morbidity in most cases. In dolphins that were PCR positive but IHC negative, the infection may have been limited to body regions that were not sampled for IHC, they may have been mild infections with low antigen loads or they may have been convalescing following non-fatal infection. Severe cutaneous bruising was frequently observed in dolphins that died during the 2013 UME and may also have contributed to mortality; however, its cause was not ascertained. This condition has not been described in other studies of morbillivirus-related UMEs.</p><p>There does not appear to be a consistent pattern to UMEs involving infectious disease: they are variable in geographical extent, number of mortalities and duration [<xref rid="RSOS160838C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rubio-Guerri <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] compared the pattern of cumulative mortality of dolphins (mostly striped dolphins, <italic>Stenella coeruleoabla</italic>) in the Mediterranean Sea during three UMEs separated by 11 years. The first two were characterized by a slow response [<xref rid="RSOS160838C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The final UME, in 2011, involved slightly fewer dolphins (37 versus approx. 50) and had a rapid increase in mortalities at the beginning of the event, similar to the SA 2013 UME. Fauquier <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] documented an extensive UME (mostly of common bottlenose dolphins) along the east coast of the USA during 2013 and 2014. It involved over 1250 dolphins and lasted at least 10 months. The pattern of mortalities was similar to the SA event in terms of an initial rapid increase but no second peak was observed during the USA event.</p><p>Unlike UMEs caused by biotoxins, those linked to infectious disease are likely to be complex and vary according to environmental and host factors. Environmental variables (e.g. fisheries interactions, toxic contaminants, higher than normal sea surface temperatures, limited prey availability) play a role [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Host population structure, size and dynamics (e.g. inbreeding, social structure, migration) and contact with other species are likely to also be important factors [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin is a resident, inshore species forming loose associations that occupy home ranges of up to 200&#8197;km along coasts with suitable habitat [<xref rid="RSOS160838C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There is potential, therefore, for a rapid spread of infectious disease and this appeared to be the case in SVG during 2013. Preliminary evidence shows that some Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins make movements of at least 100&#8197;km in SVG (T. Bartram 2015, personal communication). Limited gene flow between SVG and other parts of SA [<xref rid="RSOS160838C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] may, in part, explain why the UME was confined to that region. However, since CeMV was identified by PCR in SVG and elsewhere in SA before 2013, some factor, or factors, must have triggered the UME. There are no population estimates for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in SVG to indicate that population density was higher than normal before or during 2013.</p><p>The dolphin UME coincided with a major climatic anomaly in south eastern Australia, including SA, that resulted in water temperatures substantially higher (3&#8211;5&#176;C) than normal [<xref rid="RSOS160838C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Resulting phytoplankton blooms were monitored sporadically in SVG, with the primary species being a barbed diatom, <italic>Chaetoceros coarctatus</italic>. During late February to early April 2013, there were at least 17 fish die-offs in SA, mostly SVG. The fish died as a result of bacterial infection resulting from gill damage caused by this diatom [<xref rid="RSOS160838C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There was no evidence that the fish or the dolphins died as result of biotoxins produced during a harmful algal bloom. Although these have resulted in the deaths of large numbers of bottlenose dolphins elsewhere [<xref rid="RSOS160838C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS160838C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], there are no documented cases of this agent killing marine mammals in Australia.</p><p>The fish involved in the die-offs were primarily small benthic species [<xref rid="RSOS160838C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], none of which was identified in the stomachs of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins collected during the 2013 UME. One of the contributing factors to the UME may have been reduced prey availability, although this is speculative. Cephalopod beaks were the most numerous items in the examined stomachs. These are resistant to digestion and can remain in the stomach of a marine mammal for longer than otoliths [<xref rid="RSOS160838C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The lack of undigested prey indicated the dolphins had not consumed food just prior to death, which is additional evidence that an agent resulting in acute mortality (e.g. a biotoxin) was not involved in the UME.</p><p>Toxic contaminants are sometimes included in the possible factors contributing to UMEs of marine mammals [<xref rid="RSOS160838C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Organochlorines and other lipid-soluble toxins may act through immune compromise [<xref rid="RSOS160838C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. There has been limited analysis of these compounds in SA dolphins with a few elevated concentrations reported, e.g. PCB Arochlor 1260 up to 19.5&#8197;mg&#8197;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup> wet weight in an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin from SVG [<xref rid="RSOS160838C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Much more is known about the concentrations of heavy metals in SA dolphins. Lavery <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that levels of zinc, cadmium, mercury and lead are found in high concentrations in some Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins from the SA gulfs. An interesting future study would be to determine the concentrations of heavy metals in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins that died during the 2013 UME.</p><p>A large proportion of young (82%, less than 7 years) compared with older (18%, 12&#8211;17 years) Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins died during the UME in 2013, which is in contrast with some other studies. Chabanne <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] noted mixed age groups in the first peak of the Western Australian UME and only adults in the second. A very large UME of common bottlenose dolphins in the USA included all age groups [<xref rid="RSOS160838C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Epizootics of <italic>S. coeruleoalba</italic> in the Mediterranean Sea have involved various combinations of age groups [<xref rid="RSOS160838C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Biotoxin-related UMEs involve a relatively even distribution of age classes for marine mammals [<xref rid="RSOS160838C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Domingo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] discussed two scenarios relating to morbillivirus infections in marine mammals: (i) severe and with high mortality, the virus subsequently disappearing from the population and (ii) more or less severe with susceptible hosts always available for infection and epizootics cease because most individuals become immune from an early age. The disease can then become endemic in scenario two and would involve infected individuals over a considerable period of time [<xref rid="RSOS160838C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Future testing of archived samples (SAM), collected since 1985 from many cetacean species, would help to describe the prevalence and nature of disease processes of morbillivirus, brucellosis and toxoplasmosis in SA marine mammals.</p><p>Why has it taken so long for a major mortality event to occur in Australia when morbillivirus was identified in cetaceans collected as early as 1985 [<xref rid="RSOS160838C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]? Van Bressem <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] noted that pollution may increase the frequency of disease in marine mammals. This observation may explain why the North Atlantic has experienced so many large marine mammal UMEs since the environment there has been polluted by human activities for hundreds of years. By contrast, the Australian marine environment is generally unpolluted and pinnipeds and cetaceans inhabiting these waters may be more resilient to epizootics. Recurring UMEs associated with morbillivirus are known in many parts of the world [<xref rid="RSOS160838C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160838C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and are likely to occur in Australian cetaceans in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Electronic Supplementary Data: Details of collected carcasses examined in this study from SA during 2005&#8211;2013.
