However, the differential response of human leukocytes to MPLA and LPS has not been well characterized. The goal of this study was to compare the differential transcriptomic response of human blood to LPS and MPLA. Venous blood from human volunteers was stimulated with LPS, MPLA or vehicle. Gene expression was determined using microarray analysis. Among 21,103 probes profiled, 136 and 130 genes were differentially regulated by LPS or MPLA, respectively. Seventy four genes were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated by both ligands. The remaining genes were differentially induced by either agent. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that LPS and MPLA share similar upstream regulators and have comparable effects on canonical pathways and cellular functions. However, some pro-inflammatory cytokine and inflammasome-associated transcripts were more strongly induced by LPS. In contrast, only the macrophage-regulating chemokine CCL7 was preferentially up-regulated by MPLA. In conclusion, LPS and MPLA induce similar transcriptional profiles. However, LPS more potently induces pro-inflammatory cytokine and inflammasome-linked transcripts. Thus, MPLA is a less potent activator of the pro-inflammatory response but retains effective immunomodulatory activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is an integral component of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria and plays an essential role in membrane structural integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. LPS is comprised of a hydrophobic lipid A component that serves to anchor LPS in the membrane, a non-repeating core oligosaccharide and a distal polysaccharide, known as the O-antigen, that interacts with the extracellular environment and contributes to morphological traits of Gram negative bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Upon lysis of Gram negative bacteria, LPS can be released into the host environment where it activates the innate immune system by binding to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complex on macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells and B lymphocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Lipid A is the component of LPS that binds the TLR4 complex to initiate cellular activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. As such, lipid A mediates stimulation of the innate immune response and induces a robust inflammatory response characterized by cytokine and chemokine secretion, increased expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, leukocyte recruitment, alterations in vascular permeability and changes in vascular tone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, lipid A is the major component of Gram negative bacteria that is recognized by the immune system to facilitate the host response to infection. Systemic administration of LPS or lipid A induces a syndrome characterized by inflammation, hemodynamic instability, metabolic dysfunction and organ injury that is termed endotoxin shock and mimics many of the alterations present during severe sepsis and septic shock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>In addition to initiating the host response to Gram negative infection, LPS possesses immunomodulatory properties and, upon prior exposure, can modify the host response to subsequent LPS exposure or infection. Treatment with LPS will induce a state known as endotoxin tolerance in which the production of pro-inflammatory mediators is greatly attenuated in response to a subsequent LPS challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The induction of endotoxin tolerance has been shown to modulate the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response and to endow protection from a normally lethal LPS challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Other studies show that LPS priming will augment the host response to infection with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and polymicrobial peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The enhanced resistance to infection was associated with improved bacterial clearance and attenuated cytokine production. Thus, LPS possesses immunomodulatory properties that could be useful in augmenting the host response to infection in high risk and vulnerable patient populations.</p><p>Unfortunately, LPS is not an attractive agent for clinical use, owing to its toxicity in humans. However, the lipid A analog monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) provides a useful alternative. MPLA was initially prepared by hydrolysis of lipid A from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Minnesota Re 595 resulting in removal of the <italic>O</italic>-1 phosphate group. Removal of the <italic>O</italic>-1 phosphate group results in a product with low pro-inflammatory activity but potent immunomodulatory effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. As such, MPLA is currently employed as a component of FDA-approved vaccine adjuvant systems and is used in commercially available vaccines against papilloma viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. MPLA also has potent effects on the innate immune system. MPLA elicits endotoxin tolerance, and attenuates the pro-inflammatory cytokine surge and hemodynamic alterations in response to subsequent LPS challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Studies from our research group have consistently shown that priming with MPLA augments the innate host response to infection in murine models of sepsis, including CLP-induced bacterial peritonitis and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> burn wound infection, leading to improved survival outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Although LPS and MPLA have different impacts on innate immune system activation, the gene expression profiles induced by LPS and MPLA in humans have not been compared. We hypothesized that MPLA, when compared to LPS, is less potent in inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes while maintaining potent adjuvant properties and the ability to augment innate antimicrobial immunity. The main objective of the current study was to examine the differential transcriptomic response of human peripheral blood to LPS and MPLA using microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to better understand differences in the biological responses to each agent. This study enabled us to identify functional attributes of the differentially expressed transcripts and to uncover the interactions among the differentially expressed genes within treatment groups and with other molecules in the IPA database. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the transcriptomic profiles in human blood challenged with LPS and MPLA. Our findings have significant translational impact, because MPLA is an attractive immunomodulatory agent with application as a vaccine adjuvant and non-specific modifier of innate immune responses to infection.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microarray</title><p>The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI&#8217;s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE72557.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differentially Expressed Genes after LPS or MPLA Treatment</title><p>Gene expression profiles in LPS- or MPLA-treated human blood samples were assessed using microarray analysis.

Out of 136 differentially expressed genes in LPS group, 115 genes were significantly up-regulated and 21 were significantly down-regulated. In the MPLA group, 113 of 130 differentially expressed genes were up-regulated and 17 down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of note, in both groups, the number of up-regulated genes was approximately 6 times higher than that of down-regulated genes. Meanwhile, the numbers of total differentially expressed, up-regulated, and down-regulated genes were comparable between these two treatments.</p><p>To further assess the similar effects of these two TLR4 ligands, Venn diagrams were used to depict the overlap of genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated in human blood after LPS or MPLA treatment. Among up-regulated genes, 74 genes were commonly regulated by both TLR4 ligands, 41 genes were preferentially induced by LPS and 39 genes by MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Among the down-regulated genes, expression of 9 genes was regulated by both LPS and MPLA, while 12 genes were preferentially induced by LPS and 8 by MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering of these 83 commonly up- and down-regulated genes in blood samples treated with PBS, LPS and MPLA resulted in three distinct clusters distinguishing the six MPLA-treated and six LPS-treated blood samples from the remaining six control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>A list of commonly and differentially induced genes by LPS and MPLA is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2 and S3</xref>.

Our pathway-based analysis revealed that both LPS and MPLA activated 14 pathways, such as Toll-like receptor signaling, role of pattern recognition receptors, IL-6 signaling, TREM1 signaling, and acute phase response signaling. Besides these shared pathways, TNFR2 signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway genes were preferentially induced by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrows), while genes associated with chemokine signaling and IL-8 signaling were selectively induced by MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, arrows). On the other hand, 4 pathways (LXR/RXR activation, PPAR signaling, antioxidant action of vitamin C, and PPAR&#945;/RXR&#945; activation) were commonly inhibited by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Networks</title><p>We further identified the networks <italic>in silico</italic> using Molecular Activity Predictor analysis of IPA with the differentially expressed genes in human blood treated with LPS or MPLA. In both groups, the top predicted network is centered on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), and the network diagrams are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. TNF-&#945; is one of the most important and earliest induced cytokines in an inflammatory insult, which activates the TNF-&#945; receptor involved in innate immune cell function. Our data revealed that the TNF-&#945; network in LPS-treated human blood consists of 12 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>), which are predicted to be mainly associated with Small Molecule Biochemistry (<italic>G0S2, GCH1, KMO, KYNU</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>), Amino Acid Metabolism (<italic>GCH1, KMO, KYNU</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>), and Cardiovascular System Development and Function (<italic>GCH1, IL23A, PIM3</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>). Whereas, the TNF-&#945; network in MPLA-treated human blood consists of 15 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>), which are predicted to be mainly associated with Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction (<italic>CH25H, CYP, IFNB1</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>), Cellular Growth and Proliferation (<italic>Gm-csf, IFNB1, IL4I1, PIM3, SLAMF7</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>), and Hematological System Development and Function (<italic>CH25H, Gm-csf, IFNB1, IL4I1, PIM3, SLAMF7</italic>, and <italic>TNF</italic>). Similar patterns were found in the two network diagrams. For example, there were five genes predicted to be inhibited by TNF in both groups, and four of which are common among them (<italic>2</italic>&#8242;<italic>5</italic>&#8242;<italic>oas, Aconitase, CEBP</italic>, and <italic>CYP19</italic>). In addition, the same interactions between <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>CYP, CYP19</italic>, Ldh (complex), and <italic>GCH1</italic> were observed in both treatments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional Analysis</title><p>Using the datasets of modulated genes from the LPS and MPLA treatments, IPA Functional analysis generated predictions for significantly increased (z-score&#8201;&gt;&#8201;2) or decreased (z-score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#8722;2) activity in various cellular processes. The major altered biological functions are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>. In LPS treated human blood, activity of 23 biological functions was predicted to be increased. Those LPS-modulated genes were mostly related to cellular movement (51 genes), inflammatory response (42 genes), and cellular function and maintenance (42 genes). Whereas, inflammation of intestine (27 genes), infectious disease (24 genes), and organismal death (24 genes) were the only three decreased functions predicted by IPA in LPS-treated human blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Whereas there were 23 biological functions predicted to be increased upon MPLA treatment in human blood. Among them were functions related to tissue morphology (50 genes), cellular function and maintenance (45 genes), and cellular development (45 genes). The three decreased functions predicted by IPA in MPLA treated human blood were related to proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells (8 genes), inflammatory disease (14 genes), and infectious disease (11 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Upstream Analysis</title><p>The Upstream analysis section of the core analysis was used to identify the activation state of upstream regulators that could explain the observed gene expression profile alterations in LPS- and MPLA- treated human blood. The predicted top 12 activated and top 5 down-regulated regulators in human blood treated with TLR4 ligands are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>. High similarities were observed between LPS and MPLA groups as evidenced by the fact that there is only one distinct upstream regulator presented in each group, i.e., TLR7 was predicted to be activated only in LPS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, *) while IL1A only in MPLA-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>, *) human blood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF were predicted the most relevant activated upstream regulators in both treatments. Genes and molecules that are known to induce the activation of inflammatory genes were found among the predicted activated upstream regulators, and they were also found up-regulated in our data sets. For example, as compared to the PBS control group, <italic>TNF, IL1B</italic>, and <italic>IFNG</italic> were upregulated by 9.595, 7.290, and 4.849 folds, respectively, in LPS-treated human blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>), and 6.914, 6.192, and 3.757 folds, respectively, in MPLA-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Those predicted activated regulators included several chemical drugs, cytokines, and transmembrane receptors. The top predicted inhibited regulators included five kinase inhibitors (SB203580, U0126, LY294002, PD98059, and SP600125), and their targets are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genes that are Preferentially Modulated by LPS or MPLA</title><p>Despite the vast similar genomic response of human peripheral blood to LPS and MPLA, a further comparison of the effects of MPLA and LPS on human blood was performed. The genes that were more strongly induced by LPS or MPLA are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>. Among the 11 genes that were more responsive to LPS, 10 of them were cytokines or chemokines, including a number of inflammatory mediators (<italic>IFNB1, IL12B, IL1A, IL18</italic>, and <italic>IL23</italic>), and 2 were associated with the NLRP3 inlfammasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). In contrast, only one out of 12 genes that were preferentially modulated by MPLA is a cytokine, namely <italic>CCL7</italic>, a chemokine known to attract monocytes and regulate macrophage function, was not changed upon LPS challenge but was strongly upregulated by MPLA (<italic>14-fold</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Of note, the expression profile trends showed that, all of the LPS-more-responsive genes was also up-regulated by MPLA, but to a lower magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>); whereas the MPLA-more-responsive genes were not significantly modulated by LPS (&lt;1.3 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). In addition, <italic>IL6</italic> showed the greatest upregulation in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Data S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S6</xref>).</p><p>Further studies were undertaken to validate the observed differences in gene expression after LPS and MPLA challenge at the protein level. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with LPS or MPLA for 6 or 24&#8201;hours at 37&#8201;&#176;C and cytokine concentrations in conditioned media were measured. Concentrations of all measured cytokines, with the exception of CCL7 and IL-8, were more strongly induced by LPS than MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). IL-8 was strongly and equally induced by both agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A</xref>) and CCL7 production was more potently induced by MPLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8B</xref>). These results correlate with the qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The differential effects of LPS and MPLA on inflammasome activation was also further assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). To assess IL-1&#946; and IL-18 transcription, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with LPS or MPLA for 30&#8201;minutes and gene expression was assessed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9A</xref>). IL-1&#946; was equally induced by both agents whereas IL-18 expression was more potently induced by LPS. However, mature IL-1&#946; concentrations were higher in conditioned media from peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with LPS than with mature MPLA whereas no difference in IL-18 concentration was observed between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Inflammasome-associated protein expression was further assessed by Western blotting after incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS or MPLA for 6&#8201;hours. Intracellular NLRP3, pro-Caspase-1 and pro-IL-1&#946; were higher after incubation with LPS than with MPLA whereas as pro-IL-18 was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9C</xref> and D).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major findings of this study are that LPS and MPLA induce very similar transcriptional profiles and the canonical pathways activated by both agents are comparable. However, among commonly induced gene products there were differences in magnitude of expression in some cases. In addition, although there was significant overlap in gene expression, each agent induced expression of gene products that were not induced by the other based on our cut-off criteria. The most prominent differences were in the increased level of pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by LPS, when compared to MPLA. LPS more potently (&gt;2 fold over MPLA) induced expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts including <italic>IFNB1, IL12B, IL23, IL6, IL1A</italic> and <italic>IL18</italic>. We also observed a 1.5-fold increase in <italic>IL1B</italic> transcript expression after LPS challenge compared to MPLA (data not shown) and LPS more potently induced expression of NLRP3 mRNA, which further prompted our investigation of inflammasome activation. Our results show that LPS more potently induces intracellular expression of NLRP3, pro-Caspase-1 and pro-IL-1&#946; protein as well as secretion of IL-1&#946; by isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to MPLA. Those observations suggest that the enhanced pro-inflammatory activity of LPS is due, in part, to its ability to more potently activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate cleavage of pro-IL-1&#946;. Interestingly, IL-18 expression was more potently induced by LPS at the mRNA level but no differences in IL-18 protein expression were observed between groups. Most types of native LPS are potent inducers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and induce a potent pro-inflammatory response. In agreement with our results, Sch&#252;lke and colleagues showed that, as compared to its parent molecule LPS, MPLA induced a qualitatively similar but significantly less potent pro-inflammatory immune response in <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> human and mouse test systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. They further successfully generated a novel fusion protein consisting of MPLA and a model allergen Ovalbumin (MPLA&#8201;:&#8201;Ova), and demonstrated that MPLA&#8201;:&#8201;Ova can boost Th1, Th2, and Th17 TC-derived cytokine secretion and hence induce both stronger innate and adaptive immune responses compared to the mixture of both components<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Based on experimental evidence, Chilton and colleagues have postulated that LPS and native diphosphoryl lipid A potently induce NLRP3 expression resulting in increased NLRP3 protein production and effective inflammasome assembly whereas weak NLRP3 induction, as seen after MPLA exposure, fails to elicit adequate NLRP3 protein production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The functional importance of LPS-induced inflammasome activation <italic>in vivo</italic> was demonstrated by Vanden Berghe and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> who reported that both IL-1&#946;/IL-18 and Caspase-1 knockout mice are highly resistant to LPS-induced shock. Our results support the contention that LPS is a potent stimulus for inflammasome activation whereas MPLA is not and extend previous studies by demonstrating these differences in human blood. All previous studies on the differential induction of inflammasome activation by LPS and MPLA were performed in mice.</p><p>Despite its limited ability to induce a pro-inflammatory response, MPLA retains immunomodulatory properties associated with LPS. Work from our laboratory, and others, shows that priming of mice with either LPS or MPLA will non-specifically augment host resistance to bacterial infections caused by Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria as well as polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Both agents potently augment bacterial clearance mechanisms and potentiate neutrophil recruitment to sites of infection. LPS and MPLA also induce endotoxin tolerance and activate both the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The immunomodulatory properties of MPLA have been harnessed for clinical use as a component of FDA-approved, commercially available vaccine adjuvant systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The present study supports the concept that LPS and MPLA activate many common canonical pathways and activate those pathways with similar intensity. Canonical pathways are distinct from networks in that they are generated prior to data input, are based on the literature, and do not change upon data input, whereas networks are generated <italic>de novo</italic> on the basis of the researcher&#8217;s own input data. Biological understanding of the function of genes in pathways, and the currently available lists of &#8220;canonical&#8221; pathways are evolving rapidly. Among the canonical pathways that were similarly induced by both agents were TLRs, TREM-1, pattern recognition receptors, IL-6, HMGB-1, the acute phase response and MAP kinase activation. Downregulated pathways included peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and liver X/retinoid X receptors (LXR/RXR).</p><p>The similarities in induced gene expression among LPS and MPLA were further illustrated using networks and functions analysis. The Molecule Activity Predictor (MAP) tool in IPA enables one to simulate the upstream and/or downstream effects of activation or inhibition of molecules in a network given a starting set of neighboring molecules with &#8220;known&#8221; activity or expression. In both groups, the top predicted network is centered on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;).</p><p>The functions results of the IPA core analysis not only allowed transcripts to be grouped under particular functional annotations, but were also used to determine which functions were likely increased or decreased by integrating the direction of the fold change of a particular molecule and its documented impact on that function in the literature. In our study, among all the functions that were predicted to have significantly increased activity in both LPS and MPLA groups, only 5 functions were found distinct in each group and the inflammatory response and hematological system development were the shared top two predicted functions in the two groups.</p><p>In an effort to identify other potential drugs bearing immunomodulatory traits that are similar to LPS or MPLA, we used LPS- and MPLA-responsive genes and Ingenuity upstream regulator analysis to identify the upstream regulators that may cause similar gene expression changes compared to those induced by LPS and MPLA. Upstream regulators are defined as any molecule that can affect the expression of another molecule, including transcription factors, cytokines, drugs, and chemicals. Receptors and molecules that are known to induce the activation of inflammatory genes were found among the predicted activated upstream regulators for both compounds and had nearly complete overlap. The inhibitor analysis demonstrated complete overlap when comparing groups and indicates that LPS and MPLA activate MAP kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling.</p><p>There are limitations to our study. We did not perform FACS analysis to characterize the composition of the immune cells used in our array due to the known technical difficulties associated with performing the red blood cell lysis procedure. However, existing literatures have shown that, (1) the main targets of the LPS/MPLA treatment in human blood are monocytes and neutrophils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>; and (2) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the essential receptor for LPS recognition, is mainly expressed by monocytes (and neutrophils but at lower levels) in human peripheral blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In addition, in our study, the 90-minute incubation period is not long enough for cells to proliferate. Thus, the composition of leukocytes in the samples is unlikely to change during the treatment period.</p><p>On the other hand, our transcriptome analysis was based on the RNA extracted from the whole blood, not from the enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) fraction. Nevertheless, we validated many of the key findings using isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and extended observations at the transcriptional level by demonstrating parallel production and secretion of protein products. Yet, analysis of blood only provides an assessment of one organ system and may not represent the transcriptional response elicited in other tissues. However, the peripheral blood provides a rich source of leukocytes and is the only tissue readily available for harvest in humans. Our findings validate, in a human system, previous observations made in mouse models. The use of human systems is important for further development of TLR4 agonists for use in humans and supported by the success of MPLA as a vaccine adjuvant in humans.</p><p>LPS is known for its toxicity in humans, which precludes its clinical use; while MPLA, a less toxic derivative of LPS, is currently employed as an adjuvant in marketed vaccines. We have published results showing that MPLA is effective in broadly enhancing innate immune responses against multiple clinically relevant bacterial pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. As we move our studies forward, it is valuable to know the transcriptional response of human leukocytes to LPS and MPLA since the information will provide important insights to guide future mechanistic studies and characterize important similarities and differences in the transcriptional response to the two agents. In addition, our present study provides critical results to further advance our knowledge with respect to key differences in the molecular pathways that are differentially regulated by MPLA and LPS in humans PBMCs. This further enables to elucidate the molecular targets responsible for the preferential low toxicity of MPLA as compared to LPS. Finally, many previous studies were performed in mice. The present study advances knowledge regarding the transcriptional response in humans.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reagents and Dosing</title><p>Both LPS (Catalog number: L2630) and MPLA (Catalog number: L6895) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.

IPA program generates an activation &#8220;z-score&#8221; for each functional category, which indicates the effects to the biological process are trending towards an increase (a positive z-score) or a decrease (a negative z-score). This provides a prediction of activation or inhibition of each function annotation.
