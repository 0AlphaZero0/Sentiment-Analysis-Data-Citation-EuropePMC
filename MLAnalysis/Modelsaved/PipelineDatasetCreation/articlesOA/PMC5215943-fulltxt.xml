Licensed HPV vaccines contain virus-like particles (VLP) self-assembled from L1 major capsid proteins that provide type-restricted protection against mucosal HPV infections causing cervical and other ano-genital and oro-pharyngeal carcinomas and warts (condylomas), but do not target heterologous HPV. Experimental papillomavirus vaccines have been designed based on L2 minor capsid proteins that contain type-common neutralization epitopes, to broaden protection to heterologous mucosal and cutaneous HPV types. Repetitive display of the HPV16 L2 cross-neutralization epitope RG1 (amino acids (aa) 17&#8211;36) on the surface of HPV16 L1 VLP has greatly enhanced immunogenicity of the L2 peptide. To more directly target cutaneous HPV, L1 fusion proteins were designed that incorporate the RG1 homolog of beta HPV17, the beta HPV5 L2 peptide aa53-72, or the common cutaneous HPV4 RG1 homolog, inserted into DE surface loops of HPV1, 5, 16 or 18 L1 VLP scaffolds. Baculovirus expressed chimeric proteins self-assembled into VLP and VLP-raised NZW rabbit immune sera were evaluated by ELISA and L1- and L2-based pseudovirion (PsV) neutralizing assays, including 12 novel beta PsV types. Chimeric VLP displaying the HPV17 RG1 epitope, but not the HPV5L2 aa53-72 epitope, induced cross-neutralizing humoral immune responses to beta HPV. <italic>In vivo</italic> cross-protection was evaluated by passive serum transfer in a murine PsV challenge model. Immune sera to HPV16L1-17RG1 VLP (cross-) protected against beta HPV5/20/24/38/96/16 (but not type 76), while antisera to HPV5L1-17RG1 VLP cross-protected against HPV20/24/96 only, and sera to HPV1L1-4RG1 VLP cross-protected against HPV4 challenge. In conclusion, RG1-based VLP are promising next generation vaccine candidates to target cutaneous HPV infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001821</institution-id><institution>Vienna Science and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LS11-006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5588-4179</contrib-id><name><surname>Kirnbauer</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant to RK from the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wwtf.at">www.wwtf.at</ext-link>) (Life Science Call 2011) (LS11-006).

More than 200 human PV (HPV) genotypes have been completely sequenced and classified into five genera: alpha, beta, gamma, mu and nu (pave.niaid.nih.gov; hpvcenter.se) [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While genus alpha contains HPV types that infect mucosal or cutaneous epithelia, types of the other genera predominantly infect the skin, although site specificity is not complete [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mucosal HPV can be divided into high (hr) or low-risk (lr) types based upon their oncogenic potential. Alpha HPV infections cause ano-genital warts (condylomata acuminata), and persistent infection with hr types may cause cervical cancers (CxCa), most anal cancers, and a subset of vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oro-pharyngeal (tonsil and base of tongue) cancers. About 13 mucosal hr types, in particular HPV16 and 18, account for practically all CxCa cases worldwide, while lr HPV, most often HPV6 and 11, cause benign genital warts and, infrequently, recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis. Common cutaneous types HPV1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 27, 57 induce benign common and palmo-plantar warts, a frequent nuisance in children, but also in adults and immunosuppressed patients, causing a significant burden to health care systems [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most HPV infections and associated lesions eventually regress due to a cell-mediated immune response [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in immunosuppressed patients including HIV positive and organ transplant recipients (OTR), warts are more numerous, tend to persist, are more difficult to treat and prevalence increases with time of immunosuppression [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>A group of HPV types belonging to genus beta are hypothesized to play a role as adjunct to the main carcinogen UV light in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in immunosuppressed OTR and HIV-positive patients. Although beta HPV are detected in skin swabs or hair bulbs from normal individuals by highly sensitive nested PCR, infections appear to be contained by the immune system. Beta HPV have originally been identified in patients with the rare genodermatosis Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), who typically present with generalized flat warts and scaly plaques. Early in life EV patients develop multiple NMSC, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) or basal cell carcinomas (BCC), predominantly on sun-exposed areas [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The genodermatosis is most often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and 90% of patients show homozygous mutations in EVER1 or EVER2 genes that encode for membrane transporters important for zinc homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This defect appears associated with increased susceptibility for infections exclusively with beta HPV, and especially hr HPV5 and 8 are found in 90% of EV skin cancers. Beta HPV DNA is also detected in approximately 80% of SCC in OTR, who have a 65-100-fold increased risk to develop NMSC compared to the normal population [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>While the role of beta HPV causing NMSC in EV patients is long established, their role in development of NMSC in OTR is less clear. Beta HPV infections of the skin are acquired very early in life, even a few days after birth, reaching an overall prevalence of approximately 90% with increasing age without causing clinical symptoms. Studies have revealed increased beta HPV DNA carriage in cutaneous SCC compared to perilesional skin, whereas prevalence and viral load appear higher in precancerous actinic keratoses, opposite to the findings in EV patients [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast to hr mucosal HPV-associated or EV cancers, the beta HPV genome appears never integrated into the host DNA [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies on the mechanism how beta HPV may cause skin cancer revealed that beta HPV affect cell cycle and regulatory pathways less profoundly than and via mechanisms somewhat distinct to hr mucosal HPV types [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Low viral load and lack of E6 and E7 dependence of cancer progression point towards a role of beta HPV in the early stages of skin carcinogenesis, but not in tumor maintenance (i.e. a potential &#8220;hit-and-run&#8221; mechanism).</p><p>Licensed HPV vaccines are based upon recombinant major structural protein L1 self-assembled into VLP that are immunologically and morphologically similar to native virions [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The main mechanism of vaccine efficacy is the induction of high-titer neutralizing antibodies that provide type-restricted protection against infections with vaccine-included HPV types. Vaccination is most beneficial prior to onset of sexual activity, whereas there is no therapeutic effect on existing infections or induced lesions. Licensed vaccines target HPV16/18 (bivalent Cervarix<sup>&#174;</sup>), HPV16/18/6/11 (quadrivalent Gardasil<sup>&#174;</sup>), or HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58/6/11 (nonavalent Gardasil-9), with the potential to protect against 70&#8211;90% of all CxCa cases and, for the latter two vaccines against 90% of genital warts. However, they do not protect against the mucosal types associated with the remaining 10% of CxCa cases requiring cervical screening programs to be maintained in vaccinated women [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, they are unlikely to target any cutaneous HPV because of the type-restricted nature of the induced neutralizing immune response and limited cross-protection to even very closely related mucosal types.</p><p>Immunosuppressed patients could tremendously profit from a vaccine targeting a broader type spectrum including mucosal and cutaneous HPV since they are often infected with unusual and rare types [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. HPV vaccinations have proven safe and immunogenic in immunosuppressed patients, inducing seroconversion in 95&#8211;100% of HIV-positive patients, but antibody titers were lower compared to healthy controls, which might be improved by additional vaccine boosts [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly, a prevalent infection with one vaccine-targeted HPV type did not negatively influence antibody induction against other vaccine types, and no effect was seen on CD4+ cell counts or HIV RNA levels. Few studies have been conducted in OTR populations, but available data suggests that licensed HPV vaccines are safe, yet of suboptimal immunogenicity when applied post-transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Less than 50% of OTR seroconverted after Gardasil immunization, and patients immunized early after transplantation showed the lowest responses, suggesting that OTR should be ideally vaccinated prior to transplantation.</p><p>In order to extend the type-restricted protection provided by current L1-VLP HPV vaccines towards more distantly related types, several groups have employed the minor capsid protein L2 of PV as immunogen, which can induce low-level neutralizing antibodies to the homologous types, and also cross-neutralization to heterologous HPV types [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Encouraged by the broad spectrum protection achieved by our previous RG1-VLP vaccine, the aim of this study was to design L2-based chimeric immunogens that specifically target cutaneous HPV, using L1 VLP of mucosal or cutaneous types as scaffold. Using this strategy, L1 fusion proteins were generated that display the inserted L2 peptide repetitively and closely spaced on the VLP surface which is expected to greatly increase the L2 peptide&#8217;s immunogenicity and to retain at least some of the type-specific L1 conformational epitopes required for induction of high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Because of their less complex (single- or oligo-valent) antigen formulation L2-displaying VLP vaccines are potentially less expensive than multivalent L1 VLP vaccines, with the capacity to greatly increase the protective spectrum. Eventually, it is envisaged to combine several chimeric VLP as a pan-HPV vaccine to provide protection against all relevant cutaneous and mucosal HPV types associated with human pathologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design of chimeric VLP</title><p>Genes encoding chimeric fusion proteins were designed using CLC DNA workbench (CLC bio) based on either HPV5 L1/L2 (NC_001531), HPV16 L1 (HPV16 L1 variant 114K; EU118173) and HPV17 L2 (X74469), HPV1 L1 (NC_001356) and HPV4 L2 (NC_001457), or HPV18 L1 (AY262282) GenBank entries.

The HPV5 L2 peptide aa53-72 was chosen by homology to another cross-neutralization epitope aa56-75 of HPV16 L2 [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In total five chimeric fusion genes i.e. HPV16L1-17RG1, HPV5L1-17RG1, HPV16L1-5L2(aa53-72), HPV18L1-5L2(aa53-72), and HPV1L1-4RG1 were synthesized and cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector. The HPV16 L1 scaffold has previously proven highly efficient in epitope display, though presenting the RG1 epitope of beta HPV17 by beta HPV5 L1 might be more advantageous in providing high-titer type-specific immunity to HPV5. In addition, because of their proven efficacy for foreign epitope display, HPV16 and 18 L1 were chosen to present the HPV5 L2 epitope aa53-72. Both HPV1 and 4 are difficult to target by heterologous single formulation L1-RG1 antigens because of their distant relatedness, thus HPV1 L1 was used as scaffold to present the HPV4 RG1 epitope homolog (HPV1L1-4RG1).</p><p>Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by plaque purification, amplified, and fusion proteins expressed by infection of Sf9 cells and verified by SDS-PAGE. By Coomassie staining, the five fusion proteins migrated around 50kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Additional bands likely correspond to contaminating Sf9 proteins as well as degradation products and oligomers of recombinant L1-RG1 proteins. By Western Blot, anti-L1 mAb Camvir-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) recognized HPV16L1-17RG1, HPV16L1-5L2(aa53-72), HPV18L1-5L2(aa53-72) and HPV1L1-4RG1, whereas HPV5L1-17RG1 was identified by an HPV5 L1 VLP-raised serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The respective L2 peptides in fusion proteins HPV5L1-17RG1, HPV16L1-17RG1 and HPV1L1-4RG1 were verified by an antiserum raised against HPV16 L2 aa11-200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Additionally, larger bands corresponding to multimers, and smaller bandings indicating degradation products can be observed that appear specific for chimeric proteins, as the uninfected Sf9 cell extract did not show any reactivity with used mAb and polyclonal serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g001">Fig 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>).

Similar to above results, neutralizing mAb binding to native chimeric VLP was weak as compared to wt HPV16 L1+L2 VLP, indicating that epitope insertion interfered with mAb binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169533.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

The HPV16 L2 aa11-200-raised serum very weakly cross-reacted with chimeric VLP containing the HPV5 L2 peptide under both conditions, and control mAb Camvir-1 preferentially bound denatured VLP.

Beta HPV DNA is more frequently detected in premalignant actinic keratosis than in NMSC and only a minority of cancer cells harbor viral DNA, supporting a possible role in initiation but not maintenance of the tumor phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study using the natural Mastomys natalensis papillomavirus (MnPV) mouse model, prophylactic vaccination of na&#239;ve mice, and even therapeutic vaccination of previously infected animals protected against development of MnPV-associated skin cancer [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therapeutic efficacy in infected mice was mediated by neutralizing antibodies that prevented the establishment of novel MnPV-induced skin lesions, although MnPV L1-VLP vaccination failed to eradicate the virus. In humans, natural HPV16 infection induced limited B cell memory and usually non-neutralizing antibodies, whereas a single vaccine dose in HPV16 seropositives induced neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Immunization of EV patients and OTR with a vaccine that targets oncogenic beta HPV infections could potentially prevent development of NMSC if administered early. This approach might confirm or refute the hypothesis that beta-HPV play an adjunct role in NMSC, as hit-and-run type mechanisms are very difficult to demonstrate otherwise. Seropositivity for multiple beta HPV types has been linked with increased risk to NMSC development. Organ transplant patients are frequently infected with multiple beta types, and the number of different types increased with duration on immunosuppressive therapy. Thus timely immunization, preferably before start of immunosuppression, might prevent infection with not yet encountered beta HPV types reducing the risk for NMSC development [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>We have used the RG1 homologs of beta HPV or a common cutaneous type as type-common experimental vaccine antigens to more directly target cutaneous HPV, compared to a previous HPV16-based chimeric RG1-VLP (HPV16L1-16RG1) immunogen [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The HPV17 RG1 epitope was chosen because of conserved sequence homology (85&#8211;100%) to a panel of different beta HPV raising the possibility to induce broad cross-neutralization within this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169533.s006">S3 Table</xref>).</p><p>Previously, expression of recombinant HPV L1 proteins in insect cells has shown that truncation of the nuclear targeting and DNA binding signals at the C-terminus of HPV16 and HPV18 L1 reduced incorporation of cellular DNA, whereas the capacity to assemble in immunogenic VLP was retained [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition to full length recombinant proteins, smaller bands are observed by SDS-PAGE or Western blot in our chimeric VLP preparations that likely correspond to proteolytic degradation products including C-terminal truncated L1 proteins, i.e. prominent ~45 kDa bands for HPV16L1-5L2(aa53-72) and HPV18L1-5L2(aa53-72), or ~50 kD bands for HPV5L1-17-RG1. We may speculate that chimeric L1 proteins with at least smaller C-terminal proteolytic truncations are incorporated into assembled VLP.</p><p>The current standard approach to assess neutralizing antibodies, which are the main effectors of protection induced by L1 VLP vaccination, is by &#8216;L1- sensitive&#8217; PsV-based neutralization assays (L1-PBNA). However, the L1-PBNA was shown to be less sensitive and thereby possibly underestimating the extent of L2-mediated cross-protective humoral responses. Consequently, a novel L2-based neutralization assay that detects L2-mediated neutralization (L2-PBNA) with higher sensitivity, as well as L1-targeted neutralization, was employed to analyse the (cross-) neutralization spectrum of chimeric VLP [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Unexpectedly, for antisera to HPV5L1-17RG1 VLP low type-specific neutralizing titers to homologous HPV5 were detected <italic>in vitro</italic> which were not protective against HPV5 PsV challenge <italic>in vivo</italic>, while cross-neutralization was observed against additional 5 of 13 beta HPV by L2-PBNA. Nevertheless, mice passively immunized with sera raised against chimeric HPV5L1-17RG1 VLP were partially protected against experimental challenge with HPV20, 24 and 96 PsV, but not against HPV38 and 76. These results suggest that 17RG1 epitope insertion into and sequence replacement of the DE loop disrupted or sterically hindered major HPV5 L1 neutralization epitope(s) exposure in the chimeric HPV5L1-17RG1 VLP. Unfortunately, mAb to analyze chimeric and parental HPV5 VLP for type-specific neutralization epitopes were not available. However, the binding of HPV16-neutralizing mAb H16.V5 was recently mapped to 17 residues found in five intertwined loops of two neighboring L1 molecules, comprising the DE and HI loops of one L1 and the BC, DE and FG loops of an adjacent L1 [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Involved DE residues have shown to include aa138/139 as well as aa142/143/144 of the two HPV16 L1 molecules, and corresponding residues would have been replaced by the HPV17 RG1 in chimeric HPV5L1-17RG1 VLP (replacement of aa132-145), therefor disrupting a possible homolog of the major neutralizing epitope. Further, HPV5L1-17RG1 also did not mount cross-neutralizing antibodies against the closely related HPV8 as observed for the HPV5 L1 VLP-raised serum, which is in agreement with an abrogated L1-dependent immune response [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Neutralizing mAb H16.V5 has been shown to block 75% of reactive human sera with HPV16 VLP. Although reactivity of H16.V5 with HPV16L1-17RG1 VLP was rather weak, immune sera conferred complete type-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> protection against HPV16 PsV challenge, indicating the chimeric HPV16 VLP retained protective immunogenicity. RG1 epitope insertion at L1 positions 136/137 might have disrupted the DE loop involvement in the H16.V5 recognition site, while residual binding might be due to the remaining FG residues. MAb 263.A2 appears to have a similar binding pattern to that of H16.V5, with FG and HI loop residues recognized by both mAb defining a complex epitope recognized by a majority of human sera in response to natural HPV16 infection [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. No reactivity was seen between chimeric VLP and HPV16-neutralizing mAb H16.E70 whose recognition site was mapped to the FG and DE loop as well [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Of importance, HPV16L1-17RG1 VLP were able to raise antisera with type-specific HPV16 titers of 10,000, and cross-neutralization against 10 of 14 tested beta types HPV5/8/20/24/36/23/80/49/92/96. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments further confirmed immunogen-mediated (cross-) protection against challenge with HPV20, 96 and the homologous HPV16, while partial protection was observed against HPV5, 24 and 38.</p><p>Even though chimeric VLP generated herein were primarily designed to target cutaneous HPV, we decided to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> protection by murine vaginal challenge, because infection at the cutaneous site with beta HPV5, a type showing usually high <italic>in vivo</italic> infectivity, was much lower and more variable when compared to infection of the vaginal mucosal and thus did not allow robust analysis of vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169533.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Of note, although previously considered strictly cutaneous types, beta HPV have been found to frequently infect anal and oral mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169533.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p><p>Novel beta HPV PsV types were designed according to HPV prevalence in NMSC of both immune-suppressed and immune&#8212;competent patients, and to provide at least one type representative of different beta HPV species [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In general, novel beta HPV PsV showed variable infectivity and not all were useful <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of 12 novel types, HPV17 and 93 PsV showed no <italic>in vitro</italic> infectivity, while by TEM correctly sized PsV were observed for HPV17, but not for HPV93. Re-evaluation of the used HPV17 L1 and L2 sequences (NCBI entry X74469, last accessed 09&#8211;2016) revealed that 12 C-terminal aa of its L2 protein were predicted to be missing (residues 525&#8211;536: SLKKRKRKRKYL) by comparison to the HPV17 L2 sequence entry from the HPV PAVE homepage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/">https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>, last accessed 09&#8211;2016). The missing sequence is highly conserved to the C-terminus of HPV16 L2 that contains a nuclear localization signal (aa454-462), a nuclear export signal (aa462-471) and a dynein-binding site (the last C-terminal 40 aa) [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Mutations in the latter site have shown to greatly reduce infectivity possibly resulting from failed transport along microtubules towards the nucleus. This predicts that the HPV17 L2 homolog to this dynein-binding site is missing and likely explains why HPV17 PsV carrying a C-terminal 12 aa deleted L2 were non-infectious while capsid assembly was retained.</p><p>The second L2 epitope used in this study is the HPV5 L2 aa53-72 homolog of HPV16 L2 aa56-75. The latter epitope has originally been described to induce cross-neutralizing antibodies against mucosal hr types [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. More recently the HPV58 homolog of this epitope was inserted either alone, or together with the HPV31 RG1 epitope into the HPV18 L1 C-terminal arm and DE loop. Resulting chimeric VLP immunogens induced cross-neutralization against several tested HPV, including the beta type HPV5, alpha lr HPV11 and hr HPV33/45/58 [<xref rid="pone.0169533.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These results obtained with mucosal HPV stand in stark contrast to results herein, demonstrating that antisera raised against the HPV5 L2 aa53-72-augmented chimeric immunogens failed to induce cross-neutralization against any of the beta HPV types tested including homologous type HPV5 despite induction of antibodies to the inserted epitope. The HPV5 peptide homolog to HPV16 L2 aa56-75 was regarded a potentially promising epitope because of a &gt;85% sequence homology to a panel of different beta HPV types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169533.s007">S4 Table</xref>), including HPV76 or 38 that were not or only partially cross-neutralized by antisera to HPV17 RG1-containing VLP. We may speculate that structural differences between mucosal and cutaneous beta HPV types exist that account for these discrepant results.</p><p>Common cutaneous types HPV1 and HPV4 are more difficult to target by a single formulation immunogen due to their distant relatedness to other types, thus we decided to insert the RG1 epitope of HPV4 into the L1 DE loop of HPV1. The polyclonal anti-HPV16 L2 serum showed similar reactivity with chimeric HPV1L1-4RG1 protein under both native and denatured conditions by ELISA, consistent with exposure of a linear L2 epitope on the VLP surface. This was corroborated by L2 peptide ELISA revealing the induction of high anti-RG1 titers by rabbit vaccination with chimeric HPV1L1-4RG1 VLP, thus pointing towards an immunogenic epitope presentation on the VLP surface. We were unable to evaluate whether induced sera neutralize homologous HPV1, as PsV assays are not available for this type despite multiple attempts (Chris Buck, pers. comm.). Antisera were neutralizing <italic>in vitro</italic> and partially protected <italic>in vivo</italic> against HPV4 challenge, likely by targeting the homologous HPV4 RG1 epitope. However, antisera failed to cross-neutralize distantly related cutaneous alpha and beta HPV by PBNA, which is likely due to &#8804;50% RG1 sequence homology to tested cutaneous types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169533.s008">S5 Table</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, chimeric VLP immunogens that display cross-neutralization L2-RG1 epitopes of cutaneous HPV types are evolving as a promising tool to develop next generation L2-based prophylactic vaccines with broad-spectrum protection against HPV types associated with skin pathologies in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169533.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Evaluation of L1-17RG1 chimeric VLP by ELISA.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Reactivity of non-neutralizing mAb Camvir-1 and HPV16-neutralizing mAb H16.5A, H16.14J, 263.A2 with native or denatured HPV16L1-17RG1 VLP.
