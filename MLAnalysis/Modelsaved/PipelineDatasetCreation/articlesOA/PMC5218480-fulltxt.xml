Outcomes for patients with AML remain poor, highlighting the need for novel treatment options. Aberrant epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, and inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes have exhibited activity in preclinical AML models. Combination studies with HDAC inhibitors plus DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have potential beneficial clinical activity in AML, however the toxicity profiles of non-selective HDAC inhibitors in the combination setting limit their clinical utility. In this work, we describe the preclinical development of selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are hypothesized to have improved safety profiles, for combination therapy in AML. We demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is sufficient to achieve efficacy both as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine in preclinical models of AML, including established AML cell lines, primary leukemia cells from AML patient bone marrow samples and <italic>in vivo</italic> xenograft models of human AML. Gene expression profiling of AML cells treated with either an HDAC1/2 inhibitor, azacitidine, or the combination of both have identified a list of genes involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation as potential mediators of the combinatorial effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition with azacitidine. Together, these findings support the clinical evaluation of selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors in combination with azacitidine in AML patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by Acetylon Pharmaceuticals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acetylon.com">http://www.acetylon.com</ext-link>).

Treatment options for AML patients are limited and outcomes are poor [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There is a high unmet medical need in these patients for novel treatment options. Considering the high intrinsic genetic instability and heterogeneity of AML, it is generally believed that combination regimens will be necessary to achieve the desired clinical efficacy. Recent discoveries have highlighted an important role of dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AML [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Epigenetic changes include DNA modifications, such as cytosine methylation, modifications of histone proteins, such as histone acetylation and histone methylation, and RNA-associated gene silencing. Development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors has been the most successful in this disease. VIDAZA<sup>&#174;</sup> (azacitidine), which has demonstrated efficacy in AML preclinical models [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of elderly patients with AML. HDAC inhibitors are another class of epigenetic therapies which are under extensive development for AML and other hematologic malignancies. In multiple preclinical models of AML, HDAC inhibitors such as panobinostat, vorinostat, or entinostat, have demonstrated antitumor activities either as a single agent or in combination settings through induction of differentiation, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. HDAC inhibitors have also shown promising clinical activity in combination with agents with known anti-leukemia activity, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and chemotherapies, in AML patients [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, adding non-selective HDAC inhibitors to combination regimens often results in increased toxicities which can lead to dose reduction and early treatment discontinuation [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, isozyme-selective HDAC inhibitors with improved safety profiles may overcome this hurdle and provide additional clinical benefit to patients.</p><p>In humans there are 11 classical HDAC isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HDACs 1&#8211;3 are enzymatically active members of transcriptional corepressor complexes, responsible for chromosomal compaction and gene repression through removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histones. Initial genetic dissection of the role of specific HDACs in murine models has revealed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 play redundant and essential roles in tumor cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, co-inhibition of HDAC1 with HDAC2 by genetic and pharmacological approaches was shown to mediate robust pro-apoptotic responses in models of lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is sufficient for anti-tumor activities in AML.</p><p>Here, we describe the preclinical development of series of oral and selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2 based upon the biaryl aminobenzamide scaffold [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

Azacitidine was administered intravenously (i.v.) twice weekly at 5.5 mg/kg in saline while ACY-957 was administered orally (p.o.) daily at 125 mg/kg in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in deionized water. Mice were treated for 28 days. The dosing schedule was chosen based on tolerability of the treatment as well as pharmacokinetic profile of ACY-957 in mice. Tumors were measured twice weekly in two dimensions using calipers and volume was calculated by width<sup>2</sup> x length/2. Animals were monitored individually for tumor growth until day 34. Each animal was euthanized for tumor progression when its tumor reached the 2000 mm<sup>3</sup> volume endpoint and time to endpoint (TTE) was determined for each mouse. To calculate TTE, tumor volume data were log transformed and linear regression performed on the data set comprising the first observation that exceeded the endpoint volume and the three consecutive observations that immediately preceded the attainment of the endpoint volume. TTE for each mouse was calculated with the following equation: TTE = log<sub>10</sub> [(endpoint volume)&#8211;intercept]/slope of linear regression. In instances in which the log-transformed calculated TTE preceded the day prior to reaching endpoint or exceeded the day of reaching tumor volume endpoint, a linear interpolation was performed to approximate TTE. Any animal determined to have died from treatment-related causes was assigned a TTE value equal to the day of death. Any animal that died from non-treatment-related causes was excluded from the analysis. Any animal that did not reach endpoint was euthanized at the end of the study and assigned a TTE equal to the last study day (Day 34). Survival curve was plotted using GraphPad Prism 6 and statistical analysis performed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.</p><p>All animal work was performed at Charles River Discovery Services, Morrisville, NC (CR DS-NC). The identity of MOLM-13 cell line was validated and documented by Charles River Discovery Services. The study was approved by the CR DS-NC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The group is not euthanized and recovery is allowed. Within a group with more than 20% weight loss, individuals hitting the individual body weight loss endpoint will be euthanized. If the group treatment related body weight loss is recovered to within 10% of the original weights, dosing may resume at a lower dose or less frequent dosing schedule. Exceptions to non-treatment body weight % recovery may be allowed on a case-by-case basis based on veterinary approval in consultation with the Study Director.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Gene expression microarray analysis</title><p>MV-4-11 cells were treated for 48 hours with vehicle DMSO, 1 &#956;M ACY-1035, 1 &#956;M azacitidine or the combination of 1 &#956;M azacitidine plus 1 &#956;M ACY-1035.

Importantly, it has been reported that HDAC1 and HDAC2 play essential and redundant roles in leukemia cell survival and proliferation, establishing the plausibility that HDAC inhibitors selective for these two isozymes might retain anti-leukemic activity while obviating toxicity associated with inhibition of other HDACs, such as HDAC3 [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In fact, HDAC3 plays an essential role in maintaining chromatin structure and genome stability [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Mouse knockout studies have also shown that HDAC3 is necessary for maintenance of several metabolic functions in both cardiac and hepatic tissues [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this study we demonstrated that HDAC1/2-selective inhibitors, namely ACY-957 and ACY-1035 of the biaryl aminobenzamide class, inhibited the viability of AML cells, increased their expression of the differentiation marker CD11b, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, both as single agents and in combination with azacitidine. Analysis of patient bone marrow samples demonstrated that a large majority of these primary AML samples were highly sensitive to the combination of ACY-957 with azacitidine, and ACY-957 significantly prolonged the survival and enhanced the anti-tumor activity of azacitidine in an AML xenograft model without adding additional toxicities. Together, these results demonstrate that selective pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1/2 is sufficient to mediate synergistic anti-cancer activity in combination with azacitidine in preclinical models of AML. These findings have laid a foundation for further investigations to characterize the pharmacology and therapeutic index of this combination in efficacy and toxicology studies. Furthermore, additional studies to explore the combination of HDAC1/2 inhibitors with a range of existing and emerging AML therapies are warranted.</p><p>DNA methylation and histone acetylation are well-characterized epigenetic mechanisms which can result in repression of tumor suppressor genes and cell transformation [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In fact, reduction of DNA methylation by azacitidine and induction of histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitors, both of which lead to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes, are believed to contribute significantly to their therapeutic effects. Gene expression profiling in this study identified critical AML tumor suppressor genes which may play important roles in mediating the combinatorial effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition with azacitidine. Specifically, gene expression profiling showed that 199 genes were further up-regulated by combination treatment over either single agent, among which several tumor suppressor genes were identified. CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN1C (p57) are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of several G1 cyclin complexes [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].

Therefore, these genes may play important roles in mediating the suppressive effects of the combination treatment on cell cycle progression. HES1 and GATA2 are transcription factors that may play important roles in driving the broad changes in gene expression resulting from combination treatment. Elevated endogenous levels of HES1 have been associated with longer relapse-free survival and increased overall survival in AML patients [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and overexpression of HES1 in AML cell lines suppressed their growth and increased the expression of CDKN1A [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. GATA2 is known to be dysregulated through genetic mutations or epigenetic silencing in subsets of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169128.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. GATA2 was shown to be hypermethylated in <italic>TET2;Flt3</italic><sup>ITD</sup> AML progenitor cells and ectopic expression of GATA2 significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of these cells [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Moreover, GATA2 has been shown to be a direct target of ACY-957 in hematopoietic progenitor cells [<xref rid="pone.0169128.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In agreement with these results, we also found that GATA2 expression was induced in AML cells by HDAC1/2 inhibitors or azacitidine and this induction was further enhanced by combination treatments. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GATA2 reduced the proliferation of MV-4-11 cells, suggesting GATA2 might play a role in mediating the anti-leukemic activity of the combination of HDAC1/2 inhibition with azacitidine. In addition, our analysis identified additional 7 categories of genes which exhibited additive or synergistic changes in the combination treatment relative to single agent treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169128.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). It is possible that some of these genes can contribute to the anti-leukemic activities of this combination as well.</p><p>Together, our findings demonstrate that selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors are efficacious both as single agents and in combination with azacitidine in inhibiting proliferation of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts from patients. Importantly, HDAC1/2 inhibitor ACY-957 significantly enhances the anti-leukemic activity of azacitidine in the MOLM13 xenograft model of AML. Further preclinical studies are warranted to characterize the therapeutic application of HDAC1/2 inhibitors in AML in multiple combination settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>ACY-1035 did not inhibit HDAC4 through 9 at the maximum concentration tested of 20 &#956;M.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>HDAC1/2 inhibition increases histone acetylation.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>HDAC1/2 inhibition reduces viability of AML cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>ACY-957 inhibits proliferation of primary leukemic blasts from AML patients.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Gene expression profiling analysis.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0169128.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>TTE for individual mouse.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0169128.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank James Bradner, Ralph Mazitschek, Kenneth Jacobs and Nikolaus Trede for their scientific insights and support of the HDAC1/2 inhibitor program.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0169128.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gilliland</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tallman</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Focus on acute leukemias</article-title>. <source>Cancer Cell</source>. <year>2002</year>;<volume>1</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>417</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>20</lpage>. <?supplied-pmid 12124171?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12124171</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0169128.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bose</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Orphan drug designation for pracinostat, volasertib and alvocidib in AML</article-title>. <source>Leuk Res</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>38</volume>(<issue>8</issue>):<fpage>862</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>5</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.leukres.2014.06.007</pub-id>
