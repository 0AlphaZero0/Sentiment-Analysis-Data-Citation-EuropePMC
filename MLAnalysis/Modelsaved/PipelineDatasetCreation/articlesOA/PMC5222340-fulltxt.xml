Here, we present the crystal structure of wild-type Sso7c4 at a high resolution of 1.63 &#197;, showing that the two basic C-termini are disordered. Based on the fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay, two arginine pairs, R11/R22&#8242; and R11&#8242;/R22, on the top surface participate in binding DNA. As shown in electron microscopy (EM) images, wild-type Sso7c4 compacts DNA through bridging and bending interactions, whereas the binding of C-terminally truncated proteins rigidifies and opens DNA molecules, and no compaction of the DNA occurs. Moreover, the FP, EM and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) data indicated that the two basic and flexible C-terminal arms of the Sso7c4 dimer play a crucial role in binding and bending DNA. Sso7c4 has been classified as a repressor-like protein because of its similarity to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Ecrep 6.8 and Ecrep 7.3 as well as <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> ACCR in amino acid sequence. Based on these data, we proposed a model of the Sso7c4-DNA complex using a curved DNA molecule in the catabolite activator protein-DNA complex. The DNA end-to-end distance measured with FRET upon wild-type Sso7c4 binding is almost equal to the distance measured in the model, which supports the fidelity of the proposed model. The FRET data also confirm the EM observation showing that the binding of wild-type Sso7c4 reduces the DNA length while the C-terminal truncation does not. A functional role for Sso7c4 in the organization of chromosomal DNA and/or the regulation of gene expression through bridging and bending interactions is suggested.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Institute of Biological Chemistry at Academia Sinica and Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (to Andrew H.-J.

Generally, the architectural proteins that modulate genome compaction function through DNA bending, bridging, wrapping and/or stiffening. These proteins share no sequence or structure similarities but appear to be functionally conserved across kingdoms. In addition, many architectural proteins are involved in important biological processes, such as transcription, replication, and repair [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In eukaryotes, histones wrap double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into nucleosomes, the principal units of DNA compaction and organization [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The high-mobility group (HMG)-box proteins play an important architectural role in nucleoprotein complex assembly [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The nucleosome interacts with the linker histones H1 and H5, producing increasingly higher-ordered structures [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), such as histone protein from strain U9 (HU) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], integration host factor (IHF) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], contribute to the compaction of chromosomal DNA. Archaeal NAPs use strategies from both eukaryotes and bacteria. Most euryarchaea possess true histone proteins such as HMfA and HMfB from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>fervidus</italic> which organize dsDNA into tetrameric nucleosomes containing a tetramer of proteins that are analogous to the proteins in the eukaryotic [H3&#8211;H4]<sub>2</sub> tetrasome [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous genome-wide MNase/ChIP-seq studies showed that archaeal histones HTkB and HMtA2 bind along the genome to form multimers of varied sizes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>kodakarensis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>thermautotrophicus</italic>, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, with few exceptions, crenarchaea do not synthesize histone homologues; instead, they use a wide array of small NAPs to package their DNA [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p><italic>Sulfolobus</italic> species (e.g., <italic>S</italic>. <italic>solfataricus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>acidocaldarius</italic>), which are hyperthermophilic crenarchaeal organisms, encode a variety of small, abundant and basic proteins ranging in molecular weight from 7 to 10 kDa that modulate their genome. Five classes of architectural proteins have been characterized and classified as histone-like proteins according to their physical properties: Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity, also known as the Sso10b [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]/Sac10b [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] family), Sso10a [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]/Sac10a [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Sul7d (Sso7d/Sac7d) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Cren7 [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Sso7c4 [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, Alba proteins form dimers in solution and exhibit two different binding modes by bridging DNA or forming stiff filaments along DNA, depending on the dimer concentration and composition [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, Sso10a also exists as a dimer in solution via antiparallel coiled-coil interactions. Sso10a1 bridges DNA duplexes, but Sso10a2 forms filaments along DNA [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sul7d non-cooperatively binds to dsDNA as a monomer with micromolar affinity and introduces a sharp kink into the DNA duplex via the intercalation of hydrophobic side chains into the minor groove [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cren7 is the only NAP known to be conserved at the kingdom level in crenarchaea. Cren7 is a structural homologue of Sul7d, and the biochemical properties and structures of both Cren7 and its DNA complex are similar to the properties and structures of Sul7d [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The Sso7c4 protein was originally identified in co-purifications with Sso7d and ribonuclease A from the supernatant of acid-soluble cell lysates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>solfataricus</italic>. Based on the sequence alignment, Sso7c4 which has been classified as a bacterial repressor-like protein exhibited similarities with three transcriptional repressors, Ecrep 6.8 and Ecrep 7.3 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and ACCR in <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sso7c4 appears to be the first repressor-like protein described in crenarchaea and may play a regulatory role in gene transcription [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The solution structure and DNA-binding properties of Sso7c4 have been determined by NMR analysis [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The Sso7c4 protein possesses a homodimeric DNA-binding fold that forms a swapped &#946;-loop-&#946; &#8216;Yin-Yang&#8217; topology, and it belongs to the SpoVT-AbrB superfamily. The fold resembles the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of both AbrB and MazE, which are transcriptional regulators in bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present the crystal structure of wild-type Sso7c4, which was resolved at a high resolution of 1.63 &#197;, to obtain a better understanding of its architectural properties and functions. Two C-termini composed of LKEPWK residues, which are disordered in the crystal, are involved in binding DNA. Based on the results obtained from a variety of techniques, including tryptophan fluorescence quenching, fluorescence polarization (FP) and electron microscopy (EM), a model depicting the mechanism by which Sso7c4 binds DNA is proposed and further validated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Overall structures of wild-type and C-terminally truncated Sso7c4</title><p>Sso7c4 crystals were grown in the presence of a 10-bp dsDNA to elucidate how the Sso7c4 protein interacts with dsDNA. However, crystals containing only proteins were formed. DNA appeared to be required for crystallization but was not incorporated into the crystal. The structures of wild-type and C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 (deletion of L49-K54) were well refined at resolutions of 1.63 and 1.4 &#197;, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The crystal of wild-type Sso7c4 contains one homodimer in the asymmetric unit and is in the <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group. Interestingly, the two basic C-termini are disordered owing to a lack of corresponding density. The wild-type Sso7c4 monomer has a &#946;1-&#946;2-&#945;1-&#946;3-&#946;4 topology. The dimeric Sso7c4 protein, which consists of eight intertwined &#946; sheets and two flanking &#945; helices, forms a dimer via intermolecular associations between &#946;1 and &#946;3&#8242; (the primes indicate the second monomer in the dimer) and &#946;1&#8242; and &#946;3 in the flank, &#946;2 and &#946;2&#8242; at the top, and &#946;4 and &#946;4&#8242; at the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The crystal structure revealed that Sso7c4 displays a homodimeric DNA-binding fold, forming a swapped &#946;-loop-&#946; &#8216;Yin-Yang&#8217; topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We also determined the crystal structure of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 at a resolution of 1.4 &#197; to address the potential effect of the flexible C-terminus on DNA binding. In contrast to the wild-type structure, there are three homodimers in one asymmetric unit of the C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 crystal, which is in the <italic>P</italic>3<sub>1</sub> space group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The crystal structures of the wild-type and C-terminally truncated proteins are similar, as indicated by the good superposition of their &#945; carbons (the r.m.s.d. value is 0.35 &#197; for 85 atoms, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0169627.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169627.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the wild-type Sso7c4 protein.</title><p>(A) Ribbon diagram of wild-type Sso7c4 with the two arginine pairs (R11/R22&#8242; and R11&#8242;/R22) and three sulfates (X201, X202 and X203) depicted as balls and sticks with (2<italic>F</italic>o-<italic>F</italic>c) Fourier electron density maps (contoured at 1&#963; level).

However, K45 in &#946;4 and K45&#8242; in &#946;4&#8242; are well ordered in both the wild-type protein and the C-terminal truncation mutant because they are responsible for the intermolecular association of the Sso7c4 monomers, together with D38 (D38&#8242;), S40 (S40&#8242;) and E41 (E41&#8242;), through either electrostatic interactions or water-mediated hydrogen bonds at the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

Consequently, their side-chain conformations are stabilized by protein-protein interactions. One Sso7c4 protein interacts with six neighboring proteins through three patterns: sulfate-mediated interactions with E5, K20, and R22, electrostatic interactions between K24&#8242; and E39&#8242;, and hydrogen bond arrays around the R11 (R11&#8242;) and E29 (E29&#8242;) side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Three sulfate ions, which all bind to the top surface of wild-type Sso7c4, are present in the crystal structure.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, the side chains of R22 and E5 in one monomer interact with sulfate X201 through water-mediated hydrogen bonds, whereas the K20&#8242; side chain from the adjacent protein (symmetry-related molecule) makes direct contacts with the sulfate and E5 side chain via electrostatic interactions. The other sulfate, X202&#8242;, is located near the R22&#8242; side chain of the symmetry-related protein and exhibits the same interaction patterns as sulfate X201. These two sulfates mediate interactions with the side chains of E5, K20 and R22 (E5&#8242;, K20&#8242; and R22&#8242; from symmetry-related protein) and are responsible for one of the three protein-protein interaction patterns at the interface. However, the third sulfate, X203, which is located on the top of the protein surface, is not involved in the protein-protein interaction. The strong direct ionic force surrounding this sulfate is provided by the NH groups of N12&#8242; and Q14&#8242; in one monomer and Q14 in the other monomer. The hydroxyl group of S10' forms a hydrogen bond with sulfate X203, which is only solvated by two water molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

Based on the sequence alignment of the Sso7c4 family in the archaeal kingdom, the only two arginines in Sso7c4, R11 and R22, are not only highly conserved across species in the archaeal homologues but are also involved in DNA contacts, as shown in previous NMR studies [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The R22 side chains in both wild-type and C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 are structurally conserved and more static than the R11 residues. In the crystal structure of the C-terminal truncation mutant, the R11 side chains of the three molecules in one asymmetric unit are all exposed to solvent and flexible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), consistent with the results of previous NMR dynamics studies [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Similarly, the R11&#8242; side chain of protein I interacts with the adjacent protein VII using the same interaction patterns as protein I and protein VI. In addition, the R11 side chain (chain A) of the wild-type protein is further stabilized by PEG 400 through water-mediated hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p><p>In the wild-type crystal structure, both R22 side chains interact with sulfates, which are located near the &#945;1 helices on the DNA-binding surface through water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">2B</xref>). One Sso7c4 protein is associated with six symmetry-related molecules, of which four make contacts via R11 or R22 residues. Two of these neighboring molecules contact the R22 side chains via sulfate-mediated interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), whereas the other two interact with the R11 side chains via hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The relationship between R22 and the sulfate suggests that the positive side chain of R22 may interact with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone in the nucleoprotein complex. Similarly, R11 may contact the DNA base via hydrogen bonds. Based on these results, we speculate that the two arginines, R11 and R22&#8242; (or R11&#8242; and R22), may be involved in binding DNA. The R11 and R22 residues were replaced with alanine to probe their effects on DNA binding and further verify the roles of these two arginine pairs in Sso7c4.

The double mutant cannot achieve a saturation binding curve, even at a very high protein concentrations (4.33 mM). Based on the estimated unsaturated DNA binding curve, the binding affinity of Sso7c4-R11A/R22A for a 20-bp DNA is much lower than that of the wild-type protein.

The bacteriophage &#955; encodes two proteins, &#955; (cI) and Cro repressor, which play contrasting roles in regulating the growth mode of the phage. Both the &#955; and Cro repressors function as dimers, with the recognition helices of the HTH (helix-turn-helix) motifs inserted into the major grooves of the operator [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The HTH motif, in conjunction with the basic N-terminal arm (STKKKP), is responsible for the recognition and binding of &#955; repressor to the OL1 consensus operator half site. Lys3 and Lys4 contact guanine bases in the major groove, whereas Lys5 interacts with a phosphate group [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Here, we address the possible role of the Sso7c4 C-terminus in binding DNA using tryptophan fluorescence quenching, FP, and EM. The fluorescence emission spectrum of Sso7c4 was essentially the same as the spectrum expected for a free tryptophan, indicating that the single tryptophan (W53) located at the C-terminus is highly exposed to solvent in the Sso7c4 monomer. The binding of the wild-type Sso7c4 protein to dsDNA led to a dramatic decrease of nearly 98% in the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan (W53) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, the W53 residue at the Sso7c4 C-terminal end is involved in the interaction with DNA. A nonlinear fit of the titration data for Sso7c4 binding to a 20-bp dsDNA yielded a binding affinity of 22.77 &#956;M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, right panel). Sso7c4 binds to dsDNA with micromolar affinity, consistent with other nonspecific dsDNA-binding proteins, such as Sso7d/Sac7d in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> species, as shown in a tryptophan fluorescence quenching study [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The intensity of tryptophan fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of the Sso7c4 proteins in the micro-molar concentration range. Our gel-filtration results indicated that the Sso7c4 proteins are unable to form higher multimers in solution. The crystal structure of Sso7c4 indicated that the two basic C-termini in a dimer are highly flexible. In the above experiment, the Sso7c4 solution (~7 &#956;M) was titrated with 20-bp dsDNA fragment, and the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of Sso7c4 decreased gradually to 98% quenching. Based on these results, the fluorescence quenching of tryptophan residue at the C-terminal end was more likely due to DNA binding rather than stacking of the tryptophan side chains between adjacent Sso7c4 proteins.</p><p>To further examine the role of its C-terminus for DNA binding, the residues L49 to K54 were truncated from Sso7c4. Then we used fluorescence polarization to study the binding of wild type Sso7c4 and the C-terminally truncated protein to 8-bp, 10-bp and 20-bp dsDNA fragments. The FP results showed that all the C-terminally truncated proteins exhibited lower binding affinity to 8-bp, 10-bp, and 20-bp DNAs than the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169627.t001">Table 1</xref>). Undoubtedly, these FP data further show that the C-terminal ends of Sso7c4 participate in the interaction with DNA. However, the C-terminally truncated protein displayed a similar binding affinity (15.90&#177;0.53 &#956;M) for the 8-bp DNA to the wild-type protein (14.17&#177;0.26 &#956;M). The distances between the S atoms of X201 and X203 and between the S atoms of X202 and X203 were 13 &#197; and 16.1 &#197;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The sum of the distances of the three sulfates in the crystal was 29.1 &#197;, which corresponds to the length of an 8-bp DNA. When the 8-bp DNA interacted with the top DNA-binding surface of Sso7c4 at equilibrium, it would be too short to contact the C-terminus of the protein. Therefore, the wild-type Sso7c4/8-bp and C-terminally truncated Sso7c4/8-bp complexes had similar DNA-binding affinities. Extension of the DNA length to 10 bp would allow the flexible C-terminus to make contacts with the DNA, a scenario supported by the ~5-fold increase in the DNA-binding affinity of the wild-type Sso7c4/10-bp DNA complex (3.12&#177;0.16 &#956;M). Moreover, the binding affinity of the wild-type Sso7c4/20-bp DNA complex (2.73&#177;0.18 &#956;M) was slightly higher than but similar to the value for the wild-type Sso7c4/10-bp DNA complex, indicating that 10 bp is the shortest DNA that contacted by the two C-termini of Sso7c4. Thus, the length of the nucleotide molecule that can bind one protein dimer is at least 10 bp. In contrast, the C-terminally truncated protein bound to the 10-bp and 20-bp DNAs with similar affinities (~11 &#956;M) but bound to the 8-bp DNA with slightly weaker affinity. Together, these results imply a mechanism for the formation of the complex: Sso7c4 first associates with DNA through its top surface, and the C-terminus at the base of the protein subsequently binds the DNA. The binding of the top surface of Sso7c4 to DNA accounts for the 10&#8211;15 &#956;M binding affinity, but the binding affinity increases to ~3 &#956;M when the C-terminus participates in the DNA interactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Sso7c4 mediated DNA compaction, as visualized by EM</title><p>Electron microscopy is a suitable method for examining the sizes and shapes of biological macromolecules, particularly nucleoprotein complexes.

At a ratio of 5 bp per dimer, most wild-type Sso7c4-DNA complexes are bridged (93%, n = 134), and the remaining open loops are primarily located at the ends of the plasmids. At increased wild-type Sso7c4-DNA ratios (0.5 bp/dimer), more bridged complexes were observed (98%, n = 86), of which some of the DNA molecules were completely bridged (15%, n = 86) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right).

At a protein-to-DNA ratio of 1 dimer to 5 base pairs, binding of the C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 resulted in intra-molecular bridges as seen with the wild-type protein. The proportion of the plasmid bridged by C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 (70%, n = 178) is less than the wild-type (93%, n = 134). Furthermore, in a single plasmid, the number of bridged regions by C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 is much fewer than by the wild-type protein.

Two different nucleoprotein complexes that formed with either wild-type or C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 at a ratio of 5 bp per dimer were thicker than the plasmid duplex circle, with widths of 8.05 nm for the wild-type and 8.57 nm for the truncated. This increase in the width of the plasmid indicates that the DNA molecules were binding to proteins. On the other hand, the binding of wild-type Sso7c4 at a higher protein concentration (0.5 bp/dimer) increased the plasmid width up to a maximum of 13.89 nm, which was probably mediated by the extensive protein-protein interactions with unbound wild-type Sso7c4. Multimeric forms of Sso7c4 have not been observed in solution, suggesting that these protein-protein interactions may only be possible between Sso7c4 dimers that are bound to DNA.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0169627.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169627.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Average lengths and widths of the plasmid and nucleoprotein complexes.</title><p>EM images were measured using ImageJ software.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0169627.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0169627.t002"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t002fn001"><p>n: the number of molecules.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Measurements of the contour lengths of the wild-type-DNA complexes at a ratio of 5 bp per dimer revealed a ~10.9% reduction in the mean length (from 1844 nm to 1643 nm) compared with that of a naked plasmid in the same preparation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169627.t002">Table 2</xref>). Upon incubation of the DNA with a ten-fold higher wild-type protein concentration (a ratio of 0.5 bp per dimer), the average contour length was as short as 1494.58 nm, which corresponds to a ~19.0% reduction in length due to DNA bending. In contrast, little or no condensation of the DNA molecules was observed in the C-terminally truncated Sso7c4-bound complexes at stoichiometries of 5 bp and 0.5 bp DNA per dimer. Although the individual protein cannot be resolved, a reduction in apparent DNA length might be attributed to DNA bending, which in turn can be induced by binding to wild-type Sso7c4. However, the DNA contour length was not reduced upon C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 binding (1834.97 nm for 5 bp/dimer and 1830.06 nm for 0.5 bp/dimer), implying that both C-termini of Sso7c4 are also involved in bending DNA. Interestingly, based on the results of the FP binding assay and EM images, the basic and flexible C-termini of Sso7c4 are responsible for binding DNA and participate in bending DNA. In conclusion, wild-type Sso7c4 induces the formation of a more compact DNA structure primarily through both bridging and bending interactions, whereas C-terminally truncated proteins rigidify and open the DNA molecules at high protein concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Proposed Sso7c4-DNA model and validation using FRET</title><p>Three sulfates are bound to the top DNA-binding surface of Sso7c4 in the crystal lattice. The curved trace of these sulfates mimics the position of the phosphate backbone of DNA. Furthermore, the analysis of the EM images of the wild-type-DNA complexes implied that wild-type Sso7c4 induces DNA bending. In addition, Sso7c4 has been classified as a repressor-like protein by the amino acid sequence alignment [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In our FP assay, 10 bp of DNA is the shortest length that binds to one Sso7c4 dimer. Based on these results, we propose a possible model for the Sso7c4-DNA complex. We searched all possible structures of protein-DNA complexes whose proteins act as transcriptional regulators by bending DNA as candidates for constructing our model. We attempted to fit the positions of three sulfates as closely as possible to the phosphates in the bent DNA molecule. Surprisingly, these three sulfates fit well with the phosphates of curved DNA molecules in the CAP (catabolite activator protein)-DNA complexes (PDB ID: 1O3T) [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Compared with the unbound DNA, the dye-to-dye distance in the wild-type complex was decreased, whereas the binding of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 produced little difference in distance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169627.t003">Table 3</xref>). The decreased distance upon complex formation indicates that wild-type Sso7c4 bends the DNA, as observed in the EM analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0169627.t002">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the binding of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 induced a slight change in the end-to-end distance of DNA, consistent with the length measured from the EM images of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4-DNA complexes.

However, the measured distance is shorter than the expected value for the 30-bp free DNA. The sequence of the 30-bp DNA used in the FRET experiments contains &#8220;ATAA&#8221;, which may have an intrinsic sequence-directed curvature, resulting in the decreased distance compared with the distance for canonical B-DNA. In the presence of wild-type Sso7c4, the end-to-end distance of the 30-bp DNA decreased to 86.99 &#197;. Clearly, the binding of wild-type Sso7c4 results in DNA bending. Interestingly, the binding of the 30-bp DNA to the C-terminally truncated protein exhibited a larger end-to-end distance than free DNA (95.92 &#197; for the C-terminally truncated-DNA complex and 90.98 &#197; for 30-bp DNA). The binding of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 seems to straighten the DNA and produces a stiffened configuration, as shown in the EM images.</p><p>On the other hand, the end-to-end distance of the 20-bp DNA only changed slightly upon binding to either the wild-type or C-terminally truncated protein compared with the distances for free DNA. Both the 24- and 30-bp DNAs, but not 20-bp DNA, were bent by wild-type Sso7c4. In our model, ten DNA base pairs are covered by one Sso7c4 dimer. Thus, the entire 20-bp DNA binds to two Sso7c4 dimers located side by side at saturating protein concentrations. However, the 20-bp DNA appears to be too short to observe the reduction in the end-to-end distance caused by the binding of wild-type Sso7c4. The end-to-end distance of the 20-bp DNA also remains constant upon C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 binding, consistent with the results for the 24- and 30-bp DNAs, suggesting stiffening of the DNA through side-by-side binding along the DNA molecule.</p><p>The end-to-end distances of the 24- and 30-bp DNAs observed upon binding to wild-type Sso7c4 are almost identical to the corresponding distances measured from our proposed model. The FRET results support the fidelity of the proposed model. In addition, the end-to-end distance of the DNA in the model is 86.8 &#197;, which corresponds to a ~14.7% reduction in length compared with the length for 30-bp B-DNA. This reduction in the length of the DNA upon binding to Sso7c4 is consistent with the EM results, in which the DNA length was reduced by 10.9% - 19.0% at stoichiometries of 5 bp and 0.5 bp DNA per dimer. The roles of the Sso7c4 C-terminus in both binding and bending DNA have been revealed <italic>in vitro</italic> using EM and FRET analysis. Interestingly, the HMG-box tails (C-terminal for HMG-D and LEF-1, N-terminal for yeast NHP6A) show a similar property, as the loss of extended tails leads to a substantially reduced DNA affinity and a smaller bend angle [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Biological implications</title><p>DNA-binding proteins that compact and regulate genetic material are crucial in all organisms.

In our study, Sso7c4 exhibits DNA-binding activity and alters the trajectory of the DNA through bending and bridging. Sso7c4 might be a transcriptional regulator, based on its amino acid sequence and our proposed model. Sso7c4 utilizes two swapped-&#946;-loop-&#946; motifs for binding DNA, which is similar to the fold of AbrB-N [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] but distinct from the HTH motif, a common recognition element used by most prokaryotic transcriptional regulators. However, our proposed model of the Sso7c4-DNA complex resembles many structures of transcriptional regulators, such as CAP [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Fis [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, as well as &#955; [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and Cro repressor [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] from bacteriophage lambda, in complex with DNA. These regulators use an HTH motif to bind the major groove of DNA and function as a homodimer, with each motif binding one half-site of the symmetry-related DNA. The binding of all these transcriptional regulators bends DNA to various degrees. Based on a structural analysis, amino acid residues on the second &#945;-helix (recognition helix) of this motif are the most important residues for protein-DNA recognition.</p><p>In our model, two Sso7c4 dimers form symmetric contacts with the individual major grooves of DNA. The side chain E5 in one Sso7c4 contacts the K20 residue in the other Sso7c4 and vice versa through electrostatic interactions at the protein-protein interface. Interestingly, similar protein-protein interaction patterns between K20 and E5 are also observed in the crystal lattice contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Most of the conserved crystal lattice contacts involve residues near the surfaces of wild-type Sso7c4 that form protein-protein interactions or protein-DNA contacts in our proposed model. In the Sso7c4 crystal structure, the side chains of Ser10&#8242;, Asn12&#8242;, Gln14&#8242; and Gln14 form contacts with sulfate X203 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In the Sso7c4-DNA model, the side chains of Ser10&#8242;, Asn12&#8242;, Thr16&#8242; and Gln14 on the DNA-binding surface interact with phosphates in the DNA backbone. The R11 residue in the flexible loop L1 contacts a DNA base in the major groove, whereas the R11&#8242; side chain is located near the minor groove on the opposite site of the DNA. Interestingly, many transcriptional regulators utilize similar residues (Arg, Ser/Thr, Asn and Gln) in the recognition helix of the HTH motif to contact the major groove of their operators. The first two residues in the recognition helix of both Cro and &#955; repressors, Gln27 and Ser28 in Cro and Gln44 and Ser45 in &#955; repressor, form similar base contacts with invariant bps 2 and 4 of all operator half-sites [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Based on the FP, EM, and FRET analyses, the basic and flexible C-termini of Sso7c4 may act as two hands that grasp the DNA molecule, further inducing DNA bending. In our model, the last five residues of each monomer are not shown because they are disordered in the Sso7c4 structure, but the C-termini in two of four monomers (colored in magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169627.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) may form contacts in the vicinity of the DNA backbone in the middle region of the DNA, as shown in the Cro-DNA complex [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Based on the substantial similarity of the model of the DNA complex to transcriptional regulators, we assume that Sso7c4 has a regulatory role in gene transcription in archaea. As shown in our EM analysis, the binding of wild-type Sso7c4 bends and bridges DNA. In general, transcriptional regulators modulate transcription either by directly interacting with RNA polymerase or by forming DNA bridging structures. For example, &#955; repressor contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a small surface patch that contacts RNA polymerase for transcriptional activation [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The CAP-cAMP complex assists RNA polymerase in binding to the promoter, thereby stimulating catabolic operon transcription [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Fis functions not only by interacting with effectors like RNA polymerase, but also by bending DNA [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, bridge formation is also important for transcription, as the bridges can potentially trap or exclude RNA polymerase from promoters. Consequently, by bridging and bending DNA, Sso7c4 may have implications on both nucleoid structure and gene regulation.</p><p>Living organisms in all three domains rely on DNA to store and replicate their genetic information, despite the differences in their cellular organization [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In eukaryotes, the major architectural proteins are histones, which wrap DNA and form nucleosomes. The eukaryotic histones bind and wrap DNA using conserved residues, including the arginine and lysine residues of the &#945;1 helix, an arginine in L1, and a lysine and threonine in L2 that directly participate in DNA binding. When examined collectively over all 12 histone fold DNA-binding sites, the arginine side chains most closely associated with the minor groove show variable contacts with the surrounding DNA and protein [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Coincidentally, arginine residues R11 and R22 of Sso7c4 are also essential for binding DNA. In our model, two R22 residues from one Sso7c4 dimer contact the DNA backbone through electrostatic interactions; in addition, R11 forms contacts with DNA bases in the major groove, and R11&#8242; is located near the minor groove. Interestingly, superposition of the conserved R22 side chain in Sso7c4 with R72 of the &#945;1 helix in histone H3 (1KX5) reveals that the R11&#8242; side chain on the DNA-binding surface of Sso7c4 is located in the DNA minor groove, similar to R83 in loop1 of H3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). We chose R22 of Sso7c4 and R72 of histone H3 for alignment because they are both located on the surface of the &#945;-helices and participate in contacts with the DNA backbone. Therefore, one arginine pair in the Sso7c4, R11' and R22, may bind DNA similar to histones in eukaryotes.</p><p>On the other hand, the archaeal histones HMfA and HMfB from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>fervidus</italic> share sequence homology with the eukaryotic nucleosome core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. In comparison with histone H3, which has a similar fold, the related DNA-binding residues R72 and R83 in H3 correspond to R11 and R20 in HMfA (as well as the equivalent residues in HMfB), respectively. When the crystal structures of HMfA (PDB 1B67) and H3 (H3 histone in the nucleosome, 1KX5) are superposed by using the &#945; carbons, the orientation of R11 side chain in HMfA is quite different from that of R72 in H3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169627.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Therefore, the similarity between R22 of Sso7c4 and R72 of H3 is not readily observed in R11 of HMfA. Nevertheless, it is likely that the R11 side-chain conformation of HMfA could be changed, similar to that of R72 in H3, upon DNA complex formation. Furthermore, based on the analysis our EM images, Sso7c4 might package DNA through a bending and bridging mechanism. A similar mechanism for DNA compaction has been observed for the eukaryotic histone linker H1/H5 [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], bacterial nucleoid-associated protein Fis [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and tetrameric LrpC (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0169627.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These proteins exhibit very different global folds but use similar strategies for DNA packaging.
