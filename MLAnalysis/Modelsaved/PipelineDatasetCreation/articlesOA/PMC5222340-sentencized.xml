</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Living organisms in all three kingdoms of life compact and organize their genomic DNA into nuclei or cells using various architectural proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Generally, the architectural proteins that modulate genome compaction function through DNA bending, bridging, wrapping and/or stiffening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These proteins share no sequence or structure similarities but appear to be functionally conserved across kingdoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, many architectural proteins are involved in important biological processes, such as transcription, replication, and repair [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes, histones wrap double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into nucleosomes, the principal units of DNA compaction and organization [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The high-mobility group (HMG)-box proteins play an important architectural role in nucleoprotein complex assembly [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The nucleosome interacts with the linker histones H1 and H5, producing increasingly higher-ordered structures [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), such as histone protein from strain U9 (HU) [11–13], integration host factor (IHF) [13,14], factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) [15,16] and histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) [17,18], contribute to the compaction of chromosomal DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Archaeal NAPs use strategies from both eukaryotes and bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Most euryarchaea possess true histone proteins such as HMfA and HMfB from M. fervidus which organize dsDNA into tetrameric nucleosomes containing a tetramer of proteins that are analogous to the proteins in the eukaryotic [H3–H4]2 tetrasome [19–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous genome-wide MNase/ChIP-seq studies showed that archaeal histones HTkB and HMtA2 bind along the genome to form multimers of varied sizes in T. kodakarensis and M. thermautotrophicus, respectively [21–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with few exceptions, crenarchaea do not synthesize histone homologues; instead, they use a wide array of small NAPs to package their DNA [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Sulfolobus species (e.g., S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius), which are hyperthermophilic crenarchaeal organisms, encode a variety of small, abundant and basic proteins ranging in molecular weight from 7 to 10 kDa that modulate their genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Five classes of architectural proteins have been characterized and classified as histone-like proteins according to their physical properties: Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity, also known as the Sso10b [24–26]/Sac10b [27] family), Sso10a [28]/Sac10a [29], Sul7d (Sso7d/Sac7d) [30–32], Cren7 [33,34] and Sso7c4 [35,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, Alba proteins form dimers in solution and exhibit two different binding modes by bridging DNA or forming stiff filaments along DNA, depending on the dimer concentration and composition [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Sso10a also exists as a dimer in solution via antiparallel coiled-coil interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Sso10a1 bridges DNA duplexes, but Sso10a2 forms filaments along DNA [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Sul7d non-cooperatively binds to dsDNA as a monomer with micromolar affinity and introduces a sharp kink into the DNA duplex via the intercalation of hydrophobic side chains into the minor groove [30–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cren7 is the only NAP known to be conserved at the kingdom level in crenarchaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Cren7 is a structural homologue of Sul7d, and the biochemical properties and structures of both Cren7 and its DNA complex are similar to the properties and structures of Sul7d [33,34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The Sso7c4 protein was originally identified in co-purifications with Sso7d and ribonuclease A from the supernatant of acid-soluble cell lysates of S. solfataricus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Based on the sequence alignment, Sso7c4 which has been classified as a bacterial repressor-like protein exhibited similarities with three transcriptional repressors, Ecrep 6.8 and Ecrep 7.3 in E. coli, and ACCR in Agrobacterium tumefaciens [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Sso7c4 appears to be the first repressor-like protein described in crenarchaea and may play a regulatory role in gene transcription [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The solution structure and DNA-binding properties of Sso7c4 have been determined by NMR analysis [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The Sso7c4 protein possesses a homodimeric DNA-binding fold that forms a swapped β-loop-β ‘Yin-Yang’ topology, and it belongs to the SpoVT-AbrB superfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The fold resembles the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of both AbrB and MazE, which are transcriptional regulators in bacteria [37,38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the crystal structure of wild-type Sso7c4, which was resolved at a high resolution of 1.63 Å, to obtain a better understanding of its architectural properties and functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Two C-termini composed of LKEPWK residues, which are disordered in the crystal, are involved in binding DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained from a variety of techniques, including tryptophan fluorescence quenching, fluorescence polarization (FP) and electron microscopy (EM), a model depicting the mechanism by which Sso7c4 binds DNA is proposed and further validated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The dimeric Sso7c4 protein, which consists of eight intertwined β sheets and two flanking α helices, forms a dimer via intermolecular associations between β1 and β3′ (the primes indicate the second monomer in the dimer) and β1′ and β3 in the flank, β2 and β2′ at the top, and β4 and β4′ at the bottom (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure revealed that Sso7c4 displays a homodimeric DNA-binding fold, forming a swapped β-loop-β ‘Yin-Yang’ topology (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We also determined the crystal structure of C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 at a resolution of 1.4 Å to address the potential effect of the flexible C-terminus on DNA binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the wild-type structure, there are three homodimers in one asymmetric unit of the C-terminally truncated Sso7c4 crystal, which is in the P31 space group (S1A and S1B Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The crystal structures of the wild-type and C-terminally truncated proteins are similar, as indicated by the good superposition of their α carbons (the r.m.s.d. value is 0.35 Å for 85 atoms, S1C Fig). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>In our model, two R22 residues from one Sso7c4 dimer contact the DNA backbone through electrostatic interactions; in addition, R11 forms contacts with DNA bases in the major groove, and R11′ is located near the minor groove. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, superposition of the conserved R22 side chain in Sso7c4 with R72 of the α1 helix in histone H3 (1KX5) reveals that the R11′ side chain on the DNA-binding surface of Sso7c4 is located in the DNA minor groove, similar to R83 in loop1 of H3 (S7A Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>We chose R22 of Sso7c4 and R72 of histone H3 for alignment because they are both located on the surface of the α-helices and participate in contacts with the DNA backbone. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>In comparison with histone H3, which has a similar fold, the related DNA-binding residues R72 and R83 in H3 correspond to R11 and R20 in HMfA (as well as the equivalent residues in HMfB), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>When the crystal structures of HMfA (PDB 1B67) and H3 (H3 histone in the nucleosome, 1KX5) are superposed by using the α carbons, the orientation of R11 side chain in HMfA is quite different from that of R72 in H3 (S7B Fig). </plain></SENT>
