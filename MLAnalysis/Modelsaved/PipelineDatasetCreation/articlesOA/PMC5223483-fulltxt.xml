To understand the anthocyanin biosynthesis at post-transcriptional level, we investigated the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) during fruit coloring. In the present study, four small RNA libraries and a mixed degradome library from pericarps of &#8216;Feizixiao&#8217; litchi at different developmental phases were constructed and sequenced by Solexa technology. A total of 78 conserved miRNAs belonging to 35 miRNA families and 41 novel miRNAs were identified <italic>via</italic> high-throughput sequencing, and 129 genes were identified as their targets by the recently developed degradome sequencing. miR156a and a novel microRNA (NEW41) were found to be differentially expressed during fruit coloring, indicating they might affect anthocyanin biosynthesis through their target genes in litchi. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression changes of miR156a and the novel microRNA (NEW41) were inversely correlated with the expression profiles of their target genes <italic>LcSPL1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> and <italic>LcCHI</italic>, respectively, suggesting regulatory roles of these miRNAs during anthocyanin biosynthesis. The target genes of miR156a, <italic>LcSPL1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>, encode transcription factors, as evidenced by a localization in the nucleus, that might play roles in the regulation of transcription. To further explore the relationship of <italic>LcSPL1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> with the anthocyanin regulatory genes, yeast two-hybrid and BiFC analyses showed that LcSPL1 proteins could interact with LcMYB1, which is the key regulatory gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi. This study represents a comprehensive expression profiling of miRNAs in anthocyanin biosynthesis during litchi fruit maturity and confirmed that the miR156- SPLs module was conserved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Litchi chinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>anthocyanin</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>high-throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd><italic>miR156a</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>LcSPL1</italic></kwd><kwd>LcMYB1</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthocyanins, synthesized by a specific branch of the flavonoid pathway, which represent a large class of secondary metabolites, have a variety of functions within plants (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Winkel-Shirley, 2001</xref>). Athocyanins biosynthesis is regulated by enzyme-coding structural genes, including chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonoid-3&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8217;H), flavonoid-3&#8242;,5&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8242;5&#8242;H), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-<italic>O</italic>-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), and is also orchestrated at the transcriptional level by MBW transcription factor (TF) complexes consisting of MYB, bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) and WD40 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Koes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent researches have demonstrated that the MBW complex regulates the genes that encode enzymes specifically at the late steps of the anthocyanin pathway, and the MYB TF s have been identified to be the major determinant regulatory genes in the biosynthetic steps of anthocyanin metabolism (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>AtPAP1</italic> (<italic>AtMYB75</italic>), the known anthocyanin regulator originally defined in Arabidopsis, has been shown to effectively induce anthocyanin accumulation in various plant species (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Zuluaga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rowan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Li X. et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). And now the <italic>PAP1</italic> orthologs have been identified in many horticultural crops (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cutanda-Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chagne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Schaart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, our studies suggest that the structural gene <italic>LcUFGT</italic> and its regulator <italic>LcMYB1</italic> play major roles in anthocyanin accumulation in litchi (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition to MBW complex, additional TFs and regulatory genes have also been reported to affect anthocyanin biosynthesis, such as COP1 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maier et al., 2013</xref>), JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) genes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2011</xref>), the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>), and NAC (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). These genes show an interaction with the MBW complex forming a regulatory network that modulates the production of anthocyanins.</p><p>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of 20&#8211;24 nt non-coding small RNAs with important roles in plant growth, development, metabolism, and responses to stress by repressing their targets at post-transcriptional level (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Voinnet, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Iwakawa and Tomari, 2015</xref>). In plants, miRNAs are generally processed from longer single-stranded RNA hairpin precursors by Dicer-like proteins to produce a double-stranded RNA duplex, and then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex where they negatively regulate their target mRNA through imperfect sequence complementarity (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). To date, a large number of miRNAs have been identified in different plant species and deposited in miRBase<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. Acting as powerful endogenous regulators, the identification of the miRNAs and their target mRNAs could help in better understanding of the biological roles of each miRNAs on the regulatory mechanism under various plant growth and development processes. Recently, a genome-wide 5&#8242; RACE approach, known as degradome sequencing or PARE (parallel analysis of RNA ends), has been successfully adapted to screen miRNA targets in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Addo-Quaye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">German et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li Y.F. et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Functional analysis of miRNAs has revealed that miRNAs regulate various aspects in plant development, including leaf morphogenesis, the differentiation and development of a flower, root development, the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006</xref>). For example, the target genes of miR160, miR167 and miR393 regulate auxin signaling, and the regulation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs) by miR160 focuses on many aspects of shoot and root development, while miR167 appears to be important in the regulation of flowers and fruit development (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mallory et al., 2004</xref>). Besides their roles in plant development, miRNAs are also important to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as in primary and secondary metabolism (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Evidences suggest that miRNAs are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis through their target genes, while only few miRNAs have been reported to be responsible for the biosynthesis of anthocyanins (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2012</xref>). In Arabidopsis, miR828 negatively controls anthocyanin accumulation by repressing the expression of <italic>MYB75</italic>, <italic>MYB90</italic>, and <italic>MYB113</italic>, which are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2012</xref>). miR858 has been identified in Arabidopsis, apple, cotton and tomato (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). miR858 is predicted to target up to 66 MYB factors in apple (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2012</xref>). Small tandem target mimic-mediated blockage of miR858 (STTM858) results in anthocyanin accumulation in tomato (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). It is well documented that miR156 negatively regulates anthocyanin accumulation by targeting the TF, <italic>SPL9</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In plants, miR156 targeting a subset of SPLs is highly conserved and plays important role in plant development (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nodine and Bartel, 2010</xref>). The miR156/SPLs module also participate in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, as SPL9 was reported to repress anthocyanin accumulation by destabilizing the MBW complex, and directly preventing expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, the miR156-targeted SPL has been connected to the spatiotemporal regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and patchouli (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Litchi (<italic>Litchi chinensis</italic> Sonn.) is one of the most popular members of the Sapindaceae fruit with sweet, juicy flesh. The pericarp of litchi is mostly red at maturity, which is provided by anthocyanins accumulation. Apart from the delicious taste, attractive red skin of litchi is another important aspect of the fruit quality. Recently, the gene involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and sequestration from litchi has been reported (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanism of miRNAs regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi has not been reported. In the present study, we identified miRNAs in litchi pericarps during fruit ripening by using Solexa sequencing, and then analyzed the miR156/SPL module and its regulatory roles in the anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials</title><p>Litchi (<italic>L. chinesis</italic> Sonn.) cv. &#8216;Feizixiao&#8217; (FZX) was collected from the Yongfa Fruit Farm, Haikou, China.

However, there was no interaction between LcSPL1/2 and LcbHLL1/2/3 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Recently, LcbHLH1/3 interacting with LcMYB1 in regulating late structural genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> and <italic>Litchi</italic> has been reported (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). In previous study, SPL9 was reported to destabilize the MBW complex to repress anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gou et al., 2011</xref>). However, the WD40 related to anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi has not been identified. Therefore, whether the LcSPL1/2 could bind WD40 in litchi is worth for further research. Our results, together with previous reports, clearly suggest that <italic>LcSPL1</italic> is involved in litchi anthocyanin biosynthesis through interaction with its regulatory gene <italic>LcMYB1</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that the expression of <italic>LcUFGT</italic>, <italic>LcF3H</italic>, <italic>LcDFR</italic>, <italic>LcGST</italic>, and their regulatory gene <italic>LcMYB1</italic> were up-regulated as the fruit developed toward full maturity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, the expression of miR156a was enhanced with the accumulation of anthocyanins, while its target genes <italic>LcSPL1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> were opposite (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,D</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results suggest the up-regulation of miR156a lead to the down-regulation of <italic>LcSPL1</italic>, which negatively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis via interaction with <italic>LcMYB1</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that miRNAs are involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi, and our findings reveal a novel mechanism on regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi. Here, we report that miR156a-targeted LcSPL1 functionally interfere with anthocyanin biosynthesis through interaction with LcMYB1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RL, GH, and JZ designed the research.
