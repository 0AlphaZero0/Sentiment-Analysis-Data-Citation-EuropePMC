In order to monitor groundwater, a detailed understanding of groundwater biota and what biological sampling of wells truly reflects, is paramount. This study aims to address this uncertainty, comparing the composition of biota in groundwater wells prior to and after purging, with samples collected prior to purging reflecting a potentially artificial environment and samples collected after purging representing the surrounding aquifer. This study uses DNA community profiling (metabarcoding) of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA, combined with traditional stygofauna sampling methods, to characterise groundwater biota from four catchments within eastern Australia. Aquifer waters were dominated by Archaea and bacteria (e.g. <italic>Nitrosopumilales</italic>) that are often associated with nitrification processes, and contained a greater proportion of bacteria (e.g. <italic>Anaerolineales</italic>) associated with fermenting processes compared to well waters. In contrast, unpurged wells contained greater proportions of pathogenic bacteria and bacteria often associated with denitrification processes. In terms of eukaryotes, the abundances of copepods, syncarids and oligochaetes and total abundances of stygofauna were greater in wells than aquifers. These findings highlight the need to consider sampling requirements when completing groundwater ecology surveys.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The immense economic value of groundwater resources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and the importance of groundwater ecosystems for maintaining water quality and flow in aquifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, has meant that assessments of groundwater ecosystems are increasingly being required as part of environmental impact assessments (e.g. Dept.

Large scale assessments of groundwater ecosystems have typically been based on assessing the diversity of obligate groundwater invertebrates (stygofauna), with regulatory agencies considering this sufficient for most purposes (e.g. EPA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, DSITIA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). However, this focus on the macro (meio) faunal diversity means that only a small proportion of the true diversity of the ecosystem is assessed and little consideration is given to the overall structure and function of the groundwater ecosystem. In many aquifers, larger macro- and meio-invertebrates are rare, constrained particularly by the geology and available pore spaces in the aquifer matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.

In order to effectively monitor groundwater, a detailed understanding of how groundwater biota vary in space and time, and what biological sampling of wells truly reflects, is paramount. There are many protocols for sampling aquifers in order to characterise the biota. Some protocols require wells to be purged by the removal of predefined volumes of water<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> or until constant water quality conditions are achieved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> while others do not require purging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Purging wells is necessary to gain representative biological samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> because wells represent an artificial environment that is enriched in oxygen and organic matter, may have some light, and contains a large volume of open water compared to that of the aquifer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. As such, wells often contain higher stygofaunal abundances than aquifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Previous studies have also shown differences in microbial assemblages between well and aquifer samples using community fingerprinting techniques (e.g. TRFLP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and flow cytometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Whilst such studies have shown differences in the structure and abundance of microbial communities, the lack of taxonomic resolution in these methods means that the implications of purging (or not) on assessments of biological structure and potential ecosystem function in groundwaters have not yet been adequately explored. Accordingly, the aims of this study are to describe the compositional differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities within aquifer and unpurged well waters using traditional morphological analysis and metagenomics techniques, and to explore the implications of any such differences for sampling and assessments of groundwater ecosystems.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prokaryotes (16S results)</title><p>There were seven archaea and 88 bacteria orders identified within the samples, with six bacteria and one archaea only being identified to the domain level.

They have a stagnant water column<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, often enriched nutrients (e.g. carbon and oxygen), increased open water habitat availability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and direct access to the surface, which makes the well environment very different from the space-limited conditions of the aquifer. It is thus not surprising that wells and aquifers support different biological assemblages, albeit with a great deal of commonality because the well water is derived directly from the surrounding aquifer. The consequence of this difference is that samples collected from wells alone, without accessing groundwater (and with that biota) from the surrounding aquifer, may present an incomplete picture of the aquifer community. Further, with differences in the composition of microbial communities (both eukaryotic and prokaryotic) comes differences in functional capabilities, suggesting that sampling wells only may miss or misinterpret the important functional processes that are occurring within aquifers.</p><p>In terms of water quality, differences among wells and aquifer samples were much less than was the variation between sites, and differences in water quality variables were not significant between wells and aquifer samples. Despite differences in water quality between sites, and the small differences between wells and aquifers, it is somewhat surprising that the results from biological data showed (in general) the opposite trend. This may be due to biological sampling providing a more holistic view of the long-term environmental conditions at a site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, whereas the water quality analysis provides a snap-shot of the water at one point in time. Prokaryote samples from aquifers were more similar to each other than to corresponding well samples, which suggests a common suite of taxa may underpin the aquifer assemblages. The heterogeneity among well samples was also greater than that among aquifer samples which suggests a range of external, perhaps site-specific influences (e.g. well condition) are acting on the well communities. Trends in the eukaryote assemblages and stygofauna were less clear, but all data demonstrated differences between well and aquifer samples.</p><p>Our study indicates that groundwater contains a high diversity of prokaryotes and significant differences in prokaryote community profiles between purged (aquifer) and unpurged (well) environments. We are not the first to shows such differences, Roudnew <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> found a significantly greater abundance of virus-like particles in wells compared to aquifers, but no difference in bacterial cell abundance. In contrast, Sorensen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> found significantly greater abundance of bacterial cells in the wells than in aquifers but no difference in microbial assemblages (as determined by DNA &#8216;fingerprinting&#8217; methods). However, unlike these previous studies, we have identified the taxa occurring in the well and aquifer communities and, by incorporating the functional traits of those taxa, can infer the functional processes occurring.</p><p>The prokaryotes identified in this study perform a range of metabolic functions, which suggests that biogeochemical cycling of carbon (e.g. the methanogen, <italic>Methanomassiliicoccales</italic>), sulfur (e.g. sulfur reducing bacteria from the order <italic>Desulfobacterales</italic>) and nitrogen (e.g. the ammonia oxidizing archaea <italic>Nitrososphaerales</italic>) is occurring within groundwaters (see Hug <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). As well, there were taxa capable of aerobic and anaerobic processes. Interestingly, we recorded a number prokaryotic OTUs that could only be classified as either bacteria or Archaea, with no confidence in lower&#8211;level taxonomic detail, and many taxa for which a functional role is unknown. Accordingly, the following discussion of functional differences between aquifer and well assemblages should be tempered by the recognition that many taxa (including those undescribed) may be contributing to a particular function, and further, without measures of functional output (such as mRNA or protein expressions), we are considering the potential function rather than actual function of the assemblage.</p><p>Aquifer communities contained greater proportions of Archaea and correspondingly, had a lower relative abundance of bacteria compared to the wells, which is consistent with studies in groundwater elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Aquifers contained high proportions of prokaryotes that have the potential to fix nitrogen, including <italic>Nitrosopumilales, Nitrososphaerales</italic>, and <italic>Nitrospirales</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, with members of these orders recognised as important sink for nitrogen in freshwater environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The high proportion of these taxa in the prokaryotic community suggests that the aquifer ecosystem is a predominantly N-fixing environment.</p><p>In contrast, well samples contained a relatively greater proportion of denitrifying bacteria than did the aquifers. Several commonly identified denitrifiers were prominent in wells but not in aquifers, including <italic>Sphingomodales</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and <italic>Comamonadaceae</italic> (Order: <italic>Burkolderiales</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The presence of these taxa suggest that wells may be enriched in nitrate, or as we have not measured actual activity, the results may indicate previous conditions that suited these organisms.</p><p>Our expectations of water quality were that wells would be higher in oxygen than aquifers, but we did not detect a difference, with well water dissolved oxygen typical for groundwaters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Based on this same expectation, it was surprising to find a high proportion of denitrifying bacteria (which require low oxygen conditions) in the wells and a high proportion of nitrifying bacteria (which require high oxygen conditions) in the aquifer, which is in contrast to what we would normally expect of the oxygen conditions in these environments. Again, this may be due to biota indicating long-term water quality trends.</p><p>Interestingly, both Woesearchaeota (archaea) and <italic>Anaerolineales</italic> were more abundant in the aquifer than the well. Both Woesearchaeota and <italic>Anaerolineales</italic> are associated with anaerobic fermentation processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, suggesting a very low oxygen or anaerobic environment in at least some part of the aquifer. In addition, combined <italic>Neisseriales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> contributed a greater proportion of the community in wells (25%) than in aquifers (2%). Both <italic>Neisseriales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> are aerobic microorganisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, their abundance in wells suggests it to be a well oxygenated environment as we might expect given its direct access to the atmosphere. Both <italic>Neisseriales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> are common in groundwater microbial communities in eastern Australia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> however their exact functional roles within the groundwater ecosystem are still largely unknown.</p><p>Bacteria from the phylum Acidobacter (represented by GP16, GP6, GP13 and GP5) were also more prevalent in aquifers than well waters. These bacteria have been reported as abundant in oligotrophic freshwater environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Taxa from this order are known to be adapted to low carbon environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, which parallels the natural state of groundwater ecosystems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.

The relatively small proportion of these taxa in well assemblages may reflect the limited contact of the well water with the soil profile due to the largely impermeable well casing.</p><p>Actinobacteria (<italic>Acidimicrobiales</italic> and <italic>Actinomycetales</italic>) are common groundwater microbes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and were present in relatively higher abundances in wells than aquifers, albeit not significantly. These taxa prefer living in water columns rather than interstitial spaces or attached to sediment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> which may explain their greater relative abundance in the open water of the well environment than in the aquifers. Given that most bacteria within pristine aquifers are attached rather than free-living<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, large abundances of Actinobacteria may be a useful <italic>post hoc</italic> indicator that samples were not drawn from the aquifer, and thus may not be representative of the communities within it.</p><p>Another notable difference between aquifer and well prokaryotic communities was the presence of pathogenic organisms, particularly <italic>Xanthomonadales</italic> (Family: <italic>Xanthomonadaceae</italic>) and <italic>Pseudomondales</italic>, which were more prevalent in wells than aquifer samples.

The greater abundance of these organisms, as well as <italic>Xanthomondales</italic> and <italic>Pseudomondales</italic>, in wells suggests that either pathogens are entering groundwater through wells from terrestrial source, or that the well provides an environment that is more conducive to population growth than does the aquifer.</p><p>To investigate the Eukaryotic communities in wells and aquifers, our study combined stygofauna sampling (targeting macro/meiofauna) with 18S rDNA sequencing (targeting micro to macro-eukaryotes). Sampling revealed a relatively high diversity of taxa, including many of the fungal genera reported from aquifers in other parts of eastern Australia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, protozoans and stygofauna (including Nematoda, Syncarid, Amphipoda, Oligochaeta, Copepoda, Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Tardigrada, Gastropoda and Ostracoda). The results of both approaches indicate differences in community structure between well and aquifer waters. However, the taxonomic resolution on most taxa is low and there is little autecological or functional information available for most taxa which makes it difficult to determine functional differences of eukaryote communities between wells and aquifers.</p><p>Whilst both traditional &#8216;collect and count&#8217; methods and metagenomics indicated differences between well and aquifer samples, the Eukaryotic species detected by these methods differed. DNA analysis identified more meio-fauna such as Tardigrades, Platyhelminthes and protozoans, which can be cryptic and difficult to process and identify under a microscope. Whereas net/pump sampling located syncarids and amphipods which were not detected in metagenomic analysis. This indicates that both methods in combination, may be necessary to detect all stygobitic fauna. The inability to detect stygofauna in some metagenomics samples from wells does question the suitability of eDNA for stygofauna monitoring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Protozoans, particularly those from the class Spirotrichea (sub-class Hypotrichia), contributed to the eukaryotic community in both wells and aquifers. Protozoans within groundwater graze on bacterial cells which in turn can stimulate bacterial metabolism through secreted nutrients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. It has also been suggested that the grazing of bacteria by protozoans prevents clogging of interstitial spaces in the aquifer matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref> and contribute to the cycling of nitrogen and carbon within groundwaters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Centramoebida (Amoebozoan), Eugregarunorida (Protozoan), water mites and fungi were also relatively abundant within groundwater, indicating a complex community of micro, meio- and macro fauna within aquifers.</p><p>The fungi Kickxellomycotina was the most abundant eukaryote in both well and aquifer samples. Little is know of the ecological significance of this fungi sub-phylum, although members of this class are known to live in freshwater and are believed to have a symbiotic relationship with arthropods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Relative abundances of Kickxellomycotina was over three times higher in wells than aquifers, which may be due to the increased abundance of stygofauna within wells. Fungi from the order Blastocladiales were also high in abundances in both wells and aquifers. Members of this taxon are known to live in freshwater environments where they are associated with dead crustaceans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref> or are parasites of nematodes, crustaceans, and tardigrades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>.</p><p>Well waters contained a higher abundance of Peronosporomycetes (Aphanomyces) than aquifer samples. These fungi are known to live in damp soils and aquatic environments and contribute to significant loss of crops due to root rot particularly on legumes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. The higher relative abundance of this taxon within wells may indicate contact with the terrestrial environment and could potentially be linked with landuse and irrigation. Amphitremida (Stramenopile: Labyrinthulomycetes) were present in both well and aquifer samples. Taxa from this group are ecologically significant as decomposers or parasites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>. They are well known from marine environments however poorly studied in freshwater. Fungi from the order Pezizomycotina (including the class Dothimdeomycetes) had higher relative abundance in aquifers than wells. This taxon is known to occur within aquifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>, potentially having a significant role in nutrient cycling and biofilm production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>.</p><p>All major stygofauna taxa collected by traditional methods (netting and pumping) had higher abundances per litre in wells than in aquifers. This has been reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and attributed to large-bodied invertebrates preferring the open spaces, and nutrient-enriched sediments and water within wells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In particular, amphipods were only found within wells, which is consistent with Hahn &amp; Matzke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, who found significantly higher proportions of amphipods inside wells than in aquifer samples. The low abundance of amphipods in the aquifer is expected, and the greater abundance of amphipods in wells may reflect the greater density of prey, or simply effect of wells as a &#8216;trap&#8217; for fauna. Amphipods are important ecosystem services providers in aquifers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref> and are among the most sensitive stygofauna taxon to disturbance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Biased assessments of abundance based on well only sampling may lead to inaccurate conclusions about aquifer condition and productivity. Similarly, differences in the relative abundance of taxa in wells and aquifers means that proportion-based metrics used for health assessment, such as the proportion of crustaceans to oligochaetes (see Korbel &amp; Hose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), will also be affected by the sampling approach. These findings also have implications for the use of artificial substrates deployed in wells to assess groundwater communities (e.g. Voisin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>).</p><p>This study highlights several important factors to consider when sampling groundwater biota. The need to purge wells for biological sampling is dependent on the objectives of the study and the biota being analysed. The two most common objectives of sampling biota in groundwater are 1) to assess biodiversity (often required by legislation prior to commencement of development activities) in which the desired outcome is a comprehensive list of the taxa present, and 2) to investigate some aspect of groundwater ecology, which requires analysis of the composition, function, health or other attribute of the aquifer.</p><p>Based on our findings, it appears that sampling wells (without purging) is appropriate for assessing stygofauna diversity (richness), but multiple samples are generally required over time to capture all taxa using this method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>. Our results also question the suitability of using eDNA as a &#8216;stand alone&#8217; method for stygofauna monitoring. When information on prokaryote and eukaryote assemblages, or assessments requiring reliable stygofauna abundance estimates are required, purging of the well and post purge sampling is necessary. Our methods purged the well by removing approximately 50&#8201;L of water (approximately 3 well volumes) at a rate of 10&#8201;L/min. After this, 150&#8201;L of water was pumped to collect stygofauna. Samples for molecular analysis were then collected, by which time 200&#8201;L of groundwater (approximately 8&#8211;10 well volumes) had been removed. Previous studies, however, have suggested that the removal of smaller volumes of water for purging may still be adequate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>As a consequence of the findings of this study, we suggest that groundwater biological sampling should consider the approach used here, which separates the water collected into pre- and post-purge samples for stygofauna analysis, with all microbial (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) samples collected after purging. The volume of water required to purge the well will depend on well depth and diameter, and we suggest that at least three well volumes be removed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and that this water be processed separately as a &#8216;well&#8217; sample. A second volume of water no less than 100&#8201;L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref> could then be collected as a separate &#8216;aquifer&#8217; sample. This method will results in two different data sets depending on what analysis is to be completed. Community analysis of stygofauna (e.g. abundance or proportions of species) should be measured using the &#8216;aquifer&#8217; sample without the purged &#8216;well&#8217; sample, thus eliminating the high relative abundances and compositional differences between well and aquifer samples. Whereas richness or species lists should be compiled using stygofauna by compiling both &#8216;well&#8217; and &#8216;aquifer&#8217; samples to provide the best estimate of stygofauna richness at the site.</p><p>In summary, sampling methods inherently need to balance accuracy and efficiency as well as costs. Our findings indicate differences in prokaryotic and eukaryotic community function and structure between well and aquifer waters. We are not attempting to discriminate between sampling strategies or processing methods, rather we have shown the importance of purging wells to reflect the true community structure and function within aquifers. Future studies should attempt to characterise the functional and structural aspects of groundwater ecosystems, identify the metabolic pathways by which microbes produce and transform energy, and investigate the magnitude of influence these organisms have on the geochemistry of groundwater.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study Area</title><p>Sampling was conducted in the alluvial aquifers of the Condamine, Gwydir, Namoi and Macquarie- Bogan catchments, all of which form part of the Murray Darling Basin which is the largest drainage basin in Australia.

This hybrid pipeline takes files of reads and generates a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table covering all of the samples in the study.

The use of two independent classification techniques is done to provide some insight into the reliability of the taxonomic assignments, and how reliable they may be.</p><p>The pipeline first demultiplexed the data to produce a pair of read files for each sample. These paired reads were then merged, trimmed, dereplicated, and then clustered at 97% similarity to generate a set of representative OTU sequences. The merging, dereplicating and clustering steps were done using USearch v8.1.1812 tools (<italic>fastq_mergepairs, derep_fulllength</italic> and <italic>cluster_otus</italic>). The merging step excluded any merged reads with greater than 1 expected error (-fastq_merge_maxee 1.0). The clustering step also checked for chimeras, running each sequence through UParse-ref using the current set of OTUs as a reference database. If the optimal model is chimeric, the sequence is discarded. Each of these OTU sequences was then classified in two different ways: by using the RDP Classifier (v2.10.2) to determine a taxonomic classification for each sequence, down to best level of genus; and by using <italic>usearch_global</italic> to find the best match for each sequence within a curated set of 16S reference sequences, giving a species-level classification for each OTU sequence. The 16S reference set used for the species-level classification was built from the RDP Classifier&#8217;s training set (v14), augmented with additional sequences from the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) [ <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/">https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>].

The classified OTUs and the counts for each sample were then used to generate OTU tables in both text and. biom (v1) formats, complete with taxonomic classifications, species assignments and counts for each sample. Summaries of the OTU classifications were also produced at taxonomic levels from phylum to genus and species.</p><p>The Illumina MiSeq 18S data was processed using variant of the 16S pipeline described above.

Stygofauna data were analysed in two ways, first with all samples (including the dummy variable and zero abundance samples) and second with only those samples which contained stygofauna in both aquifer <italic>and</italic> well samples and no dummy variable included<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Similarity among samples was estimated using the Bray-Curtis similarity. Differences among sample groups were compared using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and differences in the multivariate dispersion between groups of samples were analysed using PERMDISP. SIMPER analysis was used to determine the taxa responsible for similarities and differences between well and aquifer stygofauna communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Water quality analysis</title><p>The average concentration DO, EC, temperature and pH in wells and aquifers were plotted using excel. Paired t-tests were conducted to compare the differences in water quality variables between well and aquifer. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was completed for nutrient results from the seven sites selected for molecular analysis. Paired T-tests were used to compare differences in the relative abundances of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA OTUs, stygofauna abundances, and the values for water quality variables between well and aquifer samples. The significance level (&#945;) for all univariate and multivariate inferential tests was 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Korbel, K. <italic>et al</italic>.
