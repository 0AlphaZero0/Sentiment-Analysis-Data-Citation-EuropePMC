We have previously reported on the discovery and preclinical characterization of PRT062607, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of SYK that exhibits robust anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models. Here we present data from our first human studies aimed at characterizing the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of PRT062607 in healthy volunteers following single and multiple oral administrations. PRT062607 demonstrated a favorable PK profile and the ability to completely inhibit SYK activity in multiple whole&#8208;blood assays. The PD half&#8208;life in the more sensitive assays was approximately 24 hours and returned to predose levels by 72 hours. Selectivity for SYK was observed at all dose levels tested. Analysis of the PK/PD relationship indicated an IC<sub>50</sub> of 324 nM for inhibition of B&#8208;cell antigen receptor&#8208;mediated B&#8208;cell activation and 205 nM for inhibition of Fc&#949;RI&#8208;mediated basophil degranulation. PRT062607 was safe and well tolerated across the entire range of doses. Clinical PK/PD was related to in vivo anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of PRT062607 in the rat collagen&#8208;induced arthritis model, which predicts that therapeutic concentrations may be safely achieved in humans for the treatment of autoimmune disease. PRT062607 has a desirable PK profile and is capable of safely, potently, and selectively suppressing SYK kinase function in humans following once&#8208;daily oral dosing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0001">SYK</kwd><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0002">PRT062607</kwd><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0003">autoimmune</kwd><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0004">allergy</kwd><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0005">lymphoma</kwd><kwd id="jcph794-kwd-0006">immunopharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="10109"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>jcph794</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>February 2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.0.2 mode:remove_FC converted:20.01.2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase that, upon receptor engagement, binds to diphosphorylated immune tyrosine activation motif (ITAM), resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple downstream substrates that ultimately regulate the cell's survival, functional activation, differentiation, and clonal expansion. In B cells, signaling through the B&#8208;cell antigen receptor (BCR) is transduced following antigen ligation by its association with immunoglobulins Ig&#945; and Ig&#946;, each bearing an ITAM, leading to cellular activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into Ig&#8208;secreting plasma cells.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> In addition to its role in B&#8208;cell development and the generation of antibody&#8208;producing plasma cells,<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jcph794-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> SYK is also required for BCR&#8208;mediated uptake and presentation of antigen on MHC.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Fc receptors also associate with ITAM&#8208;containing proteins and utilize SYK for the initiation of Ig&#8208;mediated inflammatory responses by mast cells and basophils (via Fc&#949;R)<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> and for the promotion of antigen presentation, oxidative burst, phagocytosis, and cytokine release by eosinophils, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages (via Fc&#947;Rs).<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Fc&#947;R&#8208;dependent antigen/antibody immune complex uptake and presentation by antigen&#8208;presenting cells are also dependent on SYK.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> SYK inhibition may therefore indirectly suppress T&#8208;cell activation.

</p><p>Described herein, a single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study in healthy volunteers was initiated at 3 mg and escalated to 400 mg, at which complete inhibition of SYK was achieved in multiple relevant assays performed in whole blood collected over a 72&#8208;hour period following dosing. A multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study was also conducted in healthy volunteers, who were dosed once daily for 10 consecutive days, starting at 11 mg and escalating to 110&#160;mg. The aim of the first in&#8208;human studies was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of PRT062607 following oral dosing. The PD variables measured in whole blood of dosed subjects included both SYK&#8208;dependent (BCR&#8208;induced pERK and up&#8208;regulation of cell surface CD69 in B cells, and Fc&#949;RI&#8208;induced up&#8208;regulation of basophil cell surface CD63) and SYK&#8208;independent (BCR&#8208;induced pSYK and PMA&#8208;induced pERK in B cells, fMLP&#8208;induced up&#8208;regulation of basophil cell surface CD63, and CD3/CD28&#8208;induced up&#8208;regulation of T&#8208;cell surface CD69) measures of immune cell functional responses. Complete inhibition of SYK in peripheral whole&#8208;blood assays was achieved at steady state at the 110&#8208;mg dose. No inhibition of SYK&#8208;independent immune functional responses was observed. PK/PD evaluations enabled dose projections for efficacy in human autoimmune disease based on exposures required for efficacy in animal models.</p><sec id="jcph794-sec-0020"><title>Methods</title><sec id="jcph794-sec-0030"><title>Clinical Trial Design</title><p>Study protocols were approved by the local site IRB.

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and fatigue have emerged as common safety concerns in treated patients. In addition, increased rates of adverse events have been observed in combination studies with idelisib and may limit its potential to be used in conjunction with other therapies.

Given the specificity and potency differences, it is possible that PRT062607 will elicit a different safety and efficacy profile relative to fostamatinib. Of note, a dual SYK/ZAP70 inhibitor (MK&#8208;8457) recently demonstrated efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis but ultimately was not tolerated due to serious infections, and the program was discontinued.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>

Caco&#8208;2&#8208;cell data suggest that PRT062607 is highly effluxed by P&#8208;gp (data not shown), which may be a contributing factor to the nonlinear increases in exposure observed up to 100 mg in the SAD study and up to 110 mg in the MAD study. Dose&#8208;proportional increases, however, are seen beyond 200 mg in the SAD study, suggesting that the efflux mechanism of P&#8208;gp in the gut may be saturated at these higher doses. Despite the nonlinear increases in exposure, intersubject variability was found to be low to moderate, suggesting that the PK behavior of PRT062607 is predictable. In addition, PD response appeared to be directly related to PK response, and the pharmacologic activity of PRT062607 was maintained on repeat dosing. There was little contribution via renal excretion to the overall elimination of PRT062607. Renal clearance of PRT062607 was determined to be nearly equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate when the protein binding of PRT062607 in human plasma (93.5%) is taken into account. Low renal clearance offers a benefit when this drug is administered to elderly patient populations, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis, where compromised renal function is prevalent.</p><p>One consistent observation made with PRT062607 both preclinically and following oral dosing in humans is a potent inhibition of Fc&#949;R1 signaling. We do not have a clear mechanistic understanding of this observation, but the combined SAD/MAD human data indicate an approximately 2&#8208;fold increase in potency of suppressing Fc&#949;R1&#8208;mediated basophil degranulation relative to BCR&#8208;mediated signaling or activation. Based on the clinical studies, we have estimated that inhibition of peripheral blood basophil degranulation by 50% can be achieved at a concentration of &#8764;0.2 &#956;M, which would be maintained at a dose of 51 mg, and by 90% at around 0.7 &#956;M, which would require a projected dose of 130 mg.

Wex et al<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> demonstrated in a conditional knockout model that SYK was critical for the generation of mast cell&#8211;mediated allergic and inflammatory responses.

Most likely, this was a function of a mixed reaction of suppressing BCR signaling and autoantibody production as well as inhibiting Fc&#947;R&#8208;mediated activation of effector myeloid cells. The combined effect of targeting multiple relevant immunological mechanisms may have contributed to the observation that low&#8208;level inhibition of a single pathway was sufficient for disease resolution. Experimentally, SYK is required for Fc&#947;R&#8208;mediated activation of macrophages and neutrophils,<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jcph794-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> and SYK expression in neutrophils is required for the development of inflammation and disease symptoms in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Consistently, reconstitution of the hematopoietic system of irradiated mice with SYK knockout fetal liver cells protects against autoantibody&#8208;mediated arthritis.<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> To confirm the requirement of SYK in established mature immune cells for arthritis development, Ozaki et al<xref rid="jcph794-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> have demonstrated that conditional SYK knockout mice were completely protected from collagen antibody&#8211;induced arthritis. The protection from inflammation was associated with defective signaling and functional responses following Fc&#947;R ligation in macrophages and neutrophils.</p><p>In conclusion, SYK remains an attractive target for certain autoimmune diseases and B&#8208;cell malignancies, yet its potential has not been fully explored. Animal models predict that complete suppression of SYK activity may not be needed to elicit clinical response by PRT062607. Dose&#8208;ranging clinical studies will be required with PRT062607 to determine the level of pathway suppression required for efficacy. Results from the healthy normal volunteer studies suggest that the full range of SYK inhibition by PRT062607 can be safely explored in humans and can enable identification of a pharmacological profile customized to individual target patient populations.</p></sec><sec id="jcph794-sec-0240"><title>Disclosures</title><p>G.C., A.B., Y.P., H.D., A.P., S.H., D.G., and U.S. are current or former employees and shareholders of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><p>Additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web&#8208;site.</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplemental Figure S1: Relationship between Cmax, AUC, and Dose of PRT062607 following single and multiple oral administration of PRT062607.</p></caption><media xlink:href="JCPH-57-194-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplemental Figure S2: PK parameters following the first oral administration of PRT062607 in the MAD study.</p></caption><media xlink:href="JCPH-57-194-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting Table</p></caption><media xlink:href="JCPH-57-194-s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting Information</p></caption><media xlink:href="JCPH-57-194-s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list id="jcph794-bibl-0001"><title>References</title><ref id="jcph794-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="jcph794-cit-0001">
