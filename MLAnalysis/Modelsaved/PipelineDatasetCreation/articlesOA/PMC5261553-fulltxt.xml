Our aim was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate the causal effect of intrauterine exposure to greater maternal body mass index (BMI) on offspring BMI and fat mass from childhood to early adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We used maternal genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to test the causal effect of maternal BMI in pregnancy on offspring fatness (BMI and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] determined fat mass index [FMI]) in a MR approach. This was investigated, with repeat measurements, from ages 7 to 18 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; <italic>n</italic> = 2,521 to 3,720 for different ages). We then sought to replicate findings with results for BMI at age 6 in Generation R (<italic>n</italic> = 2,337 for replication sample; <italic>n</italic> = 6,057 for total pooled sample).</p><p>In confounder-adjusted multivariable regression in ALSPAC, a 1 standard deviation (SD, equivalent of 3.7 kg/m2) increase in maternal BMI was associated with a 0.25 SD (95% CI 0.21&#8211;0.29) increase in offspring BMI at age 7, with similar results at later ages and when FMI was used as the outcome.</p><p>A weighted genetic risk score was generated from 32 genetic variants robustly associated with BMI (minimum F-statistic = 45 in ALSPAC). The MR results using this genetic risk score as an IV in ALSPAC were close to the null at all ages (e.g., 0.04 SD (95% CI -0.21&#8211;0.30) at age 7 and 0.03 SD (95% CI -0.26&#8211;0.32) at age 18 per SD increase in maternal BMI), which was similar when a 97 variant generic risk score was used in ALSPAC.</p><p>When findings from age 7 in ALSPAC were meta-analysed with those from age 6 in Generation R, the pooled confounder-adjusted multivariable regression association was 0.22 SD (95% CI 0.19&#8211;0.25) per SD increase in maternal BMI and the pooled MR effect (pooling the 97 variant score results from ALSPAC with the 32 variant score results from Generation R) was 0.05 SD (95%CI -0.11&#8211;0.21) per SD increase in maternal BMI (<italic>p</italic>-value for difference between the two results = 0.05). A number of sensitivity analyses exploring violation of the MR results supported our main findings. However, power was limited for some of the sensitivity tests and further studies with relevant data on maternal, offspring, and paternal genotype are required to obtain more precise (and unbiased) causal estimates.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings provide little evidence to support a strong causal intrauterine effect of incrementally greater maternal BMI resulting in greater offspring adiposity.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Using a Mendelian randomization approach, Rebecca Richmond and colleagues find limited evidence for a causal effect of maternal pregnancy adiposity on future offspring adiposity during childhood and adolescence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec

Maternal body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with greater pregnancy-related increases in circulating glucose, lipids, and fatty acids [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and in turn higher maternal gestational levels of these nutrients are associated with greater birth size [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, strong evidence for a causal effect of greater maternal gestational adiposity and circulating fasting glucose, but not triglycerides, on birth weight and ponderal index at birth has recently been shown using a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As birth size is correlated with later size, it is possible that these effects will extend into later offspring postnatal life. In addition to this proposed tracking effect, it has been suggested that intrauterine exposure to higher levels of adiposity-related nutrients, such as glucose, results in permanent changes to offspring appetite control, neuroendocrine functioning, or energy metabolism, which subsequently result in greater adiposity in later life, irrespective of any effect on birth size [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ascertaining whether greater maternal gestational adiposity results in greater offspring adiposity through intrauterine effects is important because if it does then that mechanism could result in acceleration of the obesity epidemic across generations [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and would emphasise the importance of preconception or antenatal interventions in women of reproductive age to halt and reverse the obesity epidemic [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Several large cohort studies have shown that maternal pre- or early-pregnancy BMI is positively associated with offspring fatness, measured with BMI, waist circumference, or more direct assessments of fat mass, across the whole maternal BMI distribution [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, due to the high heritability of adiposity and shared environmental and behavioural characteristics between mothers and their offspring, it is impossible to determine specific intrauterine effects from such studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An intergenerational MR design in which maternal genetic variants are used as instrumental variables (IVs) for environmentally modifiable intrauterine exposures, such as exposure to greater maternal adiposity, may be useful for providing insights into the causal effect of these exposures on later offspring outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002221.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To our knowledge, this approach has only been used once to examine the causal effect of maternal BMI on offspring adiposity in childhood [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In that study, a variant in the <italic>FTO</italic> gene was used as an IV for pre-pregnancy BMI. The results suggested no causal effect of maternal gestational BMI on offspring dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-determined fat mass at age 10 y once offspring genotype was taken into account. However, the CI for the IV estimate was very wide, and it could not be statistically distinguished from the positive multivariable association of maternal pregnancy BMI with offspring fat mass. That MR study and, indeed, most of the conventional multivariable association studies have examined associations only in infancy or early childhood rather than into adulthood [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Examining associations at older ages is important because the potential for this mechanism to accelerate the obesity epidemic relates to maternal gestational adiposity, influencing their daughters&#8217; adiposity during their reproductive years, such that they go into their pregnancies somewhat fatter and influence the next generation and so on through generations [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><fig id="pmed.1002221.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002221.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Intergenerational MR analysis to investigate a causal intrauterine effect of maternal BMI on offspring adiposity.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1002221.g001"/></fig><p>Our aim was to use MR to investigate the causal effect of intrauterine exposure to greater pre-/early-pregnancy maternal BMI on offspring BMI and fat mass using repeat measurements from childhood to early adulthood.

In a questionnaire completed at 32 wk of gestation, mothers recorded the occupation and education of themselves and their partners. Highest occupation of the mother or their partner was used to allocate family social class groups (classes I [professional occupations], II [managerial and technical occupations], III non-manual [skilled non-manual occupations], III manual [skilled manual occupations], IV [partly skilled occupations], V [unskilled occupations]) using the 1991 British Office of Population Censuses and Surveys classification. Highest educational qualifications of the mother and father were treated as separate variables, and each was collapsed into one of four categories: education up to age 16 y with vocational training or certificate of secondary education, education up to age 16 y with general certification of education (ordinary level), education up to age 18 with general certificate of education (advanced level), and university degree. Information on mothers&#8217; smoking status during pregnancy was obtained in questionnaires administered at 18 and 32 wk of gestation. Data were used to generate a categorical variable: never smoked during pregnancy, smoked in early pregnancy only, and smoked throughout pregnancy. Maternal age at delivery was derived from the mother&#8217;s date of birth, which was recorded at the time of recruitment, and the date of birth of her offspring. Offspring sex was recorded in the delivery room and abstracted from obstetric records and/or birth notifications.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Generation R</title><p>Information about the mother&#8217;s parity, defined as the number of times that the woman had given birth to a foetus with a gestational age of 24 wk or more, was obtained by questionnaire at enrolment.

The highest completed education level (primary school, secondary school, higher education) for both mothers and fathers was obtained from questionnaires administered at enrolment. Information about maternal smoking in pregnancy was assessed by questionnaire in each trimester and was categorised into never smoked during pregnancy, smoked in early pregnancy only, and smoked throughout pregnancy. Maternal age was obtained in the questionnaire administered at enrolment. Using this and information about the gestational age of the foetus at enrolment and gestational age at birth, mother&#8217;s age at delivery was derived.

We were unable to find any other study with relevant data on maternal and offspring genetic variants, maternal pre- or early-pregnancy BMI, and offspring BMI or fat mass in adolescence/early adulthood and so could not explore replication of ALSPAC findings at older ages.

All analyses were undertaken using Stata (Stata Corp, TX, US), version 13.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Analysis of Effect of Maternal Pre-pregnancy BMI on Offspring Adiposity through Childhood to Young Adulthood in ALSPAC</title><p>Multivariable linear regression was performed to examine the association of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI with offspring BMI from ages 7 to 18 and FMI from ages 10 to 18. In the first model, maternal age, offspring age, and sex were controlled in the standardised exposure and outcome. In the second model, we additionally adjusted for potential confounding by parental social class, parental education, maternal smoking during pregnancy, parity, and paternal BMI.</p><p>MR analysis was first carried out using the maternal weighted BMI allele score composed of 32 SNPs as an IV for her pre-/early-pregnancy BMI to assess its causal effect on offspring BMI (from ages 7 to 18) and offspring FMI (from ages 10 to 18). Both multivariable and IV approaches examined the same relationship, i.e., the SD change in outcome per 1 SD increase in maternal pre-/early-pregnancy BMI.</p><p>We used two-stage least squares (TSLS) IV analysis for the MR approach. We assumed an additive genetic model as supported by the original GWAS [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The strength of the IV was assessed by examining the R<sup>2</sup> and F-statistics from the first stage regression for each analysis [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Maternal age, offspring age, and sex were controlled in all MR analyses by the use of exposure and outcome measurements standardised for these characteristics. Despite evidence that the lifestyle and socioeconomic characteristics that commonly confound observational studies are randomly distributed with respect to genotype [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we tested this assumption in our study by examining associations between the allele score and potential confounders of the observational association [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>To obtain a causal estimate of the intrauterine influence of maternal BMI on offspring BMI, it is important to adjust for offspring genotype to exclude the possibility of another independent pathway between the genetic instrument and outcome, i.e., through genetic transmission from the mother to their offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002221.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This was achieved by adding the offspring weighted BMI allele score to the IV models. A z-test was used to test for a difference between this MR IV analysis and the confounder-adjusted multivariable regression analysis, with evidence for a difference between the two being indicative of the possibility of unobserved confounding in the multivariable analysis. The z-statistic was calculated by estimating the covariance between the multivariable regression and IV estimates using a bootstrapping procedure.</p><p>We generated an additional weighted allele score from 97 genetic variants, using SNP-specific weights taken from the recent GWAS meta-analysis in which they were all identified [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in order to explore whether our main findings were consistent when using this score, with potentially greater power.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Replication in an Independent Cohort and Meta-Analysis</title><p>We undertook multivariable regression and MR IV analyses in the replication Generation R Study using the same methods as described above for ALSPAC, with the additional adjustment for ethnicity, by including the first 20 principal components obtained from the offspring genotype data as covariates in both analyses.

We took a similar approach to pooling the MR IV results. We did this by pooling the results from the two stages of the IV analyses separately: (i) the maternal allele score (with and without adjustment for offspring allele score) association with maternal BMI (first regression) and (ii) the maternal allele score (with and without adjustment for offspring allele score) association with offspring BMI at age 6 (second regression). We then combined these two pooled estimates to obtain the IV MR causal effect using the ratio estimate, i.e., the pooled results of (ii) &#247; the pooled results of (i) [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The standard errors of these estimates were calculated using a Taylor series approximation [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We pooled results using the 32-SNP scores generated in both studies and also results using the 97-SNP score in ALSPAC with the 32-SNP score in Generation R. We compared the pooled offspring allele score-adjusted MR IV results with the pooled confounder-adjusted multivariable estimates using a z-test and bootstrapping, as described above for ALSPAC.</p><p>To provide results that are more interpretable for clinical and public health use, we converted the results on the SD scale to BMI units by multiplying them by a representative value of the SD of pre-pregnancy BMI (3.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and offspring BMI (2.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) taken from the Discovery and largest study (ALSPAC).</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Sensitivity Analyses</title><p>In the MR analysis, it is necessary to adjust for offspring BMI allele score to separate the influence of genetic inheritance from the intrauterine effect of maternal adiposity during pregnancy. However, as was highlighted in a response to the previous paper where this method was used [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], adjustment may introduce a form of bias known as collider bias in estimating the exposure&#8211;outcome association. This is because by adjusting for offspring allele score in the MR IV analyses, we may induce an association via paternal genetic variants (which we do not have data on; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We explain this possibility in more detail in the appendix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) and also describe how we undertook simulation studies to explore the likelihood of this biasing our main results with adjustment for offspring allele score. Furthermore, an alternative method for avoiding possible collider bias is to use only the maternal non-transmitted alleles [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We explored the use of this approach within ALSPAC and present results in the appendix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) only given the relatively low statistical power associated with this method.</p><p>A high degree of heterogeneity between causal estimates of the individual SNPs comprising the allele scores could indicate violation of the MR assumption that there is no pleiotropy. We therefore performed inverse-variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis of the individual SNP estimates in both ALSPAC and Generation R and calculated Cochran&#8217;s Q and I<sup>2</sup> statistic to estimate the degree of heterogeneity in the fixed effects meta-analysis [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We also investigated potential bias due to pleiotropy by performing MR Egger regression [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for the model adjusted for offspring allele score. The intercept in this analysis provides a test for overall directional pleiotropy, and the coefficient provides a valid causal estimate in the presence of pleiotropy. Results were obtained for both ALSPAC (using both sets of 32 SNPs and 97 SNPs) and Generation R (using the set of 32 SNPs). The intercepts and slopes were meta-analysed and compared with those obtained using IVW of the individual SNPs.

However, we found no evidence for these associations being causal in MR IV analyses using a weighted allele score of 32 (or 97) genetic variants known to be robustly associated with BMI. There was statistical evidence that the confounder-adjusted multivariable analyses differed from the offspring genetic variant-adjusted MR analyses, and results were virtually identical when we used FMI measured by DXA scan. ALSPAC findings were replicated in the independent Generation R Study with BMI assessed at age 6 y. Taken together, these results do not support an important causal intrauterine effect of greater maternal BMI on later offspring adiposity. This is in contrast to evidence of a causal effect of greater maternal adiposity on birth weight and ponderal index at birth identified using MR in a previous study that included both of the cohorts used here [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], potentially indicating a diminishing effect of this intrauterine exposure over the life course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002221.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pmed.1002221.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002221.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Diminishing causal effect of developmental overnutrition across the life course.</title><p>Multivariable and IV effect estimates from ALSPAC at ages 7&#8211;18 (<xref rid="pmed.1002221.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) compared with those obtained when investigating the effect of maternal BMI on offspring ponderal index (kg/m<sup>3</sup>) at birth in the same cohort.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1002221.g003"/></fig><p>Findings of a null causal effect from MR analysis in both ALSPAC (at all ages from childhood to early adulthood) and Generation R (in childhood) are consistent with most of the negative control studies, which show a similar magnitude of association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring BMI as that between paternal BMI and offspring BMI [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], although none of those studies assessed outcomes in early adulthood. They are also consistent with a large within-sibling analysis, which suggested that shared familial characteristics confounded the positive maternal early-pregnancy BMI&#8211;offspring BMI association at age 18, as this disappeared when analyses were conducted within siblings with close matching of shared family characteristics [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, that study was performed in male offspring only. Lastly, the results are consistent with the previous MR study in ALSPAC conducted using the <italic>FTO</italic> variant only as an IV for maternal BMI and examining offspring BMI- and DXA-determined fat mass at age 10 [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By combining a large number of genetic variants in an allele score, in this study, we have increased statistical power and shown a difference between the multivariable and IV analysis in ALSPAC at multiple ages (from childhood to early adulthood), which was not the case with the previous ALSPAC publication. We have also shown independent replication of our findings in Generation R, investigated the use of multiple instruments, and tested for potential pleiotropic effects.</p><p>For the MR analysis, we thoroughly investigated any violation of the main assumptions of this approach, which are that the IV is robustly associated with the exposure of interest, not related to confounding factors of the exposure&#8211;outcome association, and not related to the outcome independent of its effect on the exposure [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The allele scores derived from established variants for BMI were strongly associated with the exposure of interest (maternal BMI) in the full cohorts, and large F-statistics indicated sufficient strength as IVs, enabling a more precise assessment of the effect of maternal BMI than was previously possible with the use of a single genetic variant [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The allele scores were not consistently associated with a range of socioeconomic factors, and this illustrates a key strength of the MR approach. In addition, by adjusting for offspring genotype, intergenerational MR is able to distinguish between causal maternal effects on offspring adiposity from genetic transmission of adiposity variants.</p><p>The existence of pleiotropy, in which a genetic instrument has an effect on an outcome (offspring BMI) independent of its effect on the exposure (maternal BMI), would have implications for the assumptions made in the MR analysis. Similarly, if a genetic variant in the score was in linkage disequilibrium with another genetic variant that influences the outcome through a pathway that is unrelated to the exposure, this could bias the causal estimate. The fact that some BMI variants relate to glucose and other metabolites [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] is an example of type 2 or spurious pleiotropy and is unlikely to bias the IV effects [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. We have attempted to control for the effect of offspring genotype, which is related to maternal genotype, on offspring BMI by adjusting for offspring genotype. It is hard to determine a real pleiotropic effect that would produce the null effects seen following this adjustment. In addition, the consistency of IV estimates obtained using two allele scores in this study suggests that pleiotropy is unlikely. Furthermore, there was no strong evidence for heterogeneity of individual SNP estimates comprising the allele scores, and the MR Egger method gave no indication of directional pleiotropy in ALSPAC or Generation R.</p><p>Although maternal genetic variants are being used as an unconfounded proxy for an intrauterine exposure, these variants will also impact on maternal BMI after pregnancy and so any causal effect, had it been identified, might also incorporate postnatal effects. For example, mothers who are genetically predisposed to have a higher BMI might influence their offspring&#8217;s adiposity through postnatal characteristics such as maternal feeding behaviours [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The heterogeneity observed in the confounder-adjusted multivariable models could represent variation in prevailing postnatal environmental contexts, for example cultural influences on parents&#8217; child-feeding behaviour [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, the MR effects were null in both ALSPAC and Generation R, suggesting that the causal effect of postnatal maternal BMI on offspring adiposity is at most very small. The weak inverse association of maternal BMI allele scores with their partners (but not their own) education that we saw in both cohorts is intriguing and worth further exploration, but adjusting for this did not alter our MR results.</p><p>It is important to adjust for offspring genotype in the MR analyses, but in doing so we might introduce a path between maternal genotype and offspring BMI via paternal genotype. Our simulations suggested that this would result in a weak bias towards the null, but this bias would not fully explain the null effects we observe as the results in the simulation study with adjustment for offspring allele score were close to the true simulated result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s020">S11 Table</xref>). Furthermore, our findings were corroborated with results from the non-transmitted haplotype analysis [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], applied in ALSPAC, which revealed that the non-transmitted maternal haplotype score did not show strong evidence of association with offspring BMI.</p><p>In the MR meta-analysis using the 97-SNP allele score in ALSPAC and the 32-SNP allele score in Generation R, with adjustment for offspring genotype (<italic>n</italic> = 6,057), we had 82% power to detect a causal effect the size of that seen in the multivariable analysis controlled for age and sex (0.28 SD) with a two-sided &#945; = 0.05 in our MR analysis. Therefore, we were adequately powered to detect an effect the size of that seen observationally, and the heterogeneity we see between the multivariable and MR results is unlikely to be due to chance. However, we would need a much larger number of participants to completely rule out evidence for a weaker causal effect.</p><p>Furthermore, power was limited for some of the sensitivity tests such as the evaluation of SNP heterogeneity, the MR Egger analysis, and the evaluation of heterogeneity in causal estimates between ALSPAC and Generation R. Further studies with relevant data on maternal, offspring, and paternal genotype are required to obtain more precise (and unbiased) causal estimates.</p><p>Further limitations to the MR analysis include the possibility of population stratification and canalisation [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although in ALSPAC population stratification is unlikely because the participants are unrelated individuals of European ancestry, the Generation R Study is a multiethnic cohort. However, attempts made to adjust for population stratification by including principal components and analyses restricted to those of European ancestry were similar on the whole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Developmental canalisation, in which systems develop differently to counterbalance the effects of a particular genotype, may pose a problem for conventional MR. However, this is less of an issue in intergenerational MR analysis. This is because when maternal genotype is used as an indicator of the intrauterine environment, then this will only influence the developmental environment of the offspring through the exposure of interest and not by competing mechanisms [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was self-reported in both cohorts. Although these measures of self-report have been shown to correlate strongly with measured BMI in early pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], the possibility of systematic under-reporting, for example, if those who are heavier systematically under-report their weight, might bias findings. However, previous analysis in ALSPAC has shown that misreporting is similar for the majority of participants and is not markedly influenced by mean weight [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Furthermore, the magnitude of the association of the weighted allele score with maternal BMI in this study was similar to that seen for its relationship to BMI based on measured weight and height from other studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>A general limitation of the longitudinal measures in ALSPAC is loss to follow-up of the sample over time, from 3,720 participants at age 7 to 2,521 at age 17. Nonetheless, the distribution of birth weight was similar in groups at each age. In addition, loss to follow-up bias is unlikely to influence the MR estimates, as genetic associations are unlikely to be biased by missing data [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This is supported by the fact that the allele scores used in this study were not strongly associated with a range of risk factors associated with loss to follow-up.</p><p>In this study we have looked at outcomes at each time point separately in order to explore whether magnitudes are similar at each age. It might also be valuable to examine whether maternal exposures relate to the rate of change in offspring adiposity across childhood and into adulthood using multilevel models. Methods of applying genome-wide data to such models have recently been developed [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, we are not aware of them being used in an MR IV framework, and we feel the approach we have adopted is relevant to our aim and produces results that are easy to interpret.</p><p>Our study examined the effect of linear (incremental) increases in maternal BMI with offspring outcomes. Although methods for assessing nonlinear effects using MR have been recently developed [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], these require very large sample sizes and we are not able to apply these to our data. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility of, for example, a nonlinear threshold effect of extreme maternal obesity having a causal intrauterine effect on offspring adiposity. However, we did not find any clear departures from linearity for either the multivariable regression or MR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s008">S7 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002221.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). Lastly, although the pattern of positive multivariable regression and null MR results was consistent across ages in ALSPAC, we acknowledge that it would be valuable to show further replication of our results in large independent cohorts, particularly at older ages.</p><p>Given our results, together with those from sibling comparison [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and negative control studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], it seems unlikely that subtle incremental differences in maternal pre- or early-pregnancy BMI play a key role in initiating or perpetuating the obesity epidemic [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although some negative control [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and sibling comparisons [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] suggest weak positive effects of maternal pre- or early-pregnancy BMI on offspring childhood BMI, in general, those studies are smaller than the ones finding null effects and have not explored associations into adulthood [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Our results showed no effect up to the age of 18 in females and males in the ALSPAC cohort. This finding is important given that a lack of effect in offspring entering their reproductive life course suggests that incrementally greater maternal adiposity across the population in pregnancy is unlikely to fuel the obesity epidemic across generations, although we cannot rule out an effect of more extreme phenotypes, such as extreme obesity or gestational diabetes [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, we have not been able to investigate the causal effect of gestational weight gain during pregnancy on offspring adiposity using MR, given the current absence of robust genetic instruments for this exposure [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><p>These findings suggest that overreliance on interventions in pregnancy to reduce population obesity may not be warranted and that consensus statements [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which direct public health interventions to all family members [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and at different stages of the life course, and not just intrauterine or early life [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], are likely to be important. For example, interventions aimed at the whole population (i.e., all family members at all life course stages), such as proposals for excess tax on obesogenic foods [<xref rid="pmed.1002221.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], are potentially more likely to halt the obesity epidemic than a focus on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"
