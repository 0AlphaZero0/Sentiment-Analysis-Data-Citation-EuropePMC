MRD levels on day 19 predicted treatment outcome for patients with hyperdiploid &gt;50 ALL, NCI standard-risk B-ALL or T-cell ALL, while MRD levels on day 46 were prognostic for patients with NCI standard-risk or high-risk B-ALL. Patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) or hyperdiploidy &gt;50 ALL had the best prognosis; those with a negative MRD on day 19 had a particularly low risk of relapse: 1.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Patients with NCI high-risk B-ALL or T-cell ALL had an inferior outcome; even with undetectable MRD on day 46, cumulative risk of relapse was 12.7% and 15.5%, respectively. Among patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL, the outcome was intermediate overall but was poor if MRD was &#8805;1% on day &#8805;19 or MRD was detectable at any level on day 46. Our results indicate that the clinical impact of MRD on treatment outcome in childhood ALL varies considerably according to leukemia subtype and time of measurement.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) measured during treatment reflect the overall response to chemotherapy and hence the aggregate effect of the leukemia and host factors that regulate treatment efficacy in each patient.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Thus, MRD constitutes the single most important prognostic indicator in ALL, as shown in numerous pediatric and adult studies.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that personalized treatment based on MRD can improve ALL outcome by identifying patients who can be successfully managed with low-intensity and low-toxicity regimens as well as those who require intensified treatment to avert relapse.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> For example, in the St. Jude Total Therapy Study XV, MRD-directed treatment improved outcome for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL and hypodiploid ALL, subtypes historically associated with a poor prognosis.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Likewise, in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 study, MRD-directed therapy improved outcome for patients with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">The prognostic importance and therapeutic impact of MRD in patients with specific leukemia subtypes who already received MRD-directed therapy are not completely defined.

Patients with B-ALL who were between 1 and 10 years old and had a leukocyte count &lt;50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L (NCI standard-risk), had a leukemic cell DNA index &#8805;1.16 (or hyperdiploidy&gt;50), or had the t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) without a CNS3 status or testicular leukemia were provisionally classified as having low-risk ALL.

Those with MRD &#8805;1% on day 19 of remission induction, regardless of the provisional risk group, received three additional doses of asparaginase between day 19 and 26. All patients received cyclophosphamide, mercaptopurine and cytarabine between days 26 and 39. Upon completion of remission induction (around day 46), consolidation therapy started with four courses of high-dose methotrexate (targeted steady-state concentration of 33 &#956;M for low-risk and 65 &#956;M for standard- or high-risk patients) and intrathecal therapy together with nightly mercaptopurine given over 8 weeks. Low-risk and standard- or high-risk patients then received risk-directed continuation therapy for 120 weeks for girls and 146 weeks for boys, including two reinduction treatments (reinduction I, weeks 7&#8211;9; reinduction II, weeks 17&#8211;19). High-risk patients were offered the option of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when they achieved a negative MRD status (&lt;0.01%) after subsequent treatment.

The duration of event-free survival was defined as the time from diagnosis of ALL until the date of failure (induction failure, relapse, death in remission from any cause, or the development of a second malignancy) or until the date of last contact. Patients who did not attain complete remission were considered to have treatment failure at time zero. The cumulative risk of relapse was estimated according to the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and compared with Gray&#8217;s test;<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> deaths in remission and the development of second neoplasms were considered competing events. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed by using the asymptotic normality approximation; a nonparametric method was applied if the sample size was small. In this analysis, the 10 patients with Philadelphia chromosome (<italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>)-positive ALL were not included because the patient number was too small, and most patients did not receive ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is a treatment currently regarded as standard. The MRD levels at each time point were categories into three groups: &lt;0.01%, 0.01%&#8211;1%, and &gt;1%; they were regarded as unordered in the analysis. To determine the association between individual leukemia subtypes and outcome in comparisons that identified significant differences among multiple subtypes within each MRD category, we removed the subtype with the worst outcome and performed the analysis with the remaining subtypes; this procedure was repeated until there was no longer a statistical difference at the 0.05 level. Outcome data used in the analysis was last updated on February 4, 2016. The median follow-up for patients remaining alive in continuous remission was 10.5 years (interquartile range, 1.3 to 15.3 years). At the time of analysis, 88% of the survivors had had a follow-up visit within 2 years; only 3.3% of the patients lacked a documented contact within the preceding 5 years.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S7"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Overall treatment outcome and prognostic impact of genetic subtypes</title><p id="P10">Of the 488 evaluable patients, 482 attained complete remission after induction chemotherapy.

Hence, this response-adapted therapy is increasingly becoming the favored contemporary approach to clinical management of ALL. However, the amount of leukemic cells that persist during treatment retains prognostic significance even in treatment protocols based on this strategy. We found that MRD levels measured on day 19 (which reflect the short-term response to prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin and asparaginase) and on day 46 (which reflect response to the preceding four drugs plus cyclophosphamide, cytarabine and mercaptopurine) had prognostic relevance for patients with ALL but their clinical utility varied for different patient subgroups. The MRD measurement on day 19 was particularly useful for patients with favorable presenting features as it identified candidates for treatment de-intensification, while day 46 MRD helped identifying patients at an increased risk of relapse within the NCI standard- or high-risk B-ALL, categories which include clinically and biologically heterogeneous forms of ALL.</p><p id="P15">It should be noted that while MRD levels were significantly associated with cumulative risk of any relapse, event-free survival and overall survival, they did not correlate with CNS relapse in our Total Therapy Study XV.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Total Therapy Study XV has relatively low rate of hematological relapse; while isolated and any CNS relapses accounted for 17 of 49 relapses in the study, the cumulative risk of CNS relapse (2.7%) was actually comparable to those (0.9 to 4.0%) of other contemporary clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In fact, despite total omission of prophylactic cranial irradiation, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival rates in Total Therapy Study XV were at least comparable to those of other contemporary studies.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p id="P16">Patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) and those with hyperdiploid &gt;50 clearly had the best treatment result in our response-adapted protocol, with a 10-year event-free survival of 95.8% and 91.3%, respectively. This excellent outcome is particularly notable because 187 of 216 (86.6%) of patients with either genotype were treated on the low-risk arm of our clinical trial. Those who achieved negative MRD on day 19 had a cumulative risk of relapse of only 1.9% and 3.8%, respectively, suggesting that patients with these forms of ALL and rapid response should have priority for trials testing treatment reduction strategies to improve quality of life. It should be noted that as many as 16% of patients with hyperdiploid &gt;50 ALL had MRD &#8805;1% on day 19, and they had a high risk of relapse (23.5%). It was reported that most patients with hyperdiploid &gt;50 ALL refractory to remission induction treatment can be cured with intensive chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Similarly, in our study, 6 of 8 patients with relapsed hyperdiploid&gt;50 ALL survived for 7+ to 9+ years after retrieval therapy.

Therefore, improved treatment strategies that may avoid relapse are needed for the subset of hyperdiploid &gt;50 ALL patients with day 19 MRD &#8805;1%.</p><p id="P17">In the AIEOP-BFM 2000 study, a risk classification based on MRD measurements on days 33 and 78 was also predictive of outcome among patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) or hyperdiploid &gt;50 ALL treated with MRD-guided therapy.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thus, 5-year event-free survival rates for patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) was 93.7% if they were at standard risk according to MRD and 81.7% if at intermediate risk; for patients with hyperdiploid &gt;50 patients, the rates were 93.7% and 79.8%. Although these rates were excellent, we argue that an earlier measurement performed during remission induction therapy might have identified patients treated in their protocol with an even higher probability of remaining in continuous remission. Indeed, when Basso et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> examined the value of flow cytometry measurements on day 15 in a subset of patients enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM 2000 study, they found that this additional determination could further refine prognostic classification among patients with different ALL subtypes. For example, in patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>), 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 6.3% if MRD was &lt;0.1% on day 15. Together with the results of our study, these data provide a compelling support to the use of early MRD determinations to refine risk-classification and treatment.</p><p id="P18">Excluding patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) or hyperdiploidy &gt;50, the remaining patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL had an event-free survival of 85.4% and an overall survival of 92.8%. MRD measurements were particularly useful in determining prognosis among patients classified by these criteria. Patients with MRD &#8805;1% on day 19 or any detectable MRD on day 46 had a higher risk of relapse, with poorer event-free and overall survival rates (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These patients would clearly require further treatment intensification or perhaps an entirely novel treatment approach. By contrast, patients with negative day 46 MRD had excellent event-free and overall survival rates of 94.4% and 98.1%. In line with these findings, a recent Medical Research Council UKALL study reported event-free survival of 91% and overall survival of 97% for low-risk patients with negative MRD at the end of induction treatment; as a caveat, their analysis included patients with t(12;21)/(<italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic>) or hyperdiploidy &gt;50 ALL, and some with NCI high-risk ALL.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p id="P19">At the low end of the chemosensitivity spectrum for patients with B-lineage ALL were those with NCI high-risk B-ALL, who had an inferior treatment outcome overall. MRD testing was also informative for this group: outcome was especially poor among patients with MRD &#8805;1% on day 46, who had an event-free survival of 50%, despite treatment with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Similarly, in the Children&#8217;s Oncology Group AAL0232 study, the 5-year event-free survival for patients with high-risk B-ALL was 44% if the MRD level at the end of remission induction was 1% to &lt;10%, and 26% if it was &#8805;10%.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> T-cell ALL patients also had an inferior outcome in this study and the event-free survival was only 55% in those with day 19 MRD &#8805;1%. Such low rate resembled that of the small subset of T-cell patients with MRD &#8805;1% on day 46 who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (57.1%), and that reported by the BFM-ALL 2000 investigators for their MRD high-risk group (49.8%).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Even though MRD negativity on day 46 was associated with a lower risk of relapse in patients with NCI high-risk B-ALL or T-cell ALL, we would argue that such relapse rates are still unacceptably high. Since all patients with these two leukemia subtypes had been treated with intensive chemotherapy and a relatively high proportion had received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, further increase in treatment intensity is not feasible and novel approaches should be evaluated. Whether use of the newer and more sensitive method of detecting ultra-low MRD levels<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> can identify a highly curable group of patients with NCI high-risk B-ALL or T-cell ALL remains to be determined.</p><p id="P20">An exception to the continuing prognostic value of MRD within subgroups receiving MRD-guided therapy were patients with t(1;19)/(<italic>TCF3-PBX1</italic>) ALL, all of whom received intensive chemotherapy in the standard-risk arm of Total Therapy Study XV. They had an intermediate outcome in terms of event-free survival (89.3%) because of their increased risk of isolated CNS relapse (3 among 28 patients).<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, since isolated CNS relapse is highly curable in patients who have not received prophylactic cranial irradiation,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> all patients with t(1;19)(<italic>TCF3-PBX1</italic>) were long-term survivors in this study. In our current clinical trial, we have intensified triple intrathecal therapy for these patients.</p><p id="P21">With the increasing availability of new agents for ALL, an ever more refined risk algorithm based on MRD levels and leukemia subtypes is needed to develop optimal treatment strategies. Our study demonstrates that the impact of MRD varies according to time of measurement and leukemia subtype, even in the context of contemporary response-adapted therapy. On the basis of the findings of this study and those reported in the literature,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> we would recommend that patients with favorable presenting features and undetectable MRD after two weeks remission induction therapy receive de-intensified therapy, while novel approaches should be considered for patients with high levels of MRD at the end of induction therapy. The time points of MRD determination and remission induction treatment vary among study groups. Therefore, our results should provide a useful guideline, which can be adapted by individual study groups to their most effective MRD thresholds and monitoring intervals.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S12"><p>This work was supported by grants (CA21765, CA36401, and GM115279) from the National Institutes of Health, and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN3"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold></p><p>The authors declare no competing conflict of interests.</p></fn><fn id="FN4" fn-type="con"><p><bold>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</bold></p><p>C-H.P., and D.C designed the study, reviewed and interpreted data, and wrote the paper; C-H.P., S,J., W.P.B., J.T.S., R.C.R., J.E.R., H.I., T.A.G., and W.H.L. enrolled patients, and revised the manuscript; D.P., and C.C. provided statistical expertise, analyses, and data interpretation; S.C.R. performed genetic analyses, and E.C-S. minimal residual disease determination.
