Instability of the genetic material plays a key role in the aetiology of human cancer. This study aimed to analyse genomic instability with the micronucleus cytome assay in exfoliated buccal cells depending on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and medication in 146 female DM2 patients. The occurrence of micronuclei was significantly increased in DM2 patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, it was doubled in DM2 patients with HbA1c&#8201;&gt;&#8201;7.5% compared to subjects with HbA1c&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;7.5%. Positive correlations were found between micronuclei frequencies and HbA1c as well as fasting plasma glucose. Patients under insulin treatment showed a two-fold increase in micronuclei frequencies compared to subjects under first-line medication (no drugs or monotherapy with non-insulin medication). However, after separation of HbA1c (cut-off 7.5%) only patients with severe DM2 characterised by high HbA1c and insulin treatment showed higher micronuclei frequencies but not patients with insulin treatment and low HbA1c. We demonstrated that the severity of DM2 accompanied by elevated micronuclei frequencies predict a possible enhanced cancer risk among female DM2 patients. Therapy, therefore, should focus on a strict HbA1c control and personalised medical treatments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Depending on the duration and the severity of DM2, lifestyle changes are initially advised and followed by first-line therapeutics such as metformin, combined with a second or third non-insulin medication and completed with insulin treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Considering HbA1c, the findings clearly show the strong association of genomic damage with blood glucose control in DM2 patients. Subjects with HbA1c&#8201;&gt;&#8201;7.5% showed 2-fold higher MN frequencies compared to the ones with lower HbA1c values. Additionally, a linear correlation was detected between HbA1c and scored MN, which was particularly pronounced in patients with HbA1c&#8201;&gt;&#8201;7.5%. These results are supported by two recent publications which reported higher MN frequencies compared to healthy controls and an HbA1c-dependent increase of genomic instabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition, several studies showed an increased cancer risk in diabetes patients compared to respective controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Moreover, two recent studies were able to show the association between the overall cancer risk (excluding liver and prostate cancer) and HbA1c levels within the diabetic but also the non-diabetic HbA1c range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>HbA1c levels reflect the average plasma glucose within the last eight to twelve weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and appear to be correlated to genomic damage as well as to cancer risk. Blood glucose is dependant of the severity and duration of DM2 as well as successful diabetes treatment. We therefore tested our second aim in a more in-depth statistical analysis regarding genomic instabilities and medication. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, the study population was quiet heterogeneous in their medical treatments, especially due to different combinations. Therefore, the comparison of single drug classes was not possible with our study size. We created three Med groups according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes which state that therapeutic treatment start with diet and exercise advice followed by first-line drugs (usually metformin), combined with second or third non-insulin medication and completed with insulin treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In this study patients under insulin treatment had 2-fold higher MN frequencies compared to patients under first-line medication.</p><p>To our knowledge no other study has ever analysed the link between diabetes treatment and genomic instability measured with the MN cytome assay. However, many studies dealt with the topic of cancer risk and medication of DM2 in the last decade predicting a general assumption which reflects our MN results: insulin sensitizer, such as metformin, lower cancer risk while drugs which increase insulin (endogenously or exogenously) increase cancer risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Especially exogenous insulin therapy was associated with increased all-cause mortality and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> which might be explained by its possibility to bind and activate the structurally similar insulin-like growth factor-1 leading to cell growth and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, it should be taken into account that insulin in DM2 is only prescribed when other medications fail to achieve treatment goals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Hence, a time-related bias occurs which often is not statistically considered. Indeed, a retrospective database analysis which compensated for this bias did not find any effect of different diabetes treatments on cancer incidences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>It remains unclear if the treatments themselves or the severity of hyperglycaemia, longer diabetes duration and secondary metabolic issues influences cancer incidence. We demonstrated that only the patients with severe DM2, characterized by HbA1c&#8201;&gt;&#8201;7.5% and insulin treatment had significantly higher MN frequencies compared to subjects with HbA1c&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;7.5% off all Med groups. This indicates that insulin per se does not lead to increased genomic instability but that patients, who cannot control their HbA1c properly, even with insulin injections, are in a weak genomic state. Supporting this, PCA and bi-clustering resulted in grouping according to HbA1c values rather than Med groups, suggesting that HbA1c-control is more important to stay a healthier DM2 course independently of the medication.</p><p>It should be considered, that the occurrence of MN in exfoliated buccal cells is not yet a validated cancer risk marker. However, the MN cytome assay in exfoliated buccal cells is used extensively for measuring genotoxicity. It is well documented that MN occurrence in exfoliated buccal cells is elevated in individuals who already suffer from cancer or who have increased cancer risks due to occupational and environmental exposures or due to cancer associated diseases (for review see refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Thereby a recent meta-analysis found higher MN frequencies not only in patients with oral and neck cancer (meta MR 2.4) and leukoplakia (meta MR 1.9) but also in patients with other tumors (meta MR 2.0)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This could indicate that the MN frequency reflect also genomic instabilities of other organs. Unfortunately, there is not yet data from long lasting studies addressing the direct link of elevated MN occurrence in exfoliated buccal cells and a later cancer disease. However, it was shown in comprehensive statistical analyses that MN in lymphocytes are a predictive biomarker for cancer risks in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and that the systematic comparison of MN frequencies between buccal cells and lymphocytes resulted in a clear linear correlation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Additionally, more than 90% of all human cancers are of epithelial origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> which supports the assumption that epithelial cells may be suitable indicators for the detection of elevated cancer risks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Taken all the evidence into account, there seem to be a connection between elevated MN of exfoliated buccal cells and an enhanced cancer risk.</p><p>This explorative study in female DM2 patients found a clear association of HbA1c with genomic instabilities; however, the influence of medication stays questionable. The rather small med groups with only female DM2 patients should be considered critically and we therefore suggest more studies with larger number of patients and further grouping regarding single drug classes and their combinations to assess the influence of DM2 treatment on genomic instabilities and cancer risk. Overall, our results indicate the need for a strict glucose control in DM2 to maintain genome stability and thereby reducing cancer risk. Therefore, regular health checks, early diagnoses, personalized drug prescriptions and increased life-style changes should gain more importance to achieve HbA1c goals.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cross-sectional human study</title><p>The cross-sectional human study was performed as a cooperation between the large Diabetes Outpatient Clinic in Vienna and the Department of Nutritional Sciences of the University of Vienna in 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.

Principle component analysis (PCA) and bi-clustering analysis were performed with COVAIN toolbox for matlab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. To perform bi-clustering the average linkage of Euclidean distance between groups as the metric was used. Therefore, 29 different parameters regarding anthropometrics, lipid metabolism, vitamins and genomic instability were used.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Grindel, A. <italic>et al</italic>.
