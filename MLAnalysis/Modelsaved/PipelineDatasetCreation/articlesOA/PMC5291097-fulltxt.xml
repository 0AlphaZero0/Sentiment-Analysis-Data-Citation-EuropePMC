We previously reported that EpCAM serves as a potent stem cell marker which is highly and selectively expressed by undifferentiated rather than differentiated hESC. However, the functional role of EpCAM remains elusive. Here, we found that EpEX and EpCAM enhance the efficiency of OSKM reprogramming. Interestingly, Oct4 or Klf4 alone, but not Sox2, can successfully reprogram fibroblasts into iPSCs with EpEX and EpCAM. Moreover, EpEX and EpCAM trigger reprogramming via activation of STAT3, which leads to the nuclear-translocation of HIF2&#945;. This study reveals the importance of a novel EpEX/EpCAM-STAT3-HIF2&#945; signal in the reprogramming process, and uncovers a new means of triggering reprogramming by delivery of soluble and transmembrane proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are able to generate all three germ layers and differentiate into all cell types of the body, except placenta<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, the application of ESCs in regenerative medicine was hampered due to immune-rejection and oncogenicity. Fortunately, the prospects for regenerative research were advanced by the groundbreaking discovery that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be established from somatic cells, such as fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The use of iPSC technology circumvents the immune-rejection problem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

All Yamanaka factors are transcription factors, and the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying their effects are still not fully understood. Many attempts have been made to derive iPSCs from different species and different somatic cell types by delivering the four Yamanaka factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>A growing body of research is devoted to identifying more convenient and efficient reprogramming strategies. Certain reports have indicated that iPSCs can be generated by less than four Yamanaka factors, but the cells being reprogrammed need to express some of the Yamanaka factors endogenously. For example, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) already express high levels of Klf4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and thus application of Oct4 and Sox2 is sufficient to reprogram HUVECs and HSCs into iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Similarly, human neural stem cells (NSCs) or dermal papilla cells with high endogenous expression levels of Sox2 and c-Myc can be reprogrammed into iPSCs with Oct4 and Klf4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Since NSCs also express Sox2 protein, Oct4 is sufficient to reprogram NSCs into iPSCs with low efficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. All of these studies with one or two Yamanaka factors require cells that express high endogenous levels of one or two reprogramming factors (Hester <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>; Kim <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>; Ho <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; Tsai <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In fibroblast, a study has successfully reprogrammed mouse and human fibroblasts with Oct4 and Sox2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and the reprogramming efficiency of iPSCs has greatly improved by certain defined small-molecule scompounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In addition, mouse fibroblast can form iPSCs with Oct4 and small-molecule compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, few soluble protein factors and membrane proteins have been reported to promote iPSC formation. Therefore, there is increasing interest in identifying novel reprogramming factors that are not transcription factors or chromatin modifiers.</p><p>Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a 34~40-kDa type I transmembrane protein, which is a well-known tumor-associated antigen expressed abundantly in various types of carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. EpCAM consists of three distinct domains; an extracellular region (EpEX), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (EpICD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We previously demonstrated that EpCAM is not only enriched in ESCs, where it regulates the four Yamanaka factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, but it also plays an important role in regulating cancer-initiating abilities, self-renewal, and invasiveness in colon cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that overexpression of EpCAM or EpICD decreased the expression of p53 and p21, and activated the promoter activity of Oct4 in reprogramming MEFs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, it is unknown whether EpEX can increase the efficiency of iPSC formation and whether EpCAM/EpEX can replace one or more Yamanaka factors. The functional roles of EpEX in stem cells and reprogramming processes, as well as the downstream signal(s) and receptor(s) of EpEX, remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that EpEX and EpCAM are sufficient to reprogram fibroblasts into iPSCs with only Oct4 or Klf4. Moreover, we describe a new way of triggering reprogramming with a soluble factor and transmembrane protein, and elucidate the underlying mechanism through which EpEX increases the expressions of pluripotency genes by regulating the STAT3-HIF2&#945; signals.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>EpCAM/EpEX enhance reprogramming efficiency in OSKM-mediated iPSCs</title><p>We examined if EpEX and EpCAM can increase reprogramming efficiency during OSKM-mediated iPSC formation.

Western blotting revealed that EpEX significantly activates STAT3 (tyrosine 705) phosphorylation, with modest effects on phospho-STAT2, STAT5, and STAT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p>The dose- and time-dependent effects of EpEX on STAT3 activation were examined by Western blotting. STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) was significantly induced by EpEX within 5&#8201;minutes and gradually decreased after 4&#8201;hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). The optimal dose of EpEX for STAT3 activation is 0.5&#8211;5&#8201;&#956;g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Since LIF is known to maintain pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal via STAT3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we also tested the effects of EpEX and/or LIF on STAT3 phosphorylation in MEFs. In the absence of LIF, EpEX can activate STAT3 phosphorylation to a level comparable to that of LIF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Co-incubation of EpEX and LIF significantly boosted STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating that EpEX can induce STAT3 phosphorylation in the absence of LIF, and these signals may differ from the LIF/LIF receptor signaling; therefore, EpEX and LIF have a significant synergistic effect on STAT3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Moreover, we found the level of total STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 were increased in OE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX, KE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX, and OSKM reprogramming on days 3, 6, and 9, as compared to non-treated MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G,H</xref>). Each group was maintained in iPSC medium without LIF. Thus, we demonstrated that EpEX or EpEX/EpCAM may promote reprogramming through STAT3 signaling. Following up on the finding that EpEX-induced STAT3 signaling and EpCAM/EpEX can help initiate reprogramming, we proceeded to examine whether EpCAM is critical for iPSC maintenance by knocking down EpCAM expression with two EpCAM shRNA clones in iPSCs. EpCAM depletion decreases Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, and phosphorylated STAT3, but not total STAT3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>). Thus, EpCAM is critical for maintaining the levels of pluripotent factors as well as STAT3 signaling. Moreover, WP1066, a STAT3 inhibitor, significantly suppressed expression of Oct4, Klf4, and Nanog, indicating that STAT3 is critical for pluripotency maintenance in iPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2B</xref>). Taken together, EpEX promotes STAT3 activation in MEFs, and EpCAM promotes pluripotent gene expression via STAT3 activation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>EpEX activates HIF2&#945; via STAT3 during iPSC formation</title><p>HIF2&#945; (hypoxia inducible factor 2&#945;) supports Oct4 in mouse ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and enhances stemness by binding to Nanog promoter in human ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. IL6-STAT3-HIF2&#945; signaling contributes to angiogenesis in ovarian cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. HIF2&#945; has been found to enhance the levels of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog to maintain pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, EpCAM expression is required for HIF2&#945; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that HIF2&#945; may participate in EpEX-STAT3-mediated reprogramming. We have shown that EpEX induced nuclear translocation of HIF2&#945; in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B,C</xref>) and that WP1066 (STAT3 inhibitor) abolished the EpEX-induced HIF2&#945; nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). We have confirmed that the underlying mechanism of WP1066 is through the detection of the inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results suggested that EpEX-induced HIF2&#945; nuclear translocation is regulated by STAT3. Furthermore, iPSCs did not form when OSKM, OE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX, or KE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX groups were treated with WP1066 or HIF2&#945; shRNA (two clones, #1 and #2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p><p>Thus, STAT3 and HIF2&#945; are crucial for both pluripotency regulation and maintenance in iPSCs.

We are first to show that fibroblasts can be reprogrammed by a single Yamanaka factor (either Oct4 or Klf4) in combination with EpEX and EpCAM. This suggests that EpEX and EpCAM can replace the function of Sox2 and Oct4/Klf4 in reprogramming.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that elevation of EpCAM expression enhances tumor sphere formation and tumor initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In 2009, Maetzel <italic>et al</italic>. proposed the novel concept that activation of the EpCAM surface-to-nucleus signaling transduction pathway in cancer occurs through regulated intracellular proteolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the extracellular domain of EpCAM is cleaved by activated ADAM17 (TACE) to release soluble EpEX. Subsequently, EpICD is cut by &#947;-secretase. The increased release of EpEX enhances the production of EpICD and regulates the expression of reprogramming factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. EpICD associates with &#946;-catenin and cofactor FHL2 (four and a half LIM domain protein 2) to form a transcriptome complex that translocate into the nucleus to modulate the transcriptional activity of target genes, such as c-Myc and promote tumor progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>EpEX was recently identified as the secreted extracellular part of the transmembrane protein, EpCAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We previously showed that EpCAM is enriched in human ESCs and that EpICD binds to Yamanaka factor promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Moreover, EpCAM overexpression promotes iPSC formation via inhibition of p53 and p21<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The function and signals of EpEX has never been reported in reprogramming or ESC renewal. We found that iPSCs can be formed by using EpCAM and EpEX, combined with one Yamanaka factor, Oct4 or Klf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>) and that EpEX increases the efficiency of iPSC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This prompts us to suggest that EpEX and EpCAM may activate signaling to initiate reprogramming. Since iPSCs were not formed in the SE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX group but did form in the OE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX and KE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX groups, we propose that EpEX/EpCAM cannot replace the functions of both Oct4 and Klf4, but can substitute for Sox2, or help increase Sox2 levels during reprogramming. Previously, it was reported that the STAT3 signal up-regulates Sox2 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, thus we hypothesize that EpEX/EpCAM may up-regulate Sox2 by activating STAT3.</p><p>It has been shown that a small molecule inhibitor with several defined factors can replace Oct4 and Sox2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. E-cadherin induces reprogramming with three Yamanaka factors (Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc), without Oct4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. However, unlike EpCAM/EpEX, none of these signals can concurrently replace both Oct4 and Sox2, and reprogram fibroblasts with Klf4 alone. EpICD binds to Yamanaka factor promoters in human ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, while EpEX triggers the production of EpICD as well as regulates the expression of reprogramming factors in colon cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>; therefore, endogenous reprogramming factors may be up-regulated in OE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX and KE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX iPSCs. Soluble EpEX enhances the cleavage of EpEX and induces EpICD signaling in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and promotes tumor initiation and progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Moreover, we showed that the activity of TACE in iPSCs and mouse ESCs is highly induced compared to that of MEF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>). Interestingly, we detected the activity of TACE in OSKM, OE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX, KE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX, OE&#8201;+&#8201;TACE, and KE&#8201;+&#8201;TACE groups, and found the effects of adding TACE to be similar to that of EpEX treatment during early induction of reprogramming on day 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4B</xref>). EpEX induces the phosphorylation and activation of TACE in MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4C,D</xref>). In addition, we investigated whether treatment of MEFs with TACE can result in the shedding of EpEX and may have a similar effect for reprogramming. We transfected EpCAM with Oct4 or Klf4, and treated with TACE (5&#8201;ng/mL). Results showed that iPSCs did not form in OE&#8201;+&#8201;TACE, and KE&#8201;+&#8201;TACE groups on day 20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Such result indicated that the treatment of TACE may lead to EpEX shedding. Such level of EpEX, however, is likely not sufficient for the triggering of reprogramming signals.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that EpEX induces STAT3 phosphorylation in MEFs, suggesting that EpEX may serve as a cytokine. Thus, we suppose that EpEX can activate receptors and may initiate reprogramming through the downstream signal transduction. We showed that EpEX can induce the phosphorylation of EGFR, PDGFR, HER2, and Axl by phospho-kinase array (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5A,B</xref>). Recent study demonstrated that EGFR and PDGFR play important roles in reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, which is consistent with our previous results and may explain the efficacy of treatment of EpEX. In addition, we considered the concentration of EpEX, which we optimized in iPSC usage, to be much higher than that of the shedding of EpEX. Therefore, treatment of EpEX may enhance these signaling and drive the initiation of iPSC generation. Moreover, we supposed that since MEF does not expresses EpCAM endogenously, the efficacy of TACE treatment may not have influence on triggering the initiation processes in the beginning of reprogramming, while EpEX treatment may exert potent impact on the initiation of reprogramming through triggering and enhancing these signaling.</p><p>Alternatively, we confirmed the importance of EpICD during early induction of reprogramming and delivered EpICD-truncated EpCAM and Oct4 or Klf4 and alone with the treatment of EpEX in MEFs. The construction of EpICD-truncated EpCAM is confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). We did not observe the iPSC formation in the group of EpICD-truncated EpCAM with Oct4 or klf4 with EpEX treatment on Day 20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), which indicated the necessity of EpICD.</p><p>A few types of factors were identified to be able to substitute for Oct4 during reprogramming, such as GATA3, GATA6 and SOX7 (lineage specifiers of mesendoderm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> or substitute for Sox2, ZNF521 (ectoderm specifier)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Additionally, maternal transcription factor Glis1 and Nr5a2 can replace Oct4 for reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. E-cadherin has also been reported to induces reprogramming with three of the Yamanaka factors (Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc), without the need for Oct4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Interestingly, E-cadherin and other cell-adhesion molecules also have functional roles in the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, which is crucial for iPSC reprogramming. However, with the exception of EpCAM and EpEX, none of these can concurrently replace Oct4 and Sox2 signals and reprogram fibroblast with only Klf4. We also proposed that EpCAM/EpEX is not sufficient to replace both Oct4 and Klf4 and that it may act as an ectoderm driver due to the failure of iPSC formation in SE&#8201;+&#8201;EpEX group. Another hypothesis is that EpEX and EpCAM promote iPSC formation through other routes. For example, EpCAM is expressed in epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, it will be interesting to determine if EpCAM and EpEX promote MET to facilitate iPSC formation. Here, we describe a novel pathway: EpEX/EpCAM/STAT3/HIF2&#945; signaling. STAT3 signaling is critical for mouse ESCs and na&#239;ve pluripotent stem cells, and is activated by LIF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; EpEX induces STAT3 phosphorylation in MEF in the absence of LIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C&#8211;E</xref>). The addition of both EpEX and LIF synergistically increase phospho-STAT3, as compared to cells treated with only EpEX or LIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Total and phosphorylated STAT3 were up-regulated during early induction of reprogramming by EpEX in the absence of LIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G,H</xref>).</p><p>HIF2&#945; also mediates pluripotency by forming a complex with Oct4 and by enhancing its activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Therefore, EpEX may induce the nuclear-translocation of HIF2&#945; and promote the expressions of target genes. Interestingly, nuclear HIF2&#945; expression requires EpEX and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A&#8211;D</xref>). HIF2&#945; interacts with a glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), to promote Oct4 transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. PKM2 overexpression enhances Oct4 levels and supports self-renewal in the absence of LIF in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Thus, EpEX may also activate PKM2/HIF2&#945;, whereby up-regulating Oct4. Additionally, EpICD is critical for pluripotency and self-renewal in human ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We will determine whether EpEX promotes EpICD signaling and whether EpICD associates with HIF2&#945; and STAT3 to form a transcription interactome to promote reprogramming.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that EpCAM/EpEX activates the STAT3-HIF2&#945; complex in iPSC reprogramming. EpEX is particularly advantageous in iPSC generation since it reduces the risk of insertional mutagenesis. Such findings provide a new strategy for iPSC formation and may contribute to future regenerative medicine techniques.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Feeder cell isolation</title><p>For MEF isolation, we isolated uteri from mice on day 13.5 of pregnancy.
