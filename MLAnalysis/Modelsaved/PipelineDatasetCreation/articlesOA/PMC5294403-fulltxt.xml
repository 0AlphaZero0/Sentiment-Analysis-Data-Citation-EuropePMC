As the nutrient storage organ, the leafy head is composed of incurved, yellowish leaves, with good taste and abundant nutrients, including multiple types of dietary fiber and vitamins, all of which are important parameters of leafy head quality. Poor heading of leaves can often cause a considerable yield reduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The economic benefits of a leafy head depend on many factors, such as temperature, light intensity, auxin concentration, and the carbohydrate-to-nitrogen ratio. Among these factors, auxin is the most important, and an uneven distribution of auxin concentration in Chinese cabbage can modify the characteristics of head formation. However, the molecular mechanism and genetic basis of leafy head development remain poorly understood.</p><p>It is commonly accepted that auxin is necessary for the growth and development of plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and is the only plant hormone with the feature of polar transport, which can determine the plant morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

Specifically, two PATIs were used to confirm the response patterns of candidate genes in leafy head formation and leaf folding. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that some of the PAT-related genes in these three families contributed to the uneven auxin distribution in outer heading leaves (HLs). Moreover, UPLC was used to identify IAA content in HLs with and without PATI treatments, further demonstrating that head formation requires distinct auxin distribution patterns in different segments. These results provide a foundation for further studies on leafy head formation and PAT in Chinese cabbage. This work offers evidence for the regulation of leafy head formation by auxin genes and may assist with progress in the gene-engineered breeding of high-yield and high-quality crops.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic></title><p>Previous reports have identified 4 <italic>AtAUX</italic>/<italic>LAX</italic>, 8 <italic>AtPIN</italic> and 22 <italic>AtPGP</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

To identify the three gene families&#8217; specific functions in auxin transport, HLs were divided into five parts (Apical, Lateral 1, Lateral 2, Lateral 3, and Basal) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>).

We sprayed NPA and TIBA solutions at the level of 7th rosette leaf for 30 days. Surprisingly, the plants in the open field could form tight heads, while those under the NPA or TIBA treatment failed to form any obvious head, which we hypothesized may have been because PATIs regulated some genes at the expression level. The results showed that most <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN, BrPGP</italic> genes were down-regulated or showed no significant change under the inhibitor treatment. For example, most <italic>BrLAX</italic> genes (<italic>BrLAX1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10</italic>) were down-regulated by PATIs, while <italic>BrLAX3</italic> was up-regulated in Apical and Lateral 1, and <italic>BrLAX4</italic> was slightly up-regulated in Lateral 1, Lateral 3 and Basal by TIBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). The expression of the <italic>BrPIN</italic> genes (<italic>BrPIN3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11</italic>) was down-regulated by the NPA treatment. The samples treated with TIBA presented segment-specific responses; <italic>BrPINs</italic> were down-regulated in Apical, Lateral 2, Lateral 3, and Basal, whereas they were up-regulated or did not exhibit significant changes in Lateral 1. The <italic>BrPGP</italic> genes presented a similar response to the two PATIs; most exhibited down-regulation, except for <italic>BrPGP10, 15, 20, 24, 26</italic>, which were highly up-regulated under the two PATI treatments. Interestingly, <italic>BrPGP5</italic> was down-regulated by the NPA treatment but up-regulated by the TIBA treatment. Taken together, nearly all genes were down-regulated by the NPA treatment, although some genes showed tissue-specific expression.

Here, we present the hormone profile of Chinese cabbage HLs and their responses to the two PATIs in different segments of HLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref>). The IAA level of HLs differed significantly among the five regions; the maximum IAA content in these samples was in Lateral 1, followed by Apical, Lateral 3, Basal, and finally Lateral 2. In a previous report, TIBA and NPA were suggested to be involved in PAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Treatments with TIBA or NPA caused a similar endogenous distribution of IAA. The IAA contents in Lateral 1 and Basal were significantly lower than in the controls, perhaps due to the inhibitory effects of the PATIs. IAA rapidly accumulated in apical tissue but did not exhibit an upward curve, which might have been inhibited by the high IAA concentration. All the above findings demonstrate that PATIs can block PAT, leading to the formation of an abnormal head. The uneven distribution of auxin in the leafy head is required for formation of the leafy head.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chinese cabbage is a popular and economically important vegetable.

The leafy head possesses leaves that are extremely incurved in the transverse and longitudinal axes, which we hypothesize might be correlated with the auxin uneven distribution. Auxins are phytohormones that regulate many developmental processes to adapt to the environment and to crop domestication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. IAA is the most abundant auxin in plants, and its concentration gradient is also an important auxin flow in plant development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. As an ancient signaling molecule, IAA promotes plant growth and development. Different IAA concentration gradients can lead to morphotype diversification. In this study, we detected the IAA contents of different segments of head and non-head leaves with PATI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The influx and efflux carriers of IAA regulated PAT to generate different hormone gradients, which were involved in cellular IAA transport events. Along the vertical axis of the leafy head, IAA biosynthesis in the apical region partly leads to abundance in this area, while auxin transport-associated genes respond to the auxin gradient. IAA is transported downward, and enrichment in the medial part results in a relatively high IAA content, which may lead to the vigorous outgrowth of plants&#8217; medial tissue and to leafy head formation. Meanwhile, some auxin response genes respond to the auxin gradient and transport IAA from medial to basal, making the whole leaf erect. Along the horizontal axis, <italic>BrPGP</italic>s regulated the auxin distribution by transporting auxin from Lateral 1 to the margin region, which led the head leaf to bend inward. The properties of Chinese cabbage leaf folding and the incurving process appear to be physiological responses to auxin.</p><p>Head formation is an essential morphological index in Chinese cabbage. The expression levels of the <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic> genes in HLs were lower than those in RLs, possibly indicating that the auxins were not transferred in this stage but were transferred mainly for leaf development. RLs oriented the folding inward, as a morphological marker of leaf folding. After the rosette stage, the control plants produced a normal morphology, while those with the PATI treatment did not. The responses of PAT-associated genes were then evaluated in leafy heads. The routes of PAT could be attributed to gene function in PAT. Auxin biosynthesis in the apical meristem appeared to produce a higher concentration of auxin in the Apical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Subsequently, auxin response genes conduct a dynamic distribution of auxin and the subsequent responses to leaf-folding signals. PAT genes came to play a role in transferring auxin to other segments needed for head folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). In the folding stage, while numerous auxins were actively transported downward along the vertical and transverse axes via PAT response factors. These results confirmed that the uneven distribution of auxin and site-specific high IAA content are indispensable in head formation.</p><p>PATI-mediated blockade of the expression of PAT-related genes was observed to potentially influence Chinese cabbage head formation. We performed PATI (NPA and TIBA) treatment to identify where and how PATIs affect PAT-regulated genes in Chinese cabbage head leaves. Many genes were down-regulated by PATIs, and some genes showed specific expression under TIBA treatment. These data indicate that the transcription of PAT genes can be blocked by PATIs, thus preventing the auxin uneven distribution required in the whole head leaves. The results were consistent with our prediction; in HLs, we found that IAA accumulated in the Apical, Lateral 1 and Basal regions, to assist with the apical closing, central excess growth, and basal straightening in HLs, while plants under PATI treatment presented abnormal morphology.</p><p>We predicted the roles and molecular mechanisms of <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic> genes in the process of leafy head formation in Chinese cabbage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Auxin was generated in meristematic tissue regions at the shoot apex and showed an uneven distribution in leaves. For HLs, the Gaussian curvature theory of Nath <italic>et al</italic>. explains that Lateral 1 region of the HLs grows more quickly than the margin regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and the leaf curvature induced the leafy head formation, which we predicted was caused by uneven auxin distribution in leaves. The directions and sizes of arrows represent the auxin diffusion flux and relative quantity. In a previous report, <italic>AUX</italic>/<italic>LAX</italic> was the importer of auxin into plant cells, while <italic>PIN</italic> was the exporter and <italic>PGP</italic> was a facultative transporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Uneven auxin distribution is produced via the following two pathways: passive diffusion and active transport through PAT-related proteins. In our study, we investigated the potential biological functions of <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic> genes in the leafy heads of Chinese cabbage. Along the longitudinal axis of the Chinese cabbage leafy head, auxin plays different roles in different regions, such as apical closing, central excess growth, and basal straightening. We deduced that the auxin was transported from its site of synthesis to the basal region by PAT-related genes. In control plants, auxin influx gradually increased from the Apical region to the Basal region, which might be mediated by <italic>BrLAXs</italic> (<italic>BrLAX1, 2, 5, 6, 7</italic>) and some <italic>BrPINs</italic> (<italic>BrPIN1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</italic>). Thus, auxin was transported from the apical region to central region and then to the basal region. For apical-to-central transport, auxin importer factors, <italic>BrLAXs</italic>, generate influx and accumulation of auxin in the central part, maintaining the excess growth of the leafy head, and some of the auxin was then exported to the basal region by <italic>BrPINs</italic> (<italic>BrPIN1, 3, 6, 7, 8</italic>). Meanwhile, some <italic>BrPINs</italic> (<italic>BrPIN5, 6, 8, 9</italic>) were employed to export auxin in the basal region to straighten the entire leaf. Along the transverse axis, <italic>BrPGPs</italic> (<italic>BrPGP2, 5, 8, 16, 19, 22, 23</italic>) play a crucial role in cell-to-cell PAT in order to maintain the growth of lateral regions.</p><p>Approximately 13&#8211;17 million years ago, the <italic>Brassica</italic> genome underwent a whole-genome triplication (WET) event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The following three <italic>Brassica</italic> subgenomes have been demonstrated: the dominantly least fractionated (LF) subgenome and the remaining two more-fractionated subgenomes (MF1 and MF2). The &#8216;Triangle of U&#8217; model was established to encompass three diploid species, <italic>B. rapa</italic> (A genome), <italic>B. Nigra</italic> (B genome), and <italic>B. Oleracea</italic> (C genome), and three amphidiploid species, <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AB genomes), <italic>B. napus</italic> (AC genomes) and <italic>B. carinata</italic> (BC genomes), by pairwise hybridization. In previous studies, three gene families, including <italic>AUX</italic>/<italic>LAX, PIN</italic>, and <italic>PGP</italic>, were identified as related to auxin polar transport and functions in various biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships of these auxin transport proteins in different species and constructed a phylogenetic tree of <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Cheng <italic>et al</italic>. reported that Chinese cabbage (<italic>B. rapa</italic>) and cabbage (<italic>B. oleracea</italic>) possess similar leaf heading, which might be attributable to various processes, such as auxin-mediated signaling. Auxin-mediated signaling pathways were hypothesized to regulate leaf adaxial-abaxial patterning in leaf-heading morphotypes of both <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>B. oleracea</italic>. Several essential genes in leafy head formation (<italic>BRX</italic>s, <italic>ARF</italic>s, <italic>KAN</italic>s and <italic>AXR</italic>s) were identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and they have been shown to interact with PATs to create auxin gradients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The temporal differences in expression of PINs involved in the Aux/IAA-ARF (indole-3-acetic acid-auxin response factor) signaling pathway result in the auxin-mediated regulation of PAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In this study, we found that most of the auxin genes were expressed in multiple leaf segments, suggesting that they might have different functions in Chinese cabbage development. Thus, auxin, the main phytohormone, induced a series of complicated biochemical mechanisms of leafy head formation that could elucidate the relationship between PAT genes and the establishment of morphogenesis, which might lead to better understanding of leafy head formation and organogenesis in other species. Here, we hypothesize that the similar leafy head phenotypes in Chinese cabbage and cabbage might be due to the same form of uneven auxin distribution, which requires further study.</p><p>In summary, we first propose a model of auxin polar transport in Chinese cabbage head leaves and reveal the auxin flow or accumulation in the whole head leaf and the uneven auxin distribution associated with leafy head formation in Chinese cabbage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). We hypothesize that some genes of the <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic> families play essential roles in the uneven auxin distribution. We show the auxin biosynthesis in meristematic tissue regions at the shoot apex and the downward auxin flow to modify the lateral outgrowth. At the cell level, the <italic>BrLAX</italic> auxin influx factors mainly regulated the auxin response and the subsequent downward polar auxin transport. <italic>BrPIN</italic>s participate in the auxin transport out of cells, and auxin accumulates in medial regions to ensure their outgrowth. <italic>BrPGP</italic>s are auxin response factors focused on PAT during development along the transverse axis, producing an inward bend to head leaves. Those results also indicated that the <italic>BrLAX, BrPIN</italic> and <italic>BrPGP</italic> genes may be involved in the PAT during leafy head development, which merits further functional exploration in the future.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant Materials and Treatment of the Foliage with Chemicals</title><p>Seeds of the inbred line &#8216;chiifu-401-42&#8217; were employed and germinated on moisture-absorbent papers, grown at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 3 d and then transplanted to a climate-controlled chamber with 16&#8201;h light/18 dark cycles.
