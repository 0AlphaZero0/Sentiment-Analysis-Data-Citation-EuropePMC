To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance, we performed a systematic analysis of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in three clinically-relevant tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines (TamRs) compared to their parental tamoxifen-sensitive cell line. Alterations in the expression of 131 miRNAs in tamoxifen-resistant vs. parental cell lines were identified, 22 of which were common to all TamRs using both sequencing and LNA-based quantitative PCR technologies. Although the target genes affected by the altered miRNA in the three TamRs differed, good agreement in terms of affected molecular pathways was observed. Moreover, we found evidence of miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>ESR1, PGR1, FOXM1</italic> and <italic>14-3-3</italic> family genes. Integrating the inferred miRNA-target relationships, we investigated the functional importance of 2 central genes, SNAI2 and FYN, which showed increased expression in TamR cells, while their corresponding regulatory miRNA were downregulated. Using specific chemical inhibitors and siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, we showed that both SNAI2 and FYN significantly affect the growth of TamR cell lines. Finally, we show that a combination of 2 miRNAs (miR-190b and miR-516a-5p) exhibiting altered expression in TamR cell lines were predictive of treatment outcome in a cohort of ER+ breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen mono-therapy. Our results provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance and may form the basis for future medical intervention for the large number of women with tamoxifen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>miRNAs</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>miRNA-mediated gene regulation</kwd><kwd>endocrine resistance</kwd><kwd>antihormonal therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tamoxifen is a widely used therapy for estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+) breast cancer, and has been shown to be highly effective in the adjuvant setting, with 28% reduction in mortality at 15 years of follow-up [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to the adjuvant setting, anti-estrogen treatment with tamoxifen is also effective in the metastatic setting and, although not curative, extends survival. Tamoxifen is the recommended treatment modality for premenopausal breast cancer patients and for postmenopausal patients with contraindications for treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs). In addition, the side-effects of anti-estrogenic drugs differ and some patients may not be eligible for a given drug due to co-morbidities [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is, therefore, rational to maintain tamoxifen as an adjuvant treatment option for postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer patients, although AIs have been shown to be superior in this group of patients [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although tamoxifen greatly benefits many patients, recurrence occurs in almost all patients with advanced disease and approximately 30% of ER+ patients at 15-years of follow-up despite adequate treatment [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Metabolites of tamoxifen, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, bind to the estrogen receptor (ER), competing with estrogens and thereby inhibiting transcription of estrogen-responsive genes [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Previous studies have shown a loss or decreased expression of ER in ER+ breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Altered ER expression might be linked to genetic and epigenetic changes, such as hypermethylation of CpG islands in 5<sup>&#8217;</sup> regulatory regions of ER, or there may be other genetic events that affect ER expression [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, mutations localized in the ligand-binding domain of the ER gene (<italic>ESR1</italic>) have been identified in metastatic lesions of patients treated with tamoxifen [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Various studies have shown the impact of altered expression of ER-beta, co-activators and co-repressors of ER, IGF1, IGF1R, IGFBP3 and various other growth factors and receptors on tamoxifen resistance [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Aberrant activation of alternative pathways of cellular proliferation may also contribute to tamoxifen-resistant tumor growth. Among the major players regulating molecular pathways are short, 21 nucleotide long, non-coding genes called miRNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In mammals, more than 60% of protein-coding genes undergo post-transcriptional regulation in the form of degradation or translation inhibition through miRNAs [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to their potential to regulate mRNAs through tumor-suppressing or -inducing capacities, miRNAs have recently been investigated to determine their contributions to cancer development and progression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Gene regulation by miRNAs often leads to activation or dysregulation of various pathways responsible for the development of drug resistance. For example, the miR-221/222 cluster miRNAs regulate levels of ER and could thereby play a critical role in tamoxifen resistance and in ER+ cancers in general [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that miR-22 negatively regulates ER expression [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Apart from ER, restoration of TIMP3 expression via suppression of its regulatory miRNA (miR-222, miR-181b) has been shown to restore tamoxifen sensitivity in a mouse tamoxifen-resistant xenograft model [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, a majority of previous studies have focused on a limited number of miRNAs and have lacked a system-wide view of miRNA-mediated tamoxifen resistance.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated miRNA-mediated gene regulation associated with tamoxifen resistance by analyzing a clinically-relevant, isogenic, human breast cancer MCF-7-based tamoxifen-resistant cell line model using small-RNAseq, global LNA-based miRNA quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and microarray profiling. Since it is known that miRNA target predictions often suffer a high number of false-positives, we performed integrative inverse-correlation analysis of miRNAs and mRNA expression profiles to distinguish likely functional miRNA-target relationships from spurious computational target predictions. The results provide interesting insights into affected biological processes in tamoxifen resistance. By integrating various lines of evidence related to miRNA-gene regulation, we posit a novel functional miRNA-gene relationship, and a subsequent clinical validation confirmed that some of the miRNA alterations observed in our TamR cell line model correlated with disease outcome in clinical primary tumor samples of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen mono-therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Tamoxifen resistance-associated miRNA alterations in the tamoxifen-resistant cell line model</title><p>miRNA expression profiles of three tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines (TamR1, TamR4 and TamR8) and the parental tamoxifen-sensitive cell line (MCF-7/S0.5) were analyzed by LNA-based qPCR in biological triplicates.

In TamR4, miRNAs exhibiting altered expression seemed to regulate mRNAs associated with signaling by Aurora kinases (FDR &lt; 0.05), FOXM1 transcription factor network (FDR &lt; 0.05), and cell cycle M Phase and G2/M transition (FDR &lt; 0.05), glypican pathway, FOXA transcription factor network, PDGFR-beta signaling, Kit receptor, axon guidance and PDGF signaling pathway. Finally, miRNAs exhibiting altered expression in TamR8 were found to regulate mRNAs involved in the IFN-gamma pathway, Jak-STAT signaling, plasma membrane ER signaling and neurotrophin signaling pathways, although the analysis of TamR8 did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>We also examined whether these minimally overlapping sets of differentially-expressed functional targets shared any common mechanisms of drug resistance resulting from effects on any specific pathways. miRNA-regulated mRNAs in TamR1 and TamR4 cell lines showed a strong enrichment (FDR&lt; 0.05) of the glypican and IGF1 pathways, PDGFR-beta signaling, IFN-gamma pathway, plasma membrane ER signaling, TGF-beta signaling, nuclear and cytoplasmic SMAD2/3, BMP signaling and class I PI3K signaling events.

Although siRNA transfection resulted in over 80% knockdown of FoxM1 transcript in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, top panel), no significant alteration of miR-135a expression was observed, suggesting that reduction of the <italic>FOXM1</italic> level in TamR4 alone was not sufficient to alter the miR-135a level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, lower panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2_6"><title>Loss of miRNA regulation for YWHAG and YWHAZ</title><p>Our inverse correlation analysis also identified the two 14-3-3 family members YWHAZ and YWHAG upregulated in TamR8 vs. MCF-7/S0.5, but not in TamR1 and TamR4.

To investigate whether the reduced expression of miR-593/increased expression of SNAI2 had functional significance for tamoxifen resistance, we evaluated the growth of TamR and MCF7/S0.5 cells in the presence or absence of tamoxifen when the SNAIL-P53 binding inhibitor GN25 was added. The results showed that GN25 alone has a moderate effect on TamR cells but, when combined with tamoxifen, dramatically reduces growth, suggesting that inhibition of SNAI2 activity renders TamR cells highly susceptible to tamoxifen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we evaluated whether the reduced expression of miR-342-3p/5p and miR-33b/increased expression of FYN had functional significance for tamoxifen resistance by evaluating the growth of TamR and MCF7/S0.5 cells in the presence or absence of tamoxifen when the cells were treated with SRC family kinase inhibitor PP2. The results showed that, treatment of TamR cells with PP2 resulted in significant growth inhibition of TamR cells, but no marked effect on the parental cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Interestingly, similar to our observation with SNAI2 inhibitor, PP2 markedly enhanced tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in cells otherwise resistant to tamoxifen. Moreover, to evaluate whether the 2 genes promote tamoxifen resistance independently or in combination, we treated TamR cells with the combination of PP2 and GN25 and found that the combination resulted in much more potent inhibition than the 2 compounds used separately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), suggesting that the 2 genes may promote resistance through separate pathways. In the tamoxifen-sensitive parental cell line, treatment with GN25, tamoxifen or combination of the 2 led to comparable and dramatic growth inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), while PP2 treatment did not affect the growth of parental cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_8"><title>siRNA-mediated knockdown of SNAI2 increases tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines</title><p>To further evaluate whether the reduced expression of mir-593 and corresponding increased expression of its target gene SNAI2 is associated with tamoxifen resistance, we performed gene knockdown of, SNAI2.

The reduction in SNAI2 resulted in significant reduction of TamR cell growth, while no significant reduction in growth of parental MCF7/S0.5 cells was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>), suggesting that mir-593 may affect tamoxifen resistance by controlling SNA12 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2_9"><title>miRNA alterations in the cell line model are also seen in breast cancers of patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy</title><p>We assessed the clinical relevance of our results from the cell line model by comparing the miRNA data therefrom with those of primary tumors from ER+ breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy.

Patient classification was designed to separate training performance and independent test performance for all of the single miRNAs and for combinations of miRNAs by fitting a classifier on each cohort independently and testing that classifier on all three cohorts.

In this study, we identified molecular mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer affected by miRNAs and their target mRNAs in a cell line model. To strengthen the regulatory associations of miRNAs and target mRNAs, we utilized inverse expression correlations between miRNAs and their computationally-identified mRNA targets and integrated curated evidence of TF-DNA and protein-protein interaction information to identify relevant miRNA-mediated mRNA regulations. Several miRNA-target relationships that extend beyond the known signaling events associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer were identified.</p><p>Genomic heterogeneity is an important factor that complicates the interpretation of results obtained by global analysis of patient tumor material using advanced genomic technologies. This includes evaluation of tamoxifen resistance, which may be the result of different mechanisms in different patient tumors as well as within different areas of a single tumor [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Single cell sequencing may overcome this problem, but this technique is not commonly available and thus intratumor heterogeneity and thereby heterogeneity in the resistance mechanisms significantly complicate data interpretation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the TamR cell line model analyzed in the present study displays protein alterations also observed in clinical samples of patients resistant to tamoxifen treatment [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], supporting the clinical relevance of the model. The three individual tamoxifen-resistant cell lines studied may represent individual resistant cell clones within a tumor. In accordance with this, we observed that the distinct TamR cell lines exhibited both shared and unique miRNA and mRNA expression changes. However, despite the uniqueness of miRNAs and mRNAs affected in the individual resistant clones, there was a good overall agreement in the affected molecular pathways.</p><p>Adding clinical relevance to our findings, comparison of the miRNA alterations observed in the cell line model to those observed in a large cohort of 152 primary ER+ breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that in particular the combination of 2 miRNAs (miR-190b and miR-516a-5p) were predictive of treatment outcome in 2 of 3 patient cohorts.</p><p>We found that more than 60% of the significantly differentially-expressed genes showed a coherent inverse correlation of expression to their putative miRNA regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). In addition, combinatorial regulation by miRNA, where more than one miRNA targets the 3&#8242; UTR of mRNAs, may lead to a stable attenuation of expression of target mRNAs [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As an example of combinatorial regulation by miRNA is 14-3-3&#947; (YWHAG), which frequent overexpression is predictive of poor patient outcome in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer and functions by activation of the MAPK and PIK pathways [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We observed that YWHAG and YWHAZ were upregulated in TamR8, but not in TamR1 or TamR4. Their putative miRNA regulators were significantly downregulated in TamR8 (<italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05). Bergamaschi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] recently showed that tamoxifen plays a suppressive role on expression of miR-451 in TamR cell lines by inducing loss-of-regulation of YWHAZ due to downregulation of miR-451, its known regulatory miRNA. However, we found no significant over-expression of miR-451 in our study.</p><p>Furthermore, regulatory circuits consisting of transcription factors and miRNAs regulate gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Transcription factor <italic>FOXM1</italic>, previously shown to bind the promoter of miR-135a and to positively regulate miR-135a levels [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], showed a downregulation, in agreement with reduced level of miR-135a and increased expression of EPHA4/EPHA7 specifically in TamR4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Given the important roles of FOXM1, EPHA4 and EPHA7 on breast cancer outcome [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], FOXM1 and miR-135a were good candidates for a siRNA knockdown study. However, we found that reduction of <italic>FOXM1</italic> alone was not sufficient to modulate miR-135a expression in TamR4, and downregulation of miR-135a was dependent on other factors that were not modulated in this siRNA study.</p><p>In our experiment, miR-181b was consistently upregulated in all tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. In agreement with this, increased miR-181b expression was also associated with tamoxifen resistance by others [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Functional targets of miR-181b appeared to be relevant for breast cancer and drug resistance and were significantly downregulated in our study, including <italic>HEY1, CA2, PIK3R1, LYN, ESR1, JUN, STAT1, MYB, BCL2, CYCS, BAMBI, CTGF</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic>. MiR-342 was one of the consistently downregulated miRNAs in all resistant cell lines and has been linked with tamoxifen resistance by Cittelly <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] We identified 14 predicted functional targets of miR-342-3p/5p, including <italic>FYN, TGFBR1, COL4A6, CDKN1A</italic>, and Ephrins <italic>EPHA4/7</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). miR-221 and miR-222 are known to be associated with tamoxifen-resistance [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and our data provided some support for this hypothesis. miR-221 level was slightly increased in TamR1 and TamR4 (log2FC 0.53 and 0.64, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05), but not in TamR8, whereas miR-222 was downregulated specifically in TamR4 (log2FC &#8722;0.51, <italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05), perhaps as a consequence of a regulatory event upstream of miR-221/222 regulation.</p><p>The miRNA-mRNA inverse-correlation analysis identified miR-593, which was downregulated in TamR cell lines vs. MCF7/S0.5, while its predicted target SNAI2 was upregulated. Similarly, miR-342-3p/5p and miR-33b were downregulated in TamR vs. MCF7/S0.5 cells, while their predicted target FYN was upregulated. To assess whether the two miRNA-gene axis were central to the tamoxifen resistance phenotype, we used chemical inhibitors of the two genes and evaluated their influence on TamR growth. Interestingly, GN25, a chemical agent interfering with SNAI2 binding to P53, reduced the growth of all three TamR cell lines only in the presence of tamoxifen, while no effect was observed on TamR growth in the absence of tamoxifen, and its effect on the parental cell line was independent of tamoxifen. This suggests that the reduced mir-593/enhanced SNAI2 expression observed in TamR cells may influence the effect of tamoxifen, and that specific inhibition of SNAI2 function may render the cells susceptible to the growth-inhibiting effects of tamoxifen. Some GN25-mediated growth inhibition of the parental cell line was also observed. While SNAI2 was upregulated in TamR vs. parental cell lines, some expression in the parental cell line was observed. As GN25 treatment may lead to the complete abolition of SNAIL activity, and since SNAI2 is an anti-apoptotic molecule [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], complete abolition of its activity may affect survival of the cells, including the parental cell lines. This suggests that while residual expression of SNAI2 is essential for cell survival, the increased expression observed in tamoxifen-resistant cells may contribute to the resistance phenotype.</p><p>Similarly, we performed growth assays of TamR cell lines in the presence of a selective inhibitor of SRC family kinases PP2 and showed that the inhibitor reduced the growth of TamR cells, but had no significant effect on the tamoxifen-sensitive parental cell line, suggesting that the altered miR-342-3p/5p and miR-33b/FYN axis observed in TamR cells is important in the resistance mechanism. TamR cell growth was inhibited both in the presence and absence of tamoxifen, suggesting that FYN acts independently of ER. In line with this, we have recently shown that siRNA knockdown of <italic>FYN</italic> in TamR cells enhanced their susceptibility to the effects of tamoxifen [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although we have not proven that the PP2-mediated growth inhibition of TamR cells was due to inhibition of FYN kinase activity, as the drug targets multiple SRC family kinases at high concentrations, it seems highly plausible since FYN and LYN were the only SRC family kinases that exhibited increased expression, and knockdown of LYN in TamR cells did not affect cell growth [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly for GN25, only SNAI2 was upregulated in TamR, and not the other snail proteins, SNAI1 or SNAI3, recognized by GN25. Moreover, using the PP2 and GN25 inhibitors in combination led to a dramatic reduction in cell viability beyond that of either of the two compounds alone, suggesting that the two genes independently contribute to resistance. It may be argued that chemical inhibitors are non-specific and the effect may not be attributed to a specific gene, however, knockdown of <italic>SNAI2</italic> using siRNA transfection resulted in marked reduction in cell growth in TamR cell lines similar to the chemical inhibitors, confirming the importance of the genes in endocrine resistance. In agreement with this, a recent report showed that reduced expression of SNAI2 reduces the aggressiveness of cancer cells [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>A recent study by Ward <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] identified miR-375 as a marker of tamoxifen resistance in a different tamoxifen-resistant cell line model, showing that miR-375 expression level was directly proportional to tamoxifen sensitivity. However, in our study, we observed no miR-375 downregulation and indeed found a significant upregulation in TamR8 (logFold change 1.05, p &#8804;0.05), perhaps due to differences in the cell models used. Further, of the ten miRNAs with significant downregulation in the tamoxifen-resistance models of Ward <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], three were also downregulated in our study (miR-135a, miR-135b, miR-190b), while five were missing or undetectable by our qPCR assays. Among twelve significantly upregulated miRNAs in the same study [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], five were also upregulated in our study in one or more cell lines (miR-551b, miR-519a, miR-521, miR-205 and miR-455-3p), while four were missing or undetectable by our qPCR assays.</p><p>Our systematic approach of inferring miRNA-target relationships elucidated important and detailed gene regulation events that may contribute to the development of tamoxifen resistance. Several miRNA-target relationships were identified, many showing significant association with various signaling events previously associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance. Clearly further functional studies are needed to experimentally confirm the identified miRNA-target relationships. While we realize that the observed gene regulation is a combination of miRNA targeting as well as post-transcriptional modifications of the upstream promoters of miRNAs and/or their target genes, our study nonetheless supports the importance of miRNA-mediated gene regulatory events in tamoxifen resistance. Targeted experiments based on our findings will bring insight into tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer and provide the basis for future medical intervention of ER+ tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell lines and standard culture conditions</title><p>The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was originally received from The Breast Cancer Task Force Cell Culture Bank, Mason Research Institute (Worcester, MA).

Test set 3 consisted of 40 patients who had received 3-5 years of tamoxifen therapy, and of these 19 experienced recurrences. Clinical and pathological characteristics of the three patient subgroups are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>. Normalization and pre-processing of microarray data from GSE37405 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was performed in R using <italic>limma</italic> package [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The resistant cell lines, TamR1, TamR4 and TamR8, were considered model systems for recurrence, and the parental cell line MCF-7/S0.5 was considered a model for patients without recurrence. Differentially-expressed miRNAs from the cell line model were assessed for possible changes of expression between recurrent and non-recurrent patient samples in the three test sets (cohorts) fitting a logistic regression model. miR-190b, miR-29b, miR-516a-5p, miR-203, expression profiles were used to calculate their predictive power to differentiate recurrent or non-recurrent samples in GSE37405 as a single marker or in combinations. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated using the ROCR package [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_11"><title>Gene knockdown studies</title><p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SNAI2, FOXM1 and scrambled siRNA controls were designed and synthesized by Qiagen (Copenhagen, Denmark). Cell transfection was performed using the Ingenio electroporation kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, cells grown to 70-80% confluence were harvested, counted and resuspended in 100&#956;l of Ingenio electroporation solution containing 150 nM of the required siRNAs. The mixture was transferred into a 0.2 cm cuvette and electroporated using an Amaxa nucleofector device (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Transfected cells were then seeded in the appropriate culture medium. Cells were harvested 48 or 72 hours later for evaluation of the efficiency of gene knockdown using real time PCR and/or Western blotting [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Growth assay was performed 96 hours after gene knockdown. Scrambled siRNA transfected cells were used as controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4_12"><title>Evaluation of the effect of specific chemical inhibitors on TamR cell growth</title><p>MCF-7/S0.5 and TamR cell lines (10<sup>5</sup>cells/ml) were seeded in 24-well plates (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 1&#956;M tamoxifen (Sigma) and 3&#956;M SNAIL-P53 binding inhibitor GN25 (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) or 2.5&#956;M SRC family kinase inhibitor PP2 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK). Cell growth was measured 3 days after seeding using a crystal violet-based colorimetric assay. Each assay was performed in quadruplicates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-57239-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1248" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-57239-s002.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1250" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-57239-s003.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1252" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Henriette Vever for excellent technical assistance and M.
