This study used an Illumina SNP microarray and a TaqMan assay to determine the possible association of the PADI4 gene with various tumor risks. Both genotyping methods demonstrated significant associations between the tag SNPs rs1635566 and rs882537 in the PADI4 locus with gastric carcinoma in two independent cohorts. Based on this genotyping result, we used the Cancer Pathway Finder, p53 Signaling, Signal Transduction and Tumor Metastasis PCR arrays to investigate the tumorigenic pathway of PADI4 in MNK-45 cells derived from gastric carcinoma. We detected significantly decreased expression levels of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; in MNK-45 cells that were treated with anti-PADI4 siRNA. We also detected increased expression of these three genes in MNK-45 cells transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid overexpressing PADI4. A highly similar result was also obtained for SGC 7901 cells, which also originate from gastric carcinoma. Our result indicates that the PADI4 gene has genetic susceptibility in gastric carcinoma. PADI4 contributes to gastric tumorigenesis by upregulating CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; expression, which are well known to activate angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and the immune microenvironment in tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>peptidyl deiminase (PAD)</kwd><kwd>peptidyl deiminase isoform 4 (PADI4)</kwd><kwd>CXCR2</kwd><kwd>KRT14</kwd><kwd>TNF-&#945;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the conversion of arginine residues to citrulline residues in the presence of excess calcium. This enzymatic activity is referred as citrullination or, alternatively, as deimination. PAD-mediated post-translational citrullination processes play important roles in protein function and structural stability and, therefore, significantly affect physiological and pathological processes [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The roles of PAD and citrullination in tumorigenesis have continued to garner increased interest [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Five mammalian PAD family members (PAD or PADI 1-4 and 6) are all encoded by a cluster of genes on chromosome 1p36.13 [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that PADI4 (peptidyl deiminase isoform 4) is involved in tumor progression [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We and others demonstrated marked overexpression of PADI4 in many human cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We and others also detected a significant increase in the levels of PADI4 and citrullinated antithrombin in the blood of patients with tumors [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, we found that elevated PADI4 levels are positively correlated with the pathological classification of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and that the PADI4 gene has a valid susceptibility to the risk of esophageal carcinoma [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, we reported that the expression level of PADI4 was related to the patient's age and the histopathological classification of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. Estrogen can stimulate the expression of PADI4 in ovarian tumor cells [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, we found that PADI4 can stimulate the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of the ovarian cancer cell line A2480 via p53 signaling [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>To gain further insight into its tumorigenic mechanism, we investigated whether common polymorphisms in the PADI4 region are associated with various cancer risks using a SNP microarray. The results were verified by the TaqMan genotyping method in independent cohorts. We aimed to determine the tumor types to which the PADI4 gene has valid susceptibility. Based on the genetics data, the study continued to explore the effect of PADI4 on the tumorigenic process and determine the signaling pathway by which PADI4 contributes to tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Genotyping SNPs located in the PADI4 locus</title><p>We genotyped 59 SNPs in the PADI4 locus of various tumor samples and controls using an Illumina 384-SNP VeraCode microarray. All of the SNPs yielded usable genotyping data, and the study sample success rate was 98.9%. Differences in the allele and genotype frequencies between the cancer and control samples were compared. The genotypic frequency of the SNPs at rs882537, rs1748034, rs1748032, rs1635566 and rs1635584 were significantly different between the gastric carcinoma cohort and the healthy control cohort. In addition, the allelic frequency and genotypic frequency of the SNP at rs1635586 were significantly different in patients with either breast cancer or esophageal carcinoma compared to the control subjects. The allelic frequency of the SNP at rs1635564 was significantly different between the rectal carcinoma cohorts and the control cohort. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> presents the allele frequencies, genotype frequencies and p-values after the statistical analysis of the above-mentioned SNPs.

Allelic frequencies and gene frequencies of these SNPs did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in either the tumor or the control samples. The genotyping did not detect the single nucleotide polymorphism at rs41265997 in the Chinese population tested. The allele frequency (odds ratio=3.827392, 95% CI=[1.262104&#8211;11.606753], p=0.010243) and gene frequency (p=0.028771) for rs1635566 demonstrated a statistically significant association with gastric carcinoma. The SNP at rs882537 also showed significant differences with regard to the allele frequency (odds ratio=1.337557, 95%CI= [1.019987~1.754002], p=0.035307) in the gastric carcinoma cohort.

This observation indicates the successful inhibition of PADI4 gene expression with anti-PADI4 siRNA. A series of Qiagen PCR array analyses were applied to examine the alternative gene expression in the treated MNK-45 cells, which allowed for the determination of the tumorigenic pathway of PADI4. Genes with at least a 4-fold change in expression were considered to be biologically significant in this study. Finally, the use of the Cancer Pathwayfinder, p53 Signaling, Signal Transduction and Tumor Metastasis PCR arrays revealed 10 genes with significantly altered expression levels in MNK-45 cells following treatment with anti-PADI4 siRNA. Significantly alterations in the expression levels of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), CA9 (carbonic anhydrase 9), IGFBP3 (insulin like growth factor binding protein 3) and KRT14 (keratin 14) were detected by the Cancer Pathwayfinder assay; TP63 (tumor protein p63) expression was detected by the p53 Signaling Pathway array; CCL5 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5), MMP7 (matrix metallopeptidase 7), CA9 and TNF-&#945; (tumor necrosis factor&#8211;alpha) were detected by the Signal Transduction Pathway array; and MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2), MMP7 and CXCR2 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2) expression was detected by the Tumor Metastasis PCR array.

Several SNPs, including rs882537, rs1748034, rs1748032, rs1635566 and rs1635584, showed significant differences with regard to allelic frequency, genotypic frequency or both between the gastric carcinoma samples and the control samples. This genotyping result was verified by the TaqMan assay in an independent cohort of individuals with gastric carcinoma. The analysis showed a significant difference in the allele frequency and the genotype frequency for rs1635566 between the gastric carcinoma samples and the controls. The analysis also detected a significant association of rs882537 and this cancer with regard to the allele frequency. The TaqMan genotyping results are in agreement with the Illumina microarray results. These findings strongly demonstrate that the PADI4 gene has a valid susceptibility to gastric tumor risk. The result encourages us to focus on investigating the tumorigenic role of PADI4 in gastric tumors. In addition, our Illumina SNP microarray assay showed a significant association of rs1635586 with breast cancer and esophageal carcinoma as well as a significant association of rs1635564 with rectal carcinoma. We previously reported that the haplotype GC, which contains rs2501796 and rs2477134 in the PADI4 locus, was significantly associated with an increased risk of esophageal carcinoma [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many studies have also reported that genetic variants in the PADI4 locus are related to rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>PADI4 gene is 55810 bp long and has 17 exons. The tag SNP rs1635566/rs59611518 is on the fourteenth intron of the PADI4 gene and 203 bp upstream of the fifteenth exon, and rs882537/rs3829723 is on the second intron and 589 bp upstream of the third exon. All published data regarding the PADI4 SNPs do not indicate a potential bio-function of these two tag SNPs in the intron region. A tag SNP is a representative single nucleotide polymorphism in a region of the genome with high linkage disequilibrium that represents a group of SNPs called a haplotype. It is feasible to genotype a small number of tag SNPs to determine a potential association with phenotypes without genotyping every SNP in a chromosomal region. To investigate the relationship between the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the associated haplotypes, Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> identified four exonic SNPs, three of which are involved in amino acid substitutions: padi4-89, padi4-90, padi4-92 and padi4-104, resulting in Ser55 to Gly, Ala82 to Val and Ala112 to Gly, respectively. The authors found that the mRNA of the susceptible haplotype was more stable than that of the non-susceptible haplotype, suggesting that SNPs in the PADI4-coding region contribute to mRNA stability. Susceptible-haplotype mRNA likely accumulates at higher levels than non-susceptible mRNA, resulting in higher levels of PADI4 protein expression [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, Acta <italic>et al.</italic> found that these three amino acid substitutions only induced conformational changes within the N-terminal domain and did not alter the citrullination activity of PADI4 enzyme. These structural and biochemical analyses suggest that improper protein citrullination in rheumatoid arthritis patients is not caused by defects in citrullination activity but by other reasons such as enhanced PADI4 mRNA stability [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To date, we do not know whether the SNPs rs1635566 and rs882537 play a role in enhancing mRNA stability. Normally, SNPs in the middle of an intron do not exert a bio-function to influence either gene expression levels or the activity of the encoded protein product [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We will genotype more SNPs in this region, particularly in the exon region, to identify functional SNPs that may affect the expression level or enzymatic activity of PADI4 as well as the related signaling pathway in a future study.</p><p>In our previous study, we detected considerably increased transcription and translation of PADI4 in gastric tumor tissues compared with corresponding healthy tissues and stomach leiomyosarcoma tissues using real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We also detected citrullination of &#946;-tubulin and &#945;-enolase in SGC 7901 cells (which are derived from gastric cancer) using a proteomic method [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The increased expression of PADI4 in gastric tumor tissues corresponds to the present finding regarding the significant association of PADI4-encoding DNA variants with gastric carcinoma. To date, citrullination of histones, cytokeratin, antithrombin and fibronectin has been detected and found to be involved in abnormal apoptosis, increased coagulation, and disordered cell proliferation and differentiation, all of which are main features of malignant tumors [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These findings suggest that PADI4 may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of gastric tumors.</p><p>The tumorigenic pathway of PADI4 was analyzed in the gastric tumor-derived MNK-45 cell line using a series of tumorigenesis-related PCR arrays. RNA interference against PADI4 expression resulted in the significantly altered expression of 10 genes involved in cancer pathways, p53 signaling, signal transduction and tumor metastasis. Real-time PCR and western blotting were then used to verify the PCR array results in MNK-45 cells that either suppress PADI4 expression or overexpress PADI4. Finally, increased mRNA and protein expression levels of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; were detected in the PADI4-overexpressing MNK-45 cells, whereas decreased expression of these three genes was detected in the cells that suppressed PADI4 expression. Moreover, similar results were obtained in SGC 7901 cells, which is another tumor cell line derived from gastric tumors. These results demonstrate that altered PADI4 expression significantly affects CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; expression and suggests that PADI4 plays a role in gastric tumorigenesis through the CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; pathways. The present study used anti-PADI4 siRNA to transiently knock down PADI4 mRNA expression. We did not establish a MNK-45 cell line that stably inhibited PADI4 expression, which can explain the 4- to 10-fold discrepancy in the decrease in PADI4 mRNA levels between the PCR array and the real-time PCR results. However, we found that PADI4 protein expression levels were 3- to 4-fold lower than those in the control cells without any considerable alterations between the two experiments. This observation suggests that the altered mRNA expression of PADI4 is not always proportional with the altered protein expression, and the discrepancy in the decreased mRNA levels between the two experiments did not considerably affect the downstream gene expression patterns.</p><p>It is well known that CXCR2 participates in chronic inflammation, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis in several types of carcinomas by binding to its native ligand interleukin-8 (IL-8) [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The expression level of CXCR2 is higher in gastric cancer tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is associated with the extent of tumor differentiation, advanced clinical stage, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis of gastric cancer [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. KRT14 (keratin 14) is expressed in mitotically active cells of the basal layer along with its partner keratin 5, and the expression of these two proteins is downregulated as cells differentiate. In lymph node metastases of squamous cell carcinoma, tumor cells often express KRT14 in the trabecular nests of the primary carcinoma [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. KRT14 also plays a role in the maintenance of proliferation potential in cells in the basal layer of stratified epithelia [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We previously detected the citrullination of keratin and co-localization of PADI4 with keratin in many tumor tissues [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. TNF-&#945; is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death via binding to specific receptors on cell membranes. TNF-&#945; polymorphisms have been found to be associated with gastric carcinogenesis [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. <italic>Helicobacter pylorus,</italic> a definitive carcinogen for stomach cancer, is known to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#945; and interleukin-1 in the stomach [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, TNF-&#945; is an endogenous tumor promoter [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Park <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the inhibition of PADI4 expression markedly attenuated the TNF-&#945;-induced increase of NF-&#954;B, AP-1 and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) expression in vascular smooth muscular cells [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Kim <italic>et al.</italic> also reported that PADI4 siRNA repressed TACE (TNF-&#945; converting enzyme) expression [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The current study found that stimulation of PADI4 increased CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945; expression levels, suggesting that increased expression of PADI4 in gastric tumor tissues, as we previously observed, contributes to tumorigenesis by increasing the expression levels of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945;.</p><p>p53, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, inhibits malignant transformation through the transcriptional regulation of its target genes, which function to mediate the cell cycle and apoptosis. Studies have indicated that p53 regulates the transcription of target genes by post-translational modification of histones via methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Yao <italic>et al.</italic> and Li <italic>et al.</italic> found that the overexpression of PADI4 may prevent the methylation of histone H3 by converting arginine into citrulline. As a result, the expression of p53 target genes is reduced, which results in the disruption of cellular apoptosis and cell cycle progression [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hagiwara <italic>et al.</italic> and Cuthbert <italic>et al.</italic> also confirmed that the citrullination of histones by PADI4 antagonizes arginine methylation [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings support the notion that PADI4 overexpression counteracts p53 function. Furthermore, Guo <italic>et al.</italic> found that upregulation of CXCR2 is dependent on the dysfunction of p53 [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; Cai <italic>et al.</italic> found that p53 represses the promoter activity of the KRT14 promoter and downregulates KRT14 expression [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; Tang <italic>et al.</italic> found that a transcription factor termed LPS-induced TNF factor (LITAF) significantly induces TNF-&#945; production. Furthermore, p53 specifically downregulates LITAF/TNF-&#945; gene expression [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These findings and ours support the possibility that overexpression of PADI4 interrupts the p53 signaling pathway, which in turn leads to increased expression of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945;. Recently, we transfected two ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780 (wild-type for p53) and SKOV3 (p53-null), with PADI4-siRNA. The proliferation of both A2780 and SKOV3 cells decreased significantly following anti-PADI4 siRNA treatment. The invasion and migratory ability of the A2780 cells was also significantly decreased in response to PADI4-siRNA treatment, but the SKOV3 cells showed no such decrease. The apoptotic rate of the A2780 cells increased in the presence of PADI4-siRNA, but there was no such increase in SKOV3 cells. These results support the notion that PADI4 plays an important role in the p53 pathway and the regulation of the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of tumor cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that PADI4 is a susceptible gene of gastric carcinoma. Moreover, this study found that PADI4 may contribute to cancer development and progression by increasing the expression of CXCR2, KRT14 and TNF-&#945;, which activate pro-inflammatory processes, angiogenesis, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell differentiation in tumor tissues. These findings may be useful in improving our understanding of the tumorigenic process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients and blood sample collection</title><p>In the present study, all of the blood samples were collected from patients at Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital (Jinan, Shandong, China) and PKUCare Luzhong Hospital/Zibo Branch of Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital (Linzi, Shandong.

An siRNA oligonucleotide that targets the PADI4 gene (target sequence: 5&#8242;CAGCGTAGTCTTGGGTCCCAA 3&#8242;) was designed and synthesized by Qiagen (Germany). The cultured tumor cells were transfected with siRNA at a concentration of 20 nM using the HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The inhibition of PADI4 expression in these cell lines was verified by real-time PCR and western blotting.</p><p>The full coding sequence of PADI4 is 1,992 bp long and codes for 663 amino acid residues. The full coding sequence was amplified from cDNA that was reverse-transcribed from total RNA of the gastric tumor tissues using the specific primers PADI4-EcoRI-Fex (TACTCAGAATTCATGGCCCAGGGGACATTG) and PADI4-AscI-Rex (TACTCAGGCGCGCCGAGGGCACCATGTTCCA).
