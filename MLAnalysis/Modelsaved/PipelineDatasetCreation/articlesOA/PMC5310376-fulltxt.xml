<italic>Introduction </italic>
</p><p> Patient outcome measures are required to assess the quality of healthcare. Tools for a patients&#8217; self-assessment of quality of recovery, during perioperative care, have been developed during the last decade. The Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale (PostopQRS) questionnaire is one of the most well-accepted and validated tools available. Here we assess the PostopORS questionnaire in Swedish.</p><p>
<italic>Methods</italic>
</p><p> Sixty-one students from the Bachelor Program in Nursing, (50 female and 11 male; mean age, 25; range, 21-46) filled in the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS questionnaire twice. They also evaluated whether they found the queries easy to understand and respond to

</p><p>
<italic>Results</italic>
</p><p> The participants found the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS questionnaire easy to read and understand. There were minor differences in test responses between the initial test and the re-test 48 hours later. We found that the PostopQRS questionnaire has some background noise; 12 out of 61 participants (20%) reported mild pain, 25 (41%) scored some depression and 33 scored mild anxiety (54%). The cognitive domain showed a learning effect between tests in &#8220;word recall&#8221; and &#8220;word generation&#8221;, while &#8220;digit recall forward&#8221; and &#8220;digit recall backward&#8221; showed no change. We found a difference in cognitive test performance with age; younger participants had higher mean cognitive test scores compared to participants &gt;30 years. Overall, nine participants showed a decrease in re-test scores; two experienced a mild increase in pain; one experienced a mild increase in anxiety; and six performed more poorly on cognitive tests.</p><p>
<italic>Conclusion</italic>
</p><p> The Swedish translation of the PostopQRS was found to be adequate for use in the assessment of quality of recovery, and the questions were well understood by participants. Our study shows the importance of baseline testing for assessment of recovery, since recovery is assessed as a return to or improvement in each individual&#8217;s baseline score.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>recovery</kwd><kwd>quality of recovery</kwd><kwd>PostopQRS</kwd><kwd>volunteers</kwd><kwd>re-test</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study has been supported by the Department of Anaesthesia Danderyds Hospital and University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Academy.

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> to best assess the quality of patient recovery
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Several tools have been developed to achieve this goal
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The Postoperative Quality of Recovery scale (PostopQRS) questionnaire was developed in 2010 and has been widely accepted as an effective tool for the self-assessment of patients&#8217; quality of recovery
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The PostopQRS homepage provides detailed information around how to use the test and available languages (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.postopqrs.com/">http://www.postopqrs.com/</ext-link>). The PostopQRS assesses patient recovery compared to a unique individual preoperative, baseline score. This is somewhat in contrast to other tests, e.g. the Quality of Recovery Scale, where the absolute score is commonly used to describe recovery. Moreover, Myles
<italic>et al</italic>. recently published recommendations around the minimal clinically important difference
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The PostopQRS questionnaire addresses multiple domains, including nociception, emotion, day-to-day activities, cognition and satisfaction. The cognitive domain consists of a five tests, as follows: orientation, digit recall forwards, digit recall backwards, letter forwards and word generation. These tests have been shown to be effective in assessing cognitive performance
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. There has been a discussion around how individual cognitive re-test scores should be evaluated, and an amended technique, including a tolerance factor of -1 to -3, is now recommended
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The PostopQRS is an attractive tool for assessing the quality of recovery following general, as well as local, anaesthesia
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to validate the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS in a test and re-test study in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Stockholm (January 20

Tests were initially undertaken face-to-face on the day of inclusion to establish a baseline, and then on day 2, 48 hours after the initial baseline test. The second test was performed by telephone.</p><p>The tests were all performed in a quiet environment, free from distraction. The participants completed all sections of the PostopQRS on both occasions. The questions and answers were read from the prescribed PostopQRS script. During the initial test, all participants also read the question by themselves, with the exception of the cognitive tests.</p><p>All participants were explicitly asked whether they had any hesitation regarding the understanding of the questions, both when provided verbally and by reading. The question about understanding the queries was asked on both occasions, although during the telephone re-test only verbal evaluation was possible.</p><p>All questions were translated to Swedish, The letters used for the word generation test were D and S was used; D for the initial base-line test and S for the 48-hour re-test.</p><p>The physiological domain, which assesses vital signs, were not included in this study.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were collected from the interview personnel before submission to the data administrator for analysis.

Participants were divided into three different groups depending on age (20&#8211;24 years, 25&#8211;29 years, and &gt;30 years). Significance testing was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test or Kruskal-Wallis test where appropriate, and were analysed using SPSS version 23.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-tailed P value &gt;0.05 was considered significant.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We observed that the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS is easy to read and understand. The test and the re-test 48 hours later showed minor alterations. There was background noise and a learning effect in word recall and generation tests between the two test occasions. The cognitive tests showed huge individual variability in scores emphasising the importance of baseline testing, since PostopQRS defines recovery as whether an individual has regained their base-line score. The PostopQRS does not assess an absolute value; it defines recovered/not recovered as a return to base-line performance or better test score.</p><p>The PostopQRS was developed by an international team in 2010, and since then has been validated and is now considered a robust test tool
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The questionnaire has been translated into several languages (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.postopqrs.com/">http://www.postopqrs.com/</ext-link>). The Japanese translation was studied in patients by Naito
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, who considered it a feasible tool for assessing recovery after surgery, despite having some limitation in ceiling effect in a high number of questions. The questionnaire was also recently translated into Chinese by Bu
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, who concluded that the translated PostopQRS tool was robust, but showed that the Quality of Recovery scale
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> had a higher validity and was faster to perform.</p><p>The importance of a baseline test was also shown by Lindqvist
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, who studied patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery and showed that the baseline test was significantly affected. In addition, several patients did not have a baseline score that was sufficient for the assessment of the recovery process. The learning effect was also seen in a volunteer study by Royse
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>The impact on age has also been addressed by Royse
<italic>et al</italic>. The authors found only minor age effects on the recovery process; however, they did not investigate the explicit test results
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Both age and time of day have been shown to influence more complex word tests, with older patients performing better in the morning in contrast to younger patients, who exhibit better results in the evening
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In this study, we used the letters &#8216;D&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217; for word generation. It has been suggested that the letters should be changed for the word generation test, and different words, letters and numbers should be chosen for the recall domain tests in re-tests, in order to reduce any learning effect. In agreement with Rosye
<italic>et al</italic>., we used face-to-face interviews for the initial test and phone interviews for the re-test
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Royse
<italic>et al</italic>. did not find that phone interviews had a significant impact on the results.</p><p>There are several limitations of the present study. The participants in our study were young healthy volunteers; thus, the participants were not exposed to any form of intervention, such as surgery and anaesthesia. We made only one follow-up after 48 hours and did not perform re-tests at any additional time-points. It should also be acknowledged that we did not compare the PostopQRS questionnaire with any other assessment tool. We do consider the PostopQRS a well-established recovery assessment tool
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and also find that the Swedish version could work well in determining patients&#8217; quality of recovery.</p><p>In summary, we observed that the Swedish translation of the PostopQRS is easy to read and understand, and preoperative baseline testing is of importance to define each individuals score profile. The test and re-test performed showed low variability, which was observed by the majority of participants performing equally on both tests. However, a learning effect in the word recall and word generation cognitive tests was observed. In conclusion, we believe that the PostopQRS is a feasible tool for assessment of recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#169; 2016 Jildenst&#229;l P et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).

Sixty one students were assessed twice on the scale with a 48 hour gap between assessments. The physiological aspects of the PostopQRS Scale were not used.&#160; On the first occasion participants were assessed face to face and the second via telephone. The PostopQRS Scale has been validated for telephone use in its English version.</p><p> The authors report some learning on the tests of word recall and word generation. It is not uncommon to find some learning taking place on cognitive tests especially between the first and second occasions. This has been attributed in part to the fact that on the first occasion the tests are new and the participant does not know what to expect. On the second occasion the experience of having done the test enables some participants to adjust their strategy and obtain an improved score. The use of parallel forms is widely used to reduce learning of the actual items on any of the tests and the authors note that they may have increased the learning observed on these two tests by not using a parallel set of words on the word recall task and not counterbalancing the letter on Word Generation task.</p><p> The authors note then baseline levels of pain, anxiety and depression along with highly variable cognitive performance all of which attest to the importance of having baseline scores before surgery in order to account for individual differences.&#160; Overall the Swedish version of the PostopQRS appears to perform well.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="report17147" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5256/f1000research.10501.r17147</article-id><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Royse</surname><given-names>Colin F.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="r17147a1">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r17147a1">

The study is well conducted and supports the translated version. Further, they have shown a small learning effect as well as considerable variation in baseline performance of the Scale, which emphasizes the need to always compare postoperative recovery against the individual's own baseline scores.</p><p> The authors should mention in their discussion that their cognitive scores were very similar to the cognitive scores reported by Royse
<italic> et al</italic> in their study on volunteers, indicating that the value of the scores in Swedish should be comparable to English version publications.
