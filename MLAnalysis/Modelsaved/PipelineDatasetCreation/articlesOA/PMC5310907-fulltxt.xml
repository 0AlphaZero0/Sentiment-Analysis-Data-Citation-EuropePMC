However, the association between the local immune responses induced by IBV and the mechanisms of pathogenesis has not yet been completely elucidated. This study compared the expression profile of genes related to immune responses in tracheal samples after challenge with two Brazilian field isolates (A and B) of IBV from the same genotype, associating these responses with viral replication and with pathological changes in trachea and kidney. We detected a suppressive effect on the early activation of TLR7 pathway, followed by lower expression levels of inflammatory related genes induced by challenge with the IBV B isolate when compared to the challenge with to the IBV A isolate. Cell-mediated immune (CMI) related genes presented also lower levels of expression in tracheal samples from birds challenged with B isolate at 1dpi. Increased viral load and a higher percentage of birds with relevant lesions were observed in both tracheal and renal samples from chickens exposed to challenge with IBV B isolate. This differential pattern of early immune responses developed after challenge with IBV B isolate, related to the downregulation of TLR7, leading to insufficient pro-inflammatory response and lower CMI responses, seem to have an association with a most severe renal lesion and an enhanced capability of replication of this isolate in chicken.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003046</institution-id><institution>Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu&#225;ria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>03.12.03.012.0-00</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The whole study was supported by Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), a governamental institution os research from Brazil.

IBV replicates primarily in tracheal epithelial cells, inducing several mucosal pathological changes, including ciliary loss, degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells, glandular degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration and epithelial hyperplasia [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. After replication at primary site in tracheal mucosa, viraemia and IBV secondary replication are also found in other respiratory tissues (nose, lungs and air sacs) and in many non-respiratory epithelial tissues (kidneys, testes, oviduct, and gastrointestinal tract). Nephritis is commonly observed, mainly in broilers, and depending on the pathotype of the IBV strain and on the bird age, it may cause high mortality, and microscopic lesions of degeneration and necrosis of the renal tubular cells and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Prevention of IBV infection is currently achieved through vaccination, especially by attenuated viral vaccines, suggesting that local mucosal immunity is essential for induction of effective protection against disease [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the dose of attenuated vaccine administered by local route is closely related to humoral and cellular immune responses at tracheal mucosal sites and their ability to confer effective protection against disease [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The continuous emergence of new IBV variants in several countries [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are routinely pointed out as a cause of outbreaks in vaccinated flocks, leading to significant economic losses to the poultry industry [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite the great number of IBV strains and variants described over the last years [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], most of the studies have been limited to the classification and differentiation of IBV strains in genotypes, pathotypes, protectotypes, and/or serotypes, while, the specific immune mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of this virus remains poorly elucidated.</p><p>A recent study has observed differential early immune response after infection with IBV when comparing IBV-susceptible and IBV-resistant chicken lines. Even before infection, specific genes, including genes related to innate immune response, were found to be differentially expressed in each chicken line. Despite these differences, viral loads were similar in tracheal samples of both chicken lines, indicating that IBV resistance might be associated with how the birds respond to the virus and not how they can prevent an initial infection [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against infections, and several immune and non-immune cells on mucosal surfaces are involved on recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) of microorganisms. PAMPs are recognized through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), among which toll-like receptors (TLR) are an important group. During a RNA-virus infection, activation of innate immune responses depends on the interaction of endosome-associated (TLR3 and TLR7) and/or cytosol-located (RIG-I like receptors) PRRs. TLR3 and TLR7 interact with double-stranded (ds) RNA or single-strand (ss) RNA, respectively, and the subsequent activation pathways for TLR3 and TLR7 are mediated by TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&#946;) and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), respectively, which lead to the production of anti-viral type I interferons (IFN&#945; and IFN&#946;) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1&#946; and IL6) [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Expression of genes related to the TLR pathway activation and type I IFN were already found to be upregulated in tracheal samples from birds challenged with reference strains of IBV [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2), responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages in response against microbial infections, is often associated with synergic effects combined with acute phase proteins and cytokines, as IFNs and TNFs, leading to enhanced phagocytosis. Alternatively, an excessive production of iNOS and consequently NO may have negative effects by promoting excessive inflammation or apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although a previous report did not identify a change in iNOS transcripts in both tracheal and lung samples during the early phase of IBV infection [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], increased levels of this enzyme was associated with high degree of disease severity in chickens infected with avian influenza H5N1 [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and virulent Newcastle disease [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The important role of pro-inflammatory cytokines on IBV pathogenicity was demonstrated in a previous evaluation of the kinetics of the inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses in tracheal mucosa of birds infected with the M41 strain of IBV. TNFSF15 and TGF&#946; transcripts were found to peak at 1 day post infection (dpi), followed by higher upregulation of IL6, IL1&#946; and IFN&#947;. These increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were associated to highest scores of lesions and viral load at 3dpi, whereas later, at 7dpi, highest increases in CD8 and Granzyme homolog A mRNA expression were detected and associated to a significant decrease in lesions and viral load [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>It has been recognized that IL6 is associated with development of tissue damage in chickens challenged with IBV, including nephritis [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Levels 20 times higher of IL6 mRNA after IBV challenge were observed in an IBV-susceptible chicken line compared to the disease-resistant chicken line [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. High level of IL6 gene expression were detected in renal samples of chickens challenged with a nephropathogenic IBV strain and it has been well correlated with viral load and influx of inflammatory cells in this organ [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>During the development of adaptive immunity against IBV infection, the local cell-mediated immune (CMI) response was associated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD4+ cells influx in the trachea from 3 to 7 dpi with IBV [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, CD8 and other CMI related genes were markedly increased during secondary response related to memory protection induced by the first antigen IBV exposition at 1dpi (8). Conversely, the CMI genes were found most upregulated later, at 5dpi, in the primary adaptive immune response of non-vaccinated chickens and correlated with high virus load in trachea, indicating this response might be more involved in the IBV pathogenesis in this post-infection period of non-immune chickens [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Mechanisms underlying immune-pathogenesis caused by IBV and those relating to viral clearance have begun to be elucidated [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In this study, we found a suppressive effect on expression of some early innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune genes in the primary site of virus replication (trachea) from chickens infected with one of the tested IBV isolates (B). This possibly contributed to an exacerbated pathogenicity of this IBV isolate, especially for kidney tissues, but not for A isolate.</p><p>IBV B isolate demonstrated an enhanced ability for viral replication in chicken host, as we observed significantly higher IBV genome loads in tracheal samples (at 5dpi), and in kidneys (at 8dpi) of birds challenged with this isolate, compared to the group infected with IBV A isolate. Furthermore, a higher percentage of positive birds for IBV genome and the presence of pathological alterations were observed in the IBV B infected group, especially in renal samples, that were IBV positive in birds infected with this isolate at 8dpi, while only 17% were positive in the group infected with IBV A isolate.</p><p>This enhanced viral replication of IBV B isolate compared to A isolate, may have played a role as one of the determinants for the higher percentage of chickens with relevant microscopic tracheal and renal lesions in birds from the IBV B challenged group. This could result in increased pathology of the IBV B isolate. However, the reason for the differences observed in tissue tropism and pathogenicity of different IBV strains remains an open question and cannot be associated in the present study to differences in S1 protein sequences, as A and B IBV isolates have an identity of XX % for this protein. Similarly, a recent study demonstrated that despite the same efficiency of S1 protein binding to the epithelial cells of oviduct, in a sialic-acid dependent manner, observed for Qx IBV strain (associated with nephropathogenicity and reproductive tract disorders) and B1648 IBV strain (associated with nephropathogenicity), a high susceptibility to infection was observed for QX strain in contrast to the resistance to infection with B1648 strain [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The authors concluded that other cellular receptors and post-virus binding activation steps could be involved and play a role in the development of IB disease, although the attachment of IBV to host cells is considered as the first important step in virus infection and for determining the tissue tropism for this virus [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In view of the differences observed here for these two Brazilian IBV isolates (A and B) in terms of viral replication and pathological alterations induced, the current study investigated how innate and adaptive immune responses are developed after challenge with each one of these viruses, aiming to better understand the virus-host interactions and the putative immune-related mechanisms that might determine the course of pathogenicity induced by IBV isolates with different virulence profiles.</p><p>Several studies on innate immune responses elicited by viruses and mediated by PRRs have demonstrated that the levels of expression of TLR genes are usually upregulated, in order to activate intra-cellular pathways involved in the production of type I anti-viral IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. TLR7 was reported to be upregulated at 1dpi in trachea from chickens experimentally infected with a Connecticut strain of IBV, but then the expression of this gene decayed to basal levels and remained unaltered at 2dpi and 3dpi [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, in the current study an unexpected suppressive effect in the TLR7 gene expression was observed only during the early phase of IBV B isolate infection (1dpi), as the transcripts of this gene were found 5 times downregulated. Moreover, at 8dpi, other genes related to activation of TLR7 pathway were also affected, including the adapter MyD88 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene (TNFSF15), which showed lower levels of expression in the birds from the group challenged with B isolate compared to the group challenged with isolate A. Thus, these results demonstrate a differential profile of early type of innate immune responses induced by IBV B isolate compared to the IBV-induced innate immune responses of another study [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the later study, an upregulation in the transcription of TLR7 and MyD88 genes was observed at 1dpi in tracheal samples from chickens infected with a Connecticut strain of IBV, that has a typical respiratory and pathogenicity for chicken respiratory tract.</p><p>Although other genes related to innate immune responses were also found to be differentially expressed in response to infection with the Brazilian IBV isolates, including TLR3, type I IFNs (IFN&#945; and IFN&#946;) and iNOS, no significant differences were observed between the group infected with IBV B isolate and that infected with IBV A isolate. These results suggested that the identified differences between the two IBV isolates are not related to the biological activities associated with these innate response genes. However, TLR3 and iNOS genes were significantly upregulated and peaked at 1dpi, while type I IFNs were significantly upregulated and peaked at 5dpi. These results contradict other findings for TLR3, IFN&#945;, IFN&#946; and iNOS gene expression in the respiratory tract of chickens challenged with a Connecticut strain of IBV [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], since no significant differences were observed for iNOS and IFN&#945; gene expression, and TLR3 was unaltered at 1dpi and IFN&#946; was upregulated at 1dpi. This indicates the likely existence of others factors and pathways in the innate immune responses that are triggered by the interaction of host and different pathotypes of IBV as well possible differences in structural and non-structural proteins of IBV strains involved in virus evasion from the immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>As memory immune responses induced by IBV vaccination could have some delay until reach effective anti-viral activities, the innate immune responses might be crucial to reduce the viral replication and pathological alterations induced by a virus pathogen as well exert a relevant role in the activation and shaping of the anti-viral adaptive immune responses. Thus, we hypothesize that the suppressive effect on TLR7 pathway could be associated with an enhanced ability for viral replication and induction of lesions for both tracheal and renal tissues. However, further analyses of these assumptions are necessary.</p><p>In addition, a reduction of expression of CMI-genes for adaptive immune responses was also observed only in the group challenged with IBV B isolate, as the transcript levels of CD3 and CD4 were significantly downregulated at 1dpi only in this group. Granzyme homolog A and IFN&#947; transcripts were also differentially expressed between the challenged groups in this interval, as significant upregulation was observed only in A group. Therefore the downregulation of cell-mediated immune related genes could be a consequence of a primary virus challenge effect and could have negative consequences for the chicken host. In a previous study, we were able to detect an increase in the expression of cell-mediated immune related genes at 1 dpi in tracheal samples from birds vaccinated with Massachusetts attenuated IBV strain and challenged with a virulent homologous strain. This early CMI response, was associated with the level of cellular memory immune responses conferred by immunization, and this effect was dependent on the vaccine dose administered and was negative correlated with the tracheal pathological changes induced by M41 strain of IBV [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Although we have not evaluated in this study the gene expression and/or the biological activity of MHC I and II pathways, or other genes related to antigen presentation by dendritic cells, we can speculate that IBV B isolate might have some differentiated properties that confer to this virus a greater ability to decrease antigen presentation and to evade the host adaptive immune responses against this virus. This assumption is supported by the findings that all cell-mediated immune related genes analyzed here have unaltered expression or were significantly downregulated in the group infected by B isolate of IBV at 1dpi, as shown the significantly downregulated levels of expression observed for CD4 and CD3 transcripts, and unaltered expression for IFN&#947; and Granzyme homolog A genes in birds of this group. In contrast, at 1dpi, the ugroup challenged with IBV A isolate showed unaltered levels of CD3 and CD4 mRNA, while IFN&#947; and Granzyme homolog A transcripts were significantly upregulated.</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells have important roles in the initial mechanisms of innate immunity against IBV, and were also important source of Granzyme homolog A and IFN&#947;. Although some authors have associated IFN&#947; production with the activity of NK cells after challenge with IBV [<xref rid="pone.0172275.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], in our experiment, the profile of expression of IFN&#947; and Granzyme homolog A may as well be associated with T CD8+ activation, since CD8&#946; and CD3 were also found to be upregulated in coincident time-points post-challenge in which IFN&#947; and Granzyme homolog A genes were upregulated, especially when considering that NK cells are unable to express CD8&#946; and CD3 genes.</p><p>In summary, this study has contributed to the better understanding part of host-IBV interactions, and to our knowledge, it is the first study that demonstrate that expression of distinct innate and cell-mediated adaptive immune genes are induced by two IBV isolates that were classified in the same genotype but differing in their virulence activities. Overall, the results point out to the relevance of the involvement of the TLR7 pathway and the associate factors related to the suppression of early innate immune responses as well the early cell-mediated adaptive immune responses and the implications on the pathogenesis of infection by a more virulent IBV isolate. However, further studies are required to confirm this association, and to verify other cellular response pathways that may also be affected by this virus. It remains also to be further investigated the differences in the immune responses triggered by the IBV infection with more distinct genotypes of IBV strains that can differ in pathogenicity for the respiratory, urinary or other tissue targets for IBV infection in chickens. Moreover, it is important for poultry industry and indirectly for human health to better understand how coronaviruses infect the chicken host and which genes and/or pathways are effectively involved in increasing the severity of this disease, especially considering the diseases caused by other coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172275.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Protein alignment of S1 gene from A (BI/BR/Embrapa/331/2000) and B (BI/BR/Embrapa/127/2006) IBV isolates.</title><p>Red squares are pointing the amino acids changes.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172275.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172275.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Medians of Log10 IBV genome copies per interval per group, and c values for Kruskal Wallis test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172275.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172275.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Medians of each treatment (gene expression) per interval per group, and c values for Kruskal Wallis test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172275.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172275.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Comparison of Log10 IBV genome copies medians between groups per tissue per interval and P values by Wilcoxon test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172275.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172275.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Comparison of gene expression medians between groups per treatment per interval and P values by Wilcoxon test.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172275.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Tania Alvina Potter Klein, Dejalmo Alexandre da Silva, Altair Althaus and Gl&#225;ucio Mata Mattos (<italic>in memorian</italic>) for support provided during experimental infection in chickens.
