Next-generation drugs, which interact with novel targets, are required to provide a better clinical outcome for these individuals. To identify potential novel targets for antiepileptic drug (AED) design, we used RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene transcription in two seizure models of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The first model compared gene transcription between wild type (WT) and <italic>bangsenseless<sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>), a gain-of-function mutant in the sole fly voltage-gated sodium channel (<italic>paralytic</italic>). The second model compared WT with WT fed the proconvulsant picrotoxin (PTX). We identified 743 genes (FDR&#8804;1%) with significant altered expression levels that are common to both seizure models. Of these, 339 are consistently upregulated and 397 downregulated. We identify <italic>pumilio</italic> (<italic>pum</italic>) to be downregulated in both seizure models. Pum is a known homeostatic regulator of action potential firing in both flies and mammals, achieving control of neuronal firing through binding to, and regulating translation of, the mRNA transcripts of voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>). We show that maintaining expression of <italic>pum</italic> in the CNS of <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> flies is potently anticonvulsive, whereas its reduction through RNAi-mediated knockdown is proconvulsive. Using a cell-based luciferase reporter screen, we screened a repurposed chemical library and identified 12 compounds sufficient to increase activity of <italic>pum</italic>. Of these compounds, we focus on avobenzone, which significantly rescues seizure behaviour in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> flies. The mode of action of avobenzone includes potentiation of <italic>pum</italic> expression and mirrors the ability of this homeostatic regulator to reduce the persistent voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>NaP</sub>) in an identified neuron. This study reports a novel approach to suppress seizure and highlights the mechanisms of neuronal homeostasis as potential targets for next-generation AEDs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary:</bold> Next-generation anticonvulsant compounds potentiate the activity of the neuronal homeostatic regulator Pumilio.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Anticonvulsant</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd><kwd>Pumilio</kwd><kwd>Sodium current</kwd><kwd>Translational repression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J005002/1</award-id><award-id>BB/L027690/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Manchester</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000770</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>087742/Z/08/Z</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The number of known contributory genetic loci to human seizure exceeds 500, which greatly increases the challenge of providing personalised medicine through tailoring treatments based on individual gene mutation (<xref rid="DMM027045C23" ref-type="bibr">Noebels, 2015</xref>). An alternative is to target treatment to common modifiers to which larger groupings of individual gene mutations contribute. One obvious modifier is neuronal homeostasis, which acts to stabilise neural circuit activity levels through continual adjustment of neuron excitability (<xref rid="DMM027045C37" ref-type="bibr">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). However, this opportunity remains unexplored.</p><p>Seizures in humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit sufficient parallels to implicate that the underlying neuronal abnormalities are highly similar. This includes defined seizure thresholds, common genetic mutations that modify seizure susceptibility, spread of seizures along defined neuronal tracts and suppression of seizures by recognised AEDs (<xref rid="DMM027045C21" ref-type="bibr">Muraro and Baines, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C34" ref-type="bibr">Song and Tanouye, 2008</xref>). As in humans, certain mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes result in a seizure phenotype (collectively termed bang-sensitive). Seizures can also be induced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by exposure to proconvulsants, including picrotoxin (PTX), primarily through block of inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="DMM027045C16" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To model seizure, we used <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>, which is a L1699F point mutation that imparts a gain of function in the sole voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>) of the fly genome (<xref rid="DMM027045C24" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in the human ortholog, <italic>SCN1A</italic>, are associated with seizure and intractable epilepsy (<xref rid="DMM027045C5" ref-type="bibr">Escayg and Goldin, 2010</xref>). In comparison, we also used exposure to PTX. We exploited the molecular tractability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to identify changes to gene transcription that occur during seizure to identify possible pathway nodes exploitable for anticonvulsant therapy. Comparison between the two models identifies 743 common transcriptional changes, including <italic>pum</italic>. Pum is a translational repressor that binds mRNA transcripts that normally (but not exclusively) contain an 8-nucleotide binding motif in their 3&#8242;-UTR, termed a Nanos response element [NRE, also known as Pumilio response element (PRE)] (<xref rid="DMM027045C8" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al., 2006</xref>). A particularly relevant Pum target, with respect to seizure, is Na<sub>v</sub>. We have previously shown that the fly Na<sub>v</sub> (<italic>paralytic</italic>) is translationally regulated by Pum and also that rat <italic>Scn8a</italic> (<italic>Na<sub>v</sub>1.6</italic>) is similarly regulated by <italic>Pum2</italic> (the closest mammalian homologue to <italic>pum</italic>) (<xref rid="DMM027045C4" ref-type="bibr">Driscoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C19" ref-type="bibr">Mee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C22" ref-type="bibr">Muraro et al., 2008</xref>). This mechanism forms part of a well-characterised homeostatic response that tunes action potential firing to match the changing level of synaptic excitation to which neurons are exposed (<xref rid="DMM027045C1" ref-type="bibr">Baines, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C39" ref-type="bibr">Weston and Baines, 2007</xref>). Two recent studies highlight the potential involvement of Pum in epilepsy. First, a <italic>Pum</italic>2 knockout mouse exhibits spontaneous seizures (<xref rid="DMM027045C33" ref-type="bibr">Siemen et al., 2011</xref>) and second, <italic>PUM</italic>2 expression is reduced in human patients suffering temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (<xref rid="DMM027045C41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We show here that overexpression of <italic>pum</italic> in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> flies is markedly anticonvulsant. By contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>pum</italic> exacerbates seizure. The likely beneficial effect of upregulation of Pum is through reduction of the voltage-gated persistent sodium current (I<sub>NaP</sub>) in central neurons. Thus, our results highlight mammalian Pum2 as a potential target for the design of novel, and possibly wide-spectrum, AEDs. To identify potential compounds that influence Pum activity and/or expression, we constructed a luciferase reporter of Pum activity and screened a comprehensive library of approved compounds. From 785 compounds, we identify 12 that potentiate Pum activity. Further analysis of one of these compounds, avobenzone, shows that it increases transcription of <italic>pum</italic>, reduces I<sub>NaP</sub> in identified motoneurons and is potently anticonvulsive in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RNA-sequencing identifies <italic>pum</italic> as downregulated in seizure</title><p>In order to determine changes to gene transcription that occur in seizure-prone CNSs, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare gene transcription in the CNS in two models of seizure: a genetic model (<italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>) and a chemical model (PTX).

We considered that manipulation of a homeostatic regulator might represent a promising approach to control seizure. To validate RNA-seq data, we undertook RT-qPCR; <italic>pum</italic> was significantly decreased in WT larval CNS after exposure to PTX (0.83&#177;0.03) and in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> (0.78&#177;0.03) compared with WT control (set as 1, <italic>P</italic>=0.03, <italic>n</italic>=5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM027045F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>B).

This increases the challenge to identify individual mutations, to determine the physiological role of both the WT and mutated protein and, ultimately, to design drugs to minimise the unwanted effect of the mutation. In this study, we identify transcriptional changes that occur in the seizure-prone CNS. We identify over 700 common genes that show altered transcription in two different seizure models. It is noteworthy that we observed approximately double the number of genes showing altered transcription in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> flies compared with those treated with PTX. The reason for this is unclear but might represent accumulated compensatory changes in the mutant line that have occurred in order to lessen the severity of seizure activity in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> mutants. These additional genes warrant further investigation as potential seizure suppressors.</p><p>Many of the common transcriptional changes we identify, and in particular those that are upregulated (and thus open to inhibition by drug exposure), might provide effective drug targets for novel AED design. However, our attention was drawn to Pum, which we have previously shown orchestrates homeostasis of action potential firing in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and rat central neurons (<xref rid="DMM027045C4" ref-type="bibr">Driscoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C19" ref-type="bibr">Mee et al., 2004</xref>).

Nevertheless, we show that upregulation of <italic>pum</italic> in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> seizure mutant is potently anticonvulsive and, further, we identify a potential lead anticonvulsive compound that seemingly increases the level of expression of this homeostatic regulator.

This raises the problem of specificity of effect following global potentiation of level or activity of Pum. This potential issue might, however, be overcome through identifying and targeting neuronal-specific regulators of Pum. One such alternative target might be the inhibition of Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2)-induced expression of miR-134 in neurons that, in turn, inhibits translation of mammalian PUM2 (<xref rid="DMM027045C6" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2009</xref>). Additional possibilities include targeting of cofactors required for Pum activity. It is interesting in this regard that a loss-of-function mutation in mei-P26, a homologue of Brat, produces strong seizure suppression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> bang-sensitive seizure mutants (<xref rid="DMM027045C9" ref-type="bibr">Glasscock et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian PUM2 binds transcripts encoding SCN1A (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1), and SCN8A (Na<sub>v</sub>1.6) (<xref rid="DMM027045C4" ref-type="bibr">Driscoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C38" ref-type="bibr">Vessey et al., 2010</xref>). A reduction in supply of Na<sub>v</sub> protein to the neuron membrane is consistent with a reduction in action potential firing and a general anticonvulsant effect (<xref rid="DMM027045C19" ref-type="bibr">Mee et al., 2004</xref>). Analysis of I<sub>Na</sub> in motoneurons indicates that a likely mechanism includes a marked reduction in I<sub>NaP</sub>. Increased I<sub>NaP</sub> is associated with mutations in <italic>SCN1A</italic> that have been identified from individuals with epilepsy (<xref rid="DMM027045C20" ref-type="bibr">Meisler and Kearney, 2005</xref>) and is specifically reduced by AEDs such as phenytoin, valproate and lamotrigine (<xref rid="DMM027045C36" ref-type="bibr">Stafstrom, 2007</xref>). In light of this, the anticonvulsant effect of increased <italic>pum</italic> expression is understandable. That reducing <italic>pum</italic> expression through RNAi-mediated knockdown is proconvulsive is again both predictable and understandable. However, the effect of this manipulation on I<sub>Na</sub> is not so clear. Rather than increasing I<sub>NaP</sub>, I<sub>NaT</sub> is instead significantly increased together with a novel appearance of resurgent I<sub>Na</sub> during repolarisation. Increased I<sub>NaT</sub> would be expected to reduce the threshold for action potential firing (i.e. making firing more likely), whereas resurgent I<sub>Na</sub> is associated with increased action potential firing frequency, partly by reducing the refractory period (<xref rid="DMM027045C10" ref-type="bibr">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>). Although we have observed this current component in recordings from seizure mutants (including <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>), it is rarely observed in WT or following expression of transgenic <italic>pum</italic>.</p><p>The ability to manipulate Pum <italic>in vivo</italic> to determine its anticonvulsive properties in rodent models of seizure will be greatly aided by the identification of chemical compounds that directly potentiate either expression or activity state. We report the use of a suitable cell-based screen to identify such compounds and highlight avobenzone as a potential lead compound for future development. The <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity of avobenzone has not been well established and although there are few reports of serious side effects associated with its use as an active ingredient of sunscreen, its tendency to form free radicals might be a potential issue. To our knowledge, this compound has not been used to treat neurological disease, and its mode of action in reducing seizure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains to be determined. Our observations that ingestion of avobenzone result in increased expression of <italic>pum</italic> is indicative that this compound might mimic elements of the pathway that control expression of this homeostatic regulator.</p><p>The output of our screen also provides additional support for the use of rapamycin to control seizure (<xref rid="DMM027045C15" ref-type="bibr">Lasarge and Danzer, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C29" ref-type="bibr">Russo et al., 2013</xref>), indicative that this molecule might influence neuronal homeostasis. The identification of topoisomerase II as a potential target to control seizure also validates previous observations reporting that inhibition of this class of nuclear protein is anticonvulsant (<xref rid="DMM027045C17" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="DMM027045C35" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, that we identify that the increase in Pum activity by aniracetam might hint at an additional mode of action for this class of known anticonvulsants (<xref rid="DMM027045C32" ref-type="bibr">Shiotani et al., 2000</xref>). The related racetams, levetiracetam and brivaracetam, are currently in clinical use as AEDs, exploiting their capability to bind and inhibit synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) (<xref rid="DMM027045C14" ref-type="bibr">Klitgaard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we present a description of transcriptional change present in seizure-prone CNS. We identify, in particular, that <italic>pum</italic> expression is downregulated in both genetic and chemically induced seizure models. This mirrors the reported reduction in PUM2 in human TLE and in rats exposed to the proconvulsant pilocarpine (<xref rid="DMM027045C41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). It also provides a possible understanding for why <italic>Pum</italic>2 null mice exhibit spontaneous seizures (<xref rid="DMM027045C33" ref-type="bibr">Siemen et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is perplexing that <italic>pum</italic> levels should decrease during seizures given that the published model predicts an increase (<xref rid="DMM027045C19" ref-type="bibr">Mee et al., 2004</xref>). As reduced Pum levels are predicted to increase neuronal excitability, it seems that epileptic seizures are associated with a pathological dysregulation of <italic>pum</italic> expression. We speculate that this occurs because Pum can auto-regulate (the <italic>pum</italic> transcript contains NRE motifs). Thus, although the neuronal hyperactivity induced by seizures will initially increase Pum expression, the accumulating Pum protein might feed back to downregulate its own transcript (<xref rid="DMM027045C8" ref-type="bibr">Gerber et al., 2006</xref>). Sampling at later stages after seizure occurrence might only report reduced Pum compared with non-seizure controls. Indeed, we have shown that upregulation of <italic>pum</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS, through expression of a wild-type transgene (lacking NRE motifs), results in reduction of endogenous <italic>pum</italic> transcript level (W.-H.L. and R.A.B., unpublished data). Prevention of this feedback, achievable in this study through expression of transgenic <italic>pum</italic> lacking an NRE, or exposure to avobenzone, holds significant promise for anticonvulsant therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Wild type (WT, maintained in the Baines lab) was Canton-S. <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> (<italic>bss<sup>1</sup></italic>), which was obtained from Dr Kevin O'Dell (Institute of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow, UK), is detailed in <xref rid="DMM027045C24" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al.
