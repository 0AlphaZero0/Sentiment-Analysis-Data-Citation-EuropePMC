(<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) published in the Anatolia Journal of Cardiology in late 2016 with great interest. We commend the authors for their contribution to impro-ving our understanding of sudden cardiac death mechanisms and suggesting potential reasons for occurrence of the condition of genetic origin. We do, however, have a number of thoughts about the study, which are outlined below.</p><p>The authors mentioned <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the sarcoglycan (<italic>SGCD</italic>) and titin (<italic>TTN</italic>) genes. The article fails to mention, ho- wever, the parent-based variant approach to analysis. In human genetic diseases, the term &#8220;<italic>de novo</italic> mutation&#8221; by definition refers to an alteration in a gene that is present for the first time in one family member as a result of a mutation in a germ cell of one of the parents or in the zygote itself. It is only by analyzing the parents that their true contribution to the disease burden can be proven (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, in the discussion section, the authors mentioned population frequencies of 2 variants using Exome Agg- regation Consortium (ExAC) browser data. If those variants are <italic>de novo</italic>, they should not be in genetic data browsers like ExAC (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, variant TTN:c.21758T&gt;C was previously identified by Pugh et al. (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The team reported this variant with a diffe- rent transcript (c.41249T&gt;C, p.Ile13750Thr NM_133378.4), and it has been identified in 5 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ranging in age from early infancy to mid 30s, with one individual in their 60s who has been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, as these variants were already identified by other research groups, they are no longer novel, as maintained in the current report.</p><p>Since only a single SGCD:c.15G&gt;C variant with unknown significance was identified, it is not very likely that the <italic>SGCD</italic> gene is implicated in the pathology of this case. According to general variant classification assertion criteria, homozygous mutant allele of rs549319429 is classified as &#8220;likely benign&#8221; variant [December 8, 2015; GeneDx Variant Classification (06012015)] (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing of <italic>TTN</italic> gene revealed heterozygote TTN:c. 21758T&gt;C. Pugh et al. (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) described effect of this variant on both DCM and HCM in 2014 (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, though SGCD:c.15G&gt;C variant may be benign, in combination with possible pathogenic variant, such as TTN:c.21758T&gt;C, clinical phenotype might produce an exponential effect.</p><p>To understand the certain effects of these variants on gene products, parent testing and co-segregation analyses should have been conducted before mentioning pathogenicity of the variants. Unfortunately, in the current article, it appears as though the authors have not completed any of these experiments.</p><p>Once again we would like to thank the authors and acknowledge their great efforts in presenting their case study. <italic>De novo</italic> mutation or pathogenicity of the variant family studies and segregation analysis should be conducted. Until these studies are completed the pathogenic effect of variants should not and cannot be mentioned.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baydar</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name><name><surname>&#214;zen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A case of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathic sudden cardiac death <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in <italic>TTN</italic> and <italic>SGGD</italic> genes</article-title><source>Anatol J Cardiol</source><year>2016</year><month>7</month><day>31</day><comment>Epub ahead of print</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Veltman</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Brunner</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>De novo</italic> mutations in human genetic disease</article-title><source>Nat Rev Genet</source><year>2012</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>565</fpage><lpage>75</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22805709</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org">http://exac.broadinstitute.org</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pugh</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gowrisankar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hynes</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Seidman</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Baxter</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The landscape of genetic variation in dilated cardiomyopathy as surveyed by clinical DNA sequencing</article-title><source>Genet Med</source><year>2014</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>601</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>General Variant Classification Assertion Criteria</collab><source>GeneDx DNA Diagnostic Experts</source><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.genedx.com">http://www.genedx.com</uri></comment></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
