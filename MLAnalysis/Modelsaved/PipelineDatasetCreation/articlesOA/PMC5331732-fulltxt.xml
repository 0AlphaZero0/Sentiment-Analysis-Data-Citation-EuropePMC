Of great interest is the observation that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure improves both fasting and dynamic measures of glucose homeostasis well before significant weight loss, resulting in the concept that RYGB surgery &#8220;cures diabetes&#8221; through mechanism(s) that are separable from weight loss itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] possible weight lost independent mechanisms include the significant caloric restriction that reduces hepatic and pancreatic fat, the exclusion of nutrients from the duodenum, and the more rapid entry of nutrients into the distal small intestine with concomitant increased release of bile acids and gut hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). While it is likely that no one mechanism is solely responsible for the acute improvements in glucose homeostasis, studies designed to test each mechanism independently often require post-surgery patients to engage in ingestive behavior that is not congruent with the intent of the surgery, such as consuming large caloric loads that match pre-surgery intake and which do not reflect the behavioral responses that occur post-surgery.</p><p>Mixed meal tolerance tests are often used to assess dynamic measures of glucose homeostasis because they are a physiologically relevant challenge that mimics the free living condition. In the bariatric literature many studies use commercially available liquid mixed meals with varied macronutrient content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a liquid meal may not induce all the postprandial effects of solid meal consumption. For example, it has been argued that liquids are not as effective as solids in inducing cephalic phase responses in insulin or pancreatic polypeptide release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Liquids require less oral processing, have more rapid gastric-emptying and orocecal transit times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and evoke lower expected satiation in non-bariatric subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cognitive manipulations of energy content and portion size can also significantly influence appetitive ratings and subsequent energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with the perceived energy content of a food better predicting self-reported appetitive sensations than the true energy content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Finally, it has been shown that the cognitive and sensory effects of food form alter ingestive behavior with oral-liquid and perceived gastric-liquid preloads eliciting greater postprandial hunger and lower fullness sensations, more rapid gastric-emptying and orocecal transit times, attenuated insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 release, and lower ghrelin suppression than did responses after oral-solid and perceived gastric-solid treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we utilized a solid mixed meal to examine the effect of RYGB surgery to alter the behavioral and metabolic response to caloric challenge at 2 and 4&#160;weeks post-surgery in subjects with short duration type 2 diabetes. We also assessed acute changes in fasting glucose, lipids, betatrophin (as a marker of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) and gut hormones over the same time period. Our goal was to examine metabolic responses to caloric intake that mimicked real life conditions following RYGB surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eighteen women scheduled for RYGB surgery were recruited, with 17 completing the full study.

Diabetes was managed either by lifestyle modification (drug na&#239;ve), oral medications, or with insulin (maximum daily total dose&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;50 units). Injectable GLP-1 analogs or oral DPP-4 inhibitors were discontinued at least 1&#160;week prior to pre-surgery visit.

Total GLP-1 was measured by radioimmunoassay (Millipore [Billerica, MA]; within CV&#8201;=&#8201;22%, between CV&#8201;=&#8201;23% at 20pM), active GLP-1 by Meso Scale Electrochemiluminescence ([Rockville, MD]; within CV&#8201;=&#8201;9.3%, between CV&#8201;=&#8201;3.6% at 0.7 and 1.3 pM respectively), and pancreatic peptide YY (PYY) by ELISA (Millipore [Billerica, MA]; within CV&#8201;=&#8201;2.66%, between CV =6.93% at 9.7 pM). For active GLP-1, values at the limit of detection were assigned a value of 0.65, the lowest standard in the assay. Measures made on samples from the 5 subjects in the pilot effort on pudding volume were done in the Considine lab at Indiana University.

In contrast active GLP-1 increased significantly during the two post-surgery challenges, peaking at 30&#160;min and returning to baseline by 120&#160;min. The incremental AUC for active GLP-1 was significantly greater at 2 and 4&#160;weeks post-surgery as was AUC<sub>I</sub> for total GLP-1. Fasting PYY was significantly reduced at 1&#160;week post-surgery (35.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.2 vs 23.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.0 pmol/L; <italic>P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001).

As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, glucose was elevated at the start of both meal tests, and exhibited a flat response curve similar to that of the bariatric subjects pre-surgery (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Also as observed for the pre-surgery subjects, insulin levels peaked at 60&#160;min and did not return to baseline at 120&#160;min with either pudding volume. C-peptide response was the same with both pudding volumes and did not exhibit a trend for return to baseline at 120&#160;min. Insulinogenic index calculated using the change in insulin (0.50&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.26 vs 0.48&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.14&#160;nmol/mmol) or C-peptide (0.82&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.4 vs 2.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.2&#160;nmol/mmol) was not significantly different by pudding volume. Glucose AUC<sub>total</sub> was slightly less with consumption of 2 oz of pudding compared to that following 4 oz (19890&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3918 vs 20971&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4144&#160;mg/dl x min respectively; <italic>P&#8201;=&#8201;0.016</italic>), but remained comparable to that observed for the pre-surgery meal test. C-peptide AUC<sub>total</sub> (415&#8201;&#177;&#8201;36 vs 443&#8201;&#177;&#8201;71&#160;ng/ml x min) and insulin AUC<sub>total</sub> (4153&#8201;&#177;&#8201;515 vs 7046&#8201;&#177;&#8201;154 uU/ml x min) were not statistically different by pudding volume, although the lower insulin excursion with the 2 oz meal suggests greater insulin clearance. There was no difference in AUC<sub>total</sub> for hunger (5313&#8201;&#177;&#8201;985 vs 3981&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1349), how much subjects could eat (7029&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1639 vs 6336&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1680), fullness (5754&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1553 vs 6717&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1149) or satisfaction (6972&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1709 vs 9021&#8201;&#177;&#8201;739) with consumption of 2 or 4 oz of pudding. These data indicate that in the absence of surgery, consuming a meal of smaller volume does not improve the glycemic, insulin secretory or behavioral response to a test meal in obese subjects with diabetes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Reductions in meal size do not normalize the glycemic and hormonal response to caloric challenge in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

There were significant reductions in fasting glucose and insulin, with a significant increase in hepatic insulin clearance, as early as 3&#160;days after surgery. Fasting betatrophin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL were significantly decreased post-surgery. Subjects exhibited less hunger, lower expectation of the amount of food they could eat, and greater feelings of fullness and satisfaction during the meal test following surgery, at which they consumed ~50% less calories. Insulinogenic index and AUC for glucose and insulin were significantly lower at 2&#160;weeks post-surgery. GLP-1 and PYY response to the meal was significantly increased post-surgery. The improvement in metabolic responses to the meal challenge following surgery could not be replicated by simply reducing meal volume in similar subjects who did not undergo surgery.</p><p>Acute reductions within the first post-operative week in fasting measures of glucose homeostasis support the suggestion that bariatric surgery ameliorates diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and this effect appears to be primarily driven by changes in hepatic metabolism. Increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, decreased hepatic glucose production and increased hepatic insulin clearance have all been observed within the first post-operative month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], beginning as early as 1&#160;week following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Several studies suggest that the improvement in hepatic metabolism is primarily due to the caloric restriction rather than the surgery per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However it is important to note that the degree of caloric restriction following RYGB surgery is difficult to achieve and maintain in the non-surgical population. Our data showing that subjects exhibited less hunger, lower expectation of the amount of food they could eat, and greater feelings of fullness and satisfaction in the fasting state support the efficacy of RYGB surgery to reduce caloric intake. It should be noted that the consumption of a low glycemic liver reduction diet prior to surgery was not sufficient to normalize hepatic metabolism to that attained following RYGB surgery.</p><p>Fasting triglycerides and total cholesterol significantly improved beginning at 2&#160;weeks post-surgery, with a significant reduction in HDL at 1&#160;week following surgery. A recent meta-analysis of data from 7815 subjects that underwent RYGB surgery found that, although heterogeneity among the studies included was high, triglycerides were significantly reduced by 3&#160;months, total cholesterol and LDL by 1&#160;month, and that HDL was unchanged until an increase at 1&#160;year post-surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The acute improvement in lipids observed here can likely be attributed to both reduced food intake, and reduced lipid absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Betatrophin, or angiopoietin-like protein 8, is expressed in human liver and adipose tissue, is present in the circulation, and is involved in triglyceride metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Preclinical studies had suggested that betatrophin promoted &#946;-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] but this work has recently been retracted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Betatrophin has also been suggested to be a marker of insulin resistance, although the nature of the relationship (positive or negative) is controversial, likely due to small differences in circulating protein across populations of different adiposity or diabetic status, and to differences in the commercially available human betatrophin assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the current study we observed a small but significant reduction in fasting betatrophin at 2&#160;weeks post-surgery, suggesting that betatrophin is increased in the diabetic state and reduced with normalization of insulin levels, although there was no correlation between betatrophin and fasting glucose, insulin or triglycerides. It is important to note that the assay used here employs an antibody targeted to the carboxy terminus of betatrophin, which has been shown to detect both full length and carboxy-terminal cleavage fragments of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus the reduction in betatrophin observed here is unlikely to be due to increased degradation of protein. A recent study has shown that insulin infusion increases adipocyte betatrophin expression in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus it is possible that the reduction in circulating insulin following bariatric surgery decreases the signal for betatrophin production in adipose tissue.</p><p>In response to solid meal test following surgery, subjects experienced less hunger, lower expectation of the amount of food they could eat, and greater feelings of fullness and satisfaction, coincident with consumption of only 50% of the meal provided. Given that the volumes of liquid meal tests used in the bariatric literature range from 100 to more than 400 mls [5&#8211;9 and others] it is note-worthy that subjects in the current study only comfortably consumed about 70 mls following surgery. Factors that likely contributed to this outcome include the high protein content of the pudding, the slower more deliberate act of eating the pudding with a spoon, and individual perception that the pudding would be &#8220;filling&#8221;. These important characteristics contribute to the success of bariatric surgery to limit caloric intake, and support dietary recommendations for this population to limit beverage intake to low or no calorie liquids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Insulinogenic index, a dynamic measure of glucose homeostasis was significantly lower at 2&#160;weeks post-surgery. Insulinogenic index has been shown to reflect meal size in normal weight subjects, doubling with a two fold increase in Kcal ingested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We did not observe a difference in insulinogenic index in the non-surgical diabetic subjects consuming the two different pudding volumes, suggesting that the insulin secretory response was not properly responsive to glucose load in those subjects. Our observations suggest that following surgery the dynamic response to glucose ingestion was improved.</p><p>Greater post- than pre-surgery insulin and C-peptide excursions are generally observed when consuming large volume liquid mixed meals, resulting in an increase in post-surgery insulinogenic index (for example see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). This observation has been interpreted to reflect an improved response to glucose ingestion, although such a response is unlikely to occur given the reduction in food intake per meal following surgery. Despite a 50% reduction in caloric stimulus post-surgery, we observed similar insulin/C-peptide release over the first 30&#160;min pre- and post-surgery, suggesting that there was an increase in insulin and C-peptide release per caloric unit consumed, likely promoted by the significant increase in secretion of GLP-1.</p><p>Insulin AUC, but not that for C-peptide, was lower during the meal test post-surgery, indicating greater insulin clearance by the liver. Reductions in fasting and dynamic hyperinsulinema contribute to improved insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue, which has been documented to occur in parallel with weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Lower fasting glucose and smaller glucose response to caloric challenge contribute to improved insulin sensitivity via reduced glucotoxicity in insulin target tissues. Importantly, the improvements in glucose homeostasis observed here were not achieved by simply reducing the quantity and volume of test meal ingested, as shown in the diabetic subjects that did not undergo surgery.</p><p>GLP-1 and PYY release during the meal test were greatly increased following surgery, as has been observed in a number of studies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). The enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and PYY resulting from the rapid transit of calories to the lower small intestine likely contributed to the reduction in food intake via their satiating effects on gut function and the central nervous system. The incretin effect of GLP-1 would be expected to result in greater insulin secretion during the meal test. Our observation that C-peptide release in response to the post-surgery meal test was unchanged, despite ingestion of half of the caloric load, suggests that GLP-1 did have an effect to promote greater insulin release, which was subsequently and efficiently cleared from the circulation by the liver.</p><p>A recent study in a small number of post-RYGB surgery subjects noted that a liquid meal induced greater increases in insulin and gut peptides than did a solid meal of similar caloric content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This likely reflected the much faster absorption of calories provided by the liquid meal. We did not compare responses between solid and liquid meals as our intent, in contrast to that of Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], was not to determine a superior test method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary we observed significant improvements in both fasting and dynamic metabolic measures following RYGB surgery in subjects with short duration diabetes. The use of a solid mixed meal test in this study permitted demonstration of improved glycemic responses to a meal challenge under the naturalistic conditions of reduced caloric intake experienced by bariatric surgery subjects. The metabolic improvements achieved with RYGB cannot be achieved by simply reducing food intake as demonstrated in non-surgical subjects.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP-1</term><def><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMTT</term><def><p>Mixed meal tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PYY</term><def><p>Pancreatic polypeptide YY</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RYGB</term><def><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the subjects that participated in this study, as well as the nursing staff at Community Hospital North and IU Health North Hospital.
