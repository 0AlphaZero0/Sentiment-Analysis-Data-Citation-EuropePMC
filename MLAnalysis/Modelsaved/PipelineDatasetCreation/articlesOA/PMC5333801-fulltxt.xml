Current Nrf2 activators, however, may exert toxicity and pathway over-activation can induce detrimental effects. An understanding of the mechanisms mediating Nrf2 inhibition in neurodegenerative conditions may therefore direct the design of drugs targeted for the prevention of these diseases with minimal side-effects. Our study provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that specific inhibition of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, can prevent neuronal toxicity in response to the AD-initiating A&#946;42 peptide, in correlation with Nrf2 activation. Comparatively, lithium, an inhibitor of the Nrf2 suppressor GSK-3, prevented A&#946;42 toxicity by mechanisms independent of Nrf2. A new direct inhibitor of the Keap1-Nrf2 binding domain also prevented synaptotoxicity mediated by naturally-derived A&#946; oligomers in mouse cortical neurons. Overall, our findings highlight Keap1 specifically as an efficient target for the re-activation of Nrf2 in AD, and support the further investigation of direct Keap1 inhibitors for the prevention of neurodegeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>As our population ages the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD), is predicted to increase dramatically. Despite providing important symptomatic relief, existing treatments for such conditions do not slow-down disease progression, and this will cause an overwhelming future burden on our healthcare system and immense suffering for many more patients and their families. Nrf2 is a gene that normally protects cells from stressful conditions. Although we don&#8217;t know why, Nrf2 is reduced in the brains of AD patients and this may explain the increased susceptibility of neurons to damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research, using a fruit fly model, identifies Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, as a valid target for the rescue of AD-related Nrf2 defects and the subsequent prevention of neuronal degeneration. Moreover, we show that a new compound, which directly blocks the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1, can prevent toxicity of the AD-initiating A&#946; peptide in mouse neurons. Hence, our study provides strong evidence that direct Keap1-Nrf2 disruptors can specifically target the defects in Nrf2 activity observed in neurodegenerative diseases, and supports the further development of such compounds as potential new drugs to prevent neuronal decline AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002283</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ART-2009-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid" authenticated="false">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9615-0094</contrib-id><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT098565/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid" authenticated="false">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9615-0094</contrib-id><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>FK and LP and are funded by Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK (ARUK; ART-2009-4).

Activation of these protective genes in response to Nrf2 enables the cell to maintain redox balance and to remove damaged proteins under conditions of oxidative and xenobiotic stress.</p><p>Such cellular stress is a key feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. Markers of oxidative damage are increased in the brains of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD)[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD)[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD)[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and, in CSF, of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some evidence also suggests that AD, PD and ALS patients have reduced xenobiotic metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and that the AD-causing A&#946;42 peptide may act as a xenobiotic[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As Nrf2 is inhibited in several neurodegenerative diseases[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and ALS[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as in APP/PS1 mutant mouse models of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], deficits in this important cellular protection pathway may, in part, explain the cellular damage associated with these conditions. Conversely, Nrf2 over-expression protects against toxicity induced by the A&#946;42 peptide in mammalian cells[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and prevents neuronal pathology in mouse models of ALS[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], PD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Activation of Nrf2 is, therefore, increasingly implicated as an attractive target for the prevention of several neurodegenerative conditions.</p><p>Potent activators of Nrf2 have been developed[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and confer protection against chemically-induced neurotoxic insults[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and improve memory deficits in mouse models of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Many of these Nrf2 activators, however, have been reported to exert toxicity due to off-target effects[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>][<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, unregulated activation of Nrf2 can have detrimental consequences, with prolonged, ubiquitous activation shortening lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and mutations in the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1) causing cancer in humans[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which Nrf2 function is inhibited in neurodegenerative disease may enable the design of drugs targeted for the prevention of these conditions with minimal side-effects.</p><p>Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by two main inhibitors, Keap1 and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3)[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006593.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). GSK-3 plays a well-established role in the pathogenesis of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and GSK-3 inhibitors, including lithium, prevent pathology in animal models of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], ALS[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and PD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Emerging evidence also suggests that inhibiting Keap1 can ameliorate neuronal degeneration, with Keap1 RNA interference (RNAi) protecting against A&#946;42[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and MPTP[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] toxicity in cells, and heterozygous loss of Keap1 protecting against neuronal pathology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of PD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both GSK-3 and Keap1 may, therefore, serve as valid candidates for mediating the inhibition of Nrf2 in neurodegenerative diseases, and their inhibition may enable the prevention of Nrf2 deficits, neuronal stress and degeneration specifically in these conditions. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of their inhibition in rescuing Nrf2 deficits in neurodegenerative diseases specifically, however, is required.</p><p>We aimed therefore to investigate the role of Nrf2 in mediating the protective effects of GSK-3 and Keap1 inhibition against A&#946;42 toxicity. Using an inducible <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we confirmed that A&#946;42 inhibits activity of the fly homolog of Nrf2 (cap-n-collar isoform C, cncC[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) in neurons, consistent with previous findings in mice[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both inhibition of GSK-3, using lithium, and loss-of-function mutations in Keap1 protected against A&#946;42 toxicity in this model. We found, however, that neuronal protection in response to Keap1 inhibition correlates with the rescue of A&#946;42-induced Nrf2 defects, whereas lithium treatment appears to exert neuro-protection independently of Nrf2.</p><p>Consistent with Nrf2 activation, Keap1 inhibition prevented the enhanced sensitivity of A&#946;42-expressing flies to xenobiotic stress, but exerted minimal protection against oxidative damage in comparison to lithium treatment. Combined modulation of Keap1 and lithium additively protected against A&#946;42 toxicity, in comparison with either treatment alone, but did not improve their respective effects on xenobiotic and oxidative damage. This further supports the divergent beneficial effects of these manipulations.

These effects occur in correlation with prevention of xenobiotic and, to a lesser extent, oxidative damage as well as the degradation of endogenous, aggregated, A&#946;42 peptide.</p><p>Using primary cortical neurons, our findings further confirm that direct pharmacological inhibition of Keap1-Nrf2 binding can protect against neuronal damage downstream of extracellular A&#946;42 oligomers. The mechanisms by which reducing Keap1 enhances degradation of A&#946; <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, requires further investigation. Autophagy, as measured by cleavage of ATG8, was unaltered in response to Keap1 inhibition in our A&#946;42 expressing flies. Consistent with the established effect of Nrf2 on transcription of proteasome subunits[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], loss of Keap1 enhanced proteasome activity in A&#946;42 flies, but blocking this increase, using the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, did not prevent the reduction in A&#946;42 levels. This suggests that the reduction of aggregated A&#946;42 in response to Keap1 inhibition may not be directly mediated via enhanced autophagy or proteasomal degradation. Nrf2 has also been implicated to play a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), serving as a target for PERK[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and activating transcription of several components of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], including chaperones and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, in addition to proteasome subunits and autophagy. Future studies will therefore be required to investigate the functional role of such protein quality control pathways, potentially upstream of the proteasome and autophagy, in the clearance of A&#946;42 following Keap1 inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Overall, our data point to Keap1, in comparison with GSK-3, as an efficient target for Nrf2 activation in response to A&#946;42 toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recent advances in the development of direct inhibitors of the Keap1-Nrf2 binding domain may, therefore, enable the prevention of Nrf2 deficits in neurodegenerative diseases with minimal side-effects. Our study shows for the first time that a direct, small molecule inhibitor of Keap1-Nrf2 binding, 22h[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], can ameliorate synaptotoxicity in response to naturally-derived A&#946; oligomers in mouse cortical neurons. As synaptic loss correlates well with cognitive decline[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], our work suggests that these compounds show promise as therapeutic agents for AD. Moreover, as this is the first demonstration that these compounds can prevent neuronal toxicity, our findings warrant their investigation in other neurodegenerative conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Combined benefits of Keap1 and GSK-3 inhibition for AD?</title><p>Both GSK-3 inhibitors[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and Nrf2 activators[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] can exert toxicity due to off-target effects and thus it is important that modifiers of these pathways achieve therapeutic benefits at low doses. More specific inhibitors of each of these targets are currently being developed[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It has also been postulated that combined inhibition of both GSK-3 and Keap1 may activate Nrf2, and confer protection, at lower doses than either intervention alone, hence limiting their detrimental effects[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We present the first <italic>in vivo</italic> study showing that combined Keap1 and GSK-3 inhibition, by lithium, confers additive protective effects against A&#946;42 toxicity. Keap1 deletion and lithium treatment extended lifespan and improved climbing ability of A&#946;42-expressing flies to a greater extent than either manipulation alone. Additionally, reducing Keap1 limits the dose of lithium required to reach maximal levels of protection since heterozygous Keap1<sup>del</sup> combined with low dose (25 mM) lithium extended lifespan of A&#946;42 flies to a similar extent as high dose (50 mM) lithium alone. Our data, however, do not predict that these additive protective effects are due to mechanisms converging on Nrf2. Rather, low dose lithium treatment exerts protective effects independently of Nrf2 activation, whereas the neuroprotective effects of Keap1 inhibition correlate strongly with increasing Nrf2. Hence, the additive nature of combined lithium and Keap1 inhibition appears to be mediated through divergent, complementary protective mechanisms.</p><p>Oxidative[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and xenobiotic damage[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are key features of AD brain and may potentially be explained by the down-regulation of Nrf2, which is also observed in several neurodegenerative diseases. Consistent with this idea, Keap1 inhibition and, therefore, Nrf2/cncC activation, correlated strongly with protection against A&#946;42-induced sensitivity to the xenobiotic DDT in our fly model. Conversely, Keap1 inhibition exerted minimal protection against oxidative damage in comparison with lithium treatment, which strongly protected against A&#946;42-induced sensitivity to both paraquat and hyperoxia-induced damage. As therapeutic concentrations of lithium, which can prevent oxidative damage, did not strongly activate Nrf2/cncC in our flies, this suggests that rescue of Nrf2 activity is not required to protect against oxidative damage in response to A&#946;42. Although pharmacological activation of Nrf2, has been shown to protect against oxidative damage, in response to A&#946;42 peptide, in cells[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and in animal models of AD[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], conflicting reports have also described protective effects against such damage that are mediated independently of Nrf2[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Moreover, studies showing protection against A&#946;42-induced oxidative damage in response to GSK-3 inhibition, using antisense oligonucleotides[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and in response to lithium[<xref rid="pgen.1006593.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], have not demonstrated a causal role of increasing Nrf2 activity. Our direct comparison of Keap1 and GSK-3 pathways, however, reveals that Nrf2 activity and prevention of A&#946;42-induced oxidative damage do not strongly correlate.</p><p>Finally, combining lithium treatment with manipulation of Keap1 did not confer additional protection against oxidative and xenobiotic damage respectively. Overall this suggests that Keap1 and lithium treatment combine to maximise protection against AD-phenotypes, through divergent effects on Nrf2 and by additively protecting against A&#946;42-induced oxidative and xenobiotic damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006593.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings provide compelling support for the use of direct Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD.
