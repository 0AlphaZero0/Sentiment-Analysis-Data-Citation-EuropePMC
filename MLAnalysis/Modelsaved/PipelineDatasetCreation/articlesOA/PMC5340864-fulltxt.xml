However, most of these experiments study growth in defined and/or constant environments. We hypothesized that while there would likely continue to be parallelism in more complex and changing environments, there would also be more variation in what types of mutations would benefit the cells. In order to test our hypothesis, we serially passaged <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in a complex medium (Luria-Bertani broth) throughout the five phases of bacterial growth. This passaging scheme allowed cells to experience a wide variety of stresses, including nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and pH variation, and therefore allowed them to adapt to several conditions. After every ~30 generations of growth, for a total of ~300 generations, we compared both the growth phenotypes and genotypes of aged populations to the parent population. After as few as 30 generations, populations exhibit changes in growth phenotype and accumulate potentially adaptive mutations. There were many genes with mutant alleles in different populations, indicating potential parallel evolution. We examined 8 of these alleles by constructing the point mutations in the parental genetic background and competed those cells with the parent population; five of these alleles were found to be adaptive. The variety and swiftness of adaptive mutations arising in the populations indicate that the cells are adapting to a complex set of stresses, while the parallel nature of several of the mutations indicates that this behavior may be generalized to bacterial evolution.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> With a growing body of work directed toward understanding the mechanisms of evolution using experimental systems, it is crucial to decipher what effects the experimental setup has on the outcome.

Recent studies have specifically probed how <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> becomes laboratory adapted (or domesticated) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) as well as how <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> adapts to specific challenges, for instance, nutrient stress (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), acid stress (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), or antibiotic stress (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These studies have allowed researchers to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of evolution on a practical time scale (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To date, these experimental evolution systems generally use defined minimal medium (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) during serial passage and/or constant conditions in chemostats (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and therefore may not fully represent the complexity of the adaptive landscapes that <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> may experience in heterogeneous environments (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The broad metabolic capacity of <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> allows for growth in a variety of environments in the laboratory, and it can survive in batch culture for days, weeks, or even years without the addition of nutrients (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The typical laboratory life cycle in long-term batch culture consists of five phases, the first three of which are well characterized and commonly studied in the laboratory: lag phase, when cells physiologically adapt to new conditions; log or exponential phase, during which cells have a constant generation time and are presumably under very-low-stress to no-stress conditions; and stationary phase, when cells reach their peak viable cell count, which remains steady for hours to days. The fourth and fifth phases are usually reached during long-term laboratory growth in batch culture. Death phase follows stationary phase, when viable cell counts decrease by &gt;99%. After death phase, the population may enter the fifth phase, &#8220;long-term stationary phase&#8221; (LTSP). This phase is similar to stationary phase in that the total number of cells remains roughly constant, although at a lower concentration than in stationary phase. However, this phase is distinct from stationary phase in that the relatively constant density is accompanied by significant shifts in subpopulations within the culture, which likely correlate with changing, heterogeneous conditions (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Survival of cells better suited to their particular environment during LTSP leads to selection of beneficial mutant alleles (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), referred to as growth-advantage-in-stationary-phase (GASP) mutations (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These LTSP-adapted mutants can outcompete parent cells in fresh medium, reflecting adaptive evolution within these populations.</p><p>Here, we show that adaptation can occur in relatively few generations if populations are allowed to enter LTSP before passage. We found that after as few as 30 generations (three long-term serial passages) in rich medium, the LTSP survival profiles of the populations had changed, and these cells were better adapted to their environment. This is rapid compared to other examples of experimental evolution in which fitness effects are usually observed after several thousand generations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Using whole-genome resequencing of adapted populations, we identified many potential adaptive mutations. There were several instances where different mutations appeared in the same gene in parallel passaged populations, giving potential evidence of parallel evolution and an indication that these genes may be important for adaptation. We show that mutations found in the genes <italic>cytR</italic>, <italic>sspA</italic>, and <italic>tolC</italic> confer a growth advantage during competition with the wild-type (WT) parent, while other mutations identified do not. We believe that with this method of long-term adaptation, we (i) demonstrate how quickly populations of <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> can adapt when presented with multiple selective pressures (nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and pH variation), along with the heterogeneity that exists during LTSP in complex medium, and (ii) identify physiological processes or metabolic regulatory pathways that are potentially more broadly important for adaptation and evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>Long-term serially passaged <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> adapts to LTSP.</title><p>We set out to determine if allowing a population of <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> to incubate through all five phases of the laboratory life cycle would result in the selection of mutants with altered growth phenotypes.

For our long-term serial passaging scheme, we incubated the cells in the rich medium LB in flasks with shaking for 4&#160;days, a time at which cells are at their lowest density since lag phase, and then serially passaged the cells into fresh medium at a dilution of 1:1,000 (vol/vol), resulting in ~10 generations of growth per passage. We performed 30 of these passages (~300 generations total) in triplicate and after every third passage (~30 generations) saved 1% of the population in frozen stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>). This serial passaging scheme is distinct from more traditional daily serial passage, where cells are allowed only to enter early stationary phase; therefore, we refer to the scheme here as &#8220;long-term serial passage&#8221; experiments.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;1&#160;</label><caption><p>Diagram of passage scheme.

Since there are likely many genotypes present in these cultures at any given time, samples of the entire population were sequenced, instead of single clones picked from each population. This allowed us to identify all of the alleles present above a threshold frequency in each population. Our threshold for calling a mutation was its appearance on each DNA strand at least 3 times; with read depths averaging ~300&#215; for each base sequenced, this procedure results in the detection of mutations present at a threshold of at least 1% of the total population.

The basal mutation frequency in these cultures is ~1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> mutations/bp replicated (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), which means that there are ~4.6 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> mutations in these 4.6 &#215; 10<sup>16</sup>&#160;bp. Since the <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> genome is 4.6 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>&#160;bp, this suggests that every (nonlethal) mutation may already be present in the population at least once. Therefore, it is impossible to initiate an experiment with no diversity already present in the culture at inoculation densities above ~1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup>&#160;CFU/ml. Further, this means that all the diversity needed for selection may be generated in the initial outgrowth of this experiment and then selected during each subsequent growth cycle and passage. However, it is equally likely that new variants are generated during each passage.</p><p>Several genes or pathways acquired different mutations in separate passaged populations: <italic>cytR</italic> (regulator of nucleoside transport and utilization) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), <italic>pitA</italic> and <italic>ybaL</italic> (encoding demonstrated [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and predicted [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] P<sub>i</sub> transport proteins, respectively), <italic>proQ</italic> and <italic>putA</italic> (proline transport [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and proline dehydrogenase and transcription factor [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], respectively), <italic>sspA</italic> (stringent response protein) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), <italic>sucC</italic> (&#946; subunit of succinyl coenzyme A [CoA] synthetase) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and <italic>acrA</italic> and <italic>tolC</italic> (TolC-AcrAB multidrug efflux transport system) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#160;3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#160;1</xref>). Using the multiple alleles of <italic>tolC</italic> as an example, <italic>tolC</italic>(I128S) is present by P9 in population A at a frequency of 90% and remains at 90% to 100% frequency through P30, indicating that it is likely under positive selection. <italic>tolC</italic>(Y415D) is present in population B, starting with passage 6 at a frequency of 20% and increasing to ~30% in P9 but then decreasing to &lt;10% after that. These data may indicate that there is positive selection for one <italic>tolC</italic> allele and not the other or perhaps suggest that in populations B and C (where there are several other low-frequency alleles), other mutations provide a greater adaptive advantage than the <italic>tolC</italic> mutants; further testing is required to distinguish between these possibilities (see below).</p><p>In each population, we can begin to see the dynamics of mutations that were occurring during passage. Since we did not sequence individual clones, we cannot determine which mutations are present on the same chromosome. However, if two or more mutations are present in the population at a frequency of greater than 50%, this would indicate cosegregation of mutant alleles in at least a subset of cells. For example, by P6 (60 generations) in population A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#160;3A</xref>), ~50% of the population has the <italic>proQ</italic>(A18P) mutation; however, by P9 (another 30 generations), this population of cells is almost completely supplanted by cells with three mutations: <italic>tolC</italic>(I128S), <italic>pitA</italic>(I29L), or <italic>rpsL</italic>. It is likely that the vast majority of, if not all, cells in the population have all three of these mutations, because they are each present at such a high frequency. Starting at P15, a subset of this population acquires a fourth mutation in the intergenic region 149&#160;bp upstream of <italic>rpoS</italic> and then acquires a <italic>sucC</italic> mutation by P18 and an <italic>acpP</italic> mutation by P24. By the time of the last passage (P30), it is likely that the majority of cells in the population have acquired all six mutations. We know that some combination of these mutations is likely responsible for the adaptive phenotype that we see with passaged strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2</xref>), but further analysis was needed to identify precisely which mutations confer the adaptive phenotype and if any epistatic effects are relevant.</p><p>We were particularly interested in the mutations found in the <italic>cytR</italic> gene because CytR, in combination with cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), can repress utilization of nucleosides (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). One could imagine that a derepression of this activity might lead to a fitness advantage over wild-type cells in LTSP, because those cells could use nucleic acids, which are likely present at high concentrations after death phase, as a nutrient source (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Further, unique mutant alleles of <italic>cytR</italic> were detected in all three passaged populations, and in population B, there are two alleles present at a frequency of at least 50% at some point. <italic>cytR</italic>(S276P) is present at 17% by passage 3, increases to 50% by passage 15, and then decreases through passage 21 until it is no longer present in the population. Simultaneously, another allele, <italic>cytR</italic>(Y206D), was present at 72% by passage 3, slightly decreased during P9 to P15 [the same passages during which <italic>cytR</italic>(S276P) increased], and then increased again until it was present at &gt;90% of the population by passage 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#160;3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1.3"><title>Individual point mutations in <italic>cytR</italic>, <italic>sspA</italic>, and <italic>tolC</italic> confer an advantage in long-term cultures.</title><p>Since the two <italic>cytR</italic> alleles in population B seem to be in competition with each other in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#160;3B</xref>), we wished to determine if they conferred a competitive advantage in competition with either the parental strain or each other. Isogenic strains with these mutant alleles were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Each <italic>cytR</italic> mutant was competed with the parent in the same long-term serial passage scheme in which the mutations were initially isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>). Even after one passage, corresponding to 4&#160;days of incubation, the <italic>cytR</italic> mutants have a strong selective advantage over wild-type cells with both <italic>cytR</italic> mutants present at 10-fold-higher viable counts than the wild-type parent. By the third passage, the <italic>cytR</italic> mutant cells outnumber wild-type parents by ~10,000:1. When competed against each other in the long-term (4-day) serial passage scheme, the two mutant strains show no fitness differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4E</xref>), indicating that <italic>cytR</italic>(S276P) might have lost out to <italic>cytR</italic>(Y206D) in population B due to stochastic effects. Alternatively, the <italic>cytR</italic>(Y206D) allele may have been present on the chromosome with other mutations that modulated that particular strain&#8217;s fitness.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;4&#160;</label><caption><p><italic>cytR</italic> mutant versus parent strain competition.

To address this, we performed more traditional serial passage competitions where cultures were passaged daily instead of every 4&#160;days. This is likely more representative of how laboratory strains of <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> are generally treated. Interestingly, after 3 passages performed every day, the parent strain has reached a density ~10-fold higher than both <italic>cytR</italic> mutants, indicating that wild-type cells have an advantage in this passaging scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#160;4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>). Therefore, the advantage of the <italic>cytR</italic> mutants is expressed only in long-term stationary-phase cultures; those same mutations lead to a disadvantage during standard stationary-phase incubation. These data also suggest that daily serial passage in LB would lead to very different adaptive phenotypes than our long-term serial passage scheme.</p><p>Site-directed mutants of both <italic>sspA</italic> alleles and, to a lesser degree, the <italic>tolC</italic>(I128S) allele produced results similar to the <italic>cytR</italic> alleles in that the mutant cells have an advantage over wild-type cells [~1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup>-fold higher for <italic>sspA</italic>(L164R), ~1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>-fold higher for <italic>sspA</italic>(D19Y), and ~100-fold higher for <italic>tolC</italic>(I28S) on passage 2] in the 4-day passaging scheme but not in the 1-day passaging scheme [WT is ~10-fold higher than <italic>sspA</italic>(L164R), ~2 to 10-fold higher than <italic>sspA</italic>(D19Y), and ~10-fold higher than <italic>tolC</italic>(I28S) mutants, respectively] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#160;S2</xref>). However, the mutations in <italic>putA</italic>, <italic>pitA</italic>, and <italic>sucC</italic> do not confer any advantage (data not shown), indicating that either they need to be present with another mutation to confer an advantage or they do not make a difference to cells and might have been present by chance. <italic>In silico</italic> studies have suggested that when the environment varies on the same time scale as mutation occurrence, as it likely does in our system, nonbeneficial mutations are just as likely, or even sometimes more likely, to become fixed in a population than beneficial mutations (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, in the population A example above, the <italic>tolC</italic> mutation might be the only important mutation in this adapted culture, while the other mutations may be hitchhikers, playing no role in the adaptive phenotype, or they may add to the fitness of the cells epistatically.

Further, we show that throughout the passaging scheme there are various genotypes that result in the adaptive phenotype, which often contain unique mutations in the same genes, indicating possible parallel evolution. While the evolved genotypes do not delay entry into death phase, they appear to allow cells to exit death phase earlier and at a higher cell density, promoting long-term survival. Competition of cells with point mutations against unaged populations shows that several of the individual mutations identified confer a competitive advantage on parent cells if the populations are allowed to enter death phase and LTSP but not if the cells are passaged during early stationary phase, indicating that these mutations are specifically adaptive in LTSP.</p><p>In several other experimental evolution systems, it can take thousands of generations to observe competitive advantage phenotypes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); here, we observe adaptive mutations in as few as 30 generations. This difference may be due to several features of the experimental design. (i) The adaptive landscape in this experiment likely leads to stronger selection. Because these cells are in a rich, complex medium, and cells are allowed to traverse all five laboratory growth phases, including death phase and LTSP, they are likely experiencing higher levels and a wider variety of stresses than those observed in, for example, minimal medium with low glucose levels. The wide variety of stresses that cells experience, coupled with detrital nutrients released after death phase, may lead to the competitive phenotypes observed here. (ii) Because we are using a rich medium, cells reach higher maximum population sizes (~10<sup>10</sup>&#160;CFU/ml versus the 10<sup>7</sup>&#160;CFU/ml usually observed in low-carbon-source medium). This naturally results in more mutations occurring in each culture upon which selection can act. Further, because we passage the cells at their lowest cell density (10<sup>7</sup> cells) and at a dilution of 1:1,000, we actually have a narrower bottleneck than in other experiments (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), where often the population is at its largest just before the bottleneck (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Because of this, we would expect that the sample being passaged would have lower genetic diversity, as opposed to the higher genetic diversity presumed in the work of Wahl and Gerrish (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), meaning that for a mutant cell to be included during passage, it must have been present in the population at relatively high frequency. This passaging scheme also means that there are many more generations between bottlenecks (from ~10<sup>4</sup>&#160;CFU/ml to ~10<sup>10</sup>&#160;CFU/ml is ~20 generations, compared to ~7 generations in 1:100-diluted minimal medium passages). This may lead to the fixation of more mutations (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Therefore, the system explored here is likely to select for the mutations present at the highest frequencies.</p><p>The observed patterns of selection allow us to identify not only what specific genes may be important for adaptation to LTSP in LB but also how these populations are changing over time. To our knowledge, this is the first example of tracking adaptive populations in long-term stationary-phase cultures through all five phases of growth at the molecular genetic level, as opposed to shorter passaging intervals as seen previously (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). All three passaged populations have different paths to their adaptive phenotypes, and while there are several alleles that seem likely to confer an advantage, there are myriad ways and combinations to achieve that population structure. Further, each of the genes identified with adaptive mutations normally has an effect on multiple genes or pathways. CytR is a direct regulator of several operons (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), SspA regulates gene expression at least partially through H-NS activity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and mutations in TolC can alter expression of stress response proteins (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). These data suggest that adaptive mutations may be more likely in genes that have pleiotropic effects. Our data support this previously suggested hypothesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and may indicate underlying themes in the evolution of microbes. Further, preliminary whole-transcriptome data suggest that a large number of genes are differentially expressed between aged and unaged populations, including upregulation of several genes in the CytR regulon in aged cells, indicating that <italic>cytR</italic> mutations may in fact lead to differential expression of genes in adapted cells (unpublished observation).</p><p>Our data show that adaptive evolution in complex environments may be due to a limited number of genetic pathways, indicating parallel evolution in multiple cultures. Using only three cultures with relatively few generations, we observe many mutations, a small number of which contribute positively to the population. These data indicate that even in a complex, heterogeneous environment, there may be relatively few pathways that lead to strong adaptive phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Bacterial strains, growth conditions, and viable cell counts.</title><p>An <italic>E.&#160;coli</italic> K-12 lineage strain, MG1655 derivative PFM2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), was used in this study.

Three parallel cultures were initiated by transferring cells directly from a frozen 20% glycerol stock into 5&#160;ml of Luria-Bertani (Lennox) medium (LB) (Difco) in an 18- by 150-mm borosilicate test tube and incubated overnight with aeration in a TC-7 rolling drum (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at 37&#176;C. Cells were then diluted into LB at 1:1,000 (vol/vol) to initiate experiments. Cultures were incubated either in test tubes as described above or in 12.5&#160;ml (10% volume) in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a shaking platform (200&#160;rpm).</p><p>Long-term serial passages were performed every 4&#160;days by diluting the culture 1:1,000 in 12.5&#160;ml sterile LB medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks.
