Anti-EGFR humanized monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, in combination with chemotherapy have improved the prognosis for patients with wild-type RAS tumors. To identify mimotopes of EGFR and develop mimotope-based EGFR vaccines, we screened a phage display peptide library with panitumumab. Two EGFR mimotopes P19 and P26, which could be recognized by panitumumab specifically, were isolated. To enhance the immune responses, we generated recombinant proteins of P19 or P26 fused to a heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), and evaluated the efficacy of Hsc70-P19 and Hsc70-P26 as vaccines <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunization with Hsc70-P19 or Hsc70-P26 fusion protein stimulated the immune system to produce specific antibodies against peptides as well as EGFR. Moreover, antibodies elicited against mimotopes could induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and inhibit the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing A431 cells. Treatment with Hsc70-P19 and Hsc70-P26 significantly reduced tumor growth in BALB/c transplantable lung cancer models. Although there was no sequence homology between the phage-derived peptides and EGFR by alignments, both peptides mimic the conformational structure of EGFR binding to panitumumab. In conclusion, the mimotopes we identified from phage display peptide library could be promising candidate vaccines for active anti-EGFR immunotherapy against cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>panitumumab</kwd><kwd>mimotope</kwd><kwd>peptide vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, and associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It promotes cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival by activating MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a critical therapeutic target in cancers, therapeutic agents targeting EGFR consist of both EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been proven effective in a number of patients with non-small cell lung cancers containing constitutively active EGFR mutations [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, humanized monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, appear to improve survival in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>However, there are many limitations of current FDA-approved monoclonal antibody therapies, including short half-life, the need to repeat administration, inadequate tissue distribution, possible immunogenicity against therapeutic antibodies, the development of resistance, and high cost [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Alternatively, to overcome these disadvantages, peptide-based vaccines are able to induce active immunity against tumor-specific antigens, develop immunological memory, and provide possible methods to circumvent resistance [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among them, Rindopepimut, the EGFR-derived 14-mer peptide vaccine consisting of the mutation site of EGFRvIII, has been demonstrated as a safe and potentially effective drug for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in phase II clinical trials [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the peptide vaccines derived from the amino acid sequence of antigens, peptide mimotopes, which are composed of amino acids different from those of native antigens, can mimic antigen-antibody binding sites structurally [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Active immunization with mimotopes would elicit antibodies against the corresponding epitopes. Since mimotopes can be identified from phage display peptide libraries [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], here we screened a phage display 12-mer peptide library, and identified two peptides, P19 and P26, that mimic the EGFR epitopes which can be recognized by panitumumab. The results showed that P19 and P26 contributed to the comformational epitopes of EGFR. Both of them could induce antibody responses to EGFR as well as cellular immune responses in mice. Taken together, peptides P19 and P26 are potential vaccine candidates for the treatment of cancers with EGFR overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Identification of phages binding to panitumumab</title><p>A 12-mer phage display peptide library was screened on panitumumab to isolate the epitope-mimicking peptides.

After three rounds of biopanning, 17.4% (62/356) of the phage clones analyzed showed binding activity to panitumumab (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We sequenced 50 positive phage clones, among which P26 (VPGWSQAFMALA) and P19 (DTDWVRMRDSAR) were the most frequent peptide sequences, suggesting that these two peptide sequences may define common peptides recognized by panitumumab. Accordingly, two distinct consensus motifs HVPG(Q)W(H)SQ and DTX<sub>n</sub>RD were identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Since our results showed that P19 and P26 not only bind to panitumumab, but also attenuate the binding of panitumumab to EGFR, we investigated whether P19 and P26 could prevent panitumumab from inhibiting tumor cell growth. Firstly, we verified the levels of EGFR in A431 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and MCF7 cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which expressed high and low levels of EGFR, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Secondly, we confirmed the function of panitumumab in inhibiting proliferation of A431, but not MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). Thirdly, we demonstrated that P19 and P26 alone had no significant effects on the proliferation of A431 or MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, by preincubating panitumumab with peptides, the response of A431 cells to panitumumab was significantly blocked by P19 and P26 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, similar concentrations of control peptide had no significant effects on the inhibition by panitumumab (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Moreover, neither of the peptide combined with panitumumab had growth inhibition of MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Colony formation assays also showed similar trends of effects of peptide P19 and P26 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

The immune responses induced by Hsc70 fusion proteins in BALB/c mice were examined by ELISA.

The anti-EGFR response was lower than the anti-P19 or anti-P26 response. The anti-P19 and anti-P26 responses were detectable after the second immunization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> upper pannel), whereas the anti-EGFR responses could be observed after the third immunization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> lower pannel).

Among them, T80[V<sub>H</sub>] made hydrogen bond with Q411[EGFR]. In addition, for CDR2 in V<sub>H</sub>, amino acids 31-36 (YYSGNT) was anchored over the surface of domain III by forming hydrogen bonds (Y31[V<sub>H</sub>] to Q408[EGFR], S33[V<sub>H</sub>] to Q384[EGFR] or R353[EGFR], N35[V<sub>H</sub>] to V417[EGFR], and T36[V<sub>H</sub>] to S418[EGFR]). Moreover, amino acids 72-75 (FDHL) in CDR3 of V<sub>L</sub> could form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction with I467[EGFR], S468[EGFR], K465[EGFR], and K443[EGFR], and contribute to the interaction with domain III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Thirdly, to demonstrate whether the functional amino acids in P19 or P26 partially overlap with the residues of EGFR domain III, we compared the interfaces formed by panitumumab with EGFR and peptides, respectively. Since there was no sequence homology between P19 or P26 and EGFR, the docking program in Insight II software was used to model the complexes of P19 or P26 with panitumumab.</p><p>In the P19-panitumumab complex model, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, R78[V<sub>H</sub>] and T80[V<sub>H</sub>] in RVTG[V<sub>H</sub>] could interact with D3[P19] and W4[P19], which occupied approximately the same positions of Q408[EGFR] and H409[EGFR], respectively, on the surface of EGFR domain III. Moreover, D73[V<sub>L</sub>] in FDLH[V<sub>L</sub>] could make electrostatic interactions with R6[P19] and R8[P19], which were similar to K443[EGFR] and K465[EGFR], respectively.

Moreover, the &#960;-&#960; interaction between F72[V<sub>L</sub>] in FDLH[V<sub>L</sub>] and F8[P26] was identified, as well as the hydrophobic interactions between D73[V<sub>L</sub>] or H[V<sub>L</sub>] in FDLH[V<sub>L</sub>] and A10[P26], L11[P26] or A12[P26], which enhanced the binding of P26 to panitumumab. Taken together, the modeling structures raised the possibility that P19 and P26 could mimic the epitope of EGFR binding to panitumumab.</p><p>To verify the contribution of functional amino acids in P19 and P26 binding to panitumumab, we generated GST-P19 mutant (DTAAVAMADAAR) and GST-P26 mutant (VPGASAAFMAAA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and then performed co-IP and GST pull-down assay. The results showed that none of these mutants could interact with panitumumab anymore (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D and 6E</xref>), suggesting that the crucial residues predicted by the modeling structures are bona fide functional amino acids in peptide-EGFR interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are administered to treat colorectal cancer patients with wild-type RAS tumors, and demonstrated to improve the survival of patients. However, a large number of patients did not respond to this treatment, or even developed resistance [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

And these mimotope vaccines could induce antibodies against EGFR, which have the similar effects as panitumumab. Although there was no sequence homology between the mimotopes and EGFR according to sequence alignment, 3D modeling suggests that P19 and P26 resemble the conformational structure of EGFR surface binding to panitumumab.</p><p>Peptides alone could not have sufficient immunogenicity to induce the production of antibody [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), function as chaperones that stabilize and deliver peptides, are known as effective adjuvants to enhance peptide-specific tumor immunity [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Vaccination with HSPs gp96, hsp90, and hsc70 derived from autologous cancer elicits specific immunity to tumors, protects mice from tumor challenge, delays cancer progression, and prolongs life-span [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc70) binding to synthetic peptides has been reported to elicit peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Undono et al. identified that vaccination of murine hsc70 fused to CTL epitopes contributed to the priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, hsc70 could serve as a connection between routes of antigen delivery, which may influence MHC II eptitope selection [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, to enhance the efficiency of peptide vaccine, mice were immunized with EGFR mimotope P19 or P26 fused to the C-terminus of mouse hsc70. Our results showed that Hsc70-P19 and Hsc70-P26 fusion protein could effectively elicit antibodies against the peptides, as well as the epitope of EGFR.</p><p>Many previous studies have reported the generation of peptide vaccines for induction of antibodies against EGFR [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On one hand, peptide vaccines were putative B-cell epitopes designed according to EGFR sequence. It has been reported that the peptides derived from separate sequences of EGFR could prevent tumorigenesis driven by EGFR or mutant EGFR [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, rindopepimut (PEPvIII-KLH; CDX-110; Celldex Therapeutics, Phillipsburg, NJ), a 14-mer peptide which was derived from mutated EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII), could elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. Phase II trial for GMB had verified the efficacy and safety of rindopepimut [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies demonstrated that not only the EGFR B cell epitopes consisted of residues from EGFR contacting sites with EGF, but also the combination treatments of peptide vaccines exhibited significant anti-tumor effects <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the other hand, peptide vaccines could be identified as mimotopes by screening phage display peptide library targeting EGFR-specific antibodies [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although no sequence homology was found between the mimotopes and EGFR, the peptide epitopes could mimic the conformational structure of EGFR, and induce antibodies against EGFR [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, even screening the identical 7-mer phage library with cetuximab, completely different mimotope peptides could be isolated [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Likewise, although mimitopes for panitumumab have been isolated from 12-mer phage peptide library by Voigt et al [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], here, we obtained different mimotopes, P19 and P26, from the same phage peptide library. These mimotopes were able to prime the active immunity against EGFR. The anti-mimotope cellular immune response possibly contains T helper cells, which could contribute to the production of specific antibody. Additionally, peptides are relatively nontoxic, more stable, low cost, easily penetrate tissue barriers, and having the potential to overcome resistance to panitumumab, which make them promising candidates for the development of most therapeutic agents [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is still a long way to go before it could be applied in the clinic.</p><p>However, there are some limitations of this study. According to the 3D model for EGFR-panitumumab complex, the residues (Q384[EGFR], S418[EGFR], Q408[EGFR], H409[EGFR], I467[EGFR], S468[EGFR]), which played critical roles in EGFR-panitumumab interaction, are inconsistent with previous studies [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are required to confirm the roles of these residues,</p><p>In conclusion, peptide mimotope P19 and P26 selected with panitumumab by phage library screening are capable of mimicking the conformational structure of EGFR-panitumumab binding sites, and inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses against EGFR.
