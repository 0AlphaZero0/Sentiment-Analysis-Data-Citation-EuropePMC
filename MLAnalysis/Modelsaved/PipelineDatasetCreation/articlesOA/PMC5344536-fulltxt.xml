The arthropod-born viral dengue disease is one such disease, with empirical and limited genetic evidence showing that African ancestry may be protective against the haemorrhagic phenotype. Global ancestry analysis based on high-throughput genotyping in admixed populations can be used to test this hypothesis, while admixture mapping can map candidate protective genes. A Cuban dengue fever cohort was genotyped using a 2.5 million SNP chip. Global ancestry was ascertained through ADMIXTURE and used in a fine-matched corrected association study, while local ancestry was inferred by the RFMix algorithm. The expression of candidate genes was evaluated by RT-PCR in a Cuban dengue patient cohort and gene set enrichment analysis was performed in a Thai dengue transcriptome. <italic>OSBPL10</italic> and <italic>RXRA</italic> candidate genes were identified, with most significant SNPs placed in inferred weak enhancers, promoters and lncRNAs. <italic>OSBPL10</italic> had significantly lower expression in Africans than Europeans, while for <italic>RXRA</italic> several SNPs may differentially regulate its transcription between Africans and Europeans. Their expression was confirmed to change through dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and to vary with disease severity in a Thai transcriptome dataset. These genes interact in the LXR/RXR activation pathway that integrates lipid metabolism and immune functions, being a key player in dengue virus entrance into cells, its replication therein and in cytokine production. Knockdown of <italic>OSBPL10</italic> expression in THP-1 cells by two shRNAs followed by DENV2 infection tests led to a significant reduction in DENV replication, being a direct functional proof that the lower <italic>OSBPL10</italic> expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Dengue is a concern of worldwide health authorities given the increase on virus and vector dispersions. So far only one traditional GWAS survey has been performed in Vietnamese children. This disease is also epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where most populations descend from a dynamic admixture between African, European and Native American backgrounds. Empirical evidence claimed that African descent was protective against dengue haemorrhagic phenotype in the Cuban population, and this study is the first to apply admixture mapping to identify candidate genes that confer African protection. We also present evidence that two candidate genes, <italic>OSBPL10</italic> and <italic>RXRA</italic>, are differentially expressed along dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and in a Thai dengue transcriptome dataset, and directly show that knockdown of <italic>OSBPL10</italic> gene expression leads to a significant reduction in DENV2 replication. A very important overall result of our work is that it provides a unifying framework for many genes that have been said to be protective in dengue. Our evidence places the LXR/RXR activation pathway at the center of natural dengue protection, and supports pursuing therapeutic techniques involving synthetic ligands of nuclear receptor genes or kinases inhibitors that interact with proteins involved in lipid metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>290344-EUROTAST</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triska</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>282378-DENFREE</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm">https://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm</ext-link>] for the DENFREE project under Grant Agreement no. 282378.

The virus is transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Morbidity and mortality associated with severe dengue infection render this disease a major increasing public health problem throughout tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue illness is also attracting awareness in Europe and in the United States as climate change and globalisation enlarge the geographic dispersion of the vector and the viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A dengue infection can evolve from a subclinical infection, a relatively mild, self-limited infection known as dengue fever (DF), to the severe disease called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), which may evolve to a life-threatening hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome, DSS [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). But only a small proportion of antibody-positive individuals develops DHF/DSS, while the vast majority suffers an asymptomatic infection or the mild disease. This differential susceptibility to disease severity indicates that besides immune factors, the host genetics may influence the infection outcome, acting in a complex interplay with viral and environmental factors. Diverse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as <italic>HLA-I</italic>, <italic>HLA-II</italic>, <italic>TNF-&#945;</italic>, <italic>IL-10</italic>, <italic>TGF-&#946;1</italic>, <italic>Fc&#947;RIIa</italic>, <italic>VDR</italic>, <italic>CD209</italic> and <italic>OAS</italic> have been associated with symptomatic dengue or considered protective against the disease, in Asian and Latin American populations [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, <italic>MICA</italic> and <italic>MICB</italic> genes have been associated with susceptibility to dengue in Cuba [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], partially overlapping previous results reported in the only genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed so far in Vietnamese children, and showing significant association of <italic>MICB</italic> and <italic>PLCE1</italic> genes with DSS [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Evidence supporting the impact of human genetic factors on infection outcome also comes from differences between ethnic groups in developing severe DHF/DSS symptoms [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As early as in 1906, it was reported that Cuban dark-skinned individuals showed a remarkable resistance against dengue disease compared with light-skinned individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This early observation was confirmed during the 1981 Cuban DHF/DSS epidemic of DENV-2 when ethnicity was recognized for the first time as a possible host risk factor, and confirmed afterwards in several other dengue Cuban outbreaks [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The low occurrence of dengue disease in Haitians [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and in African populations [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] adds further support for this ancestry influence. A genetic characterization of 30 ancestry informative markers conducted in the Colombian population [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] confirmed the protective effect of African ancestry against severe dengue outcomes (odds ratios, ORs in 0.963&#8211;0.971 interval).</p><p>Till recently, population structure as occurs in admixed populations was a major confounding factor, requiring strategies for correction of the association p-values [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. But admixed populations are a great advantage in cases of differential ancestry-conferred susceptibility/resistance to a disease through the use of admixture mapping [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The rationale of admixture mapping is that the ancestry blocks will be distributed at random across the genome, reflecting the admixture proportions of the parental ancestries, except in candidate gene locations where statistically significantly different proportions for the ancestry with higher disease levels will be observed in cases versus controls. It has been shown that this test is statistically more powerful than traditional GWAS [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]: around 250 samples can provide a 60% power to detect a two-fold risk due to ancestry, compared to the thousands of samples required in GWAS. In fact, because of the recentness of admixture, the typical ancestry blocks are significantly larger than haplotype blocks, thus lowering the multiple testing burden. This strategy has been successfully applied in African-Americans and Latin-Americans, in association with various diseases, such as asthma [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Cuba is advantageous for studies of ancestry-conferred DHF susceptibility/protection. The current Cuban population is mainly derived from the mix of two well-defined ancestral populations: European colonizers, who began to arrive in 1492 from the Iberian Peninsula, followed by other countries; and enslaved Africans, arriving in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, mainly from West Africa. The contribution of the first aboriginal Cuban inhabitants, almost totally exterminated during the Spanish conquest, is almost negligible [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Western and Eastern sides of the island show differences in historic settlement, with European descendants concentrating in the capital [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DENV experience has also been different among them. After an absence of 40 years, DENV1 was reported in 1977 and transmitted to nearly one-half of the Cuban population. Four years later, DENV2 (Asian origin) infected approximately 25% of the population, and a large DHF/DSS epidemic occurred. In 1997, another Asian DENV2 virus entered the country, producing a local epidemic in the municipality of Santiago de Cuba. In 2001, DENV3 (Asian genotype), was detected in Havana city [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2006, the circulation of DENV4 was reported in Havana, while DENV3 affected Guantanamo [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We conducted a GWAS of 2.5 million SNPs in 274 Cubans, including patients (DF and DHF) of the 2006 dengue epidemic, from Havana (west) and Guantanamo (east) cities, and in geographically matched asymptomatic individuals and population controls. The high level of admixture in Cuba enabled us to apply the first admixture mapping, thus facilitating the identification of candidate markers ethnically associated with dengue infection. Firstly, we conducted a global admixture analysis which allowed us to confirm the statistically significant decrease of African ancestry in the DHF cohort and to fine tune the association analysis in the admixed Cubans (cases and controls were paired to not differ more than 2% in African ancestry), whose statistical burden is 2.6x10<sup>-8</sup>. Secondly, we performed a local ancestry assignment along chromosomes which identified the precise regions (and genes) where the African ancestry was significantly higher in asymptomatic compared with DHF (above 3SD threshold in the difference in African ancestry between controls-cases). The fine-tuned association analysis can identify a few SNPs (located in a small chromosomal region) that confer reasonable individual risk/protection; the local ancestry assignment can identify ancestry-related blocks (medium to big chromosomal regions, depending on the time since admixture) containing SNPs conferring low-medium risk/protection, which would escape the association test.

This indicates that the haplotype affects mRNA expression. We further ascertained that these non-coding SNPs are not located in the inferred promoter, but they can be related with weaker enhancer regions and are recognised by many transcription factors, including <italic>STAT</italic> and <italic>RXRA</italic> (Fig Q in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Besides the haplotype region, the segment immediately 5&#8217; to it (within the gene) has some SNPs with significant p-values in the association test that are also regulatory regions in several cell types (Table O and Fig R in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Although there is no current good database to check eQTLs in African populations, we used GTEx despite its highly European-biased dataset (84.3%). The six identified <italic>OSBPL10</italic> SNPs are not identified in GTEx as eQTLs, but surveying the eQTLs located on that chromosomal region, there is one with frequency differences between African and European populations (rs7642435, at position 32036787; 1000 Genomes frequency in Africa&#8211;A = 0.092, G = 0.908; 1000 Genomes frequency in Europe&#8211;A = 0.723, G = 0.277), which presents alternative homozygous genotypes associated with our African/European haplotypes: &#8220;African&#8221; haplotype with rs7642435_GG and &#8220;European&#8221; haplotype with rs7642435_AA. As can be confirmed in Fig S in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>, rs7642435_GG has a significant reduction of <italic>OSBPL10</italic> expression compared with rs7642435_AA, and this SNP is predicted to have an eQTL effect (posterior probability&gt;0.9) in several tissues: artery (aorta, coronary and tibial), brain (nucleus accumbens and caudate), liver, adrenal gland, pancreas, esophagus (muscularis and gastroesophageal junction), stomach, nerve and cells-transformed fibroblasts. The remaining eQTLs in the region are almost fixed in both African and European populations. Possibly, our haplotype association is identifying the rs7642435 eQTL, although more information on African eQTLs is needed in order to ascertain other possible eQTLs in the <italic>OSBPL10</italic> region.</p><p>This extended <italic>OSBPL10</italic> segment (haplotype and immediate 5&#8217; region) has probably been under positive selection in the African Yoruban population, as inferred in the Haplotter tool based on HapMap dataset (iHS measure; Fig T in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

Therefore, it seems that the <italic>OSBPL10</italic> haplotype and its 5&#8217; region, although non-coding, bear several expression regulatory SNPs with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, probably due to selection events.</p><p>Several other SNPs located on genes (mostly one or two SNPs per gene) reached association p-values of 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>.

The most significant p-values are for three intergenic SNPs (rs4262378, rs4424343 and rs3118593) located in inferred enhancers (Table P in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

From these various significant SNPs, only rs3118593 is within a promoter and a lncRNA (<italic>RP11-473E2</italic>.<italic>4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006220.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and interestingly, according to the GTEx portal, the patterns of expression for <italic>RXRA</italic> and <italic>RP11-473E2&#183;4</italic> genes in the various human tissues are totally opposite, with <italic>RXRA</italic> being mainly expressed in liver, muscle, skin and whole blood while almost not expressed in brain and testis, and the other way around for <italic>RP11-473E2&#183;4</italic> (Figs U-W in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006220.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

The independent selective pressures acting upon these groups can lead different genes to be selected in adaptation to the same pathogen, and those genes can interact in a common crucial pathway or in different pathways of additive importance to the disease process.</p><p>The current study supports the African-ancestry-conferred resistance to DHF, in comparison with European background, concurring with the report in Colombia [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is unlikely that DENV has exerted this selective pressure, since its associated mortality is low and it does not alter reproduction. But yellow fever virus, another African-originated flavivirus, which has a remarkable mortality level (being 6.8 times higher in Caucasians), could have generated protective genetic variants against itself, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and DENV [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that besides infection-related genes, metabolic genes are also under intense selective pressure, and both can interact as in the case of the low-activity alleles of glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase providing reduced risk to malaria infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is known that Africans have a lower atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by low triglyceride (T), total cholesterol, and LDL levels, and high high-density lipoproteins (HDL) levels, when compared to Europeans [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Signs of selection were already identified in West Africans for <italic>APOL1</italic> and <italic>CD36</italic> genes involved in lipid metabolism and probably driven by pathogen resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our evidence adds two new genes to the differential lipid profile between Africans and Europeans, which play a role in infectious resistance. We detected signs of positive selection on the <italic>OSBPL10</italic> gene, while balancing selection may have generated additional polymorphisms regulating <italic>RXRA</italic> expression in Africans.</p><p>A direct link between dengue infection progression and lipid profile changes has been made, so that lipids may be used as predictors of clinical outcome [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]: increased T and HDL and decreased LDL were observed in severe dengue. Recent metabolic and lipid profiling in serum samples from dengue cohorts [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have reinforced these earlier findings, showing that DENV infection causes temporary changes in metabolites involved in acute inflammatory responses, with major perturbed metabolic pathways including fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism and steroid hormone pathway, and that progression into DSS is associated with certain metabolites (phosphatidylcholines, diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, triglycerides, and diacylglycerophosphoglycerol) that may act in endothelial cell homeostasis and vascular barrier function. Definitely, lipids are essential to DENV entrance and replication [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Flavivirus RNA synthesis and replication occur on an extended network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and then maturation takes place in the ER-Golgi complex [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These are the main cellular components where OSBPs play a key role on cholesterol and other sterols homeostasis [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our functional assay clearly shows that knockdown of <italic>OSBPL10</italic> expression reduces significantly DENV replication, a direct proof that the lower <italic>OSBPL10</italic> expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease. Interestingly, replication of HCV and poliovirus has been shown to be dependent on OSBP in a PI4-kinase dependent manner, but DENV did not, possibly due to its ligand being PI3P and not PI4P [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This evidence and our detected African-related signs of association with kinases in Cuba calls for future research to be conducted in this group of enzymes.</p><p>If the <italic>OSBPL10</italic> gene is involved in signaling and transport of lipids, <italic>RXRA</italic> plays a role in the second part of the cholesterol homeostasis through the LXR/RXR activation pathway, in hepatocytes and macrophages. When cholesterol is in excess, as occurs in infection, the consequent lowering of its cellular concentration is reached by oxysterol and desmosterol binding to <italic>LXR</italic>, which forms heterodimers with <italic>RXRA</italic> in order to control the transcription activation of many genes regulating lipid metabolism. In macrophages, <italic>RXRA</italic> also regulates the integration of immune functions, thus defining the clinical outcome of dengue infection. Indeed, macrophages are key DENV target cells and also the principal source of pro-inflammatory mediators linked to severe dengue disease. LXR/RXRA heterodimers and sumoylated LXR inhibit the <italic>NF-kB</italic> transcription factor complex, which <italic>per se</italic> acts upon inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. But a negative control of LXR/RXRA dimers is exerted by <italic>IRF3</italic>, which is activated by viruses and bacteria that entered the cell through <italic>TLR3</italic> and <italic>TLR4</italic> receptors, deregulating the cholesterol control and allowing the action of <italic>NF-kB</italic> transcription factor. It has been demonstrated that during dengue infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] there is down-regulation of <italic>RXRA</italic> expression in an <italic>IRF3</italic>-dependent manner in the host cell, to achieve optimal <italic>IFN</italic> expression. After infection, <italic>RXRA</italic> expression resumes, suppressing the type I IFN induction. Therefore, <italic>RXRA</italic> not only maintains the basal type I IFN and modulates the host antiviral response, but also regulates the antiviral inflammatory response.</p><p>Remarkably, our results offer a comprehensive explanation for various independent observations made in association with dengue. <italic>RXRA</italic> forms heterodimers with <italic>VDR</italic>, previously identified as dengue protective in Vietnamese [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The RXRA-VDR heterodimers negatively control the expression of several immune function genes. Also, <italic>PLCE1</italic>, protective against DSS in Vietnamese children [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], interacts with <italic>RXRA</italic> in the PPARA/RXRA activation pathway, positively controlling the expression of genes again related with lipid metabolism. Perhaps flavivirus resistance arose in Asians through <italic>VDR</italic> and <italic>PLCE1</italic> selection, while <italic>OSBPL10</italic> and <italic>RXRA</italic> selection provided resistance in Africans, all related with central lipids and cytokines pathways. Even the immune system genes associated with dengue illness, such as <italic>TNF-&#945;</italic>, <italic>IL-10</italic>, <italic>TGF-&#946;1</italic>, <italic>Fc&#947;RIIa</italic> and <italic>CD209</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], can also be related with the <italic>RXRA</italic> gene in several pathways, as their expression is controlled by dimers formed by RXRA and other nuclear factors.</p><p>Even the signals we detected in the kinases or kinase-related genes contribute to integrate our results in the general picture. <italic>CAMK1D</italic> is associated with chemokine, thrombin signalling and xenobiotic metabolism (through RXRA-CAR dimers), activation of neutrophil cells and apoptosis of erythroleukemia cells; <italic>MAPKAPK5</italic>, that responds to cellular stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the use of a specific inhibitor of this gene blocked DENV assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; <italic>PIK3AP1</italic> which may interact with <italic>OSBPL10</italic>, as it is possible that this gene is activated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) [<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and links Toll-like receptor signaling to PI3K activation preventing excessive inflammatory cytokine production; <italic>SNRK</italic> possibly expressed in the liver secretome; <italic>GNA14</italic> activates PLC (detected in the Vietnamese dengue GWAS) protein that generates diacylglycerol which further activates <italic>PPARA</italic> to forms heterodimers with <italic>RXRA</italic>, positively controlling the expression of genes related with lipid metabolism;[<xref rid="ppat.1006220.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] <italic>DAB-1</italic> may play a role in PI3K binding.</p><p>The genomic and functional confirmation of the protection conferred by <italic>OSBPL10</italic>, <italic>RXRA</italic> and related lipid metabolism against dengue illness supported in this study points out potential therapeutic applications.
