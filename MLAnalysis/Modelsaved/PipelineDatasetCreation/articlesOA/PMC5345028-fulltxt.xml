The liver-specific expression of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is repressed in hibernating chipmunks under the control of endogenous circannual rhythms. However, the molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene during the nonhibernation and hibernation seasons are unknown. Here, we show that the hibernation-associated <italic>HP-25</italic> expression is regulated epigenetically. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that significantly less hepatocyte nuclear receptor HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter in the liver of hibernating chipmunks compared to nonhibernating chipmunks. Concurrently in the hibernating chipmunks, coactivators were dissociated from the promoter, and active transcription histone marks on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter were lost. On the other hand, <italic>small heterodimer partner (SHP)</italic> expression was upregulated in the liver of hibernating chipmunks. Overexpressing SHP in primary hepatocytes prepared from nonhibernating chipmunks caused HNF-4 to dissociate from the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter, and reduced the <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA level. These results suggest that hibernation-related <italic>HP-25</italic> expression is epigenetically regulated by the binding of HNF-4 to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter, and that this binding might be modulated by SHP in hibernating chipmunks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Of the many physiological seasonal adaptations that occur in animals in response to the physical world, hibernation is one of the most extreme. Mammalian hibernation is a unique circannual physiological adaptation that allows life to be sustained at extremely low body temperatures, which can fall below 10&#8201;&#176;C or even 5&#8201;&#176;C. During hibernation, heart and breathing rates drop, and the metabolic rate falls to only a few percent of the euthermic level, resulting in a considerable conservation of energy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The mechanistic basis of these dynamic physiological changes in hibernation is not well understood.</p><p>The <italic>Tamias asiaticus</italic> (chipmunk) hibernation-related protein 25 is a component in a 140-kDa complex, consisting of HP-20, HP-25, HP-27, and HP-55, that decreases drastically in the blood during hibernation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. HP-20, HP-25, and HP-27 contain collagen-like Gly-X-Y repeats near the N terminus and a globular domain in the C terminus, and are highly homologous to each other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The 140-kDa complex starts decreasing before the onset of hibernation, stays at reduced levels during hibernation, and starts increasing before hibernation ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Kondo <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the onset of hibernation is marked by an increase in the HP-20c protein complex in the brain; this complex is composed of HP-20, HP-25, and HP-27<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Furthermore, hibernation is shortened when an antibody against HP-20c is administered via the lateral ventricles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, indicating that HP-20c has a critical role in hibernation.</p><p>The <italic>HP-25</italic> gene, which is expressed specifically in the liver, is downregulated in hibernating chipmunks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA level in the liver fluctuates in parallel with levels of the 140-kDa complex in the blood. Since the levels of the 140-kDa complex fluctuate independently of changes in body temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA expression in the liver is thought to be controlled by endogenous circannual rhythms, rather than by changes in body temperature or by metabolic inhibition at low body temperatures. Thus, elucidating the mechanism of such hibernation-associated endogenous circannual rhythms will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of mammalian hibernation.</p><p>Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) activates <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. HNF-4 is a member of the nuclear receptor family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Fatty acids and linoleic acids are assumed to be the endogenous ligands of HNF-4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. HNF-4 is mainly expressed in the liver and binds to direct repeat 1 like motifs as a homodimer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. HNF-4 is a critical transcriptional regulator for many genes specifically expressed in the liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In addition, HNF-4 interacts with various partner proteins that change its transcriptional activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. HNF-4 can also recruit several coactivators that modulate chromatin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the hibernation-associated loss of <italic>HP-25</italic> expression in chipmunks. We first analyzed whether the hibernation-associated loss of <italic>HP-25</italic> expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. Subsequently, we focused on the HNF-4-regulated transcriptional activity and on hibernation-associated changes in epigenetic marks on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region. Our results suggest that HNF-4 and its coactivators bind the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region to epigenetically regulate the <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription changes associated with circannual hibernation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription is regulated in association with hibernation</title><p>We previously showed that the chipmunk <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is downregulated in the liver of hibernating chipmunks, based on Northern analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, Northern analysis only indirectly measures gene transcription, since mRNA levels represent the sum of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. Here, we verified our initial finding by analyzing the levels of <italic>HP-25</italic> primary transcripts; this approach to determining a gene&#8217;s transcriptional state is an alternative to the nuclear run-on assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Total RNA was isolated from the liver of six nonhibernating chipmunks and six hibernating chipmunks, and the level of <italic>HP-25</italic> primary transcripts was compared by RT-PCR using a pair of primers, one located in exon 1 and the other in intron 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The PCR amplimers were confirmed to be a single band of the correct size by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA level was also analyzed by RT-PCR using a pair of primers, one located in exon 2 and the other in exon 3. Since the <italic>albumin</italic> mRNA level remains constant regardless of hibernation state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, we used the level of <italic>albumin</italic> primary transcripts as a control. The <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA level was reduced as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and similarly, the level of <italic>HP-25</italic> primary transcripts was greatly reduced in the hibernating chipmunks compared with nonhibernating chipmunks. Although the <italic>albumin</italic> primary transcript levels differed slightly between individuals, the level was almost constant in nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks. These results indicate that the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is in a transcriptionally active state in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks and shifts to a transcriptionally repressed state in the liver of hibernating chipmunks. This observation was in clear contrast to the constitutively active <italic>albumin</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Amount of HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter decreased during hibernation</title><p>Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription is activated by HNF-4, which is a hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, and by upstream stimulatory factor (USF), which is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Here, immunoblotting analyses of nuclear extracts from several tissues of nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks using antibodies validated for corresponding chipmunk proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) revealed that HNF-4, USF-1, and USF-2 were present in the kidney, where the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is not expressed [<italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA was detected only in the liver, but not in the kidney, by northern analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>], as well as in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, although the amounts of HNF-4 and USF in the liver differed between individuals to some extent, the average amounts were comparable in nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether HNF-4, USF-1, and USF-2 were involved in the liver-specific transcription of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In the kidney, these transcription factors were hardly present on the promoter region of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks, USF-1, USF-2, and HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region, as expected from our previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To assess whether HNF-4 binds to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter liver-specifically, we compared HNF-4-binding to the promoter regions of the <italic>HP-25</italic> and <italic>Pklr</italic> genes by ChIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). While the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is expressed in liver but not in kidney<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, the <italic>Pklr</italic> gene is expressed in both liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). The results showed that HNF-4 bound to the <italic>Pklr</italic> gene promoter in both liver and kidney, but to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter liver-specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4d</xref>), consistent with its liver-specific transcription. Of note, USF-1, USF-2, and HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region even in the liver of hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), where this gene is transcriptionally repressed. However, the amount of HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region was drastically decreased in hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In the case of the <italic>albumin</italic> gene, which is transcriptionally upregulated by HNF-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, HNF-1 and Pol II bound the promoter region in the liver of both nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>), consistent with its constitutively active transcription. ChIP-qPCR showed that about 10 times more HNF-4 was bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter in the liver of nonhibernating compared to hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). On the other hand, the amount of histone H3 on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region was almost the same in the liver of both nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These findings suggested that the dissociation of HNF-4 from the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region is one of the major causes of the repression of <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription in hibernating chipmunks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Histone modifications on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region change in association with hibernation</title><p>The acetylation and methylation of histone at certain residues, such as the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine (K) 4 and the acetylation at K9 and K14, are generally involved in gene activation, whereas the lack of histone acetylation is a hallmark of gene repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Histone modifications for active transcription destabilize higher-order chromatin structures and render nucleosomal DNA more accessible to transcription factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To examine the involvement of epigenetic regulation in <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription, we first compared the total amount of histone H3 acetylated at K9 and K14 and trimethylated at K4 in the liver between nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The total amounts of the modified histones in the liver were almost equal between nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks. We then analyzed the modification states of the histone H3 specifically bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Histone H3 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region was significantly more acetylated at K9 and K14 and more trimethylated at K4 in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks than in hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> upper part and 3c), but H3K9 dimethylation, one of the repressive histone modifications, was not detected even in hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> middle upper part). On the other hand, the histone H3 bound to the <italic>albumin</italic> promoter region was almost equally acetylated at K9 and K14 and trimethylated at K4 in the liver of nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> lower part). These results were consistent with our findings on the transcriptional states of the <italic>HP-25</italic> and <italic>albumin</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Considering that the total amounts of the modified histones were similar between nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), these histone modifications are probably regulated at the promoter region of specific genes involved in hibernation, including at least the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>HNF-4 and coactivators activate <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism of the hibernation-associated changes in histone modifications on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter, we used ChIP to analyze the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs) bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Histone H3 can be acetylated at K9 and K14 by HATs such as CBP, NCoA-1, PCAF, p300, GCN5, MOZ, MORF, and TFIIIC, and can be methylated at K4 by HMTs such as SETD1A, SETD1B, MLL1, MLL2, and ASH1L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. HDACs are classified into groups I&#8211;IV, and the class I HDACs HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 generally function as subunits in multiprotein complexes that are crucial for repressing transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. ChIP analyses revealed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 bound the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region in the liver of both nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> right panel and 4b). In contrast, CBP, NCoA-1, PCAF, and SETD1A were found on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter mainly in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> left and middle panels and 4b). Thus, hibernation-associated histone modifications are likely to be modulated by HAT and HMT, which are associated with the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter in nonhibernating chipmunks and dissociated from the promoter region in hibernating chipmunks.</p><p>To investigate the involvement of HATs and HMT(s) in activating the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with an <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter-reporter plasmid and expression plasmids for CBP, SETD1A, and HNF-4 singly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a</xref>) or in combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6b</xref>). Although neither CBP nor SETD1A alone could activate the <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription, both could facilitate its transcriptional activation by HNF-4, and the combination of CBP and SETD1A further enhanced the <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a,b</xref>). CBP&#8217;s enhancement of the <italic>HP-25</italic> transcriptional activation was repressed by curcumin, a specific inhibitor of CBP HAT activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6c</xref>). These results indicate that the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription is activated by HNF-4 in combination with HATs and HMT(s) in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SHP upregulation represses <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription by suppressing HNF-4 activity during hibernation</title><p>Our results thus far indicated that the <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription was probably repressed in hibernating chipmunks due to reduced levels of HNF-4 bound to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and the dissociation of coactivators from the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Although several microRNAs have been implicated in the translational repression of HNF-4 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the observation that the HNF-4 levels were unchanged in nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks would exclude microRNAs from the cause of this repression. Small heterodimer partner (SHP), which belongs to a group of atypical nuclear receptors that lack a classical DNA-binding domain and are corepressors of a number of nuclear receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, represses HNF-4 activity by competing with the coactivator SRC-3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We could not detect endogenous SHP protein expression in the liver with any of several commercial anti-SHP antibodies, so we used RT-qPCR to compare <italic>SHP</italic> expression in the liver of nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Notably, unlike the <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA levels, the amount of <italic>SHP</italic> mRNA was about 2.5-fold higher in hibernating than in nonhibernating chipmunks. To examine whether chipmunk SHP affects the transcriptional activity of HNF-4, we conducted a transient transfection assay using an <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter-reporter plasmid and expression plasmids for HNF-4, CBP, and SHP singly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6d</xref>) or in combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6e</xref>), in HeLa cells. We found that SHP repressed <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription activated by HNF-4 alone or in combination with CBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6d,e</xref>). We next examined interactions between chipmunk HNF-4 and chipmunk SHP in cultured cells. In HeLa cells transfected with chipmunk HNF-4 and FLAG-tagged chipmunk SHP, immunocytochemistry using fluorescent and confocal microscopies showed that significant portions of HNF-4 and SHP were colocalized in nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6f</xref>), and HNF-4 and SHP were co-precipitated in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6g</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that chipmunk SHP interacts with chipmunk HNF-4 in the nucleus and represses the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcription activated by HNF-4.</p><p>Finally, to examine the effect of ectopic SHP expression on endogenous <italic>HP-25</italic> gene expression, we transfected a FLAG-tagged SHP-expression construct into primary hepatocytes prepared from a nonhibernating chipmunk. The expression of FLAG-tagged SHP was verified by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that although SHP overexpression did not affect the <italic>albumin</italic> mRNA levels, the <italic>HP-25</italic> mRNA was reduced by 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Ectopic SHP expression did not affect the amount of HNF-4 protein or <italic>HNF-4</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,e</xref>). ChIP-qPCR revealed that SHP overexpression decreased the amount of HNF-4 bound to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter by about 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>), although the amount of histone H3 on the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter region was almost the same with or without SHP transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that SHP expression is upregulated in hibernating chipmunks and that SHP represses <italic>HP-25</italic> expression by removing HNF-4 from the promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mammalian hibernation is accompanied by various physiological changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> that are assumed to be under genetic control.

These results indicate that the liver-specific transcription of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene is established by assembling a higher order chromatin structure around the promoter region, which is inaccessible by transcription-factors, in nonexpressing tissues. Our previous finding that USF binding to the CACGTG sequence in the <italic>HP-27</italic> promoter region is inhibited by CpG methylation in nonexpressing tissues supports this idea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. On the other hand, in the liver of hibernating chipmunks, where <italic>HP-25</italic> is transcriptionally repressed, the transcription factors HNF-4, USF-1, and USF-2 still bound the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), but a repressive histone mark was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that the chromatin structures surrounding the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene do not change so drastically that they prevent transcription factors from binding, unlike in nonexpressing tissues like the kidney.</p><p>HDACs are traditionally considered to be transcriptional corepressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, HDAC1 and HDAC2 were found on the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Recent genome-wide mapping revealed that HDACs localize to many active genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. These observations support the idea that HDACs are recruited to active genes to reset the chromatin modification states and maintain an adequate level of histone acetylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, and our result is consistent with this idea. On the other hand, HDACs are also thought to enforce the hypo-acetylated chromatin state of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene in hibernating chipmunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we showed that the transcriptional repression of the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene in hibernating chipmunks results mainly from the dissociation of HNF-4 from the promoter, possibly due to SHP, which is upregulated during hibernation. SHP is proposed to repress gene transcription by interacting with other nuclear receptors via two dimerization LXXLL-related motifs in a ligand-binding domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, or by binding to the C-terminal activation function-2 helix of other nuclear receptors through these motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Since chipmunk SHP also possesses both LXXLL-related motifs in a ligand-binding domain, chipmunk SHP probably interacts with chipmunk HNF-4 through these two functional motifs. SHP is also reported to interact with lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, which is associated with a CoREST&#8211;SIRT1 repressor complex that removes H3K4 mono-, di- and trimethylation marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. These reports imply that SHP might also directly repress <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription by recruiting histone modification enzymes to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter via an interaction with HNF-4 bound to the promoter.</p><p>The <italic>HP-25</italic> gene expression in the liver is thought to be regulated by the endogenous circannual rhythm responsible for hibernation. Our results suggest that this hibernation-associated regulation of <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription occurs as follows: in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks, HNF-4 binds the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter region to activate <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription in combination with coactivators and active histone modification marks; in hibernating chipmunks, HNF-4 and its coactivators dissociate from the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter, possibly by an interaction with SHP (which is now upregulated), and active transcription histone marks are removed from the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Since transcription and translation are drastically decreased at low body temperatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, these repression processes are likely to occur before or during the entry into hibernation. On the other hand, a reduction in SHP during the nonhibernation season would allow HNF-4 to bind to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter, which could facilitate H3K4 trimethylation and histone acetylation on the promoter region by recruiting HMTs and HATs, leading to <italic>HP-25</italic> transcriptional activation. Together, controlled HNF-4 binding to the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter is likely to play a key role in the differential regulation of <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription between the nonhibernating and hibernating chipmunks. Recently, it has been reported that not only hibernating mammals but also non-hibernating mammals contain <italic>HP-20, HP-25</italic> and <italic>HP-27</italic> genes, and in cow, whose <italic>hibernation-related protein (HP</italic>) genes are expressed specifically in the liver, circulating levels of HP-25 and HP-27 in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid change seasonally as is the case with the chipmunk HPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Even when chipmunks were kept under conditions of constant warmth (23&#8201;&#176;C) with a 12&#8201;h:12&#8201;h light:dark period cycle, the HP level in the blood and their gene expression in the liver still showed seasonal oscillations similar to those in animals with a low body temperature (Tb) during hibernation season, indicating that the gene expression of HPs is regulated by endogenous circannual rhythms, and independent of Tb changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Since there is a HNF-4 binding site in the cow <italic>HP-25</italic> gene promoter (data not shown), transcription of the cow <italic>HP-25</italic> gene may be regulated by a general nuclear receptor HNF-4 as the chipmunk <italic>HP-25</italic> gene. Although it has not been established that cow HPs oscillate in an endogenously generated circannual manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, the gene regulation of HPs is likely to be under the control of a circannual clock common to chipmunk and cow. In recent years, the presence of a circannual pacemaker in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland has been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Identifying the repressors that regulate <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription and HNF-4&#8217;s binding to the <italic>HP-25</italic> promoter poses an interesting challenge. Based on our results, elucidating the upstream factors that control the epigenetic regulation of <italic>HP-25</italic> transcription will help to identify the circannual signals from the circannual pacemaker common to hibernators and nonhibernators. Also, comparative analyses of the pathways affecting the <italic>HP-25</italic> gene transcriptional regulation between hibernators and nonhibernators, together with functional analysis of the HP-25 protein, may lead to identification of hibernation signals.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All recombinant DNA experiments in this study strictly followed a protocol and guidelines approved by the Institutional Recombinant DNA Experiment Safety Committee of Kitasato University.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Male chipmunks (<italic>Tamias asiaticus</italic>) purchased from Pet Easy Space (Osaka) were individually housed and offered standard rodent chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.
