For pathological findings of arteriosclerosis, we used three measurements, including the aortic atherosclerosis index (AAI), the pathological arteriosclerotic index (PAI), and the coronary stenosis index (CSI). The degrees of AAI and PAI were determined based on a microscopic examination, and they reflected the ratio between the atheroma-occupied area and the entire surface area. Then, the AAI and PAI were scored semi-quantitatively on a scale of 0&#8211;8. The PAI was defined as the average value of the arteriosclerotic scores for eight arteries. The CSI was defined as the sum of stenotic scores obtained in three branches of the coronary arteries. Details of the methods for defining the PAI and CSI were previously reported.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> The upper 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of the AAI, PAI, and CSI distributions were used as cut off values for separating samples into those with the presence and those with an absence of pathological findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We investigated 24,423 SNVs; thus, statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.05 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>, according to the Bonferroni correction.

For each SNV, stratified by the presence or absence of AAA, we estimated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) assuming a dominant model. We initially performed multiple logistic regression analyses to determine the associations of individual SNVs with the risk of AAA, with adjustments for gender, age, and/or smoking habits. Next, each association was adjusted for individual risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and arteriosclerosis obliterans, and for complications, such as AAI, PAI, and CSI.

This finding contrasted with the general observation that the prevalence of AAA is approximately five times higher in males than in females.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> However, some studies showed that the prevalence of AAA gradually increased with age in females and males. Current reports from Japan revealed that, among older individuals, the AAA prevalence was similar between sexes. AAA was detected in 5.7% of females aged over 80 years and 5.7% of men aged 70&#8211;79 years.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Thus, our data appeared to be consistent with observations that the prevalence was not gender-dependent in the older Japanese population. We found no significant difference in smoking prevalence between subjects with and without AAA in our study population. Although there is strong evidence that smoking is a risk factor of AAA, the effect of smoking was not apparent in our population. One reason for the lack of a significant effect of smoking might to be that the smokers in our study population included both current and ex-smokers. Our information was limited in detail; thus, we had no data on when ex-smokers had stopped smoking. The clinical findings of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and arteriosclerosis obliterans were more prevalent in subjects with AAA than in those without AAA. The higher prevalence of diabetes in subjects without AAA than those with AAA was an expected observation, because diabetes decreases aortic wall expansion.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> The high severity we observed in the AAI, PAI, and CSI in subjects with AAA confirmed that atherosclerosis was a significant risk factor of AAA. In our previous report, where we investigated part of the current population, we found evidence to support the predictive abilities of PAI and CSI as markers for the risk of atherosclerosis and also coronary artery disease (CAD).<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref></p><p>Among all the SNVs investigated in this study, the SNV with the lowest p-value was rs3750092 in the <italic>WIPF3</italic> gene; this SNV was followed by rs1051338 and rs2246942 in <italic>LIPA</italic> gene, which showed a high LD [r<sup>2</sup> = 0.907, D&#8242; = 0.968, from 1000 genomes (phase_1 JPT data)].

However, the association of <italic>LIPA</italic> variations with AAA was not affected by adjustment with atherosclerotic changes may suggest that it is an independent risk factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="jgc-13-12-960-s002">Supplementary Table</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicated that the rs3750092 variant of the <italic>WIPF3</italic> gene was protective against AAA. The WIPF3 protein binds to the neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), and together, they play a key role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell movement.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> The WIPF3 protein is abundant in the brain and testis, but its expression in other tissues was not well known.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> We demonstrated that WIPF3 protein was expressed in macrophages of atheromatous plaques. Interestingly, other studies have shown that N-WASP was required for podosome formation in macrophages.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> Macrophages are known to play a critical role in AAA formation. They infiltrate the wall of AAA vessels and produce cytotoxic mediators, such as cytokines, perforin, and matrix metalloproteinase proteinases (MMPs). These mediators contribute to the elimination and degeneration of smooth muscle cells during the pathogenesis of AAA.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> Both candidate genes identified in the present study, <italic>WIPF3</italic> and <italic>LIPA</italic>, function in macrophages; thus, the pathogenesis of AAA might be affected by macrophage characteristics.</p><p>Further studies are needed to confirm these associations in larger sample sizes and to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with these SNVs. For example, the mechanism underlying the role of NWASP/WIPF3 in AAA progression is currently unknown. In addition, larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings that the genetic associations remained positive after adjusting for AAI, PAI, and CSI, and that they were independent from the risk of atherosclerosis. Future functional and physiological analyses in animal models are required to determine the causal relationship between WIPF3/LIPA and AAA development.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, we could not avoid a selection bias and a survival bias. Second, we had insufficient clinical data and a small sample size, due to the post-mortem study design. According to a summary report of the vital statistics in Japan, 2014,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> more than 80% of older individuals (65 years old and above) die in a hospital. The autopsy rate in this hospital was 40%, and the autopsies were conducted without focusing on a particular disease. The characteristics of the subjects in our study did not differ greatly from those reported for the general population of older residents in Tokyo, Japan.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Due to the small sample size, we had low statistical power for detecting the associations between AAA and the genes reported in this study. In addition, due to the retrospective nature of this study, it was difficult to collect information on WIPF3 and LIPA protein expression levels; thus, we could not analyze associations between protein expression levels and AAA lesion diameters. Consequently, our results should be regarded as hypothesis-generating, and the <italic>WIPF3</italic> and <italic>LIPA</italic> genes should be considered candidate risk factors for AAA. More research is required to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), No. 26460741], the Joint Usage/Research Program of the Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (to Muramatsu M) and the Smoking Research Foundation (to Sawabe M and Arai T).
