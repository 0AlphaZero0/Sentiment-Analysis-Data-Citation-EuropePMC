While ER&#945;36 activity have been related to breast cancer progression or acquired resistance to treatment, expression level and location of ER&#945;36 are poorly documented in the normal mammary gland. Therefore, we explored the consequences of a ER&#945;36 overexpression <italic>in vitro</italic> in MCF-10A normal mammary epithelial cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a unique model of MMTV-ER&#945;36 transgenic mouse strain wherein ER&#945;36 mRNA was specifically expressed in the mammary gland. By a combination of bioinformatics and computational analyses of microarray data, we identified hierarchical gene networks, downstream of ER&#945;36 and modulated by the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Concomitantly, ER&#945;36 overexpression lowered proliferation rate but enhanced migration potential and resistance to staurosporin-induced apoptosis of the MCF-10A cell line. In vivo, ER&#945;36 expression led to duct epithelium thinning and disruption in adult but not in prepubescent mouse mammary gland. These phenotypes correlated with a loss of E-cadherin expression. Here, we show that an enhanced expression of ER&#945;36 is sufficient, by itself, to disrupt normal breast epithelial phenotype in vivo and in vitro through a dominant-positive effect on nongenomic estrogen signaling pathways. These results also suggest that, in the presence of adult endogenous steroid levels, ER&#945;36 overexpression <italic>in vivo</italic> contributes to alter mammary gland architecture which may support pre-neoplastic lesion and augment breast cancer risk.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007546</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de S&#233;curit&#233; Sanitaire de l&#8217;Alimentation, de l&#8217;Environnement et du Travail</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012/2/014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dumond</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>INSERM</institution></funding-source><award-id>ENV201304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dumond</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projet 2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dumond</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>R&#233;gion Lorraine</institution></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chamard-Jovenin</surname><given-names>Cl&#233;mence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders are all French: the Anses - Agence nationale de s&#233;curit&#233; sanitaire de l&#8217;alimentation, de l&#8217;environnement et du travail <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anses.fr/">https://www.anses.fr/</ext-link> (fund 2012/2/014; recipient HD), the Institut national de la sant&#233; et de la recherche m&#233;dicale <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inserm.fr">www.inserm.fr</ext-link> Plan Cancer/environnement (fund ENV201304; recipient HD), La Ligue contre le cancer <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ligue-cancer.net/">www.ligue-cancer.net/</ext-link> (fund 2016; recipient HD) and the R&#233;gion Lorraine for a half PhD fellowship <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lorraine.eu">http://www.lorraine.eu</ext-link> (CC).

The so-called &#8220;genomic estrogen signaling&#8221; is mediated by direct actions of nuclear-localized estrogen receptors (ERs: ERalpha and ERbeta) as ligand-induced transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, estrogen activities are also mediated through nongenomic signaling which involves extranuclear events such as activation of various protein kinases mediated by membrane associated ERs or the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In 2005, Wang and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] identified and cloned a 36-kDa variant of ER&#945;, ER&#945;36, which is mainly located on the plasma membrane and mediates nongenomic estrogenic signaling. ER&#945;36 differs from the canonical 66-kDa estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;66) by the lack of both AF-1 and AF-2 transcription activation domains, and a truncated ligand-binding domain deleted from helix9 to helix12. These structural characteristics are consistent with the fact that ER&#945;36 has no intrinsic transcriptional activity and suggest that it may have a spectrum of ligand selectivity different from the ER&#945;66 one. Although the ability of ER&#945;36 to interact directly with any ligand is still debated, tamoxifen has been demonstrated to bind ER&#945;36 as an agonist like 17&#946;-estradiol, which triggers proliferation, migration and apoptosis escape of breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, ER&#945;36 is generated from a promoter located in the first intron of the ESR1 gene, indicating that its expression can be regulated independently from ER&#945;66 and consistent with the findings that ER&#945;36 is expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells that lack ER&#945;66 expression [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Even in the absence of known agonists, a high expression of ER&#945;36 is a marker of poor survival prognosis for breast cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with its subcellular localization, ER&#945;36 can mediate membrane-initiated signaling through physical interaction with the EGFR/Src/Shc complex, or functional coupling with GPER or HER2, depending of the tumor cell tested [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In various types of cancerous cell lines (endometrial, ER positive or negative breast cancer cells, seminoma cells&#8230;), ER&#945;36 may activate calcium release, the PKC, MAPK/ERK or the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways responsible for cell proliferation, migration and survival [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>ER&#945;36 mRNAs have been found in normal ovary, uterus, breast and testis tissues as well as endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, cartilage, bone, lung and heart [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A sexual dimorphism of protein location was reported in the osteoarticular system where ER&#945;36 appears to associate with plasma membrane only in females. However, the ER&#945;36 physiological role(s), ligand(s) and associated transactivation mechanism(s) in those tissues remain to be determined [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite ER&#945;36 activity have been related to breast cancer progression and acquired resistance to tamoxifen and chemotherapy breast tumor treatment, precise expression level and location of ER&#945;36 is still missing in the normal mammary gland [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The mammary gland is an epidermal appendage, originating from ectodermal and mesodermal elements, whose development is a step by step sequential process which begins in utero at 10.5 day post-co&#239;tum (dpc) in mouse and 4 to 6 weeks in human and ends at adulthood with lactation and involution [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A rudimentary mammary tree is present in newborn females, whereas regression occurred under androgen production during male fetal development [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During female puberty, the epithelium forms into a branching, bilayered ductal structure, consisting of an outer basal myoepithelial layer of cells and an inner luminal cell layer [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Epithelial estrogen and progesterone were shown to be responsible for ductal elongation and side branching, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Several studies based on KO mouse phenotype analyses demonstrated that the estrogen receptors ER&#945; and ER&#946; are dispensable before puberty but required for a correct mammary gland development and function in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, ER&#945; is expressed in epithelial and stromal cells and mediate duct elongation whereas ER&#946; is mostly involved in cell differentiation and function during gestation and lactation [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Despite an abundant and detailed literature dealing with ER&#945;36 expression and function in breast cancer, no data has been reported to date about a putative role of ER&#945;36 in mammary gland normal development or the molecular and cellular consequences of its transactivation.</p><p>In this work, we explored the consequences of a potential ER&#945;36 overexpression in normal mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in a unique model of transgenic mouse strain, in which ER&#945;36 is expressed specifically in the mammary gland. We identified proliferation, survival and migration as the main functions modulated by ER&#945;36 overexpression through STAT3 pathway, and assumed that this could lead to predispose normal mammary epithelial cells to neoplastic like transformation and augment breast cancer risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Mice were housed under constant conditions at a temperature of 22&#177;1&#176;C, a humidity of approximately 40% and a 10h-light/14h-dark cycle.

In the human MCF-10A cell line, ER&#945;36 modulates the expression of genes that control proliferation, survival and migration. The pathways inferred from these data by computational modeling indicate that the regulation of those ER&#945;36 target genes should involve preferentially the JAK2/STAT3 pathway as previously described in breast cancer cells in response to estrogens or anti-estrogens [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These data are in line with the prior assumption of Bj&#246;rnstr&#246;m and Sj&#246;berg [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Marino [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] who proposed that estrogenic signaling takes place through multiple pathways. Indeed, Zhang and Wang [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Fox [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported an ER&#945;36 dependent control of proliferation and resistance to apoptosis through SRC/EGFR/STAT3/5 in breast cancer cells. Since ER&#945;36 has been shown to collaborate with other estrogen or growth factor receptors in numerous cancer cells, our results also raise the possibility that an excess of ER&#945;36 protein could be a dominant positive activator of either the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER, or the EGFR downstream signaling. Indeed, GPER mRNA expression was stimulated by 2.09 fold in MCF-10A cells overexpressing ER&#945;36. Moreover, ER&#945;36 was shown to interact physically with GPER [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and/or to collaborate with GPER to trigger downstream signaling in female reproductive tract, seminoma or breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. JAK2/STAT3 signaling was also reported to be involved in GPER signaling in the hypothalamus and SKBR-3 breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. EGFR mRNA expression was not affected by ER&#945;36 overexpression in normal epithelial cells (data not shown) whereas a positive cross-activation of both gene expression has been reported in seminoma and breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173931.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Since EGF is present in cell culture medium, ER&#945;36 protein could enhance a basal level of EGFR signaling through PI3K/AKT and STAT3/5. In vivo, a combination of EGF and progesterone treatment of ER&#945;KO mice was shown to partially sustain mammary tree elongation and to modulate cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (namely IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling), adhesion, TGF&#946; signaling and apoptosis, four functions identified in the functional analysis of DEGs [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The ER&#945;36 dependent stimulation of STAT3 expression and nuclear localization is of particular interest since constitutively activated STAT3 has been demonstrated to directly contribute to oncogenesis in various cancers by enhancing cell proliferation and migration but preventing cell apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, STAT3 is supposed to be a promising therapeutic target of novel anticancer drugs like methyl ester derivative of synthetic triterpenoid which have been tested in a relevant model of ER negative breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Together with NF-kB, which expression is also increased in ER&#945;36 overexpressing cells, STAT3 has been shown to play a pivotal role in the epigenetic switch linking inflammation to mammary gland tumorigenesis (i) in a model of MCF-10A cells containing and ER-src fusion exposed to tamoxifen as well as (ii) in the pre-tumorigenic state of mammary epithelium from mice constitutively overexpressing ERBB2 [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>In this study, an in vivo mammary specific ER&#945;36 overexpression was performed through the production of a unique MMTV-ER&#945;36 transgenic mouse strain. At weaning, no difference could be observed at the microscopic level in the mammary gland between transgenic and wt mice. However, in ER&#945;36 overexpressing adult virgin females, the mammary gland displayed a significative dilation of the ducts as well as stromal thickening and epithelium thinning and leakage. A similar but limited dilation was also reported by Bocchinfuso [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] after exogenous estradiol treatment of wild-type mice. These results suggest that the endogenous estrogens produced from puberty in ER&#945;36 transgenic mice could signal trough the ER&#945;36 protein and mimic the overstimulated mammary estrogenic response observed in estradiol exposed wt mice. Since ER&#945;36 is able to down regulate ER&#945;66 expression or to behave as a dominant negative of ER&#945;66 activity [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the abnormal epithelium and stromal phenotype could result from an alteration of the correct estrogen signaling pathway. In conclusion, molecular, cellular and tissue phenotype of ER&#945;36 overexpressing models evoke a constitutive estrogenic stimulation. Noteworthy, epithelium thinning and leakage are in line with lower proliferation rate and enhanced migration observed in vitro, respectively.</p><p>To date, commercially available antibodies gave poor results in our hands for the in situ detection of ER&#945;36 receptor in normal or cancerous mammary tissues. However, a basal expression of the ER&#945;36 mRNA (and sometimes of the protein) has been detected in many organs [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since a high level of active ER&#945;36 is known to be one of the main actors of breast cancer progression [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], it would be noteworthy to investigate if ER&#945;36 function in cancer requires either an expression or/and an agonist concentration threshold. Indeed, our data from normal mammary epithelial cells suggest that, in the absence of ligand, ER&#945;36 overexpression is sufficient to trigger cell migration and partial resistance to apoptosis, two hallmarks of cancer cells. In the presence of a physiological adult level of estradiol, ER&#945;36 also mediates mammary epithelium disorganization in vivo, indicating a circuitous estrogen signaling in the presence of a high ER&#945;36 receptor level.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that estrogen mimicking compounds such as long chain alkylphenols stimulate GPER/ER&#945;36 signaling pathways in human seminoma cells [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many papers, namely from Ana M Soto&#8217;s laboratory also demonstrate that fetal or neonatal exposure to BPA or DES alter the estrogen signaling in the developing mouse or rat mammary gland of rodents and predispose animals to develop breast neoplasia later in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0173931.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, the unique model of MMTV-ER&#945;36 transgenic mice described in this study could serve to screen endogenous or xenobiotic molecules, acting as ER&#945;36 agonists or antagonists and to decipher their mechanisms of action. How and when ER&#945;36 expression is initiated and maintained in mammary epithelial cells remain to be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0173931.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Production of ER&#945;36 transgenic mice.</title><p>A.
