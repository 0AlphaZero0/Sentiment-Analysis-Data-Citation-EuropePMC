<italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (<italic>S. mutans</italic>) has been isolated from caries lesions in 1924 and was consequently considered the etiological agent of caries, consistent with Koch`s postulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Its physiological properties were since then analysed in great detail and were in accordance with a role as primary causative agent of cavities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cultivation independent studies, particularly metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses, have completely revolutionized our understanding of oral diseases like caries and periodontitis. They clearly show that <italic>S. mutans</italic> is only a tiny component of the active oral microbiome. Even in caries lesions, it accounts for less than 1% of the active microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the onset of early childhood caries can be predicted by the presence of <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> but not <italic>S. mutans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The etiology of caries is therefore one of the prime examples for the paradigm shift from Koch&#180;s postulates towards the concept of a polymicrobial origin of disease caused by a shift in the composition and metabolic activity of a complex community towards dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is thus important to understand the mechanisms that contribute to dysbiosis development and this will provide novel concepts for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, modifying the interaction pattern could potentially have complex downstream effects on the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Cell-cell communication might be one of the mechanisms that can tip the balance between health and dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Oral biofilms are hot spots of cell-cell communication due to the high species diversity, the physical contact between adjacent cells, and large metabolic activity of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. <italic>S. mutans</italic> is a good model organism for studying the role of QS in oral biofilms because the functioning of its QS system is relatively deeply understood and some of its characteristics are conserved. In streptococci, short hydrophobic peptides induce competence via a RGG type transriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These peptides have been shown to mediate interspecies communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and have been exploited for antibacterial strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Communication can be induced by environmental signals and change the resistance of the bacteria towards cell wall degrading lysozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it is currently not known if streptococci, or <italic>S. mutans</italic> in particular, are competent in their natural habitats in vivo, i.e. in the human or animal host. Metagenomics is not informative in this respect, since it only shows the presence of the DNA, but competence is a strongly regulated phenotype. Sequencing of the total mRNA of the microbial community provides information which genes <italic>S. mutans</italic> is actively transcribing in vivo. Therefore we searched the published metatranscriptomes of periodontal pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for transcripts from <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>A. act.</italic> and investigated if the competence regulator SigX and downstream genes are expressed in the natural biofilm under the prevailing conditions and in the presence of the complex oral microbial community.</p><p>
<italic>S. mutans</italic> synthesizes two quorum sensing (QS) signals, competence inducing peptide (CSP) and sigX inducing peptide (XIP) that are sensed through a two-component signal system (ComDE) and a Rgg-type intracellular transcriptional regulator (ComR), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Upon activation of ComR through binding of XIP, transcription of the alternative sigma-factor SigX is induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We recently showed that CSP controls transcription of mutacins only, thus we suggest to rename it mutacin inducing peptide (MIP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The regulon of SigX in <italic>S. mutans</italic> includes not only the transformasome machinery mediating genetic competence, but also mutacins whose transcription is controlled by the ComE response regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus SigX is the central regulator of QS in <italic>S. mutans</italic>. It is not known if <italic>sigX</italic> is expressed in vivo. Moreover, natural conditions under which MIP is synthesized are unknown. We previously demonstrated induction of <italic>sigX</italic> by the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic>; both transformasome and mutacins were upregulated in co-culture, in accordance with the central role of SigX in <italic>S. mutans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Here we now ask if inter-kingdom communication between <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> is an exception, or if <italic>S. mutans</italic> might be able to communicate with other members of the oral microbiome. We studied its interaction with <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (<italic>A. act).</italic> This pathogen has been regarded as etiological agent of aggressive periodontitis for decades, but today is found to be a minor component of the oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] while periodontitis is regarded as a polymicrobial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], similar to the situation with <italic>S. mutans</italic> and dental caries. For species to interact in the oral cavity, their co-localization in vivo is essential. Only recently has it been possible to observe such co-localization with genus-level taxonomic resolution. In dental plaque samples, interestingly, A<italic>ggregatibacter</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> were found as dense aggregates at the tips of abundant hedgehog structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus studying interactions between <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>A. act.</italic> might reveal mechanisms contributing to biofilm development in the oral cavity.</p><p>
<italic>A. act.</italic> is doomed to co-operate. It entirely depends on other oral microorganisms to grow in saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A &#8220;food for detoxification&#8221; interaction has been unraveled between <italic>A. act</italic>. and the commensal <italic>S. gordonii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. <italic>S. gordonii</italic> excretes lactic acid, which <italic>A. act.</italic> uses as a carbon source, and hydrogen peroxide, which <italic>A. act.</italic> detoxifies, and in a murine abcess model both species are more virulent together than alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Cocultivation with <italic>S. gordonii</italic> triggers expression of the complement resistance protein ApiA in <italic>A. act.</italic> and in such a way increases its resistance to host innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Here we analysed the interaction between <italic>S. mutans</italic> and <italic>A. act</italic>. in dual-species biofilms. We monitored induction of SigX of <italic>S. mutans</italic> using a P<sub>sigX</sub>-GFP reporter strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To determine through which route <italic>A. act.</italic> might communicate with <italic>S. mutans</italic> we deleted key genes of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. We analysed the transcriptomes of both species using RNA sequencing. Finally we asked if competence and mutacin synthesis might be expressed by <italic>S. mutans</italic> also in oral biofilms in vivo. To this end we extracted its transcripts from metatranscriptomes of periodontal pockets and analysed the expression of the SigX regulon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strains, culture conditions and media</title><p>Microorganisms used in this study are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. <italic>A. act.</italic> ATCC 33384 was used in all experiments except for RNA sequencing where the &#8220;rough&#8221; strain HK1651 (CCUG 56173, G&#246;teborg, Sweden) was used because it has a fully assembled and annotated genome.

The expression level of the 50 most highly expressed genes of <italic>S. mutans</italic> is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>.

The competence related genes with an average abundance of transcripts &#8805;0.01% is shown in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The most strongly expressed competence related gene was the master regulator of QS in <italic>S. mutans</italic>, the alternative sigma-factor <italic>sigX</italic> (SMU_1997), which had an average abundance of 0.23%. Additionally, transformasome as well as mutacin related transcripts could be detected.

Interestingly, transcripts of <italic>comC</italic> (SMU_1915), encoding the synthase for the precursor of the mutacin inducing peptide MIP were also detected (0.06%). Not all components of the SigX regulon were found, but since the overall transcript level of <italic>S. mutans</italic> was relatively low, this is probably due to lack of sequencing depth.

However, <italic>s&#237;gX</italic> was not expressed in pure culture of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, neither during exponential growth nor in stationary phase, but was expressed in all four periodontal pockets, sometimes at levels similar (sample pp_8) or even higher (sample pp_09) than those in dual-species biofilms. Since SigX is the master regulator of both competence and bacteriocin synthesis, we therefore hypothesize that <italic>S. mutans</italic> is genetically competent in periodontal pockets.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The expression of the SigX regulon of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the periodontal community (sample AU_08, AU_09, AU_12, AU_19 from (39)</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>Only genes with an average abundance&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.01% are shown</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that cell-cell communication in <italic>S. mutans</italic> was induced by the phylogenetically distantly related species <italic>A. act</italic>.. Induction occurred by a component in the culture medium that was only produced in live dual-species biofilms and that was not produced any more upon deletion of <italic>comS</italic> of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Thus, production of the ComS prepeptide was induced in co-culture, similarly as in dual-species biofilms between <italic>S. mutans</italic> and the fungus <italic>C. albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Leukotoxin and fimbriae are not likely to be involved since both the highly virulent strain HK1651 of <italic>A. act</italic>. and the &#8220;smooth&#8221; type strain induced QS in <italic>S. mutans</italic>. On the other hand, complex media containing components known to block the Opp permease required for import of the extracellular XIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] completely inhibited activation of SigX. This observation shows that the complete autocatalytic cycle of ComS synthesis, processing, export and import was activated in dual species biofilms. Since the stimulating factor is only produced in co-culture, it must be the result of an interaction between the two species in the biofilm. It is unclear if physical contact is required for the primary activation, yet since sterile filtered culture supernatants can activate SigX, this seems unlikely.</p><p>Deletion of the histidine kinase LiaS of <italic>S. mutans</italic> (Smu.486) resulted in a strain that could not be induced by <italic>A. act.</italic> or by synthetic XIP to express <italic>sigX</italic>. LiaS is a sensor histidine kinase which represses glucan binding protein C (<italic>gbpC</italic>) transcription and induces synthesis of mutacin IV (<italic>cipB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In our transcriptome data, <italic>gbpC</italic> was down-regulated, and mutacin IV was upregulated in dual-species biofilms with <italic>A. act</italic>.. Recently, the LiaR regulon was shown to be comprised of three genes, namely Smu.753, Smu.1727 and Smu.2084c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. None of them was differentially expressed in dual species biofilms, which makes it very unlikely that sensing of a specific stimulus was responsible for the effect of LiaS on <italic>sigX</italic> induction. Since our data show that import of externally added, synthetic XIP was not possible in a &#916;<italic>liaS</italic> mutant, we hypothesize that the cell membrane of this mutant was not permeable for XIP any more. Therefore we further hypothesize that exported XIP cannot re-enter the cell and the positive feed-back loop for XIP synthesis cannot be triggered.</p><p>We show that mucin inhibited QS induction in dual-species biofilms in a concentration dependent way. Mucins are glycoproteins contributing to the antimicrobial activity of saliva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], to which we can now add their ability to inhibit the QS of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. This might be caused by blockage of the Opp permease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] that can then not import XIP anymore. Mucin concentration can be decreased in oral biofilms by streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] to levels which no longer block signaling.</p><p>
<italic>S. mutans</italic> down-regulated the expression of genes encoding chaperones and genes involved in oxidative stress in co-culture with <italic>A. act</italic>. suggesting that <italic>A. act</italic>. protected <italic>S. mutans</italic> from oxidative stress. Oxygen may have been depleted by the aerobic respiration of <italic>A. act</italic>.. Surprisingly, its catalase gene was down-regulated in co-culture, and stress and chaperone related genes were up-regulated, in contrast to <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The strong up-regulation of the quinol peroxidase gene also indicates oxidative stress for <italic>A.act.</italic>. These apparent inconsistencies might be caused by oxygen gradients in biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and by differences in the localization of the cells within the biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In dual species biofilms we observed tight balls of <italic>A. act</italic>. embedded in a thick layer of <italic>S. mutans</italic> cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Inside the balls, conditions were most likely anaerobic. Moreover, competition for iron uptake may have stressed the cells especially within the balls. Consistent with these observations, fermentation pathway enzymes were up-regulated in <italic>A.act.</italic> in co-culture.</p><p>
<italic>A.act</italic>. strongly expressed virulence genes both in the presence and absence of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. It was noteworthy that on average 20% of transcriptional activity of this organism was devoted to the <italic>tad</italic> locus producing adhesive fimbriae. The gene encoding leukotoxin was the second most highly expressed gene overall. Thus, in our experimental setup <italic>A. act</italic>. most probably maintained an extremely virulent form. Interestingly, the two genes involved in immune response evasion, encoding catalase KatA and the complement resistance protein ApiA, were repressed in our co-culture, while they were induced in co-culture with <italic>S. gordonii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>A.act.</italic> is more susceptible to the host immune defense in the presence of <italic>S. mutans</italic>, which might explain clinical studies which have found a negative relationship between caries and aggressive periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>Our data show that <italic>S. mutans</italic> probably produces mutacins and is genetically competent in vivo, indicated by the relatively large number of transcripts of <italic>sigX</italic> as well as of many components of the SigX regulon. Moreover, the expression of <italic>comC</italic>, the gene encoding the synthase for the mutacin inducing peptide, was detected in dual species biofilms and in periodontal pockets, but not in biofilms of <italic>S. mutans</italic> alone, neither during exponential growth nor in the stationary phase. Apparently the QS system of <italic>S. mutans</italic> can be induced not only by <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>A. act.</italic>, but also by interaction with diverse members of the oral microbiome. The exact mechanism through which this occurs remains to be elucidated. The data suggest that QS of <italic>S. mutans</italic> is not so much a mechanism for orchestrating gene expression of its own population according to cell density, but a mechanism for adjusting its phenotype to the presence and activity of the oral microbiome. Killing competitors and using their DNA for genetic adaptation provides a powerful survival mechanism in complex communities, but is meaningless in pure culture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The complete quorum sensing regulon of <italic>S. mutans</italic> was induced by <italic>A. act.</italic> by an unknown mechanism which required the presence of ComS, the synthase for the XIP prepeptide. <italic>A. act</italic>. grew in a highly virulent form but down-regulated the genes important for escape from the host immune response in co-culture with <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Transformasome and mutacin genes of <italic>S. mutans</italic> were expressed in periodontal pockets, suggesting that its quorum sensing regulon is active in vivo. Because polymicrobial communities harboring streptococci and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> spp. are causing oral infectious diseases, the observed interactions may have an important role in the dysbiosis of such communities<italic>.</italic>
