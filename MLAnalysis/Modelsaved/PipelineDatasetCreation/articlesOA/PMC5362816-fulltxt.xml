Notably, the function of TRPA1 depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> potentiating and high Ca<sup>2+</sup> inactivating TRPA1. However, it remains unknown how Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerts such contrasting effects. Here, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates TRPA1 through calmodulin, which binds to TRPA1 in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Calmodulin binding enhanced TRPA1 sensitivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked potentiation of TRPA1 at low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but inhibited TRPA1 sensitivity and promoted TRPA1 desensitization at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potentiation and inactivation of TRPA1 were selectively prevented by disrupting the interaction of the carboxy-lobe of calmodulin with a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminus of TRPA1. Calmodulin is thus a critical Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor enabling TRPA1 to respond to diverse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals distinctly.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The survival of animals depends on their ability to detect damaging signals in the environment. TRPA1 is a polymodal damage sensor detecting a wide array of damaging signals including noxious cold, chemical and mechanical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. TRPA1 has been implicated in various physiological processes and medical conditions, such as chemoreception, pain, itch, inflammation, neuropathy and airway diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. TRPA1 has thus become one of the most promising therapeutic targets.</p><p>TRPA1 is highly conserved in detecting harmful chemicals across different species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.

Electrophilic agonists, such as AITC, open TRPA1 through covalent modification of cysteine residues on TRPA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, while non-electrophilic agonists, such as carvacrol, are believed to activate TRPA1 through binding directly to the channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In addition to chemosensation, considerable evidence supports a role for TRPA1 in transducing noxious cold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, though this remains controversial. Furthermore, TRPA1 transduces noxious mechanical stimuli in pathological conditions such as inflammatory pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a ubiquitous second messenger playing a pivotal role in regulating TRPA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It exerts a bimodal effect on TRPA1. Firstly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates and/or potentiates TRPA1 at low concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It is a fundamental mechanism underlying indirect activation of TRPA1 by inflammatory mediators (e.g. histamine) and UV light, both of which act by increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after activating phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> has also been proposed as a mechanism by which cold activates TRPA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> potentiated TRPA1 response to mechanical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation and/or potentiation of TRPA1 thus further diversifies the function of TRPA1. Secondly, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly inactivates TRPA1 following initial channel activation, a process known as desensitization or tachyphylaxis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This process prevents persistent TRPA1 activation, which otherwise may cause cell and tissue damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Despite the central importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of TRPA1, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. It has been reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates TRPA1 by directly binding to an EF hand domain in the N-terminus of TRPA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, this finding has not been consistently observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here, we report that Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts on TRPA1 via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to TRPA1 depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and is essential for the basal sensitivity of TRPA1. Importantly, CaM binding is sufficient to evoke TRPA1 potentiation and inactivation without changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and this effect can be selectively prevented by disrupting the binding of CaM to TRPA1. Therefore, CaM functions as both a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and an effector enabling TRPA1 to sense and respond to diverse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals distinctly.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for TRPA1 potentiation, inhibition and desensitization</title><p>Previous studies have shown that low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations potentiate TRPA1 while high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations desensitize TRPA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. To investigate the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the modulation of TRPA1, we recorded TRPA1 currents from HEK293 cells expressing TRPA1 elicited by the non-electrophilic agonist carvacrol. We found that peak TRPA1 currents increased progressively with increased concentrations of carvacrol without appreciable desensitization in the absence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, 0 [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>&#8201;+&#8201;5&#8201;mM EGTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, top panel). Interestingly, when both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> were chelated (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free&#8201;+&#8201;BAPTA-AM), negligible TRPA1 currents were induced across all doses of carvacrol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, green curve), suggesting that basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is essential for TRPA1 activation and/or potentiation. We then investigated the effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> on TRPA1 in the presence of 2&#8201;mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, TRPA1 exhibited substantially larger currents and much higher sensitivity at lower doses of carvacrol (&lt;400&#8201;&#956;M), leading to a marked leftward shift in the dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). Higher concentrations of carvacrol (&gt;500&#8201;&#956;M) elicited much smaller currents, apparently due to prominent TRPA1 desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Similar effects were also observed with the electrophilic agonist AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data are consistent with the finding that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> promotes both TRPA1 activation and desensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In addition, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influences the basal sensitivity or responsiveness of TRPA1 to channel activators.</p><p>Intriguingly, a further increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> to 10&#8201;mM also inhibited TRPA1 responses to both carvacrol and AITC to a similar degree as removing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B and C</xref>), indicating that high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> also inhibits the basal sensitivity of TRPA1, likely due to an elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> caused by the basal entry of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, leading to channel inhibition. Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates multiple aspects of TRPA1 function including potentiation/activation, inhibition and desensitization. For clarity, both TRPA1 inhibition and desensitization are termed inactivation, though it is unknown whether the two processes employ the same mechanism.</p><p>To define the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> range that triggers potentiation and inactivation, respectively, we plotted TRPA1 currents elicited by carvacrol as a function of different concentrations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, yielding a biphasic response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Based on this curve, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> evoking the maximal TRPA1 response was estimated to be around 1&#8201;mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> below 1&#8201;mM is thus defined as low Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Within this range, Ca<sup>2+</sup> mainly promoted TRPA1 activation with little inhibition or desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>), a process manifesting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potentiation (CDP). By contrast, the inhibition and/or desensitization of TRPA1 became more and more prominent with further increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> range (i.e. &gt;1&#8201;mM), resulting in gradually reduced TRPA1 responses, a process reflecting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI), in addition to CDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>, also see below).</p><p>We next examined TRPA1 potentiation induced by low and high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively, in real-time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref> shows that carvacrol elicited stable inward TRPA1 currents in nominal 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The currents were then rapidly potentiated shortly after Ca<sup>2+</sup> was perfused. Of note, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced TRPA1 potentiation progressively enhanced with increases in perfused Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with a peak potentiation at around 1&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>), consistent with predicated peak TRPA1 response at 1&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>. Notably, peak TRPA1 currents were not desensitized in the presence of carvacrol at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>), showing that low Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a pure CDP process. By contrast, high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced peak TRPA1 currents rapidly reduced following initial potentiation, a process known as acute desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>), leading to a gradual reduction in the overall CDP. CDP at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> is thus a consequence of counteracting actions of concurrent CDP and CDI. Collectively, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key player in multiple TRPA1 functions including the basal sensitivity, CDP and CDI.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TRPA1 binds to CaM depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>We next investigated how TRPA1 senses and responds to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Previous studies did not consistently support the idea that direct binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to TRPA1 mediates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects (see introduction), we wondered whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> act through an intermediate protein, which is not only sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but also binds to TRPA1, forming a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive channel complex. CaM is such a candidate with remarkable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing capability. Indeed, CaM mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> gating of many ion channels, such as TRP, SK, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether CaM binds to TRPA1 using CaM pull-down assay. TRPV1 is known to be regulated by CaM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and was thus used as a positive control. We found that CaM bound to much more TRPA1 than to TRPV1 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The binding was, however, absent without either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or TRPA1/TRPV1 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, the most potent binding to CaM was observed with TRPA1 among thermo-TRP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting a high binding affinity of CaM for TRPA1. Indeed, TRPA1-CaM binding can even be triggered by nanomolar ranges of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>), implying that TRPA1 binds to CaM in the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (&#8764;100&#8201;nM). Furthermore, despite a much lower affinity of CaM for Ba<sup>2+</sup> over Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, Ba<sup>2+</sup> elicited substantial TRPA1-CaM binding, albeit reduced when compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>), further supporting a high binding affinity between TRPA1 and CaM. Consistent with Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced TRPA1-CaM binding, Ba<sup>2+</sup> was capable of regulating TRPA1 (see below). However, Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not induce significant TRPA1-CaM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>), and accordingly did not modulate TRPA1 (see below).</p><p>In support of CaM pull-down assay, TRPA1 was found to bind to CaM in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). CaM contains two different lobes (N- and C-lobe) and each lobe contains two EF hand domains responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. CaM C-lobe exhibits a higher binding affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>Kd</italic>, 10<sup>&#8722;7</sup>&#8201;M) than N-lobe (<italic>Kd</italic>, 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>&#8201;M)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to CaM can thus be selectively disrupted by mutating two different lobes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. There was about a 40% reduction in TRPA1-CaM binding after selectively preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to N-lobe by mutating the first two Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (EF<sub>12</sub>) on N-lobe (CaM<sub>12</sub> mutant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). Mutating the third (EF<sub>3</sub>) and the fourth Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (EF<sub>4</sub>) on C-lobe (CaM<sub>3</sub>, CaM<sub>4</sub> mutants) caused a 60% and an 87% reduction in TRPA1-CaM binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). TRPA1-CaM binding was, however, completely abolished by mutating both Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites on C-lobe (CaM<sub>34</sub> mutant), or by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive CaM<sub>1234</sub> in which all four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites are mutated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). Therefore, binding of CaM to TRPA1 critically depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of CaM, and different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites on CaM play distinct roles in TRPA1 binding: CaM C-lobe is more important in triggering TRPA1 binding, while N-lobe may only play an auxiliary role in the binding process. Even within CaM C-lobe, the role of EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>4</sub> is not identical, with EF<sub>4</sub> having a higher capability of triggering TRPA1 binding than EF<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CaM binds to a non-canonical CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) in TRPA1</title><p>CaM binds to a variety of molecular targets through several classes of CaMBD such as the &#8220;IQ&#8221; motif in Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. However, TRPA1 does not contain any known canonical CaMBDs. To delineate a CaMBD on TRPA1, the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal fragments of TRPA1 coupled to the GST tag were first purified and then used for CaM pull-down assay. CaM bound prominently to the C-terminus of TRPA1, but not to GST, though there was a negligible binding to the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Similar results were also obtained with Flag pull-down assay in which purified Flag-coupled TRPA1 cytoplasmic tails were used to pull down pure CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). To further narrow down the binding, we truncated the C-terminus of TRPA1 progressively. Deleting the distal 114 amino acids (AA) (R1012-F1125) enhanced CaM binding, but a further deletion of 17 residues (L995-N1011) completely eliminated CaM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that the 17AA is a key CaMBD.</p><p>To validate whether the 17AA is a <italic>bona fide</italic> CaMBD, we synthesized a peptide identical in sequence to the 17AA. As anticipated, the binding of CaM to the C-terminus of TRPA1 was abrogated by incorporating the peptide in CaM pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). A scrambled peptide was, however, ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). As a positive control, the binding was also abolished by the CaM antagonistic peptide CALP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The specificity of the CaMBD peptide was further tested on full-length TRPA1. Consistently, TRPA1-CaM binding was almost abolished by the CaMBD peptide, but not by the scrambled peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p>To verify whether CaM binds directly to the CaMBD peptide forming a CaM-peptide complex, we incubated the peptide with pure CaM in different molar ratios and then resolved protein complexes on non-denaturing PAGE gels followed by silver staining for visualization. CaM did not exhibit a mobility shift after incubation with the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>, top panel), presumably the peptide is not large enough (17aa) to alter CaM mobility. But intriguingly, the intensity of CaM gradually enhanced with increasing ratios of peptide to CaM in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The effect was abolished by removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F and G</xref>), suggesting the formation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaM-peptide complex, which contains more amino acid side chains for binding to silver ions than pure CaM, resulting in enhanced silver stain. These experiments conclusively demonstrate that the 17 AA in the C-terminus of TRPA1 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> CaMBD and that CaM binds directly to TRPA1.</p><p>We next deleted the CaMBD from TRPA1. As expected, CaM binding was dramatically reduced in CaMBD-lacking TRPA1 (&#916;TRPA1), though incompletely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3H</xref>), suggesting the presence of other minor CaM binding regions elsewhere in TRPA1, likely in the N terminus.</p><p>Of note, the CaMBD is rich in hydrophobic residues, consistent with the binding preference of CaM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Interestingly, based on the recently resolved TRPA1 structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, the CaMBD corresponds precisely to the &#946;-strand domain with unknown function flanked by the TRP-like domain and coiled-coil domain in the C-terminus of TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3I</xref>), two important structural domains critical for modulating TRPA1 gating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Notably, the CaMBD is freely exposed in the periphery of TRPA1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3I</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, making this domain physically accessible to CaM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CaM is essential for TRPA1 CDP</title><p>To test a possible role for CaM in regulating TRPA1, we first investigated whether CaM potentiates TRPA1, as does low Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

A similar potentiation was also observed with Ba<sup>2+</sup>, though to a less degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C and D</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced TRPA1 potentiation was significantly enhanced when cells overexpressed CaM or CaM<sub>12</sub> or CaM<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B and D</xref>), consistent with their ability to bind to TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Such enhancement was absent in cells expressing CaM<sub>4</sub>, or CaM<sub>34</sub> or CaM<sub>1234</sub> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>), all of which exhibited little (CaM<sub>4</sub>) or no binding (CaM<sub>34</sub>, CaM<sub>1234</sub>) to TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>), suggesting that CaM binding is critical for TRPA1 CDP and that EF<sub>4</sub> on CaM C-lobe is indispensable for this process. Enhanced CDP may be caused by a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to increased initial TRPA1 responses evoked by carvacrol in the presence of overexpressed CaM. However, there were no positive correlations between the initial peak current amplitudes and CDP (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.044, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>), suggesting that enhanced CDP is not due to different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> entry. Taken together, increases in either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or CaM can elicit CDP. Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM thus act cooperatively to potentiate TRPA1 under low Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>To determine whether CDP could be prevented by disrupting TRPA1-CaM binding, we took advantage of the potent binding between CaM and TRPA1 CaMBD, and substituted the CaMBD for the cytoplasmic tail in Tac antigen, an &#945;-subunit of interleukin-2 receptor with a single membrane-spanning domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, to produce a Tac-A1-CaMBD chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). We then co-expressed Tac-A1-CaMBD to sequester endogenous CaM. Co-expressed Tac-A1-CaMBD markedly reduced CDP induced by 0.5&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and completely abolished CDP evoked by 10&#8201;&#956;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F and G</xref>). In contrast, CDP was not significantly affected by Tac co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F and G</xref>). Similarly, TRPA1 CDP was also blocked by the CaM antagonist W-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F and G</xref>), validating an essential role for CaM in eliciting TRPA1 CDP. TRPA1 CDP was also observed in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Importantly, CDP was significantly prevented by including the CaMBD peptide in the pipette, while a scrambled peptide was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4H and I</xref>). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate a critical role for CaM in governing TRPA1 sensitivity and CDP.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CaM is critical for TRPA1 CDI</title><p>To investigate a role of CaM in regulating TRPA1 CDI, we first examined whether CaM inhibits TRPA1 in high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (&gt;1&#8201;mM). Indeed in 2&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, TRPA1 currents evoked by all doses of carvacrol were robustly inhibited by over-expressed CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>), an effect analogous to that induced by higher 10&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, increases in either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or CaM inhibit TRPA1 in the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> range. The inhibitory effect was also observed with the N-lobe mutant CaM<sub>12</sub>, but not with the C-lobe mutant CaM<sub>34</sub> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive CaM<sub>1234</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting a critical role for CaM C-lobe in this process. Similar effects were also observed with another TRPA1 agonist AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast to a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the sensitivity of TRPA1 was also inhibited by blocking endogenous CaM with the CaM antagonist W-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>), further supporting the idea that CaM is essential for the basal sensitivity of TRPA1.</p><p>We then investigated whether CaM is involved in TRPA1 desensitization. To this end, TRPA1 was activated by consecutive pulses of carvacrol. Peak TRPA1 current was typically reduced in the second activation resulting in tachyphylaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). CaM overexpression promoted TRPA1 tachyphylaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E and F</xref>). To measure acute desensitization, TRPA1 was maximally activated by AITC to allow desensitization to fully evolve following initial channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Remarkably, CaM overexpression accelerated the desensitization rate of TRPA1, leading to a marked reduction in the time constant of desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G and H</xref>), despite overall smaller peak currents with CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G and I</xref>). The accelerated desensitization of TRPA1 was not affected by CaM<sub>12</sub>, CaM<sub>3</sub> and CaM<sub>4</sub>, all of which retained TRPA1 binding, but was absent in the C-lobe mutant CaM<sub>34</sub> and CaM<sub>1234</sub>, both of which were deficient for TRPA1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5H</xref>), suggesting that CaM binding is also crucial for inducing TRPA1 desensitization and that EF<sub>34</sub> in CaM C-lobe is critical in this process. Taken together, CaM inhibits TRPA1 sensitivity in the basal state and promotes TRPA1 desensitization in the activation state of the channel in high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and both processes require CaM C-lobe.</p><p>To investigate whether TRPA1 desensitization could be prevented by disrupting TRPA1-CaM binding, we used the CaM chelator Tac-A1-CaMBD and the CaMBD peptide. In HEK293 cells expressing TRPA1, co-expression of Tac-A1-CaMBD significantly reduced the desensitization rate of TRPA1 induced by 2&#8201;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5J and L</xref>). An analogous effect was also observed with the CaM antagonist W-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5J and L</xref>). In native DRG neurons, Currents induced by the TRPA1 agonist AITC underwent similar rapid desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5K and L</xref>). The acute desensitization was significantly prevented by including in the pipette the CaMBD peptide, but not by a scrambled peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5L</xref>), further demonstrating that CaM is critical for TRPA1 desensitization. As an alternative approach, we used Ba<sup>2+</sup>, which elicited a reduced TRPA1-CaM binding compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Accordingly, Ba<sup>2+</sup> prevented desensitization induced by consecutive pulses of carvacrol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5M and N</xref>). These experiments further demonstrate that CaM binding is required for TRPA1 desensitization.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CaM binding sites responsible for TRPA1 CDP and CDI</title><p>To identify CaM effector sites on TRPA1 responsible for CDP and CDI, we mutated 16 residues on CaMBD individually to the negatively charged glutamic acid, in an attempt to disrupt TRPA1-CaM interaction. To investigate the effect of these mutants on CDP, the mutated channels were activated using lower dose of carvacrol in order to avoid saturating TRPA1 mutants based on their dose-response curves (data not shown). TRPA1 CDP was abolished by mutating W996, R999, and P1010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). A pronounced deficit in CDP was also observed in Y997E, V1008E and Y1009E TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Interestingly, three of these mutants (W996E, V1008E and P1010E) also exhibited significant impairment in acute desensitization induced by AITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). The three sites are thus critical for transducing both CDP and CDI. In contrast, three other mutants (i.e. Y997E, R999E, and Y1009E) exhibited selective deficit in CDP without an impairment in CDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Notably, impaired desensitization in W996E, V1008E and P1010E was rescued by over-expressing CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and C</xref>), showing that impaired desensitization is due to diminished CaM binding and is not intrinsic to these mutants. On the other hand, V1001E exhibited an enhanced potentiation and accelerated desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). A significant enhancement in CDP was also observed in Q1003E and S1005E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Presumably, mutating these sites caused over-compensation of CaM binding to other functional sites such as W996. Neither potentiation nor desensitization was affected in other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether CDP and CDI are affected in &#916;TRPA1 in which CaMBD has been deleted, but found that &#916;TRPA1 was non-functional (data not shown). The lack of function in &#916;TRPA1 could be due either to impaired CaM binding or to structural disturbance. Of note, tryptophan is a conserved residue targeted by CaM among many other CaM effectors, such as CaMKII<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, underscoring a pivotal role for W996 in governing Ca<sup>2+</sup> gating of TRPA1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TRPA1 CDP and CDI are mediated by overlapping but distinct sets of effector sites on the CaMBD of TRPA1.</p><p>We finally demonstrated whether CaM binding is disrupted in the TRPA1 mutants with defective CDP/CDI. In silver staining of CaM-peptide complex, enhanced CaM staining due to bound CaMBD peptide was significantly diminished by mutating either W996, or V1008 or P1010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F and G</xref>), suggesting that CaM-peptide binding is disrupted in these mutants. A further experiment from co-immunoprecipitation also validated that CaM binding was significantly impaired in the W996E, V1008E and P1010E mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D and E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerts multiple and opposing effects on TRPA1. However, it has been a mystery how TRPA1 senses different Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor) and translates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into the gating of the channel (Ca<sup>2+</sup> effector), leading to opposing effects. In this study we have found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> gating of TRPA1 depends on CaM, which binds to TRPA1, forming a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing channel complex. In the basal state, CaM either enhances (low Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or inhibits (high Ca<sup>2+</sup>) TRPA1 sensitivity. In the activated state, CaM promotes either TRPA1 activation (low Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or desensitization (high Ca<sup>2+</sup>). These effects were prevented by either mutating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites on CaM or by mutating the CaM binding sites on TRPA1. CaM thus acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and an effector responsible for regulating TRPA1 sensitivity and activation in both the basal state and activation state.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects were mediated by CaM C-lobe, without a significant role for N-lobe in these processes. The two lobes of CaM are thus not the source that drives opposing Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on TRPA1. This is in contrast to CaV<sub>2.1</sub> and TMEM16 chloride channels that employ the C-lobe and N-lobe of CaM to transduce channel facilitation and inactivation, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Interestingly, EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>4</sub> in the C-lobe triggered different degrees of TRPA1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>), suggesting that EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>4</sub> have different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding capabilities and maybe the origin responsible for detecting different Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels for TRPA1. Consistently, EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>4</sub> participate in different aspects of TRPA1 regulation. Specifically, EF<sub>3</sub> is only involved in TRPA1 CDI, but EF<sub>4</sub> participates in both TRPA1 CDP and CDI. In keeping with distinct roles of EF<sub>3</sub> and EF<sub>4</sub> in TRPA1 regulation, some CaM effector sites on TRPA1 mediated only CDP, while others transduced both CDP and CDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). It is thus conceivable that TRPA1 CDP and CDI may be mediated by two different forms of interactions between CaM C-lobe and CaM effector sites on TRPA1, with one form of interaction promoting CDP and another favouring CDI. This possibility could arise from different binding stoichiometries between TRPA1 and CaM.</p><p>It is noteworthy that over-expressed CaM can still exert an additional effect on TRPA1 CDP/CDI, supporting that TRPA1 is far from saturated by endogenous CaM. TRPA1-CaM binding can even be triggered by nanomolar ranges of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is sufficient to cause a preassociation of CaM with TRPA1, which may explain why TRPA1 still exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in inside-out excised patches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, a patch configuration in which all associated intracellular molecules (e.g. CaM) are assumed to have been lost. It is very likely that residual CaM remains associated with excised TRPA1 channels due to, for example, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, which could prevent the complete loss of associated CaM. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CaM<sub>1234</sub> (apoCaM) did not pre-associate with TRPA1, in contrast to other ion channels, such as L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The lack of binding of apoCaM with TRPA1 explains why CaM<sub>1234</sub> had no dominant-negative action on TRPA1, which is the main evidence leading to the exclusion of a possible role for CaM in TRPA1 regulation in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Our results support that the binding of CaM C-lobe is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of TRPA1. Indeed, all the TRPA1-CaM binding can be eliminated by the C-lobe mutant CaM<sub>34</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast, no associated deficits in TRPA1 modulation were observed in the N-lobe mutant CaM<sub>12</sub>, even though CaM<sub>12</sub> caused a 40% reduction in TRPA1 binding, suggesting that N-lobe may only play an accessory role in the binding process. It is possible that once loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM C-lobe acts as both a tether anchoring CaM to CaMBD in TRPA1 and an effector transmitting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent channel gating, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded N-lobe may trigger the binding of CaM to other regions in TRPA1, such as the N terminus, acting as a second tether but without influencing channel gating. This possibility is supported by the evidence that there was a weak binding between CaM and the N terminus of TRPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>) and that deleting CaMBD from C-terminal TRPA1 did not completely abolish CaM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3H</xref>). However, it remains to be tested whether there is a second CaMBD in the N terminus of TRPA1 contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of TRPA1.</p><p>In this case, a proximal N-terminal ankyrin repeat (AR) domain in TRPA1 has been implicated as a critical region for mediating TRPA1 desensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, we did not find the binding of CaM to the AR domain (data not shown). The AR domain is thus unlikely to be a second CaMBD. A most likely second CaMBD seems to lie in the region nearby the linker domain and/or pre-S1 helix in the N terminus of TRPA1. These regions are structurally in close proximity to the C-terminal CaMBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3I</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, and could cooperate with each other to modulate TRPA1 CDP and CDI.</p><p>The C-terminal CaMBD of TRPA1 is adjacent to the ion permeation pathway allowing CaM to detect rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, agreeing with previous studies demonstrating that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> regulates TRPA1 through binding to a channel site that needs to be very close to the channel pore<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Notably, the identified six CaM effector sites on TRPA1 are very close either to the TRP domain or to the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3I</xref>), two important structural domains implicated in TRPA1 gating. It is conceivable that a slight conformational change in these effector sites due to CaM binding could have significant impact on either the TRP domain or the coiled-coil domain or both, leading to distinct functional outcomes. The unique position of CaMBD thus not only enables TRPA1 to sense Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but also allows the channel to translate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into channel gating. The revealed accessible CaMBD in TRPA1 could thus be a potential drug targeting region for tuning the channel for therapeutics.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK293 cells and mice DRG neurons were cultured as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.
