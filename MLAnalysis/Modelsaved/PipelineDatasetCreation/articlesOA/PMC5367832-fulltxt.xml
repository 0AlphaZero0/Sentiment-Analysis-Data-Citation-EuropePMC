Recent studies have shown that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from MAITs selectively redifferentiate into MAITs without altering their antigen specificity. Such a selective differentiation is a prerequisite for the use of MAITs in cell therapy and/or regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we performed methylome and transcriptome analyses of MAITs during the course of differentiation from iPSCs. Our multi-omics analyses revealed that recombination-activating genes (<italic>RAG1</italic> and <italic>RAG2</italic>) and DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (<italic>DNTT</italic>) were highly methylated with their expression being repressed throughout differentiation. Since these genes are essential for V(D)J recombination of the T cell receptor (TCR) locus, this indicates that nascent MAITs are kept from further rearrangement that may alter their antigen specificity. Importantly, we found that the repression of <italic>RAG</italic>s was assured in two layers: one by the modulation of transcription factors for <italic>RAG</italic>s, and the other by DNA methylation at the <italic>RAG</italic> loci. Together, our study provides a possible explanation for the unaltered antigen specificity in the selective differentiation of MAITs from iPSCs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mituyama</surname><given-names>Toutai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K16089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4853-0153</contrib-id><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Yutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26430084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/index.html">http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/index.html</ext-link>) to TM and YS; a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)(15K16089) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html">http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html</ext-link>) to YS; and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (26430084) from JSPS to CS and HW.

However, these differentiated cells need to be warranted for proper functionalities and constant identities when clinical applications are envisaged. In the case of T cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) give rise to immature T cells such as double negative and double positive T cells comprising polyclonal populations harboring a different set of T cell receptors (TCR) [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TCR are composed of V (D) and J regions that stem from DNA rearrangements of V (D) and J gene segments [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. V(D)J recombination is mediated by a series of enzymes such as recombination-activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) and DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (DNTT). RAG1 and RAG2 recognize signal sequences in V (D) and J segments in genomic DNA, and cleave DNA to rearrange these fragments. DNTT inserts additional nucleotides at the junction (N-region) of the rearranging TCR. Different combinations of V (D) and J gene segments produce TCR with different antigen specificities, thereby enabling T cells to recognize diverse peptidic antigens. However, the polyclonality of T cells has made it difficult to utilize these cells for cell therapy for two reasons. The first issue is intrinsic to the polyclonality of T cells generated from pluripotent cells because the repertoire of TCR is diverse and harbors no specificity to antigens. The second issue is that HSC- and/or ESC-derived T cells still possess the machinery relevant to DNA rearrangements, which may result in further rearrangements in TCR, thereby allowing TCR alternations. In this case, original antigen specificity will be lost, which is inconvenient for cell therapy. Even though the rejuvenation of T cells recognizing specific antigens for HIV and cancer via reprogramming and redifferentiation has been reported, external cues such as anti-CD3/CD28 stimuli have been required to shut down the expression of RAGs and maintain the original TCR [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, Wakao et al. reported that invariant T cells, called mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs), may be differentiated from iPSCs in a highly selective manner without such external stimuli when iPSCs are prepared from MAITs (MAIT-iPSCs) [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>MAITs are innate-like T cells harboring an invariant TCR&#945; chain (<italic>TRAV1-2</italic>-<italic>TRAJ33</italic> in both human and mouse), and recognize the vitamin B2 metabolites presented on MHC class I-related protein (MR1) [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. MAITs play a pivotal role in host defenses against infectious diseases such as bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, and have been implicated in autoimmune and metabolic diseases as well as in cancer, which are often accompanied by the depletion of MAITs from the peripheral blood [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, MAIT cell reprogramming and the selective redifferentiation of MAITs from MAIT-iPSCs are promising strategies for cell therapy and/or regenerative medicine for the above diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective differentiation need to be elucidated in more detail, and proper functionality with an appropriate epigenetic status must be ensured before <italic>in vivo</italic> use.</p><p>In the present study, we obtained transcriptome and methylome data relevant to governing T cell identities by comparing the differentiation of T cells from HSC and that of MAITs from MAIT-iPSCs (reMAITs). Our results revealed a difference in the expression of transcripts relevant to the V(D)J recombination machinery concomitant with that in DNA methylation at the corresponding gene loci, which may explain the quasi-exclusive generation of reMAITs from MAIT-iPSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Transcriptome and methylome profiling of reMAITs</title><p>In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the selective differentiation of reMAITs from MAIT-iPSCs, we conducted transcriptome (mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs)) and methylome profiling using microarrays. We sampled reMAITs during the course of differentiation from MAIT-iPSCs as well as MAITs from cord blood (CB MAITs). We used immature T cells differentiated from HSCs as a control. We selected four time points for reMAITs and immature T cells: Start, Early, Middle, and Late (Refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Materials and methods</xref> for a definition of these time points). The transcriptome and methylome of reMAITs both evolved with differentiation, gradually becoming similar to those of CB MAITs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174699.g001">Fig 1a</xref>).

These results demonstrated that reMAITs gained similar transcriptome and methylome to CB MAITs as they differentiated [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

We herein demonstrated that V(D)J recombination was suppressed in reMAITs through the repression of relevant genes such as <italic>RAG</italic>s and <italic>DNTT</italic>. The repression of <italic>RAG</italic>s was achieved at least in two layers: one by transcription factors, and the other by the DNA methylation of loci. This double-layered regulation may ensure that reMAITs are not subjected to further rearrangements that ultimately alter antigen specificity and, thus, T cell identity. This lock mode may be specific to MAITs with semi-invariant TCR because the rejuvenation of HIV and/or cancer antigen-specific T cells via reprogramming accompanies <italic>RAG</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], similar to immature T cells from HSC in this study. Future studies need to clarify what cue(s) or factor(s) trigger differential DNA methylation at <italic>RAGs</italic> and <italic>DNTT</italic> loci, and how they keep these loci hypermethylated during the differentiation of reMAITs from MAIT-iPSCs. The elucidation of such cue(s) or factor(s) may lead to the more efficient differentiation of antigen-specific T cells without further rearrangements in TCR.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that TCR rearrangements are regulated not only by <italic>RAG</italic> expression, but also by the epigenetic status of TCR loci [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. According to this model, the chromatin structure of TCR loci modulates the accessibility of RAG proteins to these loci, thereby regulating rearrangement efficiency. Although this type of regulation has been extensively studied in terms of histone modifications, limited information is currently available on the DNA methylation status of MAITs. Our preliminary data on MAIT-specific TCR loci demonstrated demethylation close to and within the <italic>TRAV1-2</italic> and <italic>TRAJ33</italic> loci, while the loci were heavily methylated in immature T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174699.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This difference may be responsible for the strong expression of <italic>TRAV1-2</italic>-<italic>TRAJ33</italic> in reMAITs at the Late stage of differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further analyses are warranted in order to establish whether these differentially methylated sites affect TCR rearrangement efficiency and influence histone modifications.</p><p>Regarding miRNAs, only five miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between reMAITs and immature T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174699.g003">Fig 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174699.s006">S4 Table</xref>). Such a small number of miRNAs is due, in part, to the relatively limited number of probes available for microarrays (targeting 2,027 miRNAs versus 21,754 mRNAs). Alternatively, miRNAs may have weaker effects on the fate determination of reMAITs than epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation and transcription factors relevant to <italic>RAG</italic> expression. We were unable to identify any differentially expressed miRNAs that target <italic>RAG</italic>s, <italic>DNTT</italic>, or the transcription factors pertinent to the promoter activity of <italic>RAG</italic>s (limma, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, from an omics point of view, the differential gene expression observed between reMAITs and immature T cells may, in part, be attributed to differential miRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174699.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). However, the effects of this differential expression of miRNAs on the destiny of T cells have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Although the transcriptome and methylome of reMAITs at the Late stage became similar to those of CB MAITs from an omics point of view (correlation coefficients of 0.909 for gene expression and 0.958 for DNA methylation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174699.s003">S1 Table</xref>), a discrepancy was noted between reMAITs and CB MAITs in terms of the specific genes for MAITs (e.g. <italic>ZBTB16</italic> and <italic>KLRB1</italic> (<italic>CD161</italic>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174699.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This may be due to reMAITs, which differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic>, lacking the appropriate external cue(s) that are a prerequisite for acquiring final differentiation (maturation) concomitant with changes in the transcriptome and epigenome. We previously revealed that the adoptive transfer of reMAITs into mice resulted in migration into different tissues, and this was accompanied by a conversion from the naive to memory type based on cell surface antigens [<xref rid="pone.0174699.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, in order to realize regenerative medicine and/or cell therapy with reMAITs, the external cue(s) that confer the final maturation of reMAITs with appropriate functionality need to be identified.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has provided possible transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by which the antigen specificity of MAITs during differentiation from iPSCs was preserved through the suppression of V(D)J recombination. In order to establish whether these mechanisms are applicable to constraining the T cell fate, comprehensive analyses with T cells other than MAITs will be necessary in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human cord blood (CB) was obtained from the Japanese Red Cross, Hokkaido Block Blood Center with written informed consent.
