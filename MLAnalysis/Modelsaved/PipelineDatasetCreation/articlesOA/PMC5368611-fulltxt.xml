In the present study, the mycosynthesis of spherical nano-Ag (12.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.8&#8201;nm) from extracellular filtrate of local endophytic <italic>T. harzianum</italic> SYA.F4 strain which have interested mixed bioactive metabolites (alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, nitrate reductase (320&#8201;nmol/hr/ml), carbohydrate (25&#8201;&#956;g/&#956;l) and total protein concentration (2.5&#8201;g/l) was reported. Industrial mycosynthesis of nano-Ag can be induced with different characters depending on the fungal cultivation and physical conditions. Taguchi design was applied to improve the physicochemical conditions for nano-Ag production, and the optimum conditions which increased its mass weight 3 times larger than a basal condition were as follows: AgNO<sub>3</sub> (0.01&#8201;M), diluted reductant (10&#8201;v/v, pH 5) and incubated at 30&#8201;&#176;C, 200&#8201;rpm for 24&#8201;hr. Kinetic conversion rates in submerged batch cultivation in 7&#8201;L stirred tank bioreactor on using semi-defined cultivation medium was as follows: the maximum biomass production (X<sub>max</sub>) and maximum nano-Ag mass weight (P<sub>max</sub>) calculated (60.5&#8201;g/l and 78.4&#8201;g/l respectively).

In recent years, engineered nanoparticles have achieved particular attention as a potential candidate for improving crop yield, resistance, and disease management technologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It is understood that the use of pesticides in agriculture is becoming more hazardous day by day. In order to replace such toxic materials by equally useful substances is an excellent choice, especially easily available metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) which are antimicrobial for most of the fungal and bacterial diseases in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. There are several methods reported for the synthesis of MNPs including physical, chemical and biological methods. Biological method is cheap, reliable, safe and non toxic over physical and chemical methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Among all microbial entities, the fungi were taking the centre stage of studies on biological generation of MNPs because of the tolerance and bioaccumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Fungi are efficient secretor of extra cellular bioactive compounds &amp; proteins and it can easily obtain its large scale production for MNPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Over the past decades, Ag NPs over an attractive considerable interest among the emerging nanomaterials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.This may be backed to the fact of their excellent and unique electromagnetic, optical, catalytic properties, and their antimicrobial effects against numerous microbes along with anti-proliferative effects compared with other metal nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Using microbes, especially their cell-free extracts, for the synthesis of nano-Ag can be advantageous compared with other biological processes because microbial resources are abundant in nature, are easy to culture, and have the potential to be scaled up for large-scale synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>Endophytic fungi are taxonomically and biologically diverse and dwell within robust plant tissue by having a symbiotic association. They have proven to be promising sources of new and biologically active natural products for exploitation in modern medicine, agriculture and industry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Supra-molecular complexes of peptides to proteins, sugars to polysaccharides, terpenoids, polyphenols, glycosides, plant and microbial derived compounds, viral particles, etc., are being constantly explored for the biosynthesis of nano-Ag and novel carriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. These proteins and biomolecules will often associate with nanoparticles that must be preventing the agglomeration and stabilize nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Fungi can produce nanoparticles both extracellularly as well as intracellularly however the exact mechanism is not understood completely. Putative mechanisms during intracellular synthesis include heavy metal binding to fungal cell wall by proteins or enzymes present on it via electrostatic interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Furthermore, the metal ions are reduced by enzymes present in cell wall. This leads to aggregation of metal ions and formation of nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Extracellular synthesis assumed interaction of metal ions and release of enzyme mainly reductase with subsequent formation of nanoparticles in solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Extracellular synthesis of nanoparticles has advantages as it does not require lyses of fungal cell, downstream processing for recovery and purification of nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Whereas, in case of intracellular synthesis recovery and purification of nanoparticles from fungi biomass is tedious task and hence analytical equipments and long processing techniques are required<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Fungi of the genus <italic>Trichoderma</italic> are a very large microbial group that play a significant role in the environment and utilized in various industry branches mainly in the production of enzymes, antibiotics, and other metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> reported that all of the <italic>Trichoderma</italic> species studied were efficient in production of nano-Ag specifically <italic>T. virens</italic>; so these species could also be used in future to explore applications of the nano-Ag<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> have studied the growth inhibition effect of three types of nano-Ag against 18 different plant pathogenic fungi <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nano-Ag was used as an alternative to pesticides to control the <italic>sclerotia</italic>-forming phytopathogenic fungi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The antifungal effect of doubly encapsulated nano-Ag solution against rose powdery mildew (leaf distortion, leaf curling, early defoliation, and reduced flowering) caused by <italic>Sphaerotheca pannosa var rosae</italic> was also studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>The green synthesis of nano-Ag involves three main criteria which must be evaluated based on the green chemistry perspectives include choice of solvent medium, variety of environmentally benign reducing agent and range of nontoxic substances for the Ag Nps stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The UV&#8211;Vis spectra recorded from the reaction medium at different pH values and the temperature also play an important role in acceleration the process of AgNPs production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Different reports suggested that a variety of biomolecules are involved in biological synthesis of nanoparticle, such biomolecules are likely to be inactivated like polysaccharides and proteins under the extremely acidic conditions (pH 3.0) and start to work effectively in neutral and slightly alkaline conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. On another hand, the noticeable difference in the mixture colors obtained over the range of pH could be ascribed to a variation in the dissociation constants (pKa) of functional groups on the biomass that are involved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Some reports also revealed that when the temperature is increased, the reactants are consumed rapidly leading to the formation of smaller nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Taguchi is a simple and effective statistical method, which organizes a systematic experimentation to determine the near to optimum settings of design parameters for performance, quality, and cost. In this method, a large number of variables are studied with a small number of experiments using orthogonal arrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In the Taguchi approach, an orthogonal arrays and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used for the analysis of experimentations. By using ANOVA, the effect of factors can be estimated and by orthogonal arrays the minimum number of experiments is needed. In this method variability of parameters is expressed by signal-to noise (S/N) ratio, which represents the ratio of desirable results (signal) to undesirable results (noise). In this statistical method the S/N ratio is used to measure the quality characteristic derivation from the desired value. The maximum S/N ratio is considered as the optimal condition as the variability is inversely proportional to the S/N ratio<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Taguchi method has been used for devising a suitable strategy to perform experiments as well as for quality control purposes in optimized conditions. Basically, the Taguchi experimental design is used to get information such as main effects of design parameters from minimum number of experiments. This method has been applied to nanoparticles for a limited number of syntheses, including silver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, zinc oxide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and silica<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, but this technique has not been applied to mycosynthesis of nano-Ag reaction.</p><p>The integration of engineering concepts with biological principles is one of the major contributions from &#8220;Biochemical Engineering&#8221; to the new biotechnology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Engineering studies are always interested in consistently producing large quantities of natural bioactive products over long periods of time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The best way to achieve this goal will be to grow the cells in a bioreactor where the cellular activity can be controlled efficiently. Historically, biochemical engineers have solved problems and accomplished designs necessary to implement at a large scale processes demonstrated in the laboratory involving enzymes, cells, and/or biological raw materials. This traditional scale-up role of biochemical engineers remains an important activity in practice and also in research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The theoretical parts for microbial processing start with the concept of growth limiting nutrients. There are several mathematical relationships of specific growth rate coefficient to concentration of growth-limiting nutrient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Medium and culture condition optimization has been reported in previous researches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, but quantitative analysis of nano-Ag production process and combining the analysis with optimization operation has been never reported. Kinetic modeling is considered to be a useful means for quantitative analysis, optimization and scaling-up of fermentation processes.</p><p>In this work; endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy organic tomato plant parts and screened for the mycosynthesis of nano-Ag by using exteracelular, periplasmic or cytoplasmic fractions.

In this experiment; the Taguchi orthogonal arrays (OA) method was used to identify the optimal conditions and to select the reaction parameters that have the most significant effect on the dry mass weight of nano-Ag.

The analysis of variance using ANOVA test was generated and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t7">Table 7</xref>. This indicates that there is a statistically significant relationship between the variables at 99.00% confidence level. In the Taguchi method, the signal/noise (S/N) ratio is a measure of signal quality and deviation from the desired value. The term &#8220;signal&#8221; represents the desired value (mean), whereas &#8220;noise&#8221; represents an undesired value (standard deviation from mean) for output characteristics. Taguchi method was used to identify the optimal reaction conditions and influencing parameters on dry weight of nano-Ag and for this purpose the obtained experimental data were processed with the &#8220;larger the better&#8221; quality characteristics. In this experimental setup, we used higher S/N ratio is better. The S/N ratio was determined and found that the interpretation of plot of S/N ratios is opposite to main effect plot. The results of S/N ratio study showed that at higher S/N ratio larger dry mass weight of nano-Ag was obtained and found that the precursor conc. (M) and reductant conc (v/v) are a significant parameter for the control of dry weight of nano-Ag while agitation speed had insignificant effects on these results. The level average graph of the raw data is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref> which shown the contribution percentage of all factors for nano-Ag production. Based on the S/N and ANOVA analyses, the optimal parameters for nano-Ag production are the precursor conc., at 0.01&#8201;M, the diluted reductant at 10 (v/v) and the agitation speed at 200&#8201;rpm. The final step in the Taguchi method is to predict and verify the improvement of the quality characteristic using the optimal level of the design parameters. Finally, the estimated dry mass weight of nano-Ag can be obtained as 28.8&#8201;mg/l. The predicted <italic>S/N</italic> ratio for standard deviation can also be calculated by the same procedure. The predicted value with the experimental results using the optimal conditions was 29.6&#8201;mg/l, so very good agreement between the predicted and experimental nano-Ag production is observed.

Finally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b97">97</xref> recorded that biosynthesis of Ag NPs by using extracellular fraction of <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> and <italic>T. harzianum</italic> without adjusting pH and reported the formation of polydisperse spherical and occasionally ellipsoid Ag NPs in the size range from 5&#8211;63&#8201;nm at room temperature started within 3&#8201;hr. In this work by using some survey experiments on nano-Ag mycosynthesis reaction at different physical conditions (pH, temperature and light intensity), we observed the narrow ranges of pH and temperature (5&#8211;6 at 30&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C) in light or dark conditions (these results unpublished). So these physical conditions used constantly in all paper experiments.</p><p>They are many studies reported the optimized different physicochemical conditions by using one variables at time strategies to increase the nano-Ag particles rate and controlling its shape, size and charge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b97">97</xref>; while optimization of AgNPs mycosynthesis reaction by using Taguchi experimental designs and large scale production studies from <italic>T. harzianum</italic> were never reported up to our knowledge. Taguchi experimental designs are called &#8220;robust design&#8221; and it is a central theme of Taguchi Method. Therefore, Taguchi methodology is used to achieve a predictive knowledge of a complex, multi-variables process with the fewest possible trials and optimization of the experimental process itself<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In this work; Taguchi structured approach was used to determining the best combination of inputs to produce a dry weight of nano-Ag based on a design of experiments (DOE) methodology for determining parameter levels such as the precursor concentration, reductant concentration and agitation speed. Taguchi method is applied to analyze the mean response for each run in the inner array and to analyze the variation using as appropriately chosen S/N ratio which are different according to the type of the characteristics. Finally, the physicochemical parameters for nano-Ag production are the precursor conc., at 0.01&#8201;M, the diluted reductant10 (v/v) adjusted pH to 5 and incubated at 30&#8201;&#176;C in 200&#8201;rpm for 24&#8201;hr. we can conclude the nano-Ag production increased (3 times larger than basal condition) and improved through the Taguchi method approach.</p><p>For industrial applications, fungi should have certain properties which include high production of specific metabolite, high growth rate; easy handling in large-scale production and low-cost requirement for production procedures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The production and quality of bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi depends on natural conditions of the association and the nature of the organic or synthetic medium used. Strategies can be developed to use these fungi for exploitation of bioactive compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Fungi secrete large amounts of enzymes and are easy growing on every medium so they are considered as a proper choice for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Many studies have been done so far using various species of fungi for the biosynthesis of Ag NPs such as <italic>Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Trichoderma</italic>, and <italic>Cladosporium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Many reports have appeared on enzymes production by the submerged cultivation of <italic>T. reesei</italic> using pretreated lignocellulosic biomass as the carbon source like baggase, vegetable waste, and wheat grains etc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Among minerals, fungi require nitrogen in the largest amounts, so nitrogen can be considered as the limiting factor for their growth can be accounted. Unlike bacteria, fungi cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen, but they are able to use many other forms of nitrogen like amino acids, ammonium, and nitrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The precise reaction mechanism leading to the biosynthesis of sliver nanoparticles is yet to be clarified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Present investigation was carried out to evaluate available cheaper medium for mass multiplication of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> strain SYA.F4 for mycosynthesis of nano-Ag as anti-phytopathogenic agent by using submerged batch fermentation mode. Previously several available of organic and inorganic or mixed media were tested for fungal mass production; in this study the best medium which achieves high fungal mass weight was selected and the relationship between the fungal biomass production and mycosynthesized nano-Ag also studied. By using semi inorganic medium biomass production (60.5&#8201;g/l) and nano-Ag dry weight (78.4&#8201;g/l) were recorded by using large-scale batch cultivation in 7&#8201;L stirred tank bioreactor; so we can conclude that nano-Ag can be induced to get to the maximum mass weight depends on the fungal culture medium and quantity of its biomass. The possible reason may be related to the fermentation conditions in stirred tank bioreactor (agitation, airflow and pH) were controlled<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>The results of the nano-Ag as antifungal agent were consisted with few earlier reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">89</xref>. The important advantages of Ag NPs-based antimicrobial agents are their biocompatibility, health and environmental safety, and their excellent stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">89</xref> reported that; the mycosynthesized AgN Ps at (5 and 10&#8201;ppm) exhibited a more effective activity in inhibiting the mycelia growth of pathogenic strains of <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, the causal agent of tomato early blight disease as compared to the recommended chemical fungicide used (Ridomil gold plus 2&#8201;g/l). Damage of fungal hyphae structure was observed through electron microscopy in hyphae treated with the mycosynthesized Ag NPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. A simple, fast, cost-effective, eco-friendly and stable method for mycogenic synthesis of nano-Ag was successfully developed in the present work by using endophytic <italic>T. harzianum</italic> SYA.F4 which isolated from healthy organic tomato plant. As mentioned in our results; 100&#8201;&#956;g/ml of nano-Ag showed the highest inhibition zones against <italic>A.alternate</italic> followed by <italic>Helminthosporium sp., Botrytis sp</italic>. and <italic>P. arenaria</italic>. The mechanism of nano-Ag antifungal activity may be related to damaging the fungus membrane lipid bilayer, leading to intracellular ion efflux resulting in cell death. Also, accumulation of Ag NPs in the cell nuclei and interaction with DNA may lead to cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Fairly the biochemical mechanisms for the studies of the production of Ag NPs especially from endophytic fungi have some aspects were left open, which are likely to be taken up into future research to further clarify, such as the understanding of the compounds that are involved on the Ag NPs and its fungicidal effect.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> EL-Moslamy, S.
