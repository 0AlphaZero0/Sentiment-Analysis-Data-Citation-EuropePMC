In the present study, 39 full-length FAD genes, based on database searches, were identified in tetraploid upland cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L.) and were phylogenetically clustered into four subfamilies. Genomic localization revealed that 34 genes were mapped on 22 chromosomes, and five genes were positioned on the scaffold sequences. The FAD genes of <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> in the same subfamily had similar gene structures. The structures of paralogous genes were considerably conserved in exons number and introns length. It was suggested that the FAD gene families in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> might be duplicated mainly by segmental duplication. Moreover, the FAD genes were differentially expressed in different <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> tissues in response to different levels of salt and cold stresses, as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. The identification and functional analysis of FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> may provide more candidate genes for genetic modification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Fatty acids, a major source of energy in plants, are the primary constituents of plant membrane phospholipids and store triacylglycerols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In most of the plant tissues, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the plastids by a successive concatenation of two carbon long units resulting in the formation of 16- or 18-carbon long fatty acids that predominate in the cellular membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

The unsaturated fatty acids, compared with saturated fatty acid, contain one or more C&#8201;=&#8201;C double bonds in their fatty-acyl chains at specific locations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Membrane-bound Fatty acid desaturases (FADs), encoded by a large gene family responsible for membrane lipid modification and re-ordering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, are the key enzymes for inducting one or more carbon double bonds at different positions in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In the eukaryotic genomes, four large branches of FAD gene family with distinct functions have been identified previously. These are First desaturase, Omega desaturase, Front-end desaturase, and Sphingolipid desaturase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The predominant First desaturase subfamily members are encoded by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> desaturase (ADS) genes and possess double bonds at &#916;7 and &#916;9 positions of palmitic acid (16:0) or stearic acid (18:0)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In Omega desaturase subfamily, a double bond is found between pre-existing double bond and the acyl end at &#916;12 and &#916;15 desaturases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Typically, the Front-end desaturase subfamily contains a <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> &#916;8 double bond produced by sphingoid long-chain bases at &#916;8 desaturases (SLDs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The sole function of Sphingolipid desaturase subfamily is to modify sphingolipids by causing desaturation at &#916;4-position and hydroxylation at the C-4-position. They are also called as dihydroceramide Desaturases (DSDs) due to their highest activity of dihydroceramide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Nineteen <italic>Gossypium raimondii</italic> FAD genes have been separated into above mentioned four branches and named after corresponding encoding genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It is known that changing bond number and/or position may form different types of fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. For instance, introducing of a double bond at &#916;12 position of oleic acid (18:1) can produce linoleic acid (18:2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>To date, several membrane-bound FAD genes from different plant species have been characterized. It is evident by the previous studies that FAD genes are expressed in adverse environmental conditions. For example, in tomato, over-expression of <italic>LeFAD3</italic> gene enhanced the tolerance of tomato seedlings against salt stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, whereas low-expression of <italic>LeFAD7</italic> increased tolerance of tomato leaves to high-temperature (45&#8201;&#176;C)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Similarly, over-expression of either <italic>FAD3</italic> or <italic>FAD8</italic> increased tolerance of tobacco plants to drought<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and over-expression of <italic>FAD7</italic> alleviated the damage of cold stress in tobacco plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Moreover, over-expression of omega-3 desaturases improved tolerance of various transgenic plants to both drought and chilling stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, <italic>FAD2</italic> and <italic>FAD6</italic> were induced in seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under salinity stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In general, the FAD genes regulate the levels of fatty acid unsaturation in membrane lipids thus improving plant tolerance to adverse environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Cotton is an important commercial crop grown worldwide to provide generous supply of natural fiber for textile industry and to provide cottonseeds for food, feed, and bio-fuel productions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. It is cultivated mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions. Temperatures below 15&#8201;&#176;C can affect the plant growth and development causing yield losses mainly due to poor germination and high seedling mortality. <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L., an allotetraploid species, is one of the most commonly grown cotton species for commercial production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Originally, it was developed from two ancient diploid cotton species, <italic>G. raimondii</italic> and <italic>G. arboreum</italic>, by hybridization and chromosome doubling about 1&#8211;2 MYA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. It seems to be an interesting model system not only for the research of genome evolution, but also for studying the roles of polyploid in crop development and domestication with high research value. The fatty acid families from <italic>G. raimondii</italic> and <italic>G. arboreum</italic> have already been identified and characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, &#916;12 desaturase (<italic>FAD2</italic>) and &#916;15 desaturase (<italic>FAD3</italic> and <italic>FAD7/8</italic>) have been studied, mainly focused on cold adaptation at seedling stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Furthermore, the <italic>FAD2</italic>-<italic>1</italic> was found to be a seed-specific desaturase responsible for the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cottonseeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, while the <italic>FAD2</italic>-<italic>2</italic> had low expression levels throughout the seed development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>In this study, all the FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> were identified and characterized, and the phylogenetic analysis and structural diversification, as well as the expression profiles of the detected GhFAD genes in response to salt and cold stress regimes across different plant tissues were conducted. This research work may contribute to widen our understanding about the structure and function of FAD gene family in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, which may provide some candidate genes for predictable modification of fatty acid profiles in order to improve the plant vigor and seed nutritional value for cotton breeders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic></title><p>Based on the completed genome sequences of <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, a genome-wide search for FAD genes was performed by BlastP and tBlastN program, using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice FAD genes as the query sequences. Subsequently, all pre-identified proteins were subjected to domain analysis using Pfam and SMART databases for further confirmation, in the presence of FAD protein domain (PF00487). Eventually, a total of 39 FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, based on their orthologs with reported counterparts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, were predicted and annotated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The protein sequences, encoded by these 39 FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, were detected.

Similarly, the predicted molecular weight (Mw) of these deduced proteins varied from 23.76&#8201;kDa to 54.27&#8201;kDa, and the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) varied from 6.80 to 9.61.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phylogenetic relationship among the FAD genes</title><p>To evaluate the evolutionary relationships among the FAD gene members, all the genes from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> (39), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (17), and rice (10) were aligned separately by Neighboring-Joining method to generate an un-rooted phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). For confirmation, a phylogenetic tree was also constructed by Maximum Evolution method and the results were found almost consistent with Neighbor-Joining method, showing a little differences at some branches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Further, the FAD genes in these three species were divided into four well-defined monophyletic groups, suggesting the existence of a common ancestor before the divergence of monocots and dicots. The First desaturase group encoded by ADS genes was composed of 11 ADS genes, nine from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and two from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>. No ADS genes were found in the rice, suggesting some evolutionary role in its genome. The ADS genes were either lost in the rice or were acquired by the dicotyledons after divergence from the last common ancestor. In the Omega desaturase group, there were five genes from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, eight genes from rice, and 22 genes from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>. There were 14 SLD genes in the Front-end desaturase group which included 11 gens from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, two from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and one from rice. The Sphingolipid desaturase subfamily contained only six DSD genes, four DSD genes from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, only one from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice each. Interestingly, the <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> possessed more gene members than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice in these three subfamilies except First desaturase in which most of the gene members belonged to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Though several pairs of paralogous genes in the terminal branches of the <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> phylogenetic tree were distributed in each subfamily, several other FAD genes were not clustered together with the FAD genes from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. This suggested that these FAD genes might have merged in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> genome after diverging from the last common ancestor or have been lost in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. Gene numbers in First and Sphingolipid desaturase groups were lower than others, which harbored two and four GhFAD genes, respectively. Taken together, the presence and the absence of species-specific FAD genes were due to the functional divergence. The FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> might have undergone rapid expansion during the course of evolution and exhibited a tendency to cluster into the same subgroup due to the conserved functions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genomic localization of FAD genes</title><p>Genomic localization of FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> notably revealed that 34 genes were mapped on the 22 chromosomes, except for chromosome A02, A03, D02, and D03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The rest five genes, <italic>GhFAD7D, GhFAD2.4A, GhFAD2.5A, GhADS5A</italic>, and <italic>GhSLD5</italic> were positioned on the scaffold sequences. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, chromosome A01, A04, A05, A06, A08, A09, A12, D04, D06, D08, D09, D10, and D12 harbored only a single FAD gene each, while two FAD genes were present on each chromosome of A07, A10, A11, D05, D07, and D11. Moreover, there were three FAD genes on chromosome A13, D01, and D13 each.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Duplication of FAD genes</title><p>To date, the mechanism of FAD genes expansion in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> remains unclear. We deliberately investigated the relationship between genetic divergence and gene duplication within the FAD gene family of allotetraploid cotton. Total 13 duplicated gene pairs were found in this study, i.e. <italic>GhFAD8.2A/GhFAD8.2D, GhFAD8.1A/GhFAD8.1D, GhSLD2A/GhSLD2D, GhDSD1.1A/GhDSD1.1D, GhFAD3.3A/GhFAD3.3D, GhSLD4A/GhSLD4D, GhSLD3A/GhSLD3D, GhFAD3.1A/GhFAD3.1D, GhDSD1.2A/GhDSD1.2D, GhSLDL5A/GhSLD5D, GhFAD2.3A/GhFAD2.3D, GhSLD1A/GhSLD1D</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD6A/GhFAD6D</italic>. They were positioned on individual chromosome and mainly attributed to the segmental duplication events. Meanwhile, no tandem duplication event was found, which showed adjacently positions with no intervening genes instead. This suggested that the expansion of FAD gene family in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> was mainly attributed to the segmental duplication events.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structural organization of FAD genes</title><p>In the current experiment, 39 FAD genes were clustered into four subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Generally, the FAD genes in the same subfamily had strikingly similar exon/intron structure than other subfamilies. For instance, in the First desaturase subfamily, <italic>GhADS5D</italic> and <italic>GhADS5A</italic> harbored five exons with highly conserved length and four introns in closed size. In contrast, all the genes in the Sphingolipid desaturase subfamily possessed only two same-sized exons. Generally, the genes of the Front-end desaturase subfamily possessed a single exon generally, except <italic>GhSLD5</italic> which had two exons and one shorter intron. However, there were three exons in <italic>GhSLD1A</italic> and <italic>GhSLD1D</italic>. The similar exon-intron structure agreed well with their close phylogenetic relationship. In contrast to these three relatively conserved subfamilies, the FAD genes in the Omega desaturase subfamily showed a complex distribution of exons and introns. For example, the genes of <italic>FAD3, FAD7</italic>, and <italic>FAD8</italic> sections mostly had up to eight exons of relatively conserved length, except for <italic>GhFAD7A</italic> which possessed seven exons. While all the FAD genes in <italic>FAD2</italic> section had a single exon, except for <italic>GhFAD2.1D</italic>, which harbored three exons. In addition, <italic>GhFAD6D</italic> and <italic>GhFAD6A</italic> were composed of ten exons. Among the paralog pairs, uniformity was observed in the gene structures. Since <italic>G.hirsutum</italic> is an allotetraploid plant, the essential integrated evolutionary relationship was done by the sequences of the diploid <italic>G. raimondii</italic> and <italic>G. arboreum</italic> progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The detailed comparison indicated that the exon-intron structures were identical to the result of phylogenetic relationships and were highly conserved in each subfamily, though parts of the orthologous genes demonstrated certain differences.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Selective pressure analysis of the duplicated FAD genes</title><p>To investigate the selective the duplicated FAD gene pairs, the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) were calculated. Generally, Ka/Ks ratio &gt;1 indicates positive selection, Ka/Ks&#8201;=&#8201;1 indicates neutral selection, while a ratio &lt;1 indicates negative or purifying selection. In <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, the Ka/Ks ratios for 13 duplicated pairs were &lt;1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), which suggested that they had experienced strong purifying selection pressure contributing largely to the maintenance of function in <italic>G. hirtusum</italic> FAD gene family.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene expression patterns in different plant tissues</title><p>39 FAD genes were multifunctional in different tissues of <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> plant.

Eight FAD genes, i.e. <italic>GhSLD4D, GhFAD2.1A, GhFAD2.2D, GhDSD1.2A, GhFAD8.1A, GhSLD3D, GhFAD8.1D</italic>, and <italic>GhSLD5D</italic> were preferentially expressed in the roots.

In the leaves, 20 FAD genes such as <italic>GhFAD7D, GhFAD3.2A</italic>, and <italic>GhSLD5D</italic> exhibited high expression levels. Four FAD genes, <italic>GhFAD2.1A, GhFAD2.2D, GhDSD1.2A</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD8.1A</italic>, were expressed higher in the roots than other plant tissues, suggesting a potentially specialized function in the roots development or roots activities.

In contrast, <italic>GhSLD1A</italic> and <italic>GhSLD4D</italic> showed the highest transcript abundance, whereas <italic>GhFAD3.3D, GhFAD6D, GhFAD3.2A, GhFAD2.4D, GhFAD2.4A, GhFAD2.5D, GhFAD7A, GhFAD2.5A</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD3.3A</italic> exhibited low expressions in the stems. In addition, the membrane-bound fatty acid genes were extensively expressed in the leaves and cotyledons, especially for those of <italic>GhFAD3.3D, GhFAD2.3A</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD2.3D</italic> in the leaves and <italic>GhDSD1.2A, GhSLD3D</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD8.1A</italic> in the cotyledons, which were significantly up-regulated when the salt stress was applied for a longer time. Several fatty acid genes in the cotyledons, such as <italic>GhFAD3.3D, GhFAD2.5D, GhFAD7D</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD3.3A</italic>, were suppressed by cold stress application.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>G. hirsutum</italic> is a natural allotetraploid produced by the interspecific hybridization of A- and D-genome diploid progenitor species. Based on the genome scans of several plant genomes, the FAD gene family has been systematically investigated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (17), soybean (10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <italic>G. raimondii</italic> (19), and <italic>G. arboreum</italic> (20)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In current work, a total of 39 putative FAD genes were identified in the genomes of <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, which contained more FAD genes than other plant species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. It might be mainly due to the recent polyploidy and segmental duplication events in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> evolutionary history. Coincidentally, the number of FAD genes in <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> (AD<sub>1</sub> allotetraploid) was exactly the sum of those in <italic>G. raimondii</italic> (19) and <italic>G. arboretum</italic> (20). Moreover, all these FADs were distinctly classified into four groups as Omega desaturase, First desaturase, Sphingolipid desaturase, and Front-end desaturase consistently. In three subfamilies, Front-end desaturase, Omega desaturase, and Sphingolipid desaturase, <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> had much more FAD genes than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, which implied that these three subfamilies arose before the divergence of monocots-dicots and might have undergone species specific expansion process. Furthermore, the sizes of the GhFAD proteins varied markedly, as well as the predicted isoelectric points, suggesting that different GhFAD proteins might have functions in different microenvironments.</p><p>Gene duplication plays an irreplaceable role in the process of gene family expansion in the genomes. In <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, 13 segmental duplicated gene pairs were found, such as five gene pairs in the Front-end desaturase subfamily, two gene pairs in the Sphingolipid desaturase subfamily, and six gene pairs in the Omega desaturase subfamily. These results suggested that the expansion of Sphingolipid desaturase, Front-end desaturase, and Omega desaturase subfamilies were due to the segmental duplication, which was consistent with the previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, namely the increasing size of FAD genes might be contributed by the segmental duplication events.</p><p>It was noteworthy that paralogous FAD gene pairs demonstrated very similar exon/intron distribution patterns in terms of exon number and intron length. For instance, the FAD genes in the First desaturase subfamily and the Sphingolipid desaturase subfamily of three cotton species were highly conserved and clustered distinctly. However, their expression patterns were greatly divergent. It might have involved in the mechanism of adaptation to different environmental conditions. In the current study, different expression patterns of FAD genes were observed in each tissue. G<italic>hADS5A, GhFAD3.1A</italic>, and <italic>GhSLD3A</italic> were expressed markedly at high levels in the leaves but lower in the other tissues, while <italic>GhFAD6D</italic> was constitutively expressed at high levels in all the tested tissues. The tissue specific FAD gene expression patterns observed in the present study indicated their functional divergence during plant development and growth, which needs further study to identify their actual functions. In addition, most of the <italic>FAD2</italic> subfamily such as <italic>GhFAD2.3A, GhFAD2.1D, GhFAD2.4A, GhFAD2.4D, GhFAD2.1A</italic>, and <italic>GhFAD2.2D</italic> showed dramatically high abundance in the process of lipid accumulation. It suggested that these genes were seed-specific responsible for the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the seed oil of cultivated cotton. In addition, the genes which were highly expressed on 20 DPA recruited all types of FAD genes for the biogenesis in different positions or lengths. However, the other development stages involved only three subfamilies, which suggested that 20 DPA might be an important stage for ovule development.</p><p>Salinity, resulting mainly due to NaCl, is one of the common environmental stresses that afflicts the growth and yield of crops in many regions all over the world<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

In addition, antisense <italic>AtFAD7</italic> expression resulted in lower salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In this study, low expression level of <italic>GhFAD2.4D</italic> was found in all tissues treated by salt stress. <italic>GhFAD8.1D</italic> and <italic>GhADS5D</italic> genes were significantly up-regulated in the leaves in response to salt stress, which suggested that these FAD genes might adjust to appropriate levels to protect the cell membrane of cotton plant from salt stress. Low temperature is another serious stress, which significantly affects plant growth and development. The <italic>FAD2</italic>-<italic>3</italic> and <italic>FAD2</italic>-<italic>4</italic> genes from <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> were found to participate in the membrane adaptation to cold stress and induced significantly higher in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.
