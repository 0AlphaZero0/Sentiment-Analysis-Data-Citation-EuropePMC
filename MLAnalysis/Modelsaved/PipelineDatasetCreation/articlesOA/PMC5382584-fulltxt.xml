However, a recent study suggested that, in green algae, arsenite transporters located in the cytosol (ArsA1 and ArsA2) control the insertion of TA proteins into the membrane-bound organelles. In the present work, we overproduced and purified these hydrophilic proteins to near homogeneity. The analysis of their catalytic properties clearly demonstrates that <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> ArsA proteins exhibit oxyanion-independent ATPase activity, as neither arsenite nor antimonite showed strong effects. Co-expression of ArsA proteins with TA-transmembrane regions showed not only that the former interact with the latter, but that ArsA1 does not share the same ligand specificity as ArsA2. Together with a structural model and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that <italic>C. reinhadtii</italic> ArsA proteins are not arsenite transporters, but a TA-protein targeting factor. Further, we propose that ArsA targeting specificity is achieved at the ligand level, with ArsA1 mainly carrying TA-proteins to the chloroplast, while ArsA2 to the endoplasmic reticulum.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cells contain numerous integral membrane proteins (IMPs) that mediate a range of essential activities.

However, relatively little is known about the molecular machinery responsible for PTP in plant cells.

Its absence leads to a small chloroplast and severely decreased chlorophyll content, implying a role in the biogenesis of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

To date, it is unclear whether algal ArsA proteins are involved in the TA-protein PTP, or provide arsenite resistance.</p><p>Here, we report the biochemical characterization of recombinant <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> ArsA1 and ArsA2. Our results indicate that, similarly to TRC40, the ATPase activity of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> ArsA (Cr-ArsA) proteins is arsenite and antimonite independent. Further, we show that both proteins form a complex with a co-expressed TA protein, containing a C-terminal His-tag. Finally, three-dimensional structural modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allowed us contextualize ArsA2 behavior in light of recently published structural information regarding Get3-TA protein complexes. Thus, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TA protein recognition and chaperoning in plants, an as yet uncharacterized field.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Cr-ArsA1 comprises a single polypeptide with two ATPase domains (~30% sequence identity to mammalian TRC40), whereas Cr-ArsA2 has only one ATPase domain with 40~50% sequence identity to TRC40 and Get3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A sequence alignment also reveals that both proteins contain three highly conserved, and essential regions for TRC40-like proteins, i.e. the P-loop, the switch I, and the switch II motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Eukaryotic TRC40 enzymes also contain an approximately 20~30-residue insertion in the &#945;-helical domain (TRC40-insert)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, which is absent from bacterial ArsA homologs, but found in Cr-ArsA2 as well as Cr-ArsA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Both Cr-ArsA2 and Cr-ArsA1 lack conserved cysteine residues (Cys-113, Cys-172 and Cys-422 in <italic>E. coli</italic> ArsA) used by bacterial ArsA to bind metalloids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and also lack the CXXC dimerization motif, generally present in eukaryotic TRC40/Get3. However, when recombinant Cr-ArsA2 was purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), it formed both dimers (~80&#8201;kDa peak) and tetramers (~160&#8201;kDa peak, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study in the characterization of an archaeal Get3, which concluded that certain putative Get3 homologues may still oligomerize, even in the absence of CXXC motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. As predicted by the alignment, purified Cr-ArsA1 revealed a monomeric architecture, with a molecular weight of about 80&#8201;kDa, much like bacterial ArsA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c and d</xref>).</p><p>Another feature that helps separate TRC40-like proteins from arsenite transporters is the formers&#8217; oxyanion-independent ATPase activity. In the absence of arsenite/antimonite, both dimeric Cr-ArsA2 and monomeric Cr-ArsA1 present a strong basal ATPase activity (400&#8211;480&#8201;nmol/min/mg), compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> ArsA and human ASNA-1 (0.06 and 17&#8201;nmol/min/mg), but similar to yeast Get3 (~418&#8201;nmol/min/mg, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In the presence of high oxyanion concentrations (100&#8201;mM), however, both arsenite and antimonite fail to elicit a strong effect on either algal protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These data are in complete contrast to previous studies in bacterial ArsA activity, which increased about 4-fold with arsenite and 32-fold with antimonite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>However, the most convincing evidence of TA-targeting activity by both Cr-ArsA proteins is provided by their co-expression and Ion Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) co-purification with C-terminal 6xHis-tag fused TA proteins. Cr-ArsA2 readily bound both full length human Sec61&#946;, and its <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> orthologue, Cr-Sec61&#946; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Conversely, no interaction took place with TMD-deleted Sec61&#946; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2 a and b</xref>). On the other hand, Cr-ArsA1 binding to the Cr-TOC34-NTC domain, which contains the Cr-TOC34-TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), (see Materials and Methods for details) was confirmed via mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Although the C-terminal portion of both TA proteins are transmembrane helices, the presence of their corresponding ArsA protein is enough for them to be produced in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. This behavior has also been observed for other TRC40-TA protein complexes, such as yeast Get3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In order to exclude unspecific interactions between the ArsA proteins and the purification resin, we further performed negative controls, in which we passed non-tagged ArsA1 through the IMAC column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2 c and d</xref>). As expected, the protein could not be purified in the absence of its his-tagged NTC ligand. Most interestingly, when reverse co-purification took place, i.e. Cr-ArsA1 with Cr-Sec61&#946;, and Cr-ArsA2 with Cr-TOC34-NTC, neither the putative TA-carriers, nor the corresponding TMD/NTC-domains could be isolated, although both the carriers and substrates were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Indeed, to us, this clearly suggests that Cr-ArsA1 and Cr-ArsA2 have different ligand specificities, and therefore, may target different sub-cellular compartments, namely Cr-ArsA1 for chloroplast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and Cr-ArsA2 for the endoplasmic reticulum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>Once we could establish that Cr-ArsA2 was indeed a TA-binding protein, we decided to take advantage of the recently published Get3 structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> to generate a closed state-Cr-ArsA2 model, which we could then compare to other TRC40 like proteins. The resulting 3-D model is a homodimer, which contains most of the Cr-ArsA2 sequence (residue 6 to 357). All features present in Get3, such as two ATPase motifs, and an &#945;-helical hydrophobic groove spanning both monomers, are present. However, since the conserved CXXC motif is absent from Cr-ArsA2 enzyme, a zinc-cysteine coordination site is not present in our model. Limiting the utility of our model is the fact that, in all published TRC40-TA complexes, there is no structural information for the solvent exposed face of the binding groove, where the TRC40-insert is. However, there is strong evidence that the TRC40-insert may serve as a &#8216;lid&#8217; to help prevent TA exposure to solvent during targeting, and assist TA substrate insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. By modeling the regions as disordered loops, followed by MD simulations, we addressed this issue. On the one hand, we generated several high quality models for Cr-ArsA2 in complex with TA protein Pep12, which we could then compare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Video S1</xref>). On the other hand, by subjecting Get3 to the same process, we had a biochemically and structurally very well characterized system, which we used to validate our bio-computational results.</p><p>In our trajectory, Get3-Pep12 rapidly converges to a stable conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5a</xref>), which is very similar to the crystal structure (19.5&#8201;ns, backbone RMSD 2.43&#8201;&#197;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Cr-ArsA2-Pep12 converged slowly, and towards a more distinct conformation (30.2&#8201;ns, backbone RMSD 2.9&#8201;&#197;, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5a</xref>). A complex rearrangement caused the protein to rotate along the Pep12 longitudinal axis during the first 60&#8201;ns (helical rotation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5b</xref>), ceasing at 38.44&#8201;+&#8201;/&#8722;4.53 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">video S1</xref>). Simultaneously, the Cr-ArsA2 groove closed around Pep12, as visualized by the hydration shells of the TA termini, to a final status which resembles Get3 hydration levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). While Get3 presents a single population, Cr-ArsA2 shows four population clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Cluster one corresponds to the initial stages of the simulation (2.4 to 6.1&#8201;ns), cluster two to the rearrangement period (7.7 to 52.9&#8201;ns), and cluster three and four are within the rearranged segment of the trajectory, where full rotation has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs. 3b</xref>, 61.1 to 158.1&#8201;ns, and 56.7 to 159.7&#8201;ns, respectively, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5b</xref>). The most highly populated region is cluster three, with low hydration and high rotation (31.28% of the total trajectory, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b and d</xref>). Behind the Pep12 dehydration lies helix 8 within the TRC40-insert. Helix 8 has been experimentally described by Mateja <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> for the Get3 system, and has been proposed to be a key component to the &#8216;lid&#8217; effect of the TRC40-insert. Although in our ArsA2 model we modeled the corresponding amino-acids as disordered loops, the helix was formed <italic>in situ</italic> in the trajectory. As helix 8 formed, it closed down on the bound Pep12, displacing the terminal hydration shell of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In a strikingly similar series of events to that proposed recently by Mateja <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, the simulation resulted in an equivalent conformation to the published Get3 structure, further cementing the quality of our model. The low hydration state co-exists with a minor population of an open, yet rotated conformation (cluster four, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b and d</xref>), suggesting that transient groove opening plays an important role in allowing for optimal Cr-ArsA2-Pep12 interactions. Binding enthalpy analysis revealed that at first, Cr-ArsA2 was a poorer Pep12 binder (134&#8201;kCal/mol), when compared to the final stages (153&#8201;kCal/mol for cluster 3). Crucially, Get3&#8217;s single peak yielded a binding enthalpy of &#8722;153&#8201;kCal/mol, indicating that our Cr-ArsA2 model is a good Pep12 binder.</p><p>We also substituted the yeast Pep12 ligand for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> Sec61&#946; (Cr-sec61&#946;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In this case, the 160&#8201;ns trajectory converges somewhat intermediately between the previous two (25.6&#8201;ns, backbone RMSD 2.6&#8201;A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5a</xref>). The rotation angle distribution is narrower, with maximum values below 40 degrees, and a final conformation similar to the initial one (0&#8201;ns vs. 118.1 to 160&#8201;ns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Also, a long-lived, high-torsion, meta-stable state dominates the first part of the trajectory (5.3&#8201;ns to 98.7&#8201;ns <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, His-83, at the C-terminus of Cr-sec61&#946;, undergoes a dramatic transformation during the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), with the imidazole side-chain ultimately lodging itself in an induced pocket formed between amino-acids Lys-478, Met-471, Asp-468, and Ile-467 in helices 6 and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, here we can see a three stage conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). First, the protein rapidly rotates around the Cr-sec61&#946; longitudinal axis (5.2&#8201;ns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, cluster 1). At 93.5&#8201;ns, Cr-ArsA2 rotates back to within 5 degrees of its original position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, cluster 2). After 23.1&#8201;ns of fluctuation, the final state follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, cluster 3) as His-83 reaches its final conformation. Accordingly, interaction energies in cluster 1 are &#8722;105&#8201;kCal/mol, cluster 2 represents a high-energy meta-stable state, at &#8722;85&#8201;kCal/mol, while cluster 3 is the most stable, at &#8722;114&#8201;kCal/mol. The function of His-83 is particular to Cr-sec61&#946;; however, in the Get3-Pep12 complex, a similar function is accomplished by the interaction between Pep12 Phe-283 and a methionine cluster in Get3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. As a result, both complexes show very little freedom of rotation around the hydrophobic ligand. Thus, the simulated Cr-ArsA2-Cr-sec61&#946; complex behaves very similarly to Get3-Pep12, further supporting the formers&#8217; function as a Get3-like targeting factor in <italic>C. reinhardtii.</italic></p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although there are over 400 predicted plant TA proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, very little is known about their targeting machinery.

The possibility of subcellular compartment targeting specificity for TRC40-like proteins has broad implications in all aspects of plant biology and biotechnology, and will elicit much research in the field of plant cellular and molecular biology.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene synthesis</title><p>The full-length genes of TRC40 homologs and TA proteins, and DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genomics (Taipei, Taiwan).

For Cr-ArsA1 expression, we used glutathione S-transferase (GST) as a fusion tag for enhancing protein production. After confirming constructs by DNA sequencing, Cr-ArsA2 or Cr-ArsA1 were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3). Cells were first grown at 37&#8201;&#176;C until they reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.6, at which point the culture was induced with 0.5&#8201;mM isopropyl &#946;-D- 1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and cultivated at 22&#8201;&#176;C for further 20&#8201;hours. Cells were disrupted in the presence of protease inhibitors using a high-pressure microfluidizer. After clearing by centrifugation, the supernatant was batch purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. This was followed optionally by cleavage with 6xHis-tagged TEV protease and removal of residual uncleaved target protein and 6xHis-tagged TEV protease by subtractive Ni-NTA purification. The cleaved material was concentrated and then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-200-16/600GL column (GE Healthcare) on a Bio Logic DuoFlow LC system (BioRad). This strategy typically resulted in multi-milligram quantities of highly purified, soluble protein for Cr-ArsA2 and Cr-ArsA1.
