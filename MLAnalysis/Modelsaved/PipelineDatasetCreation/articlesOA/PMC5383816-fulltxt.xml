In addition to the loss of lives, these suicides occur in public space, causing traumatization among train drivers and passengers, and significant public transport delays. Prevention efforts depend upon accurate knowledge of clustering phenomena across the railway network, and spatial risk factors. Factors such as proximity to psychiatric institutions have been discussed to impact on railway suicides, but analytic evaluations are scarce and limited. We identify 15 hotspots on the Austrian railway system while taking case location uncertainties into account. These hotspots represent 0.9% of the total track length (5916&#8201;km/3676 miles) that account for up to 17% of all railway suicides (<italic>N</italic>=1130). We model suicide locations on the network using a smoothed inhomogeneous Poisson process and validate it using randomization tests. We find that the density of psychiatric beds is a significant predictor of railway suicide. Further predictors are population density, multitrack structure and&#8212;less consistently&#8212;spatial socio-economic factors including total suicide rates. We evaluate the model for the identified hotspots and show that the actual influence of these variables differs across individual hotspots. This analysis provides important information for suicide prevention research and practice. We recommend structural separation of railway tracks from nearby psychiatric institutions to prevent railway suicide.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>railway</kwd><kwd>suicide</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>cluster</kwd><kwd>hotspot</kwd><kwd>spatial point pattern</kwd><kwd>Austria</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March, 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Background</title><p>Suicide is a considerable public health problem. According the World Health Organization [<xref rid="RSOS160711C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], more than 1 million individuals die by suicide globally each year. In Western countries, suicide ranks consistently among the top three causes of death among young individuals, resulting in a tremendous social, psychological and economic burden to individuals, families and society. Railway suicide is a suicide method that involves the jumping or lying in front of a train in order to die by suicide. These suicides typically occur in public locations, thereby affecting and traumatizing a large number of individuals including train drivers, passengers and clean-up personnel. Moreover, railway suicides result in significant delays in public transport. For these reasons, these suicides have received a specific focus in suicide prevention initiatives [<xref rid="RSOS160711C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS160711C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Individuals dying by railway suicide have been found to be of younger age as compared to the average suicide decedents [<xref rid="RSOS160711C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS160711C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], more often involve individuals with severe mental illness [<xref rid="RSOS160711C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and suicide decedents typically reside close to the railway tracks [<xref rid="RSOS160711C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Density-based clustering of railway suicides has been reported in the literature [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In particular, suicides seem to be more frequent close to psychiatric institutions [<xref rid="RSOS160711C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and also railway parameters including high train frequency have been found to be associated with railway suicides in some studies [<xref rid="RSOS160711C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some [<xref rid="RSOS160711C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but not all [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studies suggest that railway suicides increase with increasing population density close to the railway. Media and social contagion effects may play a role in the formation of locations with high density of railway suicide events [<xref rid="RSOS160711C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], so-called hotspots.</p><p>Studies on the clustering of suicides, in general, and on area-related factors that impact on railway suicides specifically have been hampered by a number of limitations. First, correlations between variables such as population density and railway suicides have often been assessed on an aggregate level over time, without looking at spatial variations of densities across the whole length of the railway track. Second, probable measurement errors regarding the specific locations of individual railway suicides have not been taken into account. Finally, models to estimate the relative influence of different factors have typically not controlled for both area-related population and railway factors, and have not been validated with adequate simulation techniques.</p><p>When it comes to the assessment of clustering on railway networks, an additional challenge in the field of suicide prevention research has been that any simulation needs to take into account that cases can only occur along the railroad network. Here, a careful consideration of distance measurement between cases and objects such as psychiatric institutions needs to be made: distance can be measured using Euclidean (air-line) distance or along the railroad network, e.g. by measuring the length of the shortest path from one point on the network to another. The choice depends on data availability and research question. We decided to use network-based shortest path distances to measure distances between cases of suicide, because this approach takes the railroad layout and crossings into account.</p><p>Using a single, fixed grid introduces a problem known as MAUP (modifiable areal unit problem), i.e. bias introduced by choosing a specific tessellation of the study area or the network [<xref rid="RSOS160711C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As we also use a grid-based algorithm to estimate the locations of suicide hotspots, we mitigate this problem by averaging over multiple grid definitions with varying origins. For the model simulations, we choose to use a point pattern model that, by definition, is free of MAUP.</p><p>We use a density-based clustering approach which (i) can identify spatially connected regions of arbitrary shapes as clusters and (ii) also takes account of the spatial uncertainty of case locations.</p><p><italic>What is a suicide cluster/hotspot?</italic> We aimed to find a definition of a railway suicide hotspot that allows us to identify locations with high case densities while incorporating the spatial uncertainty of case coordinates. As railway suicide hotspot, we define a spatially connected region where the mean density of cases per area is above a threshold. The mean density is calculated separately for each pixel from simulations of a Gaussian noise model created to incorporate the spatial uncertainty of case coordinates. The per-pixel threshold is chosen as the lower 10% quantile from the simulation envelope of the Gaussian noise model. We did not consider background characteristics such as population density (i.e. cases per area unit) for defining clusters, because our interest was on locations with higher overall case numbers, which would be of greatest relevance to suicide prevention efforts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Hotspots of railway suicides</title><p><italic>Data on locations of suicides</italic> on the Austrian railroad network from 1998 to 2009 have been obtained from the main Austrian railroad operator &#214;BB (<italic>N</italic>=1170).</p><p>After removal of cases from Lichtenstein (<italic>N</italic>=4), cases inside trains (<italic>N</italic>=6) or not directly located on the railroad network (<italic>N</italic>=30), 1130 cases of suicide by train impact remain.</p><p>Locations are recorded as kilometre-number on the railroad network together with the name of the closest station.

We estimate that this procedure has a (Gaussian) measurement uncertainty of approximately 1&#8201;km.</p><p><italic>Data on the railroad network</italic> have been obtained from the publicly available Euroglobalmap [<xref rid="RSOS160711C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] from 2014. We use the associated metadata to retain only the operational part of the network. We expect the railroad network to remain static over the study period. From 1998 some railroad segments have been closed, but for all suicide cases from 1998 to 2009, a proper network segment exists in the network data from 2014. The total network length is 5916&#8201;km (3676 miles).</p><p><italic>Hotspots.</italic> To identify the spatial locations with highest densities of suicides per railroad kilometre, we use box-counting on multiple fixed pixel grids: we divide the study region into a regular grid of quadratic pixels with 1&#8201;km side-length and count the number of cases per pixel. To mitigate the introduced discretization error (MAUP) [<xref rid="RSOS160711C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we repeat the procedure 16 times using slightly displaced grids while keeping the pixel size constant (quadrates with 1&#8201;km side-length). The displacement is such that the original pixel of 1&#8201;km side-length is divided symmetrically into sub-pixels of 250&#8201;m side-length.</p><p>To take the case location uncertainty of about 1&#8201;km into account, we generate 1000 realizations of a Gaussian noise model, i.e. the case locations are displaced along the railroad network using a normally distributed random displacement with <italic>&#963;</italic>=1&#8201;<italic>km</italic>.</p><p>For each realization, the box-counting is performed for each of the 16 displaced grids, resulting in a final 250&#8201;m wide grid with 16&#8201;000 counts per pixel. From this ensemble, we pixel-wisely find the lower 10% quantile of the number of cases. This results in a conservative estimate for the spatial case density distribution.</p><p>Finally, we identify the hotspots from the resulting image as eight-connected groups of pixels, i.e. neighbouring pixels with value also above threshold and located sideways, above/below and also diagonally are grouped. Hotspots with 3 pixel minimum border-to-border distance are merged.</p><p>We validate the stability of this procedure by using various larger values of grid width. We consistently identify the same hotspots as presented, corresponding to the order of the respective grid width.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2.</label><title>Psychiatric institutions and railway suicides</title><p><italic>Data on hospitals</italic> and medical institutions of Austria from 2014 with total bed counts, types of departments and street addresses have been obtained from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health [<xref rid="RSOS160711C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The geographical locations of the facilities have been obtained by looking up their street addresses using QGIS [<xref rid="RSOS160711C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with overlay data from Google Maps (maps.google.com), OpenStreetMap (<uri xlink:href="www.openstreetmap.org">www.openstreetmap.org</uri>) or Geoland Basemap (<uri xlink:href="www.basemap.at">www.basemap.at</uri>).</p><p>For each institution with a psychiatric department or unit, we calculated the average department size by dividing their total bed counts by the respective number of department types.

Second, we fit an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) to the point pattern of suicides using maximum-likelihood estimation and then generate random samples from the fitted model to estimate the effect size of the influence of psychiatric institutions to nearby suicides (&#167;(d)).

In order to account for some mobility of the population, we calculate a smoothed population map using Gaussian kernel smoothing with a bandwidth of 1.6&#8201;km on a 250&#8201;m wide destination grid. As fitting the IPP requires the log-density, we first logarithmize the population data and smooth afterwards.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(b)&#8195;<italic>Psychiatric bed density</italic>. From the approximate number of psychiatric beds per hospital and the hospital locations (&#167;(b)) we create a map of the spatial density of psychiatric beds using Gaussian kernel smoothing with a bandwidth of 0.8&#8201;km. This bandwidth choice accounts for the mobility of psychiatric patients which has been reported before [<xref rid="RSOS160711C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Again, we need the logarithmic psychiatric bed density when fitting the IPP: as the data are zero-inflated, we first offset them by adding one, then logarithmize and finally apply Gaussian kernel smoothing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(c)&#8195;<italic>Single track versus multitrack</italic>. We use a binary variable encoding for single versus multitrack segment from the Euroglobalmap data (&#167;(a)). Typically, multitrack segments are associated with a higher amount of railway traffic. The variable can therefore be seen as a proxy for low versus high traffic density.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(d)&#8195;<italic>Total suicide rate and socio-demographic factors</italic>. We extract two spatial variables as the most important factors from a principal components analysis (PCA) on input data from various sources and spatial resolutions. These are: (i) mean yearly gross income of employees (in EUR, from 2003, on a district level [<xref rid="RSOS160711C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), (ii) fraction of population older than 15 years with low (no completed secondary education), medium (completed secondary) and with high (completed tertiary) eduction (2011, on a community level [<xref rid="RSOS160711C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), (iii) fraction of male/female population, (iv) fraction of young (age &#8804;19 years), adult (20 &#8804; age &#8804; 64) and elderly (age &#8805;65) population, (v) fraction of persons without Austrian or EU citizenship, (vi) fraction of unemployed persons (iii)&#8211;(vi) on a 10&#8201;km grid, from 2008 [<xref rid="RSOS160711C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), (vii) the number of suicides in the years 2001&#8211;2008 per mean population in the same time span (district level).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>To perform the PCA, we sample these variables&#8212;together with the population density from above&#8212;at 20&#8201;000 random points on the railroad network.

To account for the case location uncertainty, we simulate a Gaussian noise model on the network with <italic>&#963;</italic>&#8776;1&#8201;km 39 times and each time perform the IPP fit described above. The resulting mean coefficient estimates are then used to create 199 simulated realizations of the IPP: we use a regular grid with 250&#8201;m wide pixels to simulate the fitted model. From the mean coefficient estimates, the explaining variables evaluated at pixel centres, and the network length per pixel, we create a two-dimensional IPP intensity image. Each realization creates 1130 cases distributed on the map proportional to this intensity image.</p><p>As the outcomes of this simulation procedure strongly depend on the grid width (i.e. smaller is more accurate), we use a <italic>Z</italic>-test based on the simulation variance to compare the simulation input coefficients with their corresponding mean simulation coefficients.</p><p><italic>Goodness of fit</italic>. The goodness of fit is estimated by calculating the pair distribution function together with simulation envelopes from the simulated model.

We defined CSR as a homogeneous Poisson process on the railroad network, which has been estimated by simulation of 199 realizations.

The 15 hotspots identified in this study comprised between 111 and 190 railway suicides, which corresponds to 9.8%&#8211;16.8% of all railway suicides in the observation period. The specific locations were spread across the entire country, with eight of nine federal states having at least one hotspot, covering approximately 54&#8201;km of the railway track in total (0.9% of the entire track length). A previous Dutch study on railway suicides similarly found that 16% of all railway suicides occurred on just 33&#8201;km of the Dutch trail track, which was about 1.2% of the total track length [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In order to model railway suicides we assumed a smoothened IPP. We tested the influence of psychiatric bed density, single versus multitrack railway; as well as population density on railway suicides. We controlled the model for two principal components of a wide range of spatial socio-economic factors, including population income level, education, proportion of males and females, age groups, proportion of residents without EU citizenship, unemployment rates, as well as total suicide rates. The two components used loaded high on education (component 1) and total suicide rates (component 2), as well as moderately on income level (component 2).</p><p>The findings indicated that railway suicides were associated with proximity of psychiatric institutions in walking distance to the railway network. The closer and higher the number of psychiatric beds in the proximity of the railway network was, the more suicides occurred on the railway track. An evaluation of the model for the specific hotspots indicated that in 5 of 15 identified hotspots, psychiatric institutions were not more than 1&#8201;km away from the railway. The excess risk associated with proximity to psychiatric institutions was larger than 1.5 in 6 of 15 hotspots, and ranged from 1.5 to 2.9 depending on the hotspot, indicating a small to medium effect size. A validation of the model with a randomization test which shuffled psychiatric institutions on the railway network taking account of the population density in the specific areas, confirmed this result. Several previous studies have described that proximity of railway tracks to psychiatric institutions may increase the number of railway suicides in that area [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, none of these studies have applied the present three-step methodological approach. In a Dutch study, it turned out that all locations on the network with the highest frequency of suicides per kilometre had psychiatric institutions within 800&#8201;m walking distance [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, a study from Germany indicated that 75% of the German railway locations with highest suicide density had psychiatric institutions nearby [<xref rid="RSOS160711C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These studies were descriptive, and did not control for any demographic or railway factors. A survey study from Brisbane, Australia indicated that 48% of railway suicides occurred close to a psychiatric institution, and 57% of decedents had been treated for mental health problems [<xref rid="RSOS160711C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Also consistent with earlier research, local population density was associated with railway suicides along the railway track [<xref rid="RSOS160711C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the UK, railway suicides were typically found around major cities with high population density [<xref rid="RSOS160711C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By contrast, the Dutch evaluation of railway suicides found similar rates of train suicides in three regions with different population densities, with a lower rate in the most densely populated region [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The authors of this study concluded that tracks may be less accessible in Dutch areas with high population density. However, similar to the other previous analyses, this analysis did not take small-area variations in population densities and railway suicides into account. In the present analysis, the individual evaluation of 15 hotspots indicated that population density was relevant to all of these locations, with excess risks ranging from 4.2 to 14, which corresponds to medium to large effect sizes.</p><p>We also found an independent association between multitrack lines on the Austrian railway network and railway suicides, with excess risks ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 for the individual hotspots. Previous studies analysed if the availability of trains, or passenger numbers were associated with railway suicide and showed mixed results [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The previously mentioned analysis of Dutch railway suicides did not identify a correlation between railway suicide and railway density or intensity of railway transportation as indicated by the variations in railway suicides across four areas with different rail density [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By contrast, railway suicides in England and Wales were correlated with the growth of the railway system over time [<xref rid="RSOS160711C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Total spatial suicide rates, which had a very high loading in the second principal component used in the analysis, were associated with railway suicides at some but not all of the identified hotspots. Excess risks were negative or positive, depending on the individual hotspot, and overall sizes of risk estimates were small. A previous study identified decreasing total suicide rates but increasing railway suicides in a 10-year period of 1991 to 2000 in Germany [<xref rid="RSOS160711C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, Dutch railway suicides did not show the same longitudinal time patterns as total suicide rates [<xref rid="RSOS160711C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The small and inconsistent relationship of the spatial distributions of total suicides and railway suicides in the present study highlights that the impact of total suicides on railway suicides is low, inconsistent, and, if there is any at all, only relevant at selected hotspots.</p><p>Spatial socio-economic factors, particularly high level of education, which loaded strongly in the first principal component used in this analysis, were related to railway suicide at several hotspots, but again, the associations were not consistent. At 13 of the 15 hotspots, there was a small direct association between high level of education and railway suicides, suggesting that areas with higher level of education of the population are more affected by railway suicide. Interestingly, these 13 hotspots were all located close to urban centres, whereas the two hotspots with divergent findings were located in rural areas. Education may reflect an uncontrolled effect of urbanity. We are not aware of any study assessing spatial associations of socio-economic variables with railway suicides, but a meta-analysis investigating the association of spatial socio-economic conditions with total suicide rates indicated substantial heterogeneity of findings, with 30% of studies with significant findings reporting direct associations and 70% reporting inverse associations.</p><p>A crucial step in any analysis on potential clustering is the definition of a cluster. A recent review of studies on suicide clustering identified that only a third of 82 included studies defined what they meant by clusters, and only 27 studies provided data as to how many suicides may have occurred in a cluster [<xref rid="RSOS160711C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, we defined railway suicide hotspots (or clusters) as a spatially connected region where the median density of cases per area was above a threshold calculated from simulations of a Gaussian noise model created to incorporate the spatial uncertainty of case coordinates. The threshold was chosen as the lower 10 per cent quantile from the simulation envelope of the Gaussian noise model. This is different from the Centers for Disease Control&#8217;s definition of suicide clusters as &#8216;a group of suicides that occur closer together in time and space than would normally be expected in a given community&#8217; [<xref rid="RSOS160711C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We neither considered background characteristics such as population density (i.e. cases per area unit), nor did we use a time component in our present definition, because our interest was on locations with the overall highest case densities, which would be of greatest relevance to suicide prevention efforts on the railway network.</p><p>The present model, while having a good model fit, indicated some potential over-clustering of railway suicides at small distances of up to 20&#8201;km. This unexplained over-clustering at small distances may be due to specific environmental characteristics not controlled for in the model or due to imitative behaviour, which has been shown to be typically limited to areas of up to 50&#8201;km radius maximum [<xref rid="RSOS160711C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Imitative behaviour can occur due to social contagion effects [<xref rid="RSOS160711C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, media reporting on a railway suicide may trigger further suicides in the same location, which may again increase media reporting, resulting in a vicious circle of heightened media attention and more suicides [<xref rid="RSOS160711C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Contagion effects typically show not only a spatial clustering but also a time clustering, i.e. their duration is limited. A review of studies on suicide clustering indicated that the median duration of clusters was 11 months, with a range of 0&#8211;24 months [<xref rid="RSOS160711C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Owing to the absence of any visible time clustering in this study, our analysis does rather point to structural, more permanent factors that impact on the clustering of railway suicides at small distances in specific areas. These factors may either be population- or area-related.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><label>4.2.</label><title>Implications for research and prevention</title><p>This study has several implications for future research in the area of suicide clustering on networks such as on railway tracks. It shows that standard methods are applicable in this area which has been characterized by a lack of standardized statistical approaches to data analysis. Future studies may use this study as a basis for further in-depth analysis of spatial distributions of suicides on networks.</p><p>There are several important implications for suicide prevention. First, this study shows that a significant proportion of suicides occurs on a very small proportion of the network. Barriers and other structural measures may be applicable to prevent railway suicides at these hotspots [<xref rid="RSOS160711C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this context, particularly psychiatric institutions need to be structurally separated from railway tracks. However, this study also highlights that not all locations with relatively high railway suicide densities show the same characteristics. While population density seems to play a major role at several locations on the Austrian railway network, vicinity to psychiatric institutions seems to play a stronger role at other hotspots. A careful site inspection of the identified hotspots seems warranted in order to assess specific conditions and develop adequate prevention techniques tailored to the specific hotspots. Beside fences and spatial separation, media collaborations to prevent imitative effects, as well as speed control have been proposed as preventive measures in the literature [<xref rid="RSOS160711C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Further, front modifications of trains as well as wheel and rail designs may contribute to the prevention of lethal consequences of train&#8211;person collisions [<xref rid="RSOS160711C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most of these measures have not been evaluated with regard to their effectiveness for suicide prevention. In Switzerland, barriers on bridges have been shown to significantly reduce suicidal behaviour [<xref rid="RSOS160711C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Suicides at nearby bridges within 5&#8201;min walking distance did not increase subsequently. Similarly, a minimal structural intervention of installing guard rails at hospital windows significantly reduced the number of patients dying by jumping out of windows [<xref rid="RSOS160711C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A meta-analysis of structural interventions at suicide hotspots confirmed that there was an overall preventive effect of these interventions on suicides by jumping [<xref rid="RSOS160711C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><label>4.3.</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has several strengths. With regard to the identification of hotspots, using a single, fixed grid introduces a problem known as MAUP, i.e. a bias introduced by choosing a specific tessellation of the area or the network. Therefore, during the hotspot estimation, we averaged over multiple grid definitions with varying origins. For the model simulations, we used a point pattern model that, by definition, is free of MAUP [<xref rid="RSOS160711C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In recent studies on suicide clustering [<xref rid="RSOS160711C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS160711C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], statistical software such as SatScan has been used, which basically works by moving windows of elliptical shape and varying size over the study region and identifies clusters using a statistical criterion [<xref rid="RSOS160711C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because the railway represents a network and suicides can only occur on that network, the present density-based clustering approach was superior in that (i) it allowed the identification of spatially connected regions of arbitrary shapes as clusters and (ii) it also allowed to take into account the spatial uncertainty of case locations.</p><p>Also the modelling technique used here has several strengths. While earlier studies typically assessed correlations between parameters such as population density and railway suicides on an aggregate level over time, we were able to investigate spatial variations of densities across the whole length of the railway track. The present statistical modelling allowed us to take probable measurement errors regarding the specific locations of individual railway suicides into account. The adjustment of the model for socio-demographic variables as well as for the total suicide rate is a strength, as well as the validation of the model using randomization tests.</p><p>Despite many strengths, this study also has some limitations. Not all socio-demographic variables were available at the level of communities; therefore, we needed to use some district data, which may introduce bias [<xref rid="RSOS160711C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, the density of psychiatric beds was an approximate measure based on the average number of beds per department type. This measure reflects the average department type size of a given institution. Actual psychiatric bed numbers may deviate from the present densities. Future studies should use more accurate data for the size of psychiatric institutions. However, also average bed numbers per department type as calculated here might be related to suicide hotspots independent of the specific size of the psychiatric departments.</p><p>Importantly, no information on socio-demographic and morbidity-related characteristics of the suicide decedents was available. We do not know if the suicide decedents had a mental illness or if they were patients at the respective institutions. Finally, the measurement of distances between the rail track and psychiatric institutions in terms of Euclidian distance (air-line) may not be entirely accurate, because this assumes that individuals can move freely in all directions. Future studies may use other network information, e.g. the sidewalk structures, to determine distances between objects and the railway network.</p><p>Finally, the model might have been stronger if some measure of existing suicide barriers (e.g. walls and fences) could have been added. For example, some psychiatric institutions might be physically separated from tracks. These barriers may effectively reduce the risk of suicide at these locations. Unfortunately, data on existing barriers were not available for this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time, we show here that spatial clustering of suicide hotspots can be understood with unprecedented precision through models for point processes. This has immediate consequences for suicide prevention. The study indicates that a considerable number of railway suicides occur on a very short fraction of the total network. Vicinity to psychiatric institutions, population densities, as well as multitrack parts of the network are particularly relevant and warrant attention in tailored prevention efforts. Spatial socio-economic factors and total suicide rates are not consistently associated with railway suicides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary Figures S1-S3</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsos160711supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1776" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Johanna Gerngross and Ing.
