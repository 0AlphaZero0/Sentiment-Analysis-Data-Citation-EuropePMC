The present study reports genome-wide identification and characterization of both tomato and RKN miRNAs simultaneously from RKN-infected susceptible tomato roots using high-throughput sequencing technique. RNAseq data from 11 small RNA libraries derived from 5 disease development stages identified 281 novel miRNAs of tomato in addition to 52 conserved and 4 variants of conserved miRNAs. Additionally, the same set of RNAseq data identified 38 conserved and 290 novel RKN miRNAs. Both tomato and RKN miRNAs showed differential expression at 5 stages of disease development based on digital expression profiles. In tomato, further validation through qRT-PCR confirmed that majority of miRNAs were significantly upregulated during susceptible response whereas downregulated during resistance response. The predicted targets of 8 conserved and 1 novel miRNAs were validated through 5&#8217;RLM-RACE. A negative correlation between expression profiles of a few conserved miRNAs (miR156, miR159, miR164 and miR396) and their targets (<italic>SBP</italic>, <italic>GAMYB-like</italic>, <italic>NAC</italic> and <italic>GRF</italic>1 transcription factor) was confirmed. A novel Sly_miRNA996 also showed a negative correlation with its target <italic>MYB-like</italic> transcription factor. These results indicate that the conserved and novel tomato miRNAs are involved in regulating developmental changes in host root during RKN infection. In RKN, the targets of conserved miRNAs were also predicted and a few of their predicted target genes are known to be involved in nematode parasitism. Further, the potential roles of both tomato and RKN miRNAs have been discussed.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF)</institution></funding-source><award-id>NFBSFARA/RNA-3022/2012-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0382-9837</contrib-id><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Amar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>R&amp;D Grant Delhi University</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0382-9837</contrib-id><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Amar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>Pritam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research work was supported by grants sanctioned to AK by National Agricultural Science Fund (NASF), Indian Council of Agricultural Research, project code (NFBSFARA/RNA-3022/2012-13) and R&amp;D grant, University of Delhi.

They have a wide host range causing agricultural losses of billions of dollars annually [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RKNs are sedentary endoparasites that complete their lifecycle within the host roots in 30&#8211;45 days. The pre-parasitic second stage juveniles (J2s) invade the plant roots with help of mechanical force and secreted cell wall degrading enzymes through stylet [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They initiate the feeding sites known as giant cells that serve as a source of nutrition for developing nematodes [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Feeding nematodes become sedentary and undergo through a few round of molting to develop into J3s, J4s and adult females. A large number of secreted effector proteins, which are produced in the esophageal glands, play a crucial role in manipulating host machinery to induce the development of giant cells and to suppress basal host defense responses [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several studies have identified repertoire of host genes that are manipulated by effectors during successful infection process. For example, majority of host genes related to defence responses are downregulated and genes involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, cell wall formation and cytoskeleton organisation are upregulated [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The role of microRNAs (miRNA) in regulating the expression of genes involved in various biological processes such as growth and development, hormone signalling, abiotic and biotic stress responses have been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In recent years, the role of plant miRNAs in regulation of genes involved in plant-nematode interaction have also been reported [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The most abundant targets of miRNAs that have been reported with modulated expression during nematode infection are transcription factors. A role of miR396 in modulating the expression of growth regulating factors (<italic>GRF</italic>s) during syncytium formation and maintenance has been demonstrated during cyst nematode infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, Zhao and coworkers [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that miR319/TCP4 module acts as a regulator of jasmonic acid levels upon RKN infection in tomato and thereby, affects the nature of host resistance. Recently, functional role of miR390/TAS3 in regulating <italic>ARF</italic>s at early gall development was studied during <italic>Arabidopsis-</italic>RKN interaction [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In animals, role of miRNAs in relation to diseases have been suggested by predicting the miRNA targets computationally in humans, insects and metazoans [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, cancer associated gender specific miRNAs were identified among human males and females [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, recent studies on identification and characterization of RKN miRNAs suggested their role in nematode development and parasitism [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have used tomato and RKN (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic>) as a model crop-pathogen system to study the role of miRNAs from both tomato and RKN during disease development. Next generation sequencing approach was employed to identify a population of both tomato and RKN miRNAs from <italic>in vivo</italic> RKN-infected tomato roots at five different disease development stages spanning first day post inoculation (dpi) to 30 dpi. Differential expression of both tomato and RKN miRNAs at various stages indicates their role during disease development. To gain insights into the regulatory roles of miRNAs during RKN infection, in silico target prediction of both conserved miRNAs from tomato and RKN and novel miRNAs from tomato was done and their gene ontology (GO) analysis was also performed. Further, targets of 8 conserved and 1 novel tomato miRNAs were validated through 5&#8217;RLM-RACE and correlation in the expression pattern of miRNAs and their targets was determined through qRT-PCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on identification and characterization of miRNAs simultaneously from both tomato and RKN at five different disease development stages that includes early and late stages of RKN infection in tomato roots under soil-grown conditions. Additionally, the role of tomato miRNAs during disease progression and role of RKN miRNAs during its development and parasitism in infected tomato roots have been discussed during tomato-RKN interaction.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Nematode culture, plant material, and growth conditions</title><p>Disease development study was conducted using RKN, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>incognita</italic>, propagated on susceptible Indian tomato line Pusa Ruby in infection house at Department of Botany, University of Delhi, India. RKN culture was obtained from Prof. Uma Rao&#8217;s laboratory, Division of Nematology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India. Infection studies were conducted under controlled growth conditions at 22&#176;C with 16 hour light and 8 hour dark photoperiod. Egg masses were dissected manually from infected roots and kept in deionised water at room temperature for hatching into J2s. After 2&#8211;3 days, the suspension of J2s was passed through three to four layered kimwipe to separate J2s from unhatched eggs. For miRNA studies, tomato susceptible line, Pusa Ruby and resistant transgenic line that contains <italic>Mi-1</italic> resistance gene were used.

The plantlets which have not been infected with nematode were treated as control. Collection of tissue was performed in susceptible line for 30 dpi and resistant line for 7 dpi. Plantlets carefully uprooted, roots were quickly washed under cold tap water, blot dried, excised from the plant and snap chilled with liquid nitrogen. Tissue was stored at -80&#176;C until further processing. The root tissue of uninfected plantlets of the same age was also harvested as control samples. Additionally, one infected plant was harvested on each day to study the lifecycle of nematode and progression of the disease through acid fuchsin staining [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After staining and clearing, the whole root was observed under the inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) and counted the number of nematodes at different development stages. To ensure reproducibility of the time course of disease development, several prior experiments were performed to standardize the count of J2s to be inoculated, substrate required for plant and nematode growth and process for conduction of experiments. Five disease development stages of susceptible response and two stages of resistance response were selected for miRNA study.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>RNA isolation and small RNA library preparation</title><p>Root tissue of equal weight of each disease development stage was processed for total RNA isolation using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) as per manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.

A total of 11 small RNA libraries were prepared including five infected disease development stages with their corresponding uninfected tissue of same age and a library of five-week old uninfected root tissue of susceptible tomato line. Small RNA libraries from root tissue of each stage were prepared independently using Illumina small RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Briefly, an equal amount of total RNA of each stage was used for sequential ligation of 3&#8217;and 5&#8217;adapter using T4 RNA ligase. Adapter ligated small RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and 3&#8217; adapter specific RT-primer. cDNA prepared was amplified and product of approximately 147 bp was eluted through 6% polyacrylamide gel.

The differential expression of miRNAs based on digital expression profiling suggests their potential role during susceptible interaction. Further, qRT-PCR results revealed that majority of tomato miRNAs were significantly upregulated at stage 3 (feeding J2s and J3s/ expansion of feeding sites). However, some of the conserved miRNAs including miR393(i), miR482(i), miR1446(i) and variant of miR156(i) and 4 novel miRNAs including Sly_miRNA667, Sly_miRNA996, Sly_miRNA1987 and Sly_miRNA2712 were also upregulated at stage 1 (invasion of J2s/ initiation of feeding sites). A few miRNAs such as miR164(i), miR319(iv) and miR1446(i) were significantly upregulated at stages 3 and 5 (J4s and females/ maintenance of feeding sites). However, miR319(iv) was significantly downregulated at stage 2 (parasitic J2s/ formation of feeding sites). Interestingly, in contrast to susceptible response, most of the miRNAs were downregulated during resistance response. The up- and down-regulation of distinct miRNAs at different stages suggest their likely role during RKN parasitism in tomato.

Our study also showed that miR169(v) was downregulated at stage 2 during resistance response in contrast to susceptible response. Similarly, during soybean-cyst nematode interaction, the expression of miR169 was upregulated during susceptible response and downregulated during resistance response [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Known targets of miR169 are <italic>NF</italic> transcription factors that regulate various abiotic stress responsive genes [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In recent study, a different member of miR169 family was shown to be downregulated and <italic>NF</italic> transcription factor gene was upregulated at early stage of infection during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-RKN interaction [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results together with previous reports suggest that members of miR169 family are likely to play a role during nematode pathogenesis.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Characterization of a novel tomato miRNA</title><p>We identified a novel miRNA, Sly_miRNA996 that was differentially expressed at different stages of disease development. Interestingly, Sly_miRNA996 showed a negative correlation in expression with its target <italic>MYB-like</italic> transcription factor gene (an uncharacterized protein) at stages 1 and 3 based on qRT-PCR. The <italic>MYB</italic> transcription factor is a large gene family in plants involved in various processes like development, differentiation, metabolism, hormone signaling, defense, abiotic and biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is likely that Sly_miRNA996 by regulating <italic>MYB-like</italic> transcription factor plays a role during tomato-RKN interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Identification and characterization of RKN miRNAs</title><p>We identified 328 RKN miRNAs (21&#8211;24 nt length) from the same small RNAseq dataset based on the RKN genome as a reference [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In total, 38 conserved miRNAs, 106 novel miRNAs and 184 candidate novel miRNAs of RKN were identified. The digital expression profile of these miRNAs showed differential expression across five disease development stages suggesting their probable role during nematode parasitism. For example, conserved miRNAs including miR-100_3, miR-58_1 and lin-4 showed a notable differential expression at different stages in concordance to the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The target prediction of RKN miRNAs provided limited data due to the lack of 3&#8217;UTRs annotation of some RKN genes. Nonetheless, the target prediction data revealed that each miRNA target many genes. For example, differentially expressed miRNAs, lin-4 and miR-100_3, target several genes involved in nucleic acid binding, protein binding, locomotion, growth, embryo development, reproduction and determination of adult lifespan. Furthermore, a differentially expressed miR-58_1 also predicted to target genes involved in gonad development, ATP binding, reproduction, embryo development, nematode larval development and determination of adult lifespan. Moreover, a previous study reported that mutants of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> with deleted miR-58 family members showed abnormalities in body size, locomotion, egg laying and inability to form dauer larva [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Recently, FLPs (<italic>flp</italic> 18 and <italic>flp</italic> 11) were reported as specific targets of miR-58 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In our study, FLPs were also predicted as targets of miR-58_1 and a significant negative correlation in expression between miR-58_1 and FLP was observed at stages 4 and 5 during susceptible response. FLPs are the largest family of neuropeptides in invertebrates that are responsible for nerve and muscle activity and are regulators of feeding behavior, locomotion, sensory modulation, energy balance and reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is likely that miR-58_1 regulated FLPs might be playing a role during susceptible tomato-RKN interaction.</p><p>In conclusion, our comprehensive study reports the genome-wide identification and characterization of miRNAs simultaneously from both tomato and RKN during five stages of disease progression and development of parasitic nematode in RKN-infected tomato roots under soil grown conditions. In tomato, differential expression of miRNAs demonstrated through qRT-PCR in both susceptible and resistance responses indicate that host miRNAs play an important role during plant-nematode interactions. The predicted and validated targets of majority of the miRNAs were transcription factors that may be involved in regulating the genes required for giant cell development. Furthermore, negative correlation between expression levels of selected conserved and novel miRNAs and their targets was demonstrated through qRT-PCR. Additionally, differential expression of RKN miRNAs, their predicted targets and GO enrichment analysis suggest that RKN miRNAs are likely to be regulating key genes involved in nematode parasitism. Moreover, this study has identified a few novel and conserved miRNAs of both tomato [e.g., Sly_miRNA996 and miR169(v)] and RKN (e.g., miR-58_1 and miR-100_3) and their targets that can be further functionally characterized to get better insights into plant-nematode interaction. Finally, this study and previous studies strongly support for a wide range of roles of plant miRNAs during disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and of RKN miRNAs in its development and parasitism during plant-nematode interactions [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this context, the mobility of RNA molecules between different hosts and parasites is important, as reported in a recent review article [<xref rid="pone.0175178.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is likely that future work on miRNAs from both plants and parasitic nematodes would reveal their role in the regulation of each other genes (i.e., cross-talk) involved in plant defense and nematode parasitism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175178.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Length distribution of putative small RNA sequences obtained from all the libraries of susceptible (tomato-RKN) interaction investigated in this study.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175178.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175178.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Predicted secondary structure of precursors of novel miRNAs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Tomato miRNAs and <bold>(B)</bold> RKN miRNAs prepared through Mfold web server.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175178.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175178.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Genomic locus distribution of predicted miRNA precursors of tomato miRNAs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0175178.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0175178.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of RKN miRNAs identified in our study with conserved miRNAs of other nematode species present in miRBASE v21 depository.</title><p>(<bold>A)</bold> Sequence alignment of three RKN miRNAs (identified in our study but not reported previously) was done on the basis of same seed sequence and 80% homology within the mature miRNA sequence (21-24nt).
