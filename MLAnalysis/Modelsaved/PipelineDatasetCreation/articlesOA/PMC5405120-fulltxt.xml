To explore the etiology of HPND, meta-transcriptomic libraries of the hepatopancreata from crabs with and without HPND were constructed. Comparison analyses showed that there were no statistically significant differences in viral and microsporidial communities in the hepatopancreata of diseased and healthy crabs. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were the most dominant bacterial phyla in the hepatopancreata of healthy crabs, with a combined prevalence of 93%. However, a decrease in bacterial diversity and a striking shift in the microbial composition were found in the hepatopancreata of crabs infected with HPND. Tenericutes was the most prevalent bacterial phylum in diseased crabs (31.82%), whereas its prevalence was low in healthy crabs (0.02%). By contrast, the prevalence of Bacteroidetes was significantly lower in crabs with HPND (3.49%) than in crabs without HPND (41.04%). We also found that the prevalence of Actinobacteria was higher in crabs with HPND (16.70%) than in crabs without the disease (4.03%). The major bacterial family within the Tenericutes phylum in crabs with HPND was detected by polymerase chain reaction and determined to be Mycoplasmataceae. In conclusion, there were striking changes in the microbiota of diseased and healthy crabs. Specifically, the prevalence of bacteria belonging to Tenericutes and Actinobacteria phyla increased, whereas the prevalence of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum decreased in crabs with HPND, clearly pointing to an association with HPND.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>hepatopancreatic necrosis disease</kwd><kwd>tenericutes</kwd><kwd>bacteroidetes</kwd><kwd>meta-transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100005906</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5706"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The freshwater Chinese mitten crab <italic>E. sinensis</italic> is an economically important crustacean cultured in the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Liaoning (Shen et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). With the rapid increase of the <italic>E. sinensis</italic> aquacultural industry, numerous diseases have recently evolved, thus resulting in huge economic losses (Shen et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For example, hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (HPND, &#8220;shuibiezi&#8221; in Chinese), which affects <italic>E. sinensis</italic>, has been a major problem in the crab-cultivated area of Jiangsu Province since 2015. Crabs with HPND exhibit multiple clinical symptoms, including hepatopancreata that are lighter in color (turning from golden yellow and light yellow to gray&#8211;white) and soft shells that are darker in color than usual, as well as muscle atrophy and edema (Ding et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Furthermore, the stomachs and intestines are empty in many diseased crabs. The majority of the diseased crabs do not die immediately; instead, they continue to molt, albeit at a later stage of breeding. However, these crabs are of little/no economic value, and they eventually die. A previous study reported that microsporidia were detected in the hepatopancreata of crabs infected with HPND (Ding et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, hepatopancreatic injury caused by environmental toxicants is believed to be one of the main causes of HPND. However, the etiology of HPND is unknown.</p><p>The hepatopancreas of crustaceans functions in both digestion and absorption (Wang et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004b</xref>). A dense microbial colonization has been observed in the hepatopancreas of several isopods (Wood and Griffiths, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Zimmer et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004b</xref>) and the shrimp <italic>Neocaridina denticulate</italic> (Cheung et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition to nutrition and digestion, the immanent microbiota play crucial roles in the immune response of their animal hosts (Cheung et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and an imbalance of host&#8211;microbiota homeostasis has been shown to be responsible for certain illnesses (Chen et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A previous study has reported symbiotic bacteria in crabs to belong to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes (Li et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Givens et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Of these symbiotic bacteria, Tenericutes are unique, because they lack a cell wall, are small in size, and possess a reduced genome (Ryan and Ray, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Furthermore, bacteria of the genus <italic>Candidatus Hepatoplasma</italic>, which belong to the Tenericutes phylum, were identified in symbionts colonizing the midgut glands of terrestrial isopods, and a positive correlation was identified between the survival of hosts and the ingestion of low-quality food (Wang et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004a</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fraune and Zimmer, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Leclercq et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, bacteria of the phylum Tenericutes have been shown to associate with several crustacean diseases, such as mycoplasma spp., which was isolated from the moribund prawn <italic>Peneaux monodon</italic> (Ghadersohi and Owens, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>); spiroplasma, which was linked to tremor disease in the Chinese mitten crab (Wang et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>); and <italic>Acholeplasma</italic> sp., which was implicated in clearwater disease of the mud crab <italic>Scylla serrata</italic> (Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, meta-transcriptomic libraries were constructed from the hepatopancreata of crabs with and without HPND, and viral, microsporidial, and bacterial communities were compared between the two groups. We report herein on statistically significant changes in the microbiota of diseased and healthy crabs. Our data provide valuable insights on the etiology of HPND.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>In June 2015, two crabs with clinical symptoms typical of HPND and two healthy crabs were obtained from an aquatic breeding pond in Yandu District, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China for meta-transcriptomic sequencing.

To remove genomic DNA, RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and quantity of the total RNA was estimated with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

A BLAST search revealed the majority of these genes (134 genes) to be highly homologous with those from <italic>Candidatus Hepatoplasma crinochetorum</italic>, a species in the genus <italic>C.

For example, an alignment showed all 134 genes to be 33&#8211;93% homologous with their corresponding genes in <italic>Candidatus Hepatoplasma crinochetorum</italic>. The gene with the highest homology (93%) was rpoB. These results indicate that these genes are from a microorganism belonging to the genus <italic>C. Hepatoplasma</italic>.

This approach is powerful, because it simultaneously evaluates both viral and bacterial communities, and even suspected pathogens from the Eukaryota domain. Considering that RNA viruses can associate with certain diseases in <italic>E. sinensis</italic> (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Zhang and Bonami, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Shen et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and microsporidia were found in crabs infected with HPND (Ding et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), we analyzed the meta-transcriptomes of hepatopancreata from crabs with and without HPND to identify potential pathogens from viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes.</p><p>We studied the differences between the virome and the microbiome in the hepatopancreata of crabs with and without HPND. Although there was no significant difference in the virome of both groups, we identified a new nodavirus, which was more abundant in the hepatopancreata of diseased crabs than in healthy crabs. The bacterial community in the hepatopancreata of crabs without HPND was more species-rich than that in the hepatopancreata of crabs with HPND. Interestingly, similar findings were reported for the human oral and gut microbiomes during health and disease (Jorth et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ling et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We identified four dominant phyla, namely, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria in the hepatopancreata of healthy crabs. A previous study has reported that 90&#8211;95% of the bacterial phylotypes in the intestine of <italic>E. sinensis</italic> were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and that Bacteroidetes were common to all crab types (Li et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). For example, the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were most abundant in the digestive system of the black tiger shrimp <italic>P. monodon</italic> (Shakibazadeh et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Chaiyapechara et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Similarly, bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum were more plentiful in the hepatopancreas, whereas those of the Firmicutes phylum were more plentiful in the foregut and intestine of the shrimp <italic>N. denticulate</italic> (Cheung et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this study, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were the most dominant bacterial phyla in the hepatopancreata of healthy crabs, with a combined prevalence of 93%. However, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of the major bacterial phyla in the hepatopancreata of crabs with and without HPND. Tenericutes was the most prevalent bacterial phylum in crabs with HPND crabs (31.82%), whereas its prevalence was low in healthy crabs (0.02%). We also found a significantly low proportion of Bacteroidetes in diseased crabs (3.49%) compared to healthy crabs (41.04%). Interestingly, microbial diversity is lower in obese individuals than in lean individuals, with obese individuals having a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes and a higher proportion of Actinobacteria (Turnbaugh et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). There was also a negative relationship between the abundance of Bacteroidetes and the presence of fat deposits (Guo et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The higher proportion of Bacteroidetes in the hepatopancreas may be related to the higher cellulolytic activity in crabs (Cheung et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this study, a similar shift in the microbial composition was found in the hepatopancreata of crabs with HPND compared with healthy crabs. The evolutionarily-stable commensal microbes positively and negatively affect host health, and when this balance is disrupted, symbiotic microbes can induce disease (Breznak and Brune, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Douglas, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Fraune and Zimmer, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jorth et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The lower proportion of Bacteroidetes and the higher proportion of Actinobacteria indicate that there were abnormalities in the metabolic breakdown of fat and cellulose in the hepatopancreata of crabs with HPND.</p><p>The majority of Tenericutes bacteria (&gt;93.8%) belonged to the Mycoplasmataceae family, with 72.9% belonging to <italic>C. Hepatoplasma</italic> and 20.9% belonging to Mycoplasma. Mycoplasmataceae bacteria were found in the symbiotic bacterial community in the gill and the gut of <italic>E. sinensis</italic>. An alignment has shown that <italic>C. Hepatoplasma</italic> shares more than 95% sequence identity with uncultured Mycoplasmataceae detected in the mud crab <italic>Scylla paramamosain</italic> (Li et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), more than 94% sequence identity with uncultured Mycoplasmataceae bacteria in the carapace, gut, and hemolymph of the Atlantic Blue Crab <italic>Callinectes Sapidus</italic> (Givens et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and more than 94% sequence identity with uncultured Mycoplasmataceae symbionts in the midgut of the isopod <italic>Ligia oceanic</italic> (Fraune and Zimmer, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Similar results were reported for the CMC Mollicutes group I that was found in the midgut bacterial community of <italic>E. sinensis</italic> (Chen et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>Hepatoplasma</italic> and the CMC Mollicutes group I might belong to the same species of Mycoplasmataceae bacteria. Mycoplasmataceae bacteria were not detected in the guts of crabs from the Yangtze River Estuary and Chongming Islands (Li et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Tenericutes were the dominant phyla in the gut of the Chinese mitten crab (Chen et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Mycoplasmataceae are one of the most dominant families in the gut; however, they are hardly detected in the gills or water (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These reports suggest that Mycoplasmataceae bacteria in <italic>E. sinensis</italic> are variable, and that Tenericutes are not indispensable to the crab. A previous study has shown that <italic>Candidatus Hepatoplasma crinochetorum</italic> was beneficial to its isopod host under low-nutrient conditions (Fraune and Zimmer, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In this study, the abundance of <italic>Candidatus Hepatopancreas</italic> in the hepatopancreata of crabs with HPND was indicative of abnormalities in the absorption of nutrients.</p><p>We found that the expression of carboxylesterase family genes was significantly up-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S12</xref>). Carboxylesterase is the major enzyme that breaks down the insecticide pyrethroid, which is widely used in Chinese mitten crab cell cultures, although it is known to harm the hepatopancreas (Wheelock et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine how pyrethroid injures the heptopancreas, thus leading to abnormalities in metabolism, nutrient absorption, microbial dysbiosis, and HPND in crabs.</p><p>In addition to Mycoplasmataceae, the genera Acholeplasma and Spiroplasma, also from Mullicutes, were abundant in the hepatopancreata of crabs with HPND. Acholeplasma and Spiroplasma bacteria are responsible for crab disease (Wang W. et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). An alignment of sequences showed that Spiroplasma and <italic>Spiroplasma eriocheir</italic>, which is believed to cause crab tremor disease, are two different species. Further studies are needed to determine whether Acholeplasma and Spiroplasma associate with HPND infection in crabs.</p><p>Microsporidia can also associate with HPND (Ding et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Analysis of meta-transcriptome data indicate that the microsporidial community included three major families, namely, Enterocytozoonidae, Nosematidae, and Unikaryonidae. These microsporidia were found in the hepatopancreata of crabs with and without HPND, although there were no significant differences between groups. Regardless, these data indicate that microsporidia are unlikely to cause HPND.</p><p>In conclusion, there were statistically significant changes in the microbiota of HPND-infected crabs. Specifically, we found an increased prevalence of bacteria belonging to the Tenericutes and Actinobacteria phyla and a decreased prevalence of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum, thus reflecting abnormalities in metabolism and the absorption of nutrients in HPND-infected crabs and indicating a connection with HPND.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>HS performed the experiment work and statistical analysis, produced the tables and figures, and wrote the paper.
