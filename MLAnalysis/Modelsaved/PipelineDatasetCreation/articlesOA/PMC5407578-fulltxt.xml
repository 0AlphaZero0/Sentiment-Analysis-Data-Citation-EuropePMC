This global deficit of AM engulfment may explain why active smokers have worse outcomes of COPD exacerbations, episodes characterized by airway infection and inflammation that carry high morbidity and healthcare cost. When administered as intravenous supplementation, the acute phase-reactant alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) reduces the severity of COPD exacerbations in A1AT deficient (AATD) individuals and of bacterial pneumonia in murine models, but the effect of A1AT on AM scavenging functions has not been reported. Apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) was measured in human AM isolated from patients with COPD, in primary rat AM or differentiated monocytes exposed to CS <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and in AM recovered from mice exposed to CS. A1AT (100 &#956;g/mL, 16 h) significantly ameliorated efferocytosis (by ~50%) in AM of active smokers or AM exposed <italic>ex vivo</italic> to CS. A1AT significantly improved AM global engulfment, including phagocytosis, even when cells were simultaneously challenged with apoptotic and Fc-coated (bacteria-like) targets. The improved efferocytosis in A1AT-treated macrophages was associated with inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; converting enzyme (TACE) activity, decreased mannose receptor shedding, and markedly increased abundance of efferocytosis receptors (mannose- and phosphatidyl serine receptors and the scavenger receptor B2) on AM plasma membrane. Directed airway A1AT treatment (via inhalation of a nebulized solution) restored <italic>in situ</italic> airway AM efferocytosis after CS exposure in mice. The amelioration of CS-exposed AM global engulfment may render A1AT as a potential therapy for COPD exacerbations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001448</institution-id><institution>Alpha-1 Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The 2012 Junior Investigator in Clinical Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid" authenticated="false">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9372-3034</contrib-id><name><surname>Serban</surname><given-names>Karina A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001540</institution-id><institution>CHEST Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The 2012 Junior Investigator in Clinical Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid" authenticated="false">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9372-3034</contrib-id><name><surname>Serban</surname><given-names>Karina A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VA Merit Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrache</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004702</institution-id><institution>Baxter International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrache</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: 1. 2012 Junior Investigator Alpha-1 Foundation and The CHEST Foundation Clinical Research grant to Karina A Serban; 2.

Whereas AM pathogen clearance is important for resolution of airway infection, removal of apoptotic cells ensures resolution of inflammation and repair [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The global dysfunction of AM engulfment in smokers and COPD patients may be most damaging during acute infectious exacerbations, episodes of increased airway infection and inflammation during which AM have to scavenge an increased load of both bacterial and apoptotic targets [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Given the high morbidity and mortality, as well as healthcare cost associated with COPD and COPD exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], therapies aimed at improving AM scavenging functions are of clinical importance.</p><p>AATD individuals have a higher risk of airways disease, including infectious exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggesting an airway-protective effect of the anti-proteinase A1AT. In addition, in AATD patients augmentation of A1AT levels via intravenous administration of purified human protein reduces sputum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the severity of exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A protective airway effect of A1AT has also been demonstrated in non-AATD experimental model, where A1AT-overexpressing mice had reduced lung tissue damage following lung bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and A1AT administration suppressed the AM release of pro-inflammatory mediators in CS-exposed mice [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The airway-protective effect of A1AT may indeed be due to its effects on AM and monocytes, since A1AT treatment profoundly affects peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages (PBMDM) inflammatory response in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Whereas low A1AT concentrations and short exposure times increase TNF-&#945;, IL-8, and IL-1&#946; release, physiologic A1AT concentrations (corresponding to normal A1AT circulating levels; 500 &#956;g/mL) or prolonged exposures (18 h) reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the effect of A1AT on AM engulfment of bacterial or apoptotic targets has not been reported.</p><p>Pathogens&#8217; engulfment during phagocytosis begins with target recognition, a step that involves pathogen opsonization with complement or immunoglobulins and specific recognition by highly conserved complement receptors such as C1R, CD11b or the immunoglobulin receptor complex, such as Fc&#947;RI-III [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The abundance of these membrane receptors can be regulated by membrane proteases [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since A1AT inhibits the sheddase TACE (ADAM17) [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], A1AT may play a specific role in maintaining the expression of Fc&#947;RI-III phagocytosis receptors on AM plasma membrane. This notion is supported by the finding that A1AT decreases the expression of several other phagocytosis receptors such as TLR4, and TLR2 on LPS-stimulated islet macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Apoptotic targets&#8217; engulfment (efferocytosis) occurs via a plethora of scavenger receptors that bind directly, or via a ligand (e.g. Gas-6 or protein S) to phosphatidylserine (PS) residues expressed on apoptotic cells&#8217; plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The major scavenger receptors implicated in the AM engulfment of apoptotic targets include the mannose receptor (MAR, CD206), the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO, SCARB-2), PS receptor (PSR), thrombospondin receptor (CD36), LDL receptor-related protein (CD91), hyaluronic acid receptor (CD44), and recognition molecules such as integrins [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These receptors may also be susceptible to protease cleavage that can in turn be modulated by A1AT, but these studies or the effect of A1AT on AM efferocytosis in general has, to our knowledge, not been reported yet.</p><p>Although AM from smokers or subjects with COPD are inefficient in clearing apoptotic cells, the engagement in efferocytosis polarizes them towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, with increased local production of M-CSF, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-33 [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, an excessive AM anti-inflammatory phenotype impairs phagocytosis and clearance of pathogens such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumococcus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], decreasing antibacterial response in the murine lung. In turn, the effect of disproportionate AM phagocytic/ pro-inflammatory polarization on efferocytosis function has not been reported. During infectious exacerbations, the airways may simultaneously contain differently polarized AM populations whose function may be further confounded by active CS exposure. Furthermore, active CS exposure induces posttranslational modifications of the A1AT native molecule (e.g. cleavage and oxidation of the catalytic site), causing an &#8220;acquired&#8221; functional A1AT- deficient state [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These studies suggest that supplementation with native A1AT may be required to achieve functionally normal A1AT levels in COPD individuals, even if they do not have genetic AATD.</p><p>In this study we used complementary approaches to investigate whether exogenous supplementation of native A1AT enhances AM efferocytosis during CS exposure, without detrimental effects on phagocytosis. Our results indicate that A1AT treatment significantly improves AM efferocytosis and phagocytosis, associated with TACE-inhibition and increase in specific scavenging receptor membrane expression. Moreover we demonstrate that when concomitantly exposed to Fc-coated &#8220;bacteria-like&#8221; and apoptotic targets, A1AT-treated AM exhibit increased overall scavenging activity.</p><p>Preliminary results of our studies have been previously presented in the form of abstracts.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Reagents</title><p>Reagents, including LPS and rabbit anti-JMJD6 (PSR) antibody, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified.

While an inhibitory effect of efferocytosis on phagocytosis has been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the effect of Fc-coated target phagocytosis on efferocytosis has not been reported. We measured the reciprocal effect of Fc receptor-mediated engulfment (phagocytosis) on AM efferocytosis and determined the baseline AM global scavenging function, defined as the proportion of AM that performed any target engulfment. In NR8383 AM, phagocytosis of Fc-coated targets suppressed in a dose-dependent manner the proportion of AM that performed exclusively efferocytosis of apoptotic targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176073.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To test whether the phagocytosis of larger Fc-coated targets has similar effects, primary rat AM were concomitantly incubated with CTG-labeled Jurkat T-cells coated with IgG2a anti-human CD3 (larger size Fc-coated targets) and apoptotic targets. We noticed the same marked inhibitory effect of phagocytosis on efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176073.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). When AM were treated with increasing apoptotic targets, as reported, efferocytosis dose-dependently inhibited Fc receptor-mediated AM engulfment (phagocytosis) of Fc-coated targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176073.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p><p>E<italic>x-vivo</italic> CS exposure of primary rat AM simultaneously challenged with Fc-coated and apoptotic targets decreased phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and the global engulfment of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176073.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Treatment with A1AT (100 &#956;g/mL, 16 h) treatment significantly increased the global scavenging function of CS-exposed AM concomitantly challenged with Fc-coated and apoptotic targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176073.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study identified that treatment with A1AT significantly improves efferocytosis, phagocytosis, and overall scavenging function of CS-exposed dysfunctional AM. This finding may have clinical relevance to smokers and individuals with COPD with impaired AM scavenging function, which perpetuates pathogen persistence and lower airways bacterial colonization linked to chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and frequent exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These results indicate that native A1AT protein can be considered along with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; agonists, macrolide antibiotics, corticosteroids, statins, and anti-oxidants as enhancer of AM engulfment of either pathogens or apoptotic targets during CS exposure [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Whereas exogenous A1AT did not further augment the engulfment function of healthy AM, a role of endogenous native A1AT in acute inflammatory and repair phases of airway infections in otherwise healthy individuals remains to be investigated. However, in smokers or in AATD, where the function and levels, respectively, of endogenous A1AT may be suboptimal to stimulate airway bacteria and apoptotic cell clearance, A1AT supplementation may be required to achieve functional A1AT levels that restore AM engulfment.</p><p>A1AT stimulated efferocytosis of CS-exposed AM not only in <italic>ex vivo</italic> models, but also <italic>in vivo</italic>, following exogenously administered apoptotic targets in CS-exposed C57BL/6J mice. Since both increased efferocytosis and inhibition of apoptosis lower the abundance of apoptotic cells in tissues, our current results are congruent with our previous reports of decreased apoptotic cells in lungs of animals exposed to pro-apoptotic stimuli and treated with exogenous A1AT [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, we revealed for the first time that A1AT&#8217;s stimulatory effect on efferocytosis was associated with increased abundance of AM receptors that recognize apoptotic targets, recognition required as first step for successful completion of efferocytosis. Unlike complement- or Fc-mediated phagocytosis, which involve highly conserved, receptor-specific engulfment of pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], efferocytosis of apoptotic targets involves a wide array of receptors&#8212;MAR, SRB-2, PSR, CD36, LDL-rp, CD44 and bridging molecules&#8212;Milk-fat-globule-factor (MFG-E8), Gas6, thrombospondin, &#946;2 glycoprotein-I, protein S, and annexin I [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consistent with studies by Hodge <italic>et al</italic>., we found decreased levels of MAR, PSR, and SRB-2 on AM exposed to CS, associated with impaired AM efferocytosis in active smokers and COPD individuals [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A1AT treatment significantly increased these receptor levels in human AM from active smokers, AATD individuals, and in CS-exposed primary rat and NR8383 AM. Moreover, A1AT treatment decreased sMAR shedding from the plasma membrane of CS-exposed AM, consistent with TACE-inhibition by the serpin, a non-canonical function shown by others and us in PMN [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], respectively, and now demonstrated here in AM. While this association does not prove causality, the evidence that MAR is cleaved by TACE [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], that TACE is inhibited by A1AT [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and that A1AT decreases sMAR shedding and increases MAR&#8217;s plasma membrane abundance highly suggests that TACE inhibition by A1AT is a central mechanism accounting for enhanced efferocytosis. However, the mechanisms by which A1AT enhances Fc-engulfment or phagocytosis remain elusive. One potential candidate mechanism is preservation of Fc -receptor complex at the plasma membrane as suggested by Bergin <italic>et al</italic>., who demonstrated A1AT-mediated TACE inhibition was associated with increased Fc&#947;RIIIb expression on neutrophils membrane and decreased neutrophil chemotaxis [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another putative mechanism may be explained by direct functional interaction of A1AT with complement protein, C3b as recently reported in abstract form [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and may enhance phagocytosis of opsonized bacterial targets via complement receptors pathway.</p><p>A novel observation reported in this study is that when AM are simultaneously challenged with both apoptotic and phagocytic targets, each target inhibits the effectiveness of overall AM engulfment. Whereas exposure to CS further inhibits, A1AT treatment improves overall AM engulfment even during this complex engulfment environment. Although our <italic>ex vivo</italic> model cannot be directly extrapolated to chronic airway inflammatory conditions&#8212;e.g. COPD, AATD, cystic fibrosis, or severe asthma, the airways of affected patients frequently contain both bacteria (e.g. <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, or <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and a large burden of apoptotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our findings, which require validation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model, are not surprising, since Medeiros <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that apoptotic cells suppress bacteria phagocytosis in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, our group and others have published that bacterial released products like alginate and pyocynin dampen the ability of AM to scavenge apoptotic targets [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176073.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, a significantly increased phagocytosis was only noted shortly after A1AT supplementation (4 h), but not after prolonged (16 h) treatment, whereas the reverse was true for enhancement of efferocytosis. This suggests differential, time-dependent effect of A1AT on cell function. We and others have noted similar biphasic effects of A1AT on endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and macrophages (PBDM) responses to inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the latter, Subramaniyam <italic>et al</italic>. have demonstrated that A1AT administration enhanced LPS-induced TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-8 release at 4 h from human monocytes and neutrophils, but A1AT delayed effect was not investigated [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The mechanisms behind these time-dependent effects require further clarification, as they may determine the timing and frequency of A1AT supplementation for various clinical indications.</p><p>Nebulized A1AT has been successfully tested in patients with cystic fibrosis and showed that A1AT treatment decreases sputum anti-elastase activity, airway bacterial or neutrophil load in the CF lung [<xref rid="pone.0176073.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Based on these reports and our current findings of enhanced AM scavenging function without further incitement of inflammation, administration of A1AT to the airways may be considered for active smokers with acute lung bacterial infections to reduce exacerbation duration, severity, and time to recovery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Patricia Smith and Brandon Day from the Pulmonary Division&#8212;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Lab at Indiana University and William Janssen and the National Jewish Health Human Lung Tissue Research Consortium for expert technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0176073.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Vandivier</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Henson</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Burying the dead: the impact of failed apoptotic cell removal (efferocytosis) on chronic inflammatory lung disease</article-title>. <source>Chest</source>. <year>2006</year>;<volume>129</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>1673</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>82</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1378/chest.129.6.1673</pub-id>
