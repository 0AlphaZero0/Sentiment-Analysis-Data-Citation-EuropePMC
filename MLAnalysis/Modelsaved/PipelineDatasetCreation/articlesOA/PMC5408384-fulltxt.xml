Small molecules, even FDA-approved drugs, are often more promiscuous than initially anticipated as a result of the complexity of cellular environments. Experimental assays of 72 inhibitors with 442 kinases showed that 64% of the compounds bind 20% of kinases with an affinity threshold of 3&#160;&#956;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among these 72 inhibitors, 11 are FDA-approved drugs. Another inter-family large-scale study with data for 238 655 compounds and 2876 targets, showed that promiscuity is often within the same protein family, but also among members of different protein families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Promiscuity can play a role in the appearance of side-effects, but could also be leveraged in polypharmacological strategies or repurposing.</p><p>Promiscuity is often perceived negatively because of side-effects that can occur when the drug modulates the activity of off-targets. Toxicity issues are responsible for nearly 30% of failures in drug development programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The side-effects associated with common off-targets are well documented and these targets are often screened during drug development to decrease the risks of side-effects during subsequent development phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The predominant dogma was often one disease, one target, one drug, where the drug had to be as selective as possible. The increasing comprehension of metabolic networks and their properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], like the redundancy of signaling pathways, can influence the targeting strategy. Indeed, the modulation of multiple key targets in the network by a single therapeutic drug, a strategy termed polypharmacology, could be more efficient than the one-drug one-target approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The promiscuous nature of certain drugs could therefore be leveraged for these multi-target tactics targeting the same condition or a different one.</p><p>Large-scale analyses of promiscuity can lead to interesting discoveries and novel treatment avenues. For example, an approved drug capable of modulating the activity of an off-target could suggest a repurposing of this drug. This is particularly interesting if the compound is an FDA-approved drug as it could be brought to market more rapidly and economically.</p><p>In order to exploit promiscuity, its underlying factors must be understood more clearly. The ability of a ligand to bind multiple targets likely depends on ligand-based and target-based properties, as both are inter-dependent. Ligand hydrophobicity is generally correlated with promiscuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Haupt et al. also found a correlation between binding promiscuity and ligand flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the latter study, target binding-site similarity was also shown to correlate with promiscuity, at least for the PDB structure dataset used. Environmental conditions, post-translational modifications and target structural plasticity are factors known to play a role in promiscuity not only for protein-ligand, but also for protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ultimately, in order to understand promiscuity, the cellular contexts of such interactions must be taken in consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The importance of both ligand and protein binding-site features is reflected on the existence of ligand-based and target-based methods to predict off-targets. Paolini et al. built Bayesian classification models for 698 targets using the structures of their ligands, obtaining a 153-fold enrichment compared to random in the prediction of targets for such drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Another ligand-based method, the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compares a ligand to ligand ensembles. The SEA method was employed on 3665 approved or investigational drugs against 246 targets. Some predictions made were validated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The method was also used to find targets related to observed side-effects for 656 drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of target-based methods for the detection of binding-site similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among these, SOIPPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], CavBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], eMatchSite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], IsoCleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and IsoMIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Such methods can be used to predict protein function from structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], understand promiscuity within a protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], assess drugability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and explain the cross-reactivity of drugs. The ability of CavBase to predict off-targets for 16 kinase inhibitors was evaluated with ROC (Receiving Operating Characteristic) curves giving an average AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.70. SOIPPA predicted off-targets of selective estrogen receptor modulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and of torcetrapib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in order to explain side-effect mechanisms. There are also inverse docking methods, such as Target Fishing Dock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], where a ligand is screened against a panel of target structures and the ones with the best scores are retained.</p><p>In the current work we perform a large-scale analysis of binding-sites of targets for an ensemble of drugs using IsoMIF, a method that detects molecular interaction field (MIF) similarities between binding-sites. IsoMIF was shown to outperform existing methods on a variety of datasets providing a higher and more robust measure of average AUC values across datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The binding-sites of drug targets are compared to cavities in a non-redundant subset of proteins with known structures. The resulting predictions are used to generate hypotheses of two types. First, the new targets predicted could represent drug repurposing avenues and, second, they could be used to explain known side-effects of the drugs. For the most significant predictions, molecular docking simulations were performed using the FlexAID algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to determine the potential docking pose of the drug in the potential cross-reactivity target. Poses of the ligand obtained by superimposing the drug bound target on the predicted cross-reactivity target using MIF similarities were compared to the pose obtained by the docking algorithm allowing to rationalize the prediction by looking at potential interactions in the target binding-site.</p><p>We provide specific examples of hypotheses regarding repurposing and side-effect mechanisms. Furthermore, all the data of the analyses is made available through a web interface including PyMOL sessions representing the detected MIF similarities and docking poses. Lists of interesting cases, i.e. those with high levels of MIF similarities and small RMSD between the IsoMIF and the FlexAID docking poses are made available through the interface at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/drugs.php.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definition of binding-sites</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Drug dataset targets</title><p>The list of ligands was obtained from the Drug and Drug Target Mapping, an RCSB resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] available on the Protein Data Bank web site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This list contains all the PDB structures crystalized with a ligand mapped in Drugbank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The structure does not always represent the primary target of the drug and sometimes one drug can have multiple targets, but a structure is retained only if it has at least 30% sequence identity with one of the known primary targets of the respective drug. The list is filtered to remove structures containing RNA or DNA structures. Each entry is named with the following nomenclature 2ITY_IRE_2020_A_-, where 2ITY is the 4 letter PDB code and IRE 2020 A &#8211; the PDB ligand code, number, chain and alternate location (&#8216;-&#8217; if none) respectively. The dataset is available for download from our site. For simplicity, we refer to this dataset as Drugs dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Non-redundant protein structure dataset</title><p>The binding-site of every drug was compared against a dataset of potential target binding-sites obtained from the PISCES server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This dataset represents the largest non-redundant set of structures currently known from a sequence point-of-view according to PSI-BLAST with a 30% sequence identity threshold. The structures also respect certain quality criteria. They have at least a 2.0&#160;&#197; resolution and an R-factor of 2.0. The list contains 8016 PDB chains. The dataset is available for download from our site. For simplicity, we refer to this dataset as Pisces dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Detection of binding-site similarities and docking simulations</title><p>The similarities between each drug binding-site and each Pisces binding-site were detected using IsoMIF and its default parameters, and a grid with 1.5&#160;&#197; spacing. Cavities were identified using the GetCleft algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. IsoMIF offers several advantages over existing methods for the detection of similarities, particularly across protein families and between binding-sites that share little or no evolutionary relationships. One notable advantage of using IsoMIF is that it is agnostic to the nature of amino acids lining the cavities under comparison but instead it relies on the detection of similarities in the interactions that are deemed favourable in particular positions in the two cavities. In the Drugs dataset, the MIFs were defined using a 3&#160;&#197; threshold around ligands. For the structures in Pisces, the top 2 largest cavities found using GetCleft in contact with the Pisces PDB chain and in contact with at most 250 residues were retained. Another advantage of the IsoMIF method is that it can handle such large cavities and still find the largest sub-volume of MIF similarities.</p><p>For each target, two measures of binding-site similarity are calculated by IsoMIF, the Tanimoto coefficient and the fraction of significant <italic>MIF</italic>
<italic>P</italic> robes in <italic>C</italic>ommon of the <italic>q</italic>uery (MPC<sub>q</sub>). The Tanimoto coefficient is the same as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and MPC<sub>q</sub> represents the fraction of the significant MIF probes (as defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) identified in the Drugs binding-site found similar to the MIF of the Pisces binding-site. As opposed to the Tanimoto, MPC<sub>q</sub> is not affected by the initial volume of the Pisces cavity, an uncontrolled parameter in this study.</p><p>For each drug, the top targets were sorted using the Z-score calculated for the Tanimoto coefficient and the MPC<sub>q</sub> measure for each Drug-Pisces binding-site combination. Whenever a Drug binding-site and a Pisces cavity have a Tanimoto coefficient of similarity or MPC<sub>q</sub> with Z-score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;3.0 (further referred as Z<sub>3</sub>), the two were superimposed using the transformation matrix that best superimposes the detected MIF similarities. This allows us to obtain a rough pose of the ligand in the Pisces cavity.</p><p>Docking simulations for targets with Z<sub>3</sub> were performed using FlexAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. FlexAID is a probabilistic genetic-algorithm based method. To ensure a satisfactory coverage of the search space, each simulation was repeated 10 times with a population size of 1000 chromosomes and for 1000 generations for a total of 10<sup>6</sup> energy evaluations. The RMSD between the top 25 poses for each Drug-Pisces combination and the pose obtained after the superimposition with the similarities detected by IsoMIF were calculated. For each Drug-Pisces combination the pose with the best RMSD and with the best docking score was retained. Docked ligands with a small RMSD with respect to the pose superimposed using the binding-site similarities represent independent corroborating evidence that the ligand could bind the cross-reactivity binding-site. Specifically, it indicates that those groups responsible for the conserved molecular interaction field similarities are also responsible for favourable interactions with the ligand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Drug side-effects and target data</title><p>For each drug entry, the toxicity information was obtained from Drugbank when available. Also, using the PubChem identifier of the drug, side-effects from Sider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were fetched with the observed frequency when available. For each Pisces protein, cross-referenced information was retrieved from the Uniprot database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

A total of 9845 docking simulations were performed (for each Drug/Pisces combination with Z<sub>3</sub>) among which 4764 (48.4%) had a top pose with an RMSD of at most 3.0&#160;&#197;. This number decreases to 2923 (29.6%) for an RMSD threshold of 2.0&#160;&#197;.

Among ligands that have the most predicted targets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2), are ethanol, acetohydroxamic acid, dichloroacetic acid and salicylic acid. These are small in terms of number of heavy atoms. Thus, it is more likely to detect binding-sites that contain atomic arrangements that satisfy the limited number of favourable interactions to bind such ligands.</p><p>The two measures of binding-site similarity used have their merits and disadvantages. For a fixed detected number of common probes between query and target search cavities, the Tanimoto coefficient is affected by differences in the volume of cavities whereas the MPC<sub>q</sub> (measure) is not affected. Biologically, the two similarity measures are relevant, but MPC<sub>q</sub> is used to identify cases where the Tanimoto coefficient would fail to yield a high similarity score because of the binding-site volume difference. This difference would occur especially if GetCleft identifies one large cavity composed of small interconnected cavities as shown below, but these were filtered out using the 250 residues cavity size limit. Naproxen with 17 heavy atoms is the next ligand identified in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 with 122 targets predicted at Z<sub>3</sub>. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug capable of binding only via aromatic and nonpolar interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Its primary target, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, was identified at a low rank of 3687 with a weak Z-score of 0.55. The reason behind this low similarity is that the naproxen binding-site on the primary target was part of a large cavity that was filtered out (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) by the 250 residues size filter. This shows that, in some cases, biologically relevant binding-sites were excluded through the filtering process. The next most promiscuous ligand in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 is meloxicam, another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with 110 predicted targets.

While the set of targets of the most promiscuous ligands do not necessarily overlap the set of the most common targets found for all ligands (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4), the most commonly predicted targets have binding-sites that are significantly more hydrophobic and aromatic than the average, as illustrated in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Target promiscuity</title><p>Among common predicted targets, the mineralocorticoid nuclear receptor (MR), represented by binding-site 4PF3_2, is a receptor expressed in many human tissues that binds steroid hormones, more specifically mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids.

The MIF of 4PF3_2 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is measured in the substrate binding-site where the compound 6-[1-(2,2-difluoro-3-hydroxypropyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazol-4-yl]-2<italic>H</italic>-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4<italic>H</italic>)-one is bound in the crystal structure 4PF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

The best docking pose of zanamivir on KCNQ1 gives an RMSD of 2.24&#160;&#197; suggesting that the drug could potentially bind the cross-reactivity binding-site. This structure represents the tail domain of potassium voltage-gated channel KCNQ1 involved in repolarization of cardiac cells and trans-epithelial potassium secretion in the internal ear. Mutations of this gene are associated with the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and the Romano-Ward syndrome, recessive and dominant autosomal variants of familial long QT syndrome, respectively, familial atrial fibrillation, and familial short QT syndrome. These rare diseases are all characterized by cardiac arrhythmias. Another mutation in a gene of the same family, KCNQ4, was recently associated to deafness and hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These associations suggest that the interaction of zanamivir with KCNQ1 (3HFE_1) and perhaps other members of this family such as KCNQ4 could cause the observed side effects. In particular, a single threonine to glutamine amino-acid variation differentiates the region where our analysis suggests that zanamivir could bind to KCNQ1 and that in KCNQ4.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results above highlight some examples obtained from the large-scale analysis of binding-site similarities between drug targets and a non-redundant set of known protein structures. Whereas these examples describe potential drug repurposing candidates or potential molecular explanations for observed side-effects, a number of caveats are in place. First and foremost, the computational data suggest molecular interactions between small-molecules and proteins but as computational hypotheses, must still be validated experimentally.</p><p>In the case of drug repurposing hypotheses, the bioavailability of the drug needs to be determined to assess the capacity of the drug to interact with the target. Yet, even if the specific molecule in question may not itself be a good candidate for drug repurposing due to bioavailability issues, it may open novel venues to inhibit the new target.</p><p>In the case of hypotheses of mechanisms that explain side-effects, in addition to bioavailability considerations, it is likely that the proposed molecular mechanism is only partially responsible for the side-effect. This seems likely to be so for side-effects that tend to be common and, thus, more likely to arise from several different molecular mechanisms.</p><p>From a technical point of view, the fact that some ligands are represented by multiple entries in the Drugs dataset can compensate for certain limitations of binding-site similarity detection methods, specifically conformational differences between the structures of the different binding-sites or the existence of different ligand binding modes. If the performance of ligand-based drug target prediction methods increases when ligand ensembles are used, as in the SEA method, target-based methods that use multiple binding-sites of the same drug could, in principle, yield a higher true positive hit rate when using multiple inputs. Some entries of the original Drugs dataset from RCSB contained unbound structures of primary targets or primary target homologs that were not included in the present work, mainly because the methodology used to define the drug binding-sites required a bound ligand. However, it must be stressed that this is entirely an experimental design choice in the present study and not a requirement to perform binding-site comparisons with IsoMIF. Indeed, whole cavities as defined by GetCleft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] could have been used.</p><p>Because of the non-redundant nature of the Pisces dataset, each binding-site is represented by a single structure. However, including multiple binding-sites from different structures of the same target in the Pisces dataset could be beneficial as conformational changes between structures can affect the detection of similarities. Furthermore, In order to filter out large cavities, a limit of 250 residues in contact with a cavity was used. The reason behind this threshold is that large cavities generate MIFs with many grid vertices and, thus, large association graphs during the search step, increasing significantly the computational time necessary to perform clique detection. More importantly, the whole volume of such large cavities most probably do not represent biologically-relevant binding-sites while sub-regions of these large cavities do. However, as we don&#8217;t know in principle where the potentially biologically-relevant subsection of a cavity is, the fact that IsoMIF can handle such large input cavities without affecting the detection of similarities is an advantage in the present study. While this filtering procedure helps us to decrease the computational time required for the detection of similarities and increase the signal to noise ratio, it could exclude potentially interesting binding-sites. Target datasets like the Potential Drug Target Database (PDTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which contains more than 1100 PDB structures with cross-referenced information or scPDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] which represents more than 8000 druggable binding-sites or PDID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], a database representing 3746 druggable human protein structures could be used in a combined or alternative fashion to the Pisces dataset. Considering that binding-sites are more conserved than other regions of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and that the Pisces dataset includes structures of proteins for which there are no human ortholog structures available, the use of the Pisces dataset may help increase the coverage of unique binding-sites. High levels of similarity found with a non-human protein that is a member of a protein family of interest to human health, opens the way to scrutinize all members of that family in detail using the alternative datasets above.</p><p>Despite the above limitations regarding the exclusion of potentially important binding-sites and the lack of structural variability in the Pisces target dataset, several hypotheses were proposed regarding potential drug repurposing avenues and side effect mechanisms. The examples presented demonstrate how a target-based MIF similarity method can be used to identify potential off-targets. The results of the docking simulations provide additional information to help assess if the drug could bind the predicted target. The docking predictions leading to small RMSD values represent cases where there are no steric clashes that prevent binding in the off-target binding-site and where the similarities found likely represent important favourable interactions to bind the ligand that are conserved between the target and off-target binding-sites. However, as no docking method is infallible, a consensus docking score using different docking methods could detect false-negative cases that were missed. Furthermore, beyond information regarding the binding of the single molecule of interest (the drug in this case), docking a diverse dataset of small molecules could be used to generate a binding profile that can be compared to the binding-site similarity measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Finally, docking scores in principle cannot be directly related to binding-affinities but methods such as MM/GBSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] try to assess binding free-energies and could provide further information on the potential drug-target interaction. It is interesting to note however that given that 29.6% of cases with high levels of similarities (z-score&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3.0) do have an RMSD below 2.0&#160;&#197; shows that the important interactions that stabilize a ligand pose in the docking simulation are shared between the two binding-sites.</p><p>The off-targets identified could also represent polypharmacological targets if they happen to be associated to a biological process relevant to the same condition. Considering the challenge represented by the design of a potent ligand for a single target, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of finding an already existing ligand that can potently inhibit multiple targets is low. As the ligand would most probably need to go through a medicinal chemistry program to increase selectivity and potency for the polypharmacological target(s), all the required steps involved in drug development such as clinical evaluation of toxicity will be required. Despite this, the data presented here may contain interesting cases from a polypharmacological perspective.</p><p>Identifying the molecular causes responsible for the side effects of drugs is a complex task. The phenotype is not necessarily a direct cause of the modulation of an off-target. It could be the result of a cascade of effects across the biological network, sometimes involving the primary target. Systems biology methods, such as flux balance analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] in the case of metabolic networks can be used to suggest if the inhibition of a given protein may be deleterious to the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, the integration of systems and structural methods remains an important challenge in bioinformatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. With the increasing accessibility of exome sequencing, in the future it is likely that we will be able to integrate such data with off-target predictions as generated here towards the goal of precision medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work we utilise the detection of molecular interaction field similarities in what is to our knowledge the first large scale analysis prediction of off-target effects to suggest potential cases of drug repurposing and determine molecular mechanisms responsible for side effects. Drug off-targets were identified in a number of different ways using other binding-site similarity methods based for example on the detection of C-alpha similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], side effect similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] or data mined from social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. All these predictions can be combined with experimental data and systems biology approaches to yield promising tools to better understand the biological response of an organism exposed to a drug. Lastly, the data generated in the present work represents a useful resource to identify additional cases of protein pairs that may interact with the same small-molecules in order to repurpose existing drugs and understand observed side effects.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p>
