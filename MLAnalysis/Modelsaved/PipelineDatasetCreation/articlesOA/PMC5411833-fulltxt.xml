In steady-state muscle tissue, as part of the ATP generation mechanism during aerobic respiration, cytochrome c, an essential component of the electron transport system, stabilizes cells that are reacting with oxygen [<xref rid="b1-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During rapid exercise, an oversupply of oxygen in the blood reacts with electrons that are generated from the electron transport system and forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="b2-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These ROS, which indicate oxidative stress, destroy DNA through muscle fatigue, damage, and apoptosis [<xref rid="b3-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The protection of cellular organelles from ROS occurs in part via the oxidation of glutathione by ROS. The glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (<italic>GCLM</italic>) and the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (<italic>GCLC</italic>) form the glutathione cysteine ligase (<italic>GCL</italic>) that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and cysteine into &#947;-glutamyl cysteine, a glutathione precursor [<xref rid="b4-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During strenuous exercise and in other situations that induce oxidative stress, the <italic>GCLC</italic> gene is expressed [<xref rid="b5-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In experiments using blood from marathon runners, glutathione expression was found to increase after strenuous exercise, and it has been hypothesized that <italic>GCLC</italic> was up-regulated in response to this exercise [<xref rid="b7-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the case of <italic>GCLM</italic>, the expression pattern also increased during strenuous exercise [<xref rid="b6-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], again owing to oxidative stress [<xref rid="b8-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A previous study showed that the expression of the <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> genes was up-regulated in the muscle of Thoroughbred horses in response to exercise [<xref rid="b9-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These data indicate that glutathione-synthesis-related genes play important roles in alleviating the stress response during exercise. Despite various experiments with <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic>, understanding these genes in horses during exercise is still insufficient.</p><p>In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses of horse <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> genes, and investigated their expression in muscle and blood in response to exercise stress to gain insights into their potential application as biomarkers for ROS responses in horses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue sampling</title><p>Two stallions and one mare Throughbred horses aged 5, 9, and 10, weighing from 500 to 700 kg which were maintained at Ham-an Racing Horse Resort and Training Center were used to obtain the blood and skeletal muscle samples before and after exercise. Exercise was performed by trotting at the speed of 13 km/h for 30 min and cantering through lunging and long-reining (circular bridge lunging).</p><p>Three Jeju horses (3 mares), which were maintained at The National Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Rural Development Administration were used to obtain tissue samples skeletal muscle, kidney, thyroid, lung, appendix, colon, spinal cord and heart. All tissue samples were kept in a liquid nitrogen tank until extraction of RNA was done. All procedures were conducted by following the protocol that had been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Pusan National University (protocol numbers: PNU-2013-0417, PNU-2013-0411).</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA isolation</title><p>Total RNA samples for investigation of <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> gene expression were collected from three Thoroughbreds. Skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, liver, lung, colon, and spinal cord tissues were extracted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The various tissues sampled from the horses (50 to 100 mg, or 3 mL in the case of blood) were crushed with a mortar and pestle and mixed with 9 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer (Solgent Co. Ltd., Daejeon, Korea) to remove red blood cells. The cells were then dissolved using 1 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 200 &#956;L of chloroform was added to remove cells from the organic solvent. The mixture was then shaken for 10 s and left at 4&#176;C for 5 min. Centrifugal separation was carried out at 4&#176;C for 15 min, and then the supernatant was removed to a new test tube and mixed with the same amount of isopropanol. The test tube was left at 4&#176;C for 15 min to produce RNA pellets. Isopropanol was removed by carrying out centrifugal separation at 4&#176;C for 15 min and the sample was then sterilized with 85% ethanol and dissolved in RNase-free water. The purity of the extracted RNA was confirmed by measuring the absorbance at 230 nm and 260 nm using a spectrophotometer (ND-100, Nano Drop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and only the extracted RNA with purity optic density (OD) value at 230 nm divided by OD value at 260 nm) over 1.8 (found via quantitative analysis) was used. The selected RNA was stored at &#8722;70&#176;C until the experiment was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA synthesis</title><p>In order to synthesize cDNA, 2 &#956;g of RNA, 1 &#956;L of oligo-dT (Invitrogen, Germany), and 1 &#956;L of RNase-free water were added, the mixture was denatured at 80&#176;C for 3 min, and then the cDNA was synthesized using 4 &#956;L of 5&#215; reverse transcription buffer, 5 &#956;L of 2 mM deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), 0.5 &#956;L of RNase inhibitor (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), and 1 &#956;L of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Polymerase chain reaction</title><p>The nucleotide sequences of horse <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> genes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) and the Ensembl Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>) were retrieved to design the primers with PRIMER3 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/">http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/</ext-link>).

This was repeated for 40 cycles, and then a final extension was performed at 72&#176;C for 10 min. The band was confirmed on UV using a 1.5% SeaKem LE agarose gel (Lonza, Rockland, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification</title><p>The real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed using a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in order to measure the relevant expression of the target genes.

The genomic structure of horse <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> is shown in (<xref rid="f1-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>GCLC</italic> gene consists of 16 exons, and the <italic>GCLM</italic> gene is composed of 6 exons. The full lengths of the <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> genes are 1,935 and 1,425 bp, respectively. The horse <italic>GCLC</italic> gene encodes 637 amino acids and the <italic>GCLM</italic> gene encodes 233 amino acids (<xref rid="t1-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the evolutionary relationships of <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> in horses, we obtained gene sequences from eight species of mammals (human, macaque, orangutan, cow, pig, horse, rat, and mouse) from Ensembl 62 and conducted a phylogenetic analysis (<xref rid="f2-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The amino acid similarity of the two genes in the eight mammals is over 90% (<xref rid="t2-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>, <xref rid="t3-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Both horse <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> are clustered in the same clade as other livestock such as pig and cow. Simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) analysis revealed that horse <italic>GCLC</italic> protein contains the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) domain from amino acid position 236 to 608, which represents a signature catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase domain (EC 6.3.2.2) (<xref rid="f1-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Horse <italic>GCLM</italic> protein possess the aldo-keto reductase family domain which is covered by the amino acid sequences from 29 to 190 (<xref rid="f1-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these two proteins are structurally conserved, suggesting that the function of <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> are conserved during the evolution.</p><p>To get the insights for function of these genes, we conducted RT-PCR and RT-qPCR using seven Thoroughbred horse tissues (<xref rid="f3-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The results showed that <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> are expressed in skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, liver, lung, colon, and spinal cord, suggesting ubiquitous expression. But there were no differences in both of <italic>GCLC</italic> gene and <italic>GCLM</italic> gene expression in the horse tissues studied in this study (<xref rid="f3-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). To reveal the relationship between exercise induced stress and transcriptional activity of glutathione synthesis related genes, we prepared total RNAs from skeletal muscle and blood of Thoroughbred horses and performed RT-qPCR analysis for <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> genes. As result, it was found that the expression of both of <italic>GCLM</italic> and <italic>GCLC</italic> genes was up-regulated in skeletal muscle as well as blood leukocytes.</p><p>The mRNA level of <italic>GCLC</italic> gene after exercise was about 10-fold higher than that before exercise in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="f4-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> left; p&lt;0.05), whereas the degree of increase of mRNA level in blood leukocytes is less compared to skeletal muscle (<xref rid="f4-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> right; p&lt;0.001). The level of mRNA of horse <italic>GCLM</italic> gene also increased in both skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes in response to exercise (<xref rid="f4-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In either case, it is not clear whether the increased expression of mRNA of these genes is the consequences of increased transcription efficiency or post-transcriptional modifications, i.e., increased stability, and is also not certain whether increased mRNA level will result in increased protein level, leading to augmented <italic>GCL</italic> activity. In a previous study, <italic>GCLC</italic> contents and activity tended to increase with exercise in skeletal muscle of both old and adult rats with different kinetics, indicating differential regulation of <italic>GCLC</italic> content and activity. Nonetheless, in old rats, <italic>GCLM</italic> contents seemed to increase more but not in adult rats [<xref rid="b13-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As the expression of <italic>GCLM</italic> and the association of <italic>GCLM</italic> with <italic>GCLC</italic> are responsible for the increase <italic>GCL</italic> activity [<xref rid="b15-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and ROS rapidly activates <italic>GCL</italic> activity by facilitating the holozyme formation [<xref rid="b5-ajas-30-5-728" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is reasonable to assume that <italic>GCL</italic> might be activated in skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes of Thoroughbred horses in response to exercise stress to alleviate stress induced ROS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, we observed that amino acid sequences of GCLC and GCLM are highly conserved evolutionary and, especially, functional domains of GCS and aldo-keto reductase family domain are well conserved in horse proteins, suggesting functional conservation of these proteins. It is of note that the mRNA level of <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>GCLM</italic> gene is increased in both skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes in response to exercise. These results will provide the basic foundation for the future studies to reveal the importance of GCL activity to relieve ROS stress caused by exercise in racing horse, leading better interventions to racing stresses and the development of reliable non-invasive biomarkers for ROS responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (No.PJ01104401, PJ01117301), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea, and research funds for newly appointed professors of Chonbuk National University in 2016 (K.D.
