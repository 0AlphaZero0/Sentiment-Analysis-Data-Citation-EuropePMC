As either cell proportion was decreased when AhR antagonist naphthoflavone was used to treat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that AhR activation is necessary for the differentiation of both cells, which agrees with most previous findings. Veldhoen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> have confirmed that AhR promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells. Apetoh et al<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> have also reported that AhR is in synergy with c-Maf in promoting the development of type 1 Treg cells. However, Quintana et al<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> have implied a more complex role of AhR during this differentiation process. They found that when AhR was activated by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the differentiation of functional Treg cells was promoted, whereas when activated by FICZ, Treg cell development was suppressed and Th17 cell differentiation was enhanced. As the roles of different AhR ligands were not explored here, we preliminarily concluded that AhR activation is necessary for the differentiation of Th17 cells.</p><p>Noticeably, when the gene <italic>STAT3</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was knockdown by RNA interference method in the group treated with AhR agonist FICZ, the percentage of either Th17 cells showed a sharp decrease, whereas Treg cells showed a significant increase as compared to the FICZ group, indicating that this gene is indispensable for the functioning of AhR in the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The case was similar in the naphthoflavone group. This gene has been assumed to have a role in IL-27-mediated proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Additionally, it has been reported to be activated by IL-6R/gp130 to exert a proinflammatory effect and by IL-10R to exert an anti-inflammatory effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Here, IL-6R had a significantly higher level in the shSTAT3 group and naphthoflavone group; however, no significant differences were observed in <italic>STAT3</italic> mRNA levels among different groups. Thus, the relationship between STAT3 and IL-6R is unclear.</p><p>Further western blotting showed higher phospho-STAT3 levels in the Th17 and FICZ groups compared with the control group, as well as lower phospho-STAT3 levels in the naphthoflavone group and shSTAT3 group, especially in the shSTAT3 group, confirming the importance of phospho-STAT3 in the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as there was an opposite trend in the concentration between phospho-STAT3 and phospho-STAT5 levels.</p><p>Taken together, STAT3 may cooperate with AhR to regulate the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. However, the mRNA levels of various interleukin and other factors showed no significant differences among different groups, thus it is hard to estimate their roles in this process, which should be further addressed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AhR = Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, CD = cluster of differentiation, FICZ = 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole, Foxp3 = forkhead box P3, IL-17 = interleukin-17, PBS = phosphate buffered saline, ROR&#947;t = retinoic acid receptor&#8211;related orphan nuclear receptor &#947;t, STAT3 = signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, TGF&#946; = transforming growth factor &#946;, Th = T helper, Treg = T regulatory.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>XL and HH are co-first authors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 81273908).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Constant</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Woodard</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
