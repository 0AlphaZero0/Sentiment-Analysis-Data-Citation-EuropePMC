As fungal conidia are, in most cases, etiological agents of plant diseases and fungal lung disease, their stress resistance and interaction with their hosts have drawn increasing attention. In the present study, we investigated whether environmental temperature during conidiation affects the stress tolerance of the conidia of the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. Conidia from a 25&#176;C culture showed a lower tolerance to heat (60&#176;C) and oxidative (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) stresses and a marked resistance to ultraviolet radiation exposure, compared with those produced at 37 and 45&#176;C. The accumulation of trehalose was lower in the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture. Furthermore, the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture showed darker pigmentation and increased transcripts of dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin biosynthesis-related genes (i.e., <italic>pksP</italic>, <italic>arp1</italic>, and <italic>arp2</italic>). An RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the transcription level of the trypacidin (<italic>tpc</italic>) gene cluster, which contains 13 genes, was sharply and coordinately activated in the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture. Accordingly, trypacidin was abundant in the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture, whereas there was little trypacidin in the conidia from the 37&#176;C culture. Taken together, these data show that the environmental temperature during conidiation affects conidial properties such as stress tolerance, pigmentation, and mycotoxin accumulation. To enhance our knowledge, we further explored the temperature-dependent production of DHN-melanin and trypacidin in clinical <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> isolates. Some of the isolates showed temperature-independent production of DHN-melanin and/or trypacidin, indicating that the conidia-associated secondary metabolisms differed among the isolates.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010157</institution-id><institution>Noda Institute for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1382-3914</contrib-id><name><surname>Hagiwara</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Budget for Research Project: The Project on Controlling Aspergillosis and the Related Emerging Mycoses</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamei</surname><given-names>Katsuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Cooperative Research Grant of NEKKEN</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonoi</surname><given-names>Tohru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>National Bioresource project for Pathogenic Microbes</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Agricultural chemical research foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>1-328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1382-3914</contrib-id><name><surname>Hagiwara</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16750969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1382-3914</contrib-id><name><surname>Hagiwara</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the Noda Institute for Science Research to DH.

Conidia are reproductive structures that play a crucial role in the distribution and survival of fungi [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In general, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> conidia are relatively stress-resistant cells that survive environmental stresses such as drought, high temperatures, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fungi protect themselves from such abiotic stresses by accumulating compatible solutes. Mannitol and trehalose are the most prevalent solute sugars that accumulate in conidia. While mannitol is the most abundant solute in <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> conidia, trehalose is the major compatible solute that accumulates in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> conidia [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], The absence of the compatible solutes reduces the heat resistance and/or longevity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>niger</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> conidia [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> is the causative agent of aspergillosis, which encompasses several types of infection, including life-threatening invasive aspergillosis. Conidia are the main infectious agents, and they are inhaled daily because they are ubiquitous in the environment [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The conidia of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> have dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin in their cell wall, which is thought to provide structural rigidity and protection from environmental stresses, such as UV irradiation and heat [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A genetic study highlighted the crucial role of DHN-melanin in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> virulence, because the virulence of a polyketide synthase (PKS) mutant, <italic>pksP</italic>, which fails to produce the PKS that is responsible for DHN-melanin synthesis, was attenuated in a murine infection model of disseminated aspergillosis [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, DHN-melanin protects conidia against phagocytic killing by inhibiting the acidification of phagolysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, pigment-less, white conidia of a <italic>pksP</italic> mutant were ingested more frequently compared with wild-type (WT) conidia by the soil-living amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, DHN-melanin not only plays an essential role in infections of mammalian hosts but also contributes to avoiding predation by amoeba. Different types of melanin (Asp-melanin) on the conidia of <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> also inhibit phagocytosis by <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which supports the importance of melanin for fungal conidia to survive in their environments.</p><p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> is also a major airborne allergen, and it possesses 22 known allergenic proteins. Temperature impacts the allergenicity and viability of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An increased level of the Asp f1 major allergen was found in conidia collected from cultures grown at 17&#176;C, compared with those grown at 32&#176;C. Environmental conditions during conidiation affect the physiological properties, such as morphology, germination kinetics, and pathogenicity, of spores from other fungi [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, entomopathogenic fungi have demonstrated that virulence toward insect hosts, and conidial tolerance to heat and UV radiation, are greatly influenced by environmental conditions such as the medium, water activity, light illumination, and oxygen concentration, during conidia production [<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177050.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, environmental conditions appear to be key factors that affect fungal conidial properties; however, little is known about the impacts of temperature on the properties of the conidia of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, including the medically important pathogenic fungus <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effects of temperature during conidia production on the stress resistance of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia.

We investigated how the conidia tolerated short bursts of heat stress (60&#176;C for 15 min), oxidative stress [200 mM hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 15 min], and UV stress (9.55 Wm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> of UV light for 1 min) that are encountered by fungal conidia in nature. The conidia from the 25&#176;C culture showed a significantly greater sensitivity to heat stress, compared with those from the 37 and 45&#176;C cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177050.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (as an oxidative stressor), the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture were more sensitive than those from the 37&#176;C culture, whereas the conidia from the 45&#176;C culture showed a greater stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177050.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, the conidia from the 25&#176;C culture showed a marked tolerance to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177050.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the conidial maturation levels affected the differences in phenotypes, we compared the heat-stress tolerance of the conidia harvested from the 25 and 37&#176;C cultures in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177050.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The conidia from the 25&#176;C culture were more sensitive to heat stress than those from the 37&#176;C at all of the culture ages (3d, 7d, and 14d).

The analysis of our set of clinical isolates revealed that some strains produced more densely pigmented conidia in the 25 or 37&#176;C cultures, whereas others produced highly pigmented conidia equally at both temperatures. Because DHN-melanin protects conidia from UV-irradiation stress, highly pigmented conidia appear to be preferable for conidial survival under UV- or strong sunlight-exposure conditions. The fungus might have evolved the temperature-dependent regulation of stress protection in a strain-dependent manner to adapt to its environment. For a deeper understanding of conidia stress-resistance-related physiology, heterogeneity among isolates should be taken into account, and exploring the diversity of conidial properties may enable the identification of previously unknown stress-resistance factors.</p><p>In conclusion, we presented the first evidence that conidial stress resistance and secondary metabolism are affected by temperature during conidiation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>. The findings of a low temperature-dependent overproduction of DHN-melanin and trypacidin in conidia provide new insights into the conidial physiology of filamentous fungi and pave the way for understanding the temperature-dependent regulation of secondary metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> strains Af293 was used to generate the <italic>&#916;tpcC</italic> strain.
