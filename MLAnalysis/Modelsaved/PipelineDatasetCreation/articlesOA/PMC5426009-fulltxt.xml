Due to the development of early diagnosis technology, the mortality rate of breast cancer is decreasing in some countries, but in other counties the mortality rate still is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tumor relapse is the main cause of the high mortality of various cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be the main reason for tumor relapse and metastasis, CSCs can maintain the number or generate more CSCs by self-renewal, and generate non-CSCs progeny by differentiation. For some kinds of tumors, a CSC can initiate tumorigenesis in immunodeficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the CSCs model, conventional cancer therapy only kills non-CSCs and leaves rare CSCs, but these CSCs can self-renew and differentiate to generate CSCs and non-CSCs, causing relapse, if combining antagonism CSCs drug with conventional cancer therapy methods could kill all tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) were discovered in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], several methods have been developed to study or separate BCSCs, for example, CD24<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], ALDEFLUOR assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], mammosphere formation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and side population (SP) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>HN1 is located on chromosome 17q25.2 and encodes a 16.5&#160;kDa protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been demonstrated to upregulate in many cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is also a marker of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is only expressed in high-grade gliomas, and HN1 knockdown inhibits tumor growth in vivo but not cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In prostate cancer, HN1 interacts with GSK3&#946;/&#946;-catenin destruction complex. Overexpression of HN1 promotes &#946;-catenin degradation and negatively influences the &#946;-catenin/E-cadherin interaction. Colony formation ability and migration ability are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, Zhanguo Zhang and colleagues find miR-132 can inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, migration and metastasis of breast cancer by targeting HN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but the role of HN1 in breast cancer and its regulatory mechanism have not been well documented. Here, we found HN1 to be upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and patients with high HN1 expression had poor prognosis. Overexpression of HN1 not only promoted the self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells, but also promoted migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis. Further analysis suggested HN1 expression had a positive correlation with MYC expression. Knockdown of MYC in HN1 overexpressing cells abrogated the phenotypes caused by HN1 overexpression, suggesting MYC is the downstream target of HN1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells, vector, oligonucleotides, infection, and transfection</title><p>Breast cancer cells MCF-7 and T47D were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Considering the fact of poor prognosis for patients with higher levels of HN1 expression, we were wondering if there was any relationship between HN1 and BCSCs. Mammosphere formation assay and Hoechst negative side population (SP) cells analysis were used to determine the role of HN1 in BCSCs, the results demonstrated that overexpression of HN1 was significantly closely associated with the formation of more and bigger mammosphere (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and the increased percentage of SP cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). CD24<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> is a marker for BCSCs, HN1 overexpression increased the percentage of CD24<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> population. These suggested HN1 overexpression promoted self-renewal of BCSCs.

HN1 knockdown inhibited cell migration and invasion of MCF-7 and T47D (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1C and D). The brain is one of main sites of breast cancer metastasis, and patients with brain metastasis have poor prognosis. The median survival of untreated patients is about 1&#160;month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. GSEA analysis showed HN1 expression to be positively correlated with genes overexpressed in breast cancer relapse in the brain. HN1 expression was found to be negatively correlated with genes downregulated in breast cancer relapse in brain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).</p><p>We used soft agar growth assay to investigate the effect of HN1 on tumorigenesis, and found overexpression of HN1 in indicated cells significantly promoted tumorigenesis in vitro (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). HN1 knockdown significantly inhibited tumorigenesis in vitro (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). A tumorigenesis assay in female nude mice was used to confirm whether HN1 promoted tumor growth in vivo, and results showed that HN1 overexpression promoted xenograft growth, and the tumor volume was bigger when HN1 expression was higher. HN1 knockdown inhibited xenograft growth, and the tumor volume was smaller (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). These results suggested that HN1 overexpression promoted tumorigenesis, and knockdown of HN1 inhibited tumorigenesis. We fixed xenograft tumor using formalin and embedded them in paraffin for IHC staining. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a central role in metastasis. For example, MMP9 has high levels of expression in breast cancer, especially in breast cancer with strong capacity for distant metastasis. It has been used as a predictive marker for breast cancer invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Overexpression of MMP9 in breast cancer has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. IHC analysis indicated that overexpression of HN1 enhanced MMP9 expression, knockdown of HN1 decreased MMP9 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), suggesting HN1 overexpression promoted invasion and metastasis.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>HN1 promotes tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. <bold>a</bold> Soft agar growth assay of tumorigenesis in vitro in indicated cells with HN1 overexpression or knockdown (*<italic>P</italic>&#8201;&lt;0.05). <bold>b</bold> Xenograft model in nude mice (<italic>left</italic>) and tumor volume growth curves (<italic>right</italic>). <bold>c</bold> IHC staining of MMP9 in xenograft tumors.

Quantitative protein expression profiles have been generated using RPPA, the data could be available at the TCGA database, we found HN1 expression positively correlated with MYC expression in breast cancer samples, the HN1 mRNA increased the protein level of MYC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), suggesting HN1 might be a regulator of MYC, and could activate MYC pathway. We further confirmed this hypothesis in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and T47D.

CDK4 and CCND1 were found to be transactivated by MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], p21, CAV1 and SFRP1 are suppressed by MYC. HN1 knockdown was found to inhibit CDK4 and CCND1 expression and to promote p21, CAV1 and SFRP1 expression, and vice versae (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d and e</xref>). These findings also suggested HN1 could regulate CDK4 and CCND1 to promote G1/S transition, p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, inhibition of p21 promoted cell cycle progression. CAV1 is a tumor suppresser, and inhibition of CAV1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Wnt signaling promotes breast cancer progression and the self-renewal of BCSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. SFRP1 is a Wnt antagonist that inhibits Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The promoter sequence of MYC was subcloned into pGL3vector, and cotransfected with HN1-overexpressing vector or siRNA for HN1. A luciferase activity assay showed HN1 overexpression enhanced the luciferase activity, inhibition of HN1 decreased the luciferase activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>), suggesting HN1 indeed regulated MYC expression.</p><p>MYC is a famous oncogene, its knockdown significantly inhibited mammosphere formation and breast cancer cell invasion (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a and b</xref>). We further demonstrated whether HN1 can regulate the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer and the self-renewal of BCSCs by regulating MYC expression. We used MYC small interference RNA (siMYC) and MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 to inhibit MYC expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A mammosphere formation assay suggested the number and size of the mammosphere formationby breast cancer cells with HN1 overexpression and inhibition of MYC were significantly reduced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we used the expression profiles of normal and malignant breast tissue downloaded from TCGA database to analyze HN1 expression. Results showed HN1 to be upregulated in breast cancer tissues. Patients with high levels of HN1 expression had poor outcomes. Using clinical samples, we found the results to be similar to those gleaned from analysis of the data from TCGA database, suggesting HN1 indeed was upregulated in breast cancer tissues. We further studied the role of HN1 in migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis. We found overexpression of HN1 promoted migration, invasion and tumorigenesis. GSEA analysis suggested there was a positive correlation between HN1 expression and the expression of genes which were upregulated in breast cancer relapse in brain. IHC analysis of xenograft tumor showed HN1 overexpression enhanced MMP9 expression, and knockdown of HN1 inhibited MMP9 expression. These findings suggested that HN1 promoted breast cancer invasion and metastasis. But whether HN1 promotes metastasis in vivo will be demonstrated further.</p><p>We also studied the role of HN1 in BCSCs and found overexpression of HN1 to enhance mammosphere formation and increase the relative size of the SP cell population. The xenograft tumor model suggested that when 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>3</sup> tumors cells were injected into the nude mice, only half of the mice in the control group developed xenograft tumors, but all nude mice in the stable HN1 overexpression group did, and none of the nude mice in the HN1 stable knockdown group did. This suggested that overexpression of HN1 promoted the self-renewal of BCSCs, and knockdown of HN1 inhibited it. This should be confirmed using NOD/SCID mice, although nude mice are also used for CSC research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>MYC is a famous oncogene, and overexpresses in various tumors. It plays important roles in tumor proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We found breast cancer patients with high HN1 expression had high MYC expression, suggesting HN1 might regulate MYC expression, overexpression of HN1 increased MYC-activating genes expression, and decreased MYC-suppressing genes expression and vice versa. These suggesting HN1 was the upstream of MYC. Threonine 58 and serine 62 in the N-terminus of MYC can be phosphorylated by GSK-3&#946; and ERK, respectively, phosphorylation of Serine 62 stabilizes MYC, phosphorylation of Threonine 58 destabilizes MYC and promotes proteasomal degradation of MYC, inhibition GSK-3&#946; activity increases the stability of MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. HN1 might inhibit the ability of GSK-3&#946; to increase the stability of MYC. Phosphorylation of GSK3-&#946; on the S9 residue inhibits its kinase activity, knockdown of HN1 in prostate cancer cells PC-3 and LNCaP inhibits pGSK-3&#946;<sup>(S9)</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we concluded that HN1 could increase the stability of MYC by suppressing the kinase activity of GSK-3&#946;.
