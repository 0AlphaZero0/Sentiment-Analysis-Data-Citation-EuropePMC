cell signaling and proliferation. NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a membrane-bound flavin dehydrogenase that generates O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#729;&#772;</sup>, is highly expressed in colon cancer. To investigate the role that NOX1 plays in colon cancer growth, we used shRNA to decrease NOX1 expression stably in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. The 80&#8211;90% decrease in NOX1 expression achieved by RNAi produced a significant decline in ROS production and a G<sub>1</sub>/S block that translated into a 2&#8211;3-fold increase in tumor cell doubling time without increased apoptosis. The block at the G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint was associated with a significant decrease in cyclin D<sub>1</sub> expression and profound inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Decreased steady-state MAPK phosphorylation occurred concomitant with a significant increase in protein phosphatase activity for two colon cancer cell lines in which NOX1 expression was knocked down by RNAi. Diminished NOX1 expression also contributed to decreased growth, blood vessel density, and VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) expression in HT-29 xenografts initiated from NOX1 knockdown cells. Microarray analysis, supplemented by real-time PCR and Western blotting, revealed that the expression of critical regulators of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, including c-MYC, c-MYB, and VEGF, were down-regulated in association with a decline in hypoxic HIF-1&#945; protein expression downstream of silenced NOX1 in both colon cancer cell lines and xenografts. These studies suggest a role for NOX1 in maintaining the proliferative phenotype of some colon cancers and the potential of NOX1 as a therapeutic target in this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd><kwd>cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)</kwd><kwd>NADPH oxidase</kwd><kwd>protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species (ROS)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health

A more physiological appreciation of the role of ROS has developed over the past decade; it is now clear that low levels of ROS, especially H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, play a critical role in signal transduction for most receptor tyrosine kinases and many cytokines (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In playing such a role, oxidants may provide potent trophic, rather than antiproliferative, signals required for epithelial cell, including tumor cell growth (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and angiogenesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Recent data are also consistent with the hypothesis that the proliferation of certain epithelial tumors is favored by an elevated oxidant set point, which promotes genetic instability and provides the basis for the inhibition of tumor growth by free radical scavengers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The production of ROS by tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> was demonstrated over 20 years ago; at that time, a potential role for tumor cell-related reactive oxygen formation in metastasis, invasion, and the development of tumor cell heterogeneity was postulated (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the formation of reactive oxygen in tumors remained incomplete until the discovery of a family of epithelial NADPH oxidases that are, to varying degrees, structural homologs of gp91<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic>, the major membrane-bound component of the respiratory burst oxidase of leukocytes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Six members of the NADPH oxidase family of membrane flavin dehydrogenases have been described in addition to gp91<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic> (NOX2), the catalytic subunit of the phagocyte oxidase that produces ROS during the process of cellular host defense (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The biological functions of the <italic>NOX</italic> gene family members, particularly in human cancer, remain incompletely understood (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>NOX1, originally discovered utilizing Caco2 human colon cancer cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), is expressed in both normal and malignant colonic tissue and at lower levels in vascular smooth muscle, uterus, prostate, and osteoclasts (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The NOX1 catalytic subunit contains binding sites for FAD and NADPH; the N-terminal portion of the molecule contains six hydrophobic segments that form transmembrane &#945;-helices (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). NOX1 associates with membrane-bound p22<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic> and soluble subunit analogs of both p47<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic> and p67<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic> known, respectively, as NOX1 organizer (NOXO1) and NOX1 activator (NOXA1), as well as the small GTPase Rac1, to transfer electrons from intracellular reducing equivalents across the cell membrane, producing O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#729;&#772;</sup> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Expression of NOX1, in concert with NOXO1 and NOXA1, in oxidase-deficient cells dramatically increases ROS generation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Evidence linking NOX1 to cytokine-related reactive oxygen production and inflammation provides a critical perspective from which to interpret recent studies of the role of NOX1 in colorectal malignancies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). NOX1 is expressed in relative abundance in the distal colon (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In patients with ulcerative colitis, who are at increased risk of developing colon cancer (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the expression of NOX1 is significantly enhanced in the presence of active inflammation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Furthermore, NOX1 expression in colonic adenocarcinomas is also significantly higher than in adjacent normal colonic epithelium in a substantial proportion of patients (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Current studies suggest that NOX1 plays critical roles in both intestinal host defense (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and regulation of colonic cell growth and apoptosis, including angiogenesis and malignant transformation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The presence of NOX1 in surface mucosal cells of the distal large bowel provides an appropriate physiological milieu from which to influence the killing of pathogenic bacteria and the innate immune response (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In contrast, based on the available experimental evidence, NOX1 also plays an essential role in oxidant-mediated signal transduction involving the RAS/MAPK pathway (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furthermore, activated NOX1 in colonic epithelial cells, producing ROS, could contribute to genetic instability (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, transient knockdown of NOX1 expression with siRNA was shown to produce a modest effect on cell proliferation in HT-29 cells and evidence of enhanced apoptosis in Caco2 human colon cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). To clarify the role of NOX1 in colon cancer growth further, we utilized NOX1 shRNA in HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells to evaluate the effect of stable, silenced NOX1 expression on reactive oxygen production, tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, gene expression, signal transduction, and angiogenesis in both a cell culture model and in HT-29 xenografts. Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of NOX1 expression significantly diminishes reactive oxygen metabolism and markedly decreases the proliferation of HT-29 cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Growth delay of tumor cells following knockdown of NOX1 expression appears to be due to a profound block at the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition of the cell cycle that is related to cyclin D<sub>1</sub> down-regulation, and alterations in other components of the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint that may reflect a protein phosphatase-mediated inactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Stable NOX1 knockdown is also accompanied by significant alterations in the expression of a broad portfolio of genes critical to cell proliferation and to the angiogenic process. The effect of decreased NOX1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> is demonstrable both as a significant alteration in the growth of HT-29 xenografts as well as the development of their supporting blood vessels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Down-regulation of NOX1 gene expression decreases reactive oxygen production and tumor cell growth rate in stable clones of HT-29 cells</title><p>HT-29 cells were utilized for these experiments because previous investigations had demonstrated that this cell line expressed high levels of NOX1 mRNA (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

We were stimulated to pursue these investigations by the current lack of clarity regarding the role of NOX1 in colon cancer. It has been argued that because NOX1 expression can be enhanced by differentiating agents that decrease tumor cell proliferation, the function of NOX1-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#729;&#772;</sup> production at the epithelial surface is to enhance host defense rather than mitogenesis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, recent investigations suggest that specific small molecule inhibitors of NOX1 are capable of significantly decreasing the growth of NOX1-containing murine tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that knock-out of NOX1 prevents the development of chronic colonic inflammation in a genetically engineered mouse model of the pre-malignant condition, inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, transient knockdown of NOX1 can decrease proliferation of human HT-29 colon cancer cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Finally, NOX1, NOXO1, NOXA1, and p22<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic> expression are all significantly increased in colon cancers when compared with simultaneously resected, adjacent, histologically uninvolved colonic epithelium (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These results support the study of Laurent <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) regarding the expression of NOX1 in colon cancer and extend those observations to include the overexpression in colon cancers of the accessory genes (NOXO1, NOXA1, and p22<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic>) needed for O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#729;&#772;</sup> production.</p><p>Based on the conclusion that all components of the NOX1 complex are overexpressed in human colon cancer, we focused our current studies on an examination of the role of NOX1 in colon cancer growth in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Stable NOX1 knockdown in HT-29 cells produced a significant decrease in baseline- and PMA-stimulated reactive oxygen metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). It is likely that the decrease in ROS levels was due to inhibition of NOX1 and not to an increase in antioxidant defense proteins associated with NOX1 knockdown, because catalase expression was not increased in 6A cells or xenografts compared with controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>); because the expression of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase 1, and members of the peroxiredoxin family were also unchanged; and because mRNA levels of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GSTA4) and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) were 3&#8211;4-fold lower in 6A cells <italic>versus</italic> scrambled control cells as assessed by microarray analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M116.768283/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>).</p><p>In concert with the decrease in intracellular oxidant tone that accompanied shRNA-mediated inhibition of NOX1 expression, we observed a significant decrease in HT-29 growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results are consistent with previous experiments that have demonstrated increased tumor cell proliferation following NOX1 overexpression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and those that have revealed the anti-proliferative effects of decreasing intracellular ROS levels in cell culture and human tumor xenografts with antioxidant proteins or small molecules (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Taken together with our data, these studies support the concept that in some human tumors ROS, rather than being cytotoxic, enhance tumor cell growth and proliferation.</p><p>Inhibition of NOX1 expression in HT-29 cells was associated with a marked decrease in cell cycle progression through G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Except for a modest increase in TUNEL positivity in serum-starved 6A cells at the G<sub>1</sub>/S interface, the increase in tumor cell doubling time observed following NOX1 inhibition was not accompanied by a substantive degree of apoptosis. Several investigators have suggested that the G<sub>1</sub> to S transition is a redox-sensitive event (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>); however, the precise molecular mechanisms that control the apparent redox sensitivity of the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition remain to be fully elucidated. In our current investigations, we found that the G<sub>1</sub> block exhibited by 6A cells might be explained by markedly decreased cyclin D<sub>1</sub> expression, associated with a concomitant up-regulation of members of the INK4 complex that play an inhibitory role in regulating the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, one possible explanation for the decrease in cyclin D<sub>1</sub> expression is the profound steady-state decrease in MAPK phosphorylation, from c-RAF to CREB (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), that accompanied NOX1 knockdown. CREB plays a critical role in the regulation of cyclin D<sub>1</sub> expression (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and is known to be regulated by oxidative stress (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p>Dephosphorylation of the MAPK pathway (including decreased c-RAF activation), which we suggest plays a critical role in slowing the proliferation of HT-29 cells, could be due to enhanced protein-tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) which may accompany a decrease in intracellular oxidant tone (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Specific associations between a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PP5) and c-Raf have been described previously (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), albeit not in the context of decreased oxidase gene expression. Further studies, however, will be required to define the underlying mechanism(s) of c-Raf dephosphorylation in our 6A cells.</p><p>The specificity of our observations, at least with respect to the effect of NOX1 inhibition on MAPK signaling and protein phosphatase activity, is supported by the development of additional knockdown clones using an shRNA targeting an alternative NOX1 sequence. In these clones, we confirmed that NOX1 knockdown both increased phosphatase activity and decreased MAPK phosphorylation. The lack of effect of NOX1 shRNA expression in the HCT-116 cell line, which does not contain NOX1 mRNA, and our results demonstrating increased phosphatase activity levels in Caco2 cells following transient NOX1 knockdown by siRNA also support a critical role for NOX1 in growth-dependent cell signaling. Finally, in related experiments, we have demonstrated that treatment with low concentrations of the flavin dehydrogenase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, which blocks ROS production by NOX1, significantly increased protein phosphatase activity in HT-29 cells but had no effect on the phosphatase activity of the NOX1-deficient HCT-116 line (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Transient knockdown of NOX1 expression in Caco2 cells was demonstrated by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) to decrease proliferation by enhancing tumor cell apoptosis rather than by producing a block in cell cycle progression, suggesting that the effects of NOX1 knockdown may vary among tumor cell models. Although this possibility must be acknowledged, it is also possible that the downstream phenotypic consequence of NOX1 knockdown could vary based on the relative expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic genes in human colon cancer cell lines. Caco2 cells are much more susceptible to apoptosis during routine cell culture because they express high levels of pro-apoptotic genes (<italic>BAX, P53</italic>); in contrast, HT-29 cells resist apoptosis, at least in part, because of increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes (<italic>Survivin, MDM2</italic>) (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In support of this interpretation, we reported that when NOX1 activity is decreased by exposure to diphenyleneiodonium in another NOX1-expressing human colon cancer cell line (LS-174), cell cycle blockade at the G<sub>1</sub> interface was observed in association with a significant decrease in the expression of cyclins D<sub>1</sub> and A, results that are very similar to our observations with HT-29 NOX1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).</p><p>When 6A cells were grown as xenografts in athymic mice, tumors progressed at a significantly slower rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>). Previous work has demonstrated that inhibition of NOX1 significantly interferes with &#945;2&#946;1-integrin signaling as well as the migration of colon cancer cells on collagen (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). It is thus not surprising that the microarray analyses we performed demonstrated that NOX1 knockdown in both cells and xenografts was associated with the up-regulation of members of the cystatin family of protease inhibitors (such as CST1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) that could decrease tumor cell invasiveness (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and down-regulation of the c-MYB proto-oncogene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), which under constitutive circumstances is responsible for blocking differentiation in colon cancer (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Studies have also suggested that a decrease in intracellular ROS may enhance the expression of the growth inhibitor TGF-&#946;1 (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>); we observed an increase in the expression of TGF-&#946;1 in both 6A cells and xenografts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Of particular relevance to colon cancer growth control is the finding of decreased blood vessel density in the HT-29 xenografts from NOX1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). This decrease in angiogenesis was associated with a profound reduction in the expression of a broad range of pro-angiogenic genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M116.768283/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>), including <italic>VEGF</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic>, <italic>HMOX1</italic>, and carbonic anhydrases 9 and 12 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). The down-regulation of VEGF in our NOX1 knockdown xenografts was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>C</italic>). The regulation of all of these genes is, at least in part, under the control of HIF-1&#945; (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). However, current opinion varies widely regarding the role of ROS in the control of HIF-1&#945; expression both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The undetectable level of HIF-1&#945; protein in HT-29 xenografts developed from NOX1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>C</italic>) provides support for a relationship between NOX1 levels and HIF-1&#945;-related pro-angiogenic gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It is appropriate, however, to point out limitations in our understanding of the role of NOX1 in the control of colon cancer growth. HT-29 cells in culture and in xenografts were significantly slowed as they traversed the cell cycle but were not completely blocked at any cell cycle checkpoint by NOX1 inhibition. This might be due to the residual NOX1 activity present despite RNAi; moreover, it is entirely possible that cell cycle progression despite NOX1 knockdown reflects endogenous ROS production from the mitochondrial electron transport chain or other sites that remain available to support the oxidant requirements of HT-29 cells.</p><p>In summary, as hypothesized in our working model of the role of NOX1-generated ROS in colon cancer growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>), we suggest that some human colon cancers, particularly those with high levels of NOX1 expression, require an oxidative selective pressure to maintain the level of genomic instability required for optimal proliferation, angiogenesis, and/or metastatic potential (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Interference with ROS homeostasis could, through decreased MAPK signaling, cyclin D<sub>1</sub> expression, and HIF-1&#945;- or ROS-related gene expression, diminish the growth potential of HT-29 cells. Whatever the ultimate mechanism(s) involved in maintaining a relatively high constitutive reactive oxygen set point, the possibility that some human colon cancers are oxidant-dependent provides a novel perspective from which to develop strategies against this disease, focusing on NOX1 as a therapeutic target.</p><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Model to illustrate how decreased intracellular oxidant tone that accompanies NOX1 inhibition could play a critical role in reducing tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in colon cancer cells.</bold> In this model, inhibition of NOX1 expression leads to a decrease in the level of intracellular ROS that favors enhanced protein phosphatase activity. Dephosphorylation of c-Raf by protein phosphatases could deactivate MAPK signaling leading to a cyclin D<sub>1</sub>-related block in cell cycle progression at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. Concomitantly, diminished intracellular ROS production may alter HIF-1&#945; expression and the transcription of a broad range of HIF-1&#945;-related or ROS-dependent genes critical to the initiation of angiogenesis or tumor cell proliferation. Decreased angiogenesis taken together with diminished cell cycle progression could markedly slow the growth of HT-29 colon cancers <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0211766370010"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi-mediated silencing of the NOX 1 gene</title><p>HT-29 human colon cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

The PCR amplification was performed on a 384-well plate using the default cycling conditions on an HT7900 Fast Real-time PCR System (Life Technologies, Inc./Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Calibration curves of target and housekeeping genes (<italic>18S</italic> or &#946;-actin) were created using serial dilutions of the plasmids (10<sup>7</sup> to 1 copy range) containing the gene insert. NOX1 plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. B. Banfi and K.-H. Krause (Geneva, Switzerland) and Dr. H. Kikuchi (Sendai, Japan).

A fragmented peptide sequence representing the C-terminal 341 amino acids (224&#8211;564 amino acid sequence) of predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa of the human NOX1 protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) host <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The purified protein was used as the antigen to produce a monoclonal antibody. Several approaches were used to validate this human monoclonal NOX1 antibody. These included the following: (<italic>a</italic>) transient and stable transfection of HA- or Myc- or FLAG-tagged human NOX1 cDNA into HEK293, COS-7, HT-29, and Caco-2 cells, with evaluation of NOX1 expression by Western analysis using antibodies raised against the HA, Myc, or FLAG tag, as well as the new NOX1 monoclonal antibody; (<italic>b</italic>) the use of NOX1-specific siRNA silencing experiments in cell lines that express reasonably high levels of NOX1, such as HT-29 and LS174T colon carcinoma cells (from the American Type Culture Collection). All of these experiments revealed that NOX1 protein and enzymatic activity corresponded very well with the level of NOX1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, in the course of the experiments to validate the NOX1 antibody, it became clear that the antibody did not cross-react with any other members of the NOX family of proteins (NOX2&#8211;5 and Duox1 or -2) that we previously demonstrated to be expressed in other human tumor cell lines (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Western analysis</title><p>HT-29 cell clones or parental cells were washed with 1&#215; PBS (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and harvested during logarithmic phase growth. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in 1&#215; RIPA Lysis Buffer (Millipore/Upstate Biotechnology, Temecula, CA) supplemented with 1 tablet of Complete Mini protease inhibitor and 1 tablet of PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor mix, both from Roche Applied Science. After protein quantitation using the BCA<sup>TM</sup> protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), equal amounts (10&#8211;50 &#956;g) of proteins were separated on 4&#8211;20% TRIS/glycine gels (Life Technologies, Inc./Invitrogen) and blotted onto PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot<sup>TM</sup> dry blotting system (Life Technologies, Inc./Invitrogen). Membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD; TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with a 1:500&#8211;5000 dilution of a primary antibody overnight at 4 &#176;C. Kaleidoscope Precision Plus Protein Standards (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular weight markers. For cell cycle protein analysis, the following primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies Inc., (Danvers, MA): p14/ARF (cs2407); p15 (cs4822); p18 (cs2896); p21 (cs2946); CDK4 (cs2906); CDK6 (cs3136); cyclin A (cs4656); cyclin D<sub>1</sub> (cs2926); cyclin D<sub>2</sub> (cs3741); cyclin D<sub>3</sub> (cs2936); p-cyclin E (Thr-62, cs4136); and cyclin E (cs4129). We obtained the following antibodies from other companies: p19 (catalog no. NA-47, Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA); p27 (catalog no. 610241, BD Transduction Laboratories). CREB pathway analysis was carried out using Cell Signaling antibodies as follows: p-RAC1/CDC42 (Ser-71) (cs2461); CDC42 (cs2466); p-c-RAF (Ser-338) (cs9427); c-RAF (cs9422); p-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/221) (cs9154); MEK1/2 (cs9126); p-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (cs9101); ERK1/2 (cs9102); p-P90RSK (Ser-380) (cs9335); RSK1/2/3 (cs9355); p-CREB (Ser-133) (cs9196); CREB (cs9197); and c-MYC (cs5605). For detection of the expression of Ser/Thr protein phosphatase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase families, the following primary antibodies were utilized: PP1 catalog no. 2167-1); PP2A (catalog no. 1512-1); PP2B (catalog no. 2051-1); p-PTP1B (S378) (catalog no. 216-1), p-PTP1B (S50) (catalog no. 2179-1) from Epitomics Inc.; PP2C was from Novus Biologicals (NBP1-04333); p-PTP&#945; (Y789) (cs4481) was obtained from Cell Signaling; and PP5 (BD611020), PTP1B (BD610139), PTP1C/SHP1 (BD610125), PTP1D/SHP2 (BD610621), and KAP (BD610334) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. The membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (mouse, sc-2055 or rabbit, sc-2054, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in 1:5&#8211;10,000 dilutions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Specific antibody binding was detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, UK), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In Western analyses, &#946;-actin (catalog no. A3853, Sigma) or GAPDH (Cell Signaling, catalog no. cs2118) was used as the loading control. Band intensities were analyzed using myImageAnalysis Software, version 1.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The target protein bands were normalized to &#946;-actin band intensity, and then bands from parental HT-29 cells were used as the denominator to compare with the band intensities of the NOX1 clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry and chemiluminescence</title><p>Production of reactive oxygen in colon cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry using the redox-sensitive dye CM-H<sub>2</sub>-DCF-DA as described previously (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). In brief, cells in logarithmic phase growth, usually 2 days after plating, were harvested, washed with PBS, and counted with a Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelom BioSciences, Lawrence, MA); one million cells were resuspended in 500 &#956;l of Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer containing 5 &#956;<sc>m</sc> dye (Life Technologies/Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; catalog no.

The data were analyzed with FlowJo&#174; software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). ROS production following NOX1 activation by PMA was measured using luminol chemiluminescence with a kit (CS1000, Sigma); briefly, 1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> parental HT-29, 6A, or G6 cells were washed in 1 ml of fresh medium and then resuspended in 100 &#956;l of the supplied assay buffer. Reaction components that contained the luminol solution, a chemiluminescence enhancer, and, where indicated, a final concentration of 200 n<sc>m</sc> PMA and/or a total of 400 units of superoxide dismutase were added to 96-well plates. The reactions were initiated in triplicate by adding the cell suspension. Luminescence was measured every 2 min for between 1 and 2 h at room temperature using a GloMax<sup>TM</sup> 96 microplate luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI).</p></sec><sec><title>Doubling time and cell growth assays</title><p>Cell lines were harvested and counted with a hemocytometer; 5 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in T25 flasks in duplicate.

Average doubling time was calculated for the two replicates of each cell line. The SC, G6, and 6A clones and parental HT-29 cells were also plated in logarithmic phase growth in tissue culture dishes and counted daily using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto T4, Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA). Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cycle analysis and TUNEL assay</title><p>HT-29 cells in logarithmic phase growth in T75 flasks were synchronized by thorough washing in PBS, re-plated in serum-free medium, and grown for 24 h in the absence of serum. Following 24 h of serum starvation, zero time cells were harvested with trypsin and counted. For cells to be examined at subsequent times, media were replaced by complete media with serum; tumor cells were then harvested for analysis at 24, 48, and 72 h. At each time point, harvested cells were counted, and 2&#8211;5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of complete media. Cells were added dropwise into 5 ml of ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were then pelleted, washed in cold PBS, re-pelleted, and finally resuspended in 5 ml of cold 70% ethanol and stored for 1&#8211;4 days at &#8722;20 &#176;C. Biotin-dUTP was incorporated into 3&#8242;-end strand breaks to detect apoptotic cells in a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) reaction. Cells were labeled with avidin-FITC for visualization by flow cytometry and with propidium iodide for concomitant cell cycle analysis. Flow cytometry was performed at the City of Hope Cancer Center Cytometry Core Facility on a MoFlo MLS flow cytometer. Data were acquired using dual laser excitation. Scatter signals were acquired with a HeNe laser (Melles Groit, Carlsbad, CA). All fluorescence excitation was performed at 488 nm using an Innova-90 Argon laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) at 500 milliwatts. FITC emission was measured through a 530DF30 filter. Propidium iodide incorporation was measured through a 640EFLP filter. The two fluorescent signals were separated with a 580DRLP and a 630DRLP dichroic filter. All filters were purchased from Omega Optical (Brattleboro, VT). Data were acquired and analyzed with Summit software (DAKO Cytomation).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein phosphatase assays</title><p>Examination of the effect of NOX1 knockdown on PTP levels in HT-29 cells and stable clones, as well as HCT-116 and Caco2 cells, was determined using a PTP end-point assay kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA; catalog no. 17-125). Cells were scraped in lysis buffer containing 20 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole-HCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, pH 7.0, with protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce catalog no. 78425), sonicated, and centrifuged at 2000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatant protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce catalog no. 23227); from 250 to 750 ng was used per assay well. PTP activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, in 96-well (half-volume) plates, protein and 200 &#956;<sc>m</sc> peptide (RRLIEDAEpYAARG) were added in a 25-&#956;l total volume. After incubation for 15 min, the enzyme reaction was terminated with 100 &#956;l of Malachite Green solution; a subsequent 15 min was allowed for color development, and absorbance was measured at 650 nm with a plate reader (SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Enzyme activity was calculated from the amount of released phosphate in picomoles of phosphate/min/&#956;g of protein based on a phosphate standard curve. In some experiments, PTP activity was also determined with a kinetic assay (Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA; catalog no. R-22067). The reaction was carried out in a 100-&#956;l total volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction plates contained the fluorescent substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, which has excitation/emission maxima at 358/452 nm, respectively. After determination of cell lysate protein content, from 500 to 750 ng of protein was added in a 20-&#956;l volume to the substrate, which was dissolved by adding 80 &#956;l buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, and 0.05% Tween 20) to each well; fluorescence was measured after a 20-min initial incubation, every 5 min for 1 h. Enzyme activity was calculated from the phosphate standard curve.</p><p>Measurement of serine/threonine protein phosphatase levels was also performed with a commercially available assay kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA; catalog no. 17-127). Samples were prepared in imidazole buffer; to measure phosphatase activity, 200 &#956;<sc>m</sc> peptide (KRpTIRR) was used as the substrate as outlined above. The reaction was carried out using from 250 to 750 ng of protein per well; enzyme activity was determined after 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 &#956;l of Malachite Green solution and then measured and calculated as outlined for PTPs. Specific serine/threonine phosphatase activities were determined as follows: PP-1 detection required addition of DTT and MnCl<sub>2</sub> (2 n<sc>m</sc> and 200 &#956;<sc>m</sc> concentrations, respectively). PP2A determinations required NiCl<sub>2</sub> in a 1 m<sc>m</sc> final concentration; and PP2B required 10 &#956;g/ml calmodulin in addition to NiCl<sub>2</sub> for maximum activity. PP2C detection was carried out by adding DTT, EGTA, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in final concentrations of 2, 1, and 20 m<sc>m</sc>, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>HIF-1&#945; protein expression</title><p>The expression of HIF-1&#945; in parental HT-29 cells, as well as SC and 6A cells, was evaluated under normoxic as well as hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions using an <italic>In vivo</italic><sub>2</sub> 400 hypoxic work station (Ruskinn Technologies, Cincinnati, OH). The expression of HIF-1&#945; in parental HT-29 cells, as well as in a second NOX1 knockdown clone (NOX1/32) derived from a different shRNA silencing vector, and in an HT-29 clonal line transfected with a non-targeting sequence (NC/27), was also evaluated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using a Modular Incubator Chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA). For these experiments, tumor cells in logarithmic phase growth were serum-starved for 16 h; the HT-29, SC, or 6A cells were then exposed to deferoxamine (100 &#956;<sc>m</sc>) or media alone in air or to 1% oxygen for 16 h in the hypoxic work station. The effect of deferoxamine on HIF-1&#945; expression was not studied for the NC/27 control cells or the NOX1/32 knockdown line. Whole-cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblots were analyzed for HIF-1&#945; expression (HIF-1&#945; monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences) as described previously with &#946;-actin as the loading control (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

Ten days after implantation, as soon as tumors were palpable, bi-dimensional measurements were recorded for 14&#8211;17 days, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula 0.5 &#215; length &#215; width<sup>2</sup>. Tumor measurements were performed for 14&#8211;17 days in these experiments because animals carrying tumors from either parental HT-29 cells or cells stably transfected with the scrambled NOX1 shRNA routinely developed early signs of skin ulceration over their xenografts at this time. Thus, at the end of the 14&#8211;17-day test period (24&#8211;27 days following the injection of tumor cells), mice were euthanized, and tumors were harvested. A portion of each tumor was fixed (see below) and embedded in paraffin.

The Bioconductor package &#8220;limma&#8221; was used to identify the genes differentially expressed between the 6A and SC samples. The R-contributed libraries limma provided the necessary routines for fitting linear models to microarray data that incorporate appropriate empirical Bayes smoothing of variances and for making multiple testing adjustments using the false discovery rate (FDR). We used a FDR of &lt;0.05 and a fold change of &gt;1.5 to identify differential expression. Genes exceeding these criteria between SC <italic>versus</italic> HT-29 samples were excluded due to possible transfection effects. Hierarchical clustering using average linkage with the Pearson correlation was applied to differentially expressed gene expression data using the clustering features in GeneSpring version 7.2 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The genes showing altered expression were then categorized on the basis of their cellular components, biological processes, molecular functions, and signaling pathways using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery 2.0 (DAVID 2.0, 17), GeneSpring, and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity, Mountain View, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> tests were performed; values of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant; <italic>NS</italic> designates values that were not significant. Xenograft data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. All values presented are the mean &#177; S.E. or S.D. of at least three experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>J.
