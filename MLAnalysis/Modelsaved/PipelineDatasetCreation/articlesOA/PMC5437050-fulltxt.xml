Following stable expression of this mEGFP-tagged receptor, Spatial Intensity Distribution Analysis indicated that a substantial proportion of the receptor was present within dimeric/oligomeric complexes and that increased expression levels of the receptor favored a greater dimer to monomer ratio. Addition of the antipsychotics, spiperone or haloperidol, resulted in re-organization of D<sub>3</sub>R quaternary structure to promote monomerization. This action was dependent on ligand concentration and reversed upon drug washout. By contrast, a number of other antagonists with high affinity at the D<sub>3</sub>R, did not alter the dimer/monomer ratio. Molecular dynamics simulations following docking of each of the ligands into a model of the D<sub>3</sub>R derived from the available atomic level structure, and comparisons to the receptor in the absence of ligand, were undertaken. They showed that, in contrast to the other antagonists, spiperone and haloperidol respectively increased the atomic distance between reference &#945; carbon atoms of transmembrane domains IV and V and I and II, both of which provide key interfaces for D<sub>3</sub>R dimerization. These results offer a molecular explanation for the distinctive ability of spiperone and haloperidol to disrupt D<sub>3</sub>R dimerization.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that belong to the class A sub-family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. They co-ordinate many functions, including motor control, emotional responsiveness and memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, dysregulation of dopaminergic neuro-transmission is implicated in multiple disorders including Parkinson&#8217;s disease and a broad suite of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Although class A GPCRs are encoded by single polypeptides that span the plasma membrane seven times and can certainly function as monomeric species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, many of these, including the dopamine receptor subtypes, have been shown to form both homo-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and hetero-dimers/oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and this may have functional and clinical significance. Rather less work in this context has focused on the dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor (D<sub>3</sub>R) subtype, which is enriched in limbic areas of the brain and a target for the treatment of, for example, drug addiction and the cognitive and social deficits of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Even in early studies the potential for dimeric/oligomeric arrangement of this receptor in rodent brain tissue was highlighted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, as well as in more recent studies in transfected cell lines that have focused on the extent and basis of such interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. By combining molecular modelling, site direct-mutagenesis and homogenous time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (htr-FRET) techniques, interfaces that allow such interactions have been defined, resulting in description of homomeric quaternary structures of this receptor that involve two distinct dimeric species, as well as a rhombus-shaped tetramer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Unlike members of the class C GPCR sub-family that function as obligate dimers/oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, quaternary complexes of the D<sub>3</sub>R are not generated and maintained by covalent interactions between receptor monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, indicating that the extent of D<sub>3</sub>R dimerization and/or oligomerization will likely be governed by both receptor expression level, ligand availability, and the intrinsic avidity of these protein-protein interactions. This implies that the observed proportions of receptor monomers, dimers and oligomers may well vary between individual cells and tissues and, furthermore, the binding of distinct ligand chemotypes may selectively alter this if they either differentially regulate receptor expression levels or stabilize distinct states of the receptor. Given roles of segments of the seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) of GPCRs that are located close to the extracellular face in controlling class A receptor dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> it is clearly possible that different antagonist/inverse agonist-bound structures of the same GPCR may alter the dimerization potential or propensity of the receptor and, therefore, the steady-state distribution of monomers, dimers and oligomers.</p><p>Herein we test this hypothesis using the D<sub>3</sub>R for which high affinity blockers from distinct chemotypes are available. Moreover, as an atomic level structure of the D<sub>3</sub>R bound to the ligand eticlopride is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and substantial efforts have been made to predict modes of binding of other antagonist ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, this provided a framework with which to assess the outcomes. To answer such questions, we have employed Spatial Intensity Distribution Analysis (SpIDA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> as this technique can be used to assess the steady-state proportion of monomers, dimers/oligomers of a cell surface receptor tagged with an appropriate fluorophore, by interrogation and statistical analysis of Regions of Interest (RoI) within confocal images of cells expressing such a receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We report three key set of outcomes. Firstly, the proportion of the D<sub>3</sub>R present within dimers/oligomers is increased by enhancing levels of receptor expression by treatment of cells expressing the D<sub>3</sub>R with sodium butyrate. Secondly, exposure to some, but not all, chemotypes of ligand with D<sub>3</sub>R antagonist properties markedly reduces the steady-state proportion of D<sub>3</sub>R within dimeric/oligomeric complexes, and thirdly, application of molecular dynamics simulations indicates selective alterations in the tertiary structure of D<sub>3</sub>R caused by ligands that reduce D<sub>3</sub>R quaternary structure complexity and that these are consistent with previously defined key dimer and tetramer-forming interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SpIDA can distinguish between monomer and dimer forms of hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP</title><p>In preparation for studies to assess the steady-state distribution between monomeric and dimeric/oligomeric states of the human (h)D<sub>3</sub>R we expressed constitutively in Flp-In T-REx 293 cells a form of this GPCR tagged at the C-terminus with monomeric, Ala<sup>206</sup>Lys, enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A number of distinct clones expressing this construct were then isolated. Resolution by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates from three clones, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antiserum, showed a similar pattern in which the predominant form was a polypeptide of some 60&#8201;kDa (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Parallel ligand binding studies using the dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone provided quantitative validation in that the level of the hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP construct was highest in clone 2 and that there was a trend towards higher levels of the receptor in clone 8 compared to clone 6 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This profile was confirmed in the plasma membrane of these cells by observing confocal images (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Fluorescence intensity analysis of images of the basolateral surface of these clones allowed estimation of expression levels as receptors per &#956;m<sup>2</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) that was qualitatively similar to those generated from the specific [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone binding studies.

</p><p>To be able to define the quaternary structure of hD<sub>3</sub>R within these clones we initially employed control SpIDA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> studies on Flp-In T-REx 293 cells induced to express differing levels of a single molecule of mEGFP that was targeted to the plasma membrane by N-terminal addition of a palmitoylation&#8201;+&#8201;myristoylation (P&#8201;+&#8201;M) sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Levels of P&#8201;+&#8201;M-mEGFP could be varied by addition of different concentrations of doxycycline because the fluorescent protein construct is inserted into a genomic locus from which expression is controlled by this antibiotic in a regulated manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Using two concentrations of doxycycline that resulted in different levels of P&#8201;+&#8201;M-mEGFP expression, SpIDA could be applied effectively on confocal images obtained at 2% laser power only at the higher level of expression. However, at the lower expression level this could also be achieved successfully by increasing laser power to 6% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Following treatment with 2 ng.ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup> doxycycline and with laser power set at 2%, analysis of a large number of RoI produced quantal brightness (QB) values for the mEGFP construct of 11.01&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.21 units (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44, different biological experiments &#215; RoI examined in each experiment) with mean expression level 130&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.5 molecules per &#956;m<sup>2</sup>. As mEGFP is intrinsically monomeric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, then in subsequent studies performed at 2% laser power a measured QB for receptor proteins tagged with mEGFP of 11.01 units was defined to represent 1.00 Monomeric Equivalent Units (MEU). Using a similar approach following induction of the cells with 0.75 ng.ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup> doxycycline, and now using 6% laser power, QB of this construct was 24.31&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.31 units (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44) and when using 6% laser power in subsequent experiments QB&#8201;=&#8201;24.31 was also defined as being equivalent to 1.00 MEU. Here expression levels, 68&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.3 molecules per &#956;m<sup>2</sup> (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44), were approximately half of those obtained following induction with the higher concentration of doxycycline (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Analysis of the full data set showed these to be distributed in Gaussian fashion with MEU of 0.994&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.206 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.D., n&#8201;=&#8201;352) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This indicates that across the range of expression levels achieved P&#8201;+&#8201;M-mEGFP was routinely observed as being monomeric and even at higher levels of expression molecular proximity did not produce artefacts that resulted in this construct being identified incorrectly as being dimeric. The mean&#8201;+&#8201;2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;S.D. corresponded to 1.406 MEU (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and represents 95.44% of the dataset. In subsequent studies on hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP QB values above 1.406 MEU were thus taken to represent RoI in which dimeric/oligomeric forms were predominant whilst MEU values less than or equal to 1.406 MEU were considered to represent regions in which monomers were the dominant species (see &#8216;Experimental&#8217; for further details).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Determination of monomeric QB.

</p><p>Confocal images from the basolateral membrane of cells of clones 2, 6 and 8 were now analysed at 6% laser power. RoIs from each provided fluorescence intensity data on the oligomeric state of hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP. For this specific data set, in clone 2 QB MEU was 1.75&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.09 (mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44) and this was statistically greater than in either clone 6 (1.45&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.05, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44) or in clone 8 (1.41&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.03, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;S.E.M., n&#8201;=&#8201;3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;44) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In each clone a substantial number of the individual QB values were&#8201;&gt;&#8201;1.406 MEU, indicating that, at steady-state, in each clone a significant proportion of hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP was identified as being dimeric/oligomeric. Analysis of QB values for each individual RoI indicated that the proportion in which hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP was predominantly within dimeric/oligomeric complexes ranged from 75.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.3% (clone 2), to 47.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.0% (clone 6) to 40.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.5% (clone 8) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulations provide a basis for selectivity of ligand effects</title><p>To provide potential insight into the molecular basis for the distinct effects of spiperone and haloperidol versus eticlopride, nemonapride and clozapine on hD<sub>3</sub>R quaternary organization we turned to the use of molecular dynamics simulations. Eticlopride was of particular interest because an atomic level structure of this ligand bound to the D<sub>3</sub>R is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We thus compared molecular dynamics simulations of the minimal energy state of hD<sub>3</sub>R bound by each of these ligands (see &#8216;Experimental&#8217; for further details), alongside the apo-protein, and how their binding might affect the organization of the extracellular side of the TMD helices (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and Supplemental Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These showed distinct differences in the orientation of the extracellular face of hD<sub>3</sub>R when associated with spiperone and haloperidol compared to when bound by eticlopride, nemonapride or clozapine and also compared to the apo-protein. Analysis of the distances between helices (as measured between defined pairs of amino acid &#945; carbon atoms), indicated that whilst both spiperone and haloperidol produced marked changes, each ligand stabilized a different inactive conformation of the hD<sub>3</sub>R. Spiperone-bound hD<sub>3</sub>R induced a significantly increased distance, by 2.3&#8201;&#197; on average, between TMD IV (residue 4.50) and TMD V (residue 5.50) (residue numbers reflect the positional reference numbering system introduced by Ballesteros and Weinstein)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> compared to the apo-protein (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), whereas none of the other ligands induced such a change (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and Supplementary Figures&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Although not achieving statistical significance, there was also a trend for spiperone to induce an increase in the distance between TMD I (residue 1.35) and TMD II (residue 2.65) and between TMD III (residue 3.40) and TMD VI (residue 6.44). This is interesting since binding of haloperidol induced a statistically significant increase of 1.7&#8201;&#197; (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) in distance between TMD I (residue 1.35) and TMDII (residue 2.65). However, haloperidol did not alter the mean distance between residues 4.50 and 5.50. Importantly, binding of eticlopride, nemonapride and clozapine was without effect on distances between these specific residue pairs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> and Supplemental Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that binding of spiperone and haloperidol induces distinct conformational changes in the tertiary structure of hD<sub>3</sub>R.

</p><p>Interestingly, based on mutagenesis studies, we have previously proposed residues from each of TMD IV-TMD V and TMD I-TMD II helices as generating active interfaces in hD<sub>3</sub>R dimers and tetramers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> based on the available eticlopride-bound hD<sub>3</sub>R atomic level structure. The spiperone-induced alteration in the distance between residues of TMD IV and TMD V and haloperidol-induced alteration in the distance between TMD I and TMD II residues, may be integral to why spiperone and haloperidol but not the other ligands produced reduced levels of hD<sub>3</sub>R dimers/oligomers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The idea that members of the class A sub-family of GPCRs can form dimers and/or oligomers has been hypothesized and tested for a considerable period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Key questions that remain uncertain or unanswered include whether such complexes are stable or transient, if the extent of oligomerization is determined, at least in part, by receptor expression levels, and to what extent the steady-state level of such quaternary organization can by altered by the binding of receptor ligands. Recently, the first two of these issues have begun to be addressed. Using single molecule tracking studies clear evidence has now been provided that interactions between individual monomers, of at least muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and the N-formyl peptide receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, are transient. Moreover, consistent with Mass-Action, for both the &#946;<sub>1</sub>- and &#946;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and the opsin receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> quaternary complexity has been reported to increase with higher levels of expression of the receptor. Although this is in contrast to earlier conclusions for both the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> where the reported extent of dimerization remained constant across expression ranges of at least 10 fold, herein we provide further support of the importance of Mass-Action in this process by showing that quaternary complexity of the D<sub>3</sub>R also increases with receptor expression level. To explore this, we took advantage that a number of previous studies had indicated that treatment of cells expressing a GPCR of interest with sodium butyrate can result in up-regulation of receptor levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Overnight treatment of cells stably expressing D<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP with sodium butyrate, that resulted in less than a doubling of receptor number, was associated with a marked increase in the proportion of RoIs examined in which dimeric/oligomeric organization of the receptor was dominant. This approach eliminated potential caveats of effects of clonal variability in determining the extent of receptor structural complexity.</p><p>In the current experiments hD<sub>3</sub>R was expressed in the HEK293-based cells at levels, based on the specific binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone, between 500&#8211;1500 fmol per mg membrane protein in the three individual clones used. Clone 2 expressed the receptor to the highest levels. Based on surface area of these cells, determined to be 5235&#8201;&#181;m<sup>2</sup> (see &#8216;Experimental&#8217; for calculation of this value), the amount of membrane protein generated per 10<sup>6</sup> cells, and the apparently uniform distribution of the receptor within the plasma membrane as seen in cross-sectional confocal images, this yielded a predicted average receptor density as some 81 receptors per &#181;m<sup>2</sup>. This value was both similar to estimates provided within the SpIDA software and, importantly, was centrally located within the range of molecules per &#956;m<sup>2</sup> of P&#8201;+&#8201;M mEGFP used for the calibration studies, in which no appearance of apparent dimers of P&#8201;+&#8201;M mEGFP was observed that could have reflected simple molecular proximity due to high levels of protein expression.</p><p>One of the major outstanding issues in considering class A GPCR quaternary structure and its implications is the effect, if any, of ligands on receptor organizational structure. This has been a much discussed and debated topic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> with at least as many reports indicating that ligands have little or no effect than those which argue differently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In the current studies, we add to and extend this topic greatly. Firstly, we show that certain antagonists with high affinity for the D<sub>3</sub>R strongly favor reduction in quaternary complexity of this receptor and promote its monomerization. Such an effect may provide a rational for why Tabor <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, reported very modest levels of D<sub>3</sub>R dimerization as the analysis was based on the binding of a fluorescent antagonist to the receptor. Ligands that promoted monomerization of the D<sub>3</sub>R comprised the chemically-related butyrophenones, spiperone and haloperidol. However, this was not a universal effect produced by binding of any antagonist with high affinity for the D<sub>3</sub>R. Interestingly, among ligands lacking this effect was the benzamide eticlopride, the ligand used to enhance stabilization and crystallization of the D<sub>3</sub>R in the studies of Chien <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Perhaps not surprisingly in this regard given its chemical relatedness to eticlopride, nemonapride also failed to alter the balance between D<sub>3</sub>R monomers and dimers/oligomers, and this was also the case for the tricyclic dibenzodiazepine and atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine.</p><p>We have previously noted that certain antagonists of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor also favor monomerization of that receptor, but in those studies we did not identify antagonist ligands that did not have such an effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. By contrast, in studies on the muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> receptor we showed that M<sub>1</sub>-subtype selective antagonists, including pirenzepine and the closely related ligand telezepine, but not subtype non-selective antagonists, including the prototypic anti-muscarinic drug atropine, also altered receptor quaternary structure at steady-state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in this case pirenzepine increased the proportion of receptor dimer/oligomers. To provide a potential molecular explanation of the selective effects of spiperone and haloperidol compared to eticlopride, nemonapride and clozapine, we exploited a combination of ligand docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations. Based on a study of long time-scale simulation of haloperidol and clozapine in complex with hD<sub>2</sub>R and hD<sub>3</sub>R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we reproduced such dockings, inferred the docking of spiperone and nemonapride and ran 500&#8201;ns molecular dynamic simulations. Spiperone and haloperidol share a fluoro-butyrophenone moiety, which is positioned deeply in the TMD bundle and located close to TMD V. Our dynamics simulation with spiperone observed this moiety to reach slightly more deeply into the bottom of the binding site than haloperidol, in proximity to residues Pro5.50, Ile3.40 and Phe6.44. This group of residues are part of the &#8220;transmission switch&#8221; that provides early stage activation of GPCRs. Unlike spiperone, haloperidol has a chloro-phenyl moiety which protrudes between the external side of TMD II and TMD III, altering the relative distance between these helices. Thomas <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, also considered the mode of binding of clozapine to D<sub>3</sub>R, which unlike haloperidol and spiperone did not promote monomerization of the D<sub>3</sub>R. Here, the mode of binding was very different from that observed for haloperidol as clozapine has a compact chemical scaffold, more akin to the D<sub>3</sub>R-co-crystallized ligand eticlopride. Like clozapine, nemonapride has a more compact scaffold as compared to spiperone or haloperidol. Docking showed it to bind in a more superficial way than the other ligands and we did not observe any significant changes in distances between TMDs. Recently a mutagenesis analysis of TMDs in D<sub>3</sub>R dimers concluded that residues from within TMD IV and TMD V provide a key interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As the predominant binding pose of spiperone in the receptor results in alterations in this region it may provide a molecular explanation for both destabilization of D<sub>3</sub>R dimers and for the selectivity of this ligand in exerting this action. Interestingly, while our molecular dynamics simulations indicate that binding of spiperone significantly increases the distance between TMD IV and TMD V at the extracellular face of the D<sub>3</sub>R compared to the apo-protein in the absence of a ligand, such an effect was not produced by binding of any other ligand considered in this study. Nontheless, previous mutagenesis studies also highlighted a potential key role for residues near the extracellular face of TMD I and TMD II in the stabilization of the second D<sub>3</sub>R dimeric configuration. Thus it is of importance that our dynamics simulations indicated that binding of spiperone-related haloperidol significantly increases the distance between TMD I and TMD II at the extracellular face of the D<sub>3</sub>R compared to the apo-protein. Although these are inherently predictions, further application of this combination of approaches, linked to both further mutagenesis studies and, indeed, medicinal chemistry, are likely to help validate or repudiate this putative basis of selective ligand regulation of D<sub>3</sub>R quaternary organization. These studies emphasize that chemically different &#8216;antagonist&#8217; ligands can potentially stabilize distinct, inactive states of a GPCR. Given that it is now widely accepted that different &#8216;agonist&#8217; ligands can stabilize detectably different states of a GPCR, such outcomes should not be considered surprising and further illustrate that the binding of different ligands to their receptor targets must be considered as producing individual and unique complexes that may alter functional outcomes and the effectiveness of different drugs in a clinical context.</p><p>Although studies are limited to approaches like the detection of SDS-resistant &#8216;dimers&#8217; in immunoblotting studies, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, have reported increases in the proportion of D<sub>2</sub>-receptor dimers in striatal tissue both in schizophrenia patients and also in an amphetamine-induced sensitized state in a rodent model. There are also reported effects on levels of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor &#8216;high agonist affinity&#8217; state in similar situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Although requiring a great deal of further analysis it is of interest, therefore, that treatment with haloperidol reverses the chronic amphetamine-induced development of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor &#8216;high agonist affinity&#8217; state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This supports the clinical relevance of D<sub>2</sub> receptor oligomerization. Although focus in the above noted studies was on the D<sub>2</sub>-receptor, anti-psychotic agents generally also interact effectively with D<sub>3</sub>R. It would be of interest, therefore, to know if drugs such as eticlopride and clozapine mimic or not the effects of haloperidol in such models.</p><p>With increasing attention being paid to differences in the clinical effectiveness of drugs that nontheless interact with the same receptor or suite of molecular targets, it will now be important to examine more closely whether variation in the capacity to alter the quaternary organization of such drug receptors might help to differentiate and classify ligands as regards their functional and therapeutic profiles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental Proceedures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Materials</title><p>General laboratory chemicals, as well as poly- <italic>D</italic>-lysine, dopamine, haloperidol, spiperone, (+)-butaclamol, clozapine, sodium butyrate and both anti-tubulin and secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK) or Fisher Scientific (Leicester, UK).

All RoI measurements were selected from the basolateral membrane surface. Unbiased RoI selection was evaluated for each experimental group by normalizing the quantified mean fluorescence intensity of the whole background corrected image to the mean fluorescence intensity measured from each RoI analysed within that image. The fraction range varied from 0.93&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02 (spiperone treated sample) to 0.80&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.06 (nemonapride treated sample) and in no case was the fraction values significantly different when compared with those obtain for the untreated sample indicating that the total receptor population had been analyzed competently and no unbiased selection had occurred. MEU values for hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP were measured by normalizing their quantified QB values to average QB values measured from the P-M-mEGFP construct using exactly the same laser power as used to excite the hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP construct. To distinguish between monomeric and dimeric/oligomeric hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP species, P-M-mEGFP MEU occurrence/frequency x-y graphs (MEU bin size&#8201;=&#8201;0.1) were plotted for each MEU value measured during excitation with laser power set to 2 or 6%. Such plots revealed a symmetrical distribution of the values and Graphpad Prism normality tests indicated the distributions were Gaussian (see Results and Statistical analyses). The data from each frequency x-y plot measured using 2 or 6% laser power were combined as this range of excitation settings was required to illuminate the hD<sub>3</sub>R-mEGFP optimally at differing expression levels without erroneous detector pixel saturation occurring. From this combined plot, an MEU value of 1.406, (which represented 95.44% of the data set, falling within the mean&#8201;+&#8201;2 standard deviations), was set as a threshold to distinguish between monomeric and larger complexes in studies where individual MEU values exceeded 1.406.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Calculation of receptor density at the cell surface by SpIDA</title><p>SpIDA software also reports the mean fluorescent intensity for each RoI analyzed.

The 3D stacks were loaded into the software program Autodeblur/Autovisualise, (version 9.3.6, Autoquant Imaging, Watervliet, NY), and receptor fluorescence within the 3D stack for each individual image was segmented using the adaptive thresholding tool to resolve mEGFP-tagged receptor fluorescence from background autofluorescence. The total surface area was then subsequently quantified using the surface area volume tool.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>Image Acquisition: Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed using a Zeiss 510 Exciter laser scanning confocal equipped with a 63x/1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil-immersion objective. The 488&#8201;nm argon laser line was used to sequentially excite mEGFP and the image format size was set to 256&#8201;&#215;&#8201;256 to speed up sequential 2.5&#8201;s time lapse image collection. To minimise mEGFP fluorescence photobleaching the 488&#8201;nm laser line was set to 4% for acquisition of the pre-bleach and post-bleach recovery images. Bleaching was performed on the basolateral membrane of cells by setting the laser power to 100% and the RoI bleached spot size was set to 3&#8201;&#181;m in diameter. 5 pre-bleach images and 44 recovery images were acquired to quantify the degree of fluorescence recovery after the laser RoI photobleaching event. FRAP analysis: Time lapse stack images generated from each experimental group were imported into Metamorph software, (version 7.8), and auto-aligned to correct for x-y drift. For each experimental image stack set, a circular RoI was drawn within the observed bleached area, (RoI Fs), and the average fluorescence intensity within the RoI Fs was quantified for each individual image within the stack to quantify the average level of fluorescence before and after photobleaching. The degree of background autofluorescence was quantified similarly by drawing an RoI in an area where no cell fluorescence was expressed, (RoI Fb). To monitor the native photobleaching rate (r), for each FRAP experiment, a control RoI was drawn on a non-bleached cell within the time lapse image series. The photobleaching rate (r) was then quantified by comparing the average fluorescence intensity of the control RoI at time zero, (Fc0), with the corresponding measured average fluorescence intensity at the end of the experiment, (Fc), e.g. r&#8201;=&#8201;Fc/Fc0. The average fluorescence intensity of the Fs RoI for each stack image was corrected for the degree of native photobleaching and background autofluorescence for each FRAP experiment as follows: F&#8201;=&#8201;(RoI Fs&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;RoI Fb)/r. The F data was the normalized, (0&#8211;100%), and the recovery half-life and mobile fraction were quantified using the Graphpad Prism software one-phase exponential equation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Computational methods</title><p>A modification of the crystal structure of hD<sub>3</sub>R, in complex with eticlopride, (PDB code: 3PBL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> was used to build all the D<sub>3</sub>R&#8211;ligand complexes or the apo-protein models.

All docking poses were visually inspected and two more frequent docking possibilities were observed. In the case of nemonapride they were similar and two dynamics simulation converged on the first poses, while in the case of spiperone in the first pose the fluoro-butyrophenone moiety of spiperone was deeply buried in the binding pocket, in a similar conformation to the one described by Thomas <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> for the hD<sub>3</sub>R-haloperidol complex (which shares this chemical feature with spiperone) whilst in the second the fluoro-butyrophenone moiety of spiperone faces the extracellular side of TMD 1. As both these conformations have been reported in the literature we employed molecular dynamics simulations to assess which was more stable.
