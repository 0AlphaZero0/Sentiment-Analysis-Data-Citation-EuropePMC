Intensification of current chemotherapy regimens to improve the outcome in these children is often limited by the effects of drug resistance and cumulative toxicity. Hence, the search for newer agents and novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to formulate the next-generation early-phase clinical trials for these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A comprehensive library of antimicrobials, including eight HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir [NFV], saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, and darunavir), was tested against a panel of pediatric leukemia cells by in vitro growth inhibition studies. Detailed target modulation studies were carried out by Western blot analyses. In addition, drug synergy experiments with conventional and novel antitumor agents were completed to identify effective treatment regimens for future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Several of the HIV protease inhibitors showed cytotoxicity at physiologically relevant concentrations (half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 1&#8211;24 &#181;M). In particular, NFV was found to exhibit the most potent antileukemic properties across all cell lines tested. Mechanistic studies show that NFV leads to the induction of autophagy and apoptosis possibly through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, interference with cell signaling pathways, including Akt and mTOR, was also noted. Finally, drug combination studies have identified agents with potential for synergy with NFV in its antileukemic activity. These include JQ1 (BET inhibitor), AT101 (Bcl-2 family inhibitor), and sunitinib (TK inhibitor).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we show data demonstrating the potential of a previously unexplored group of drugs to address an unmet therapeutic need in pediatric oncology. The data presented provide preclinical supportive evidence and rationale for future studies of these agents for refractory leukemia in children.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nelfinavir</kwd><kwd>HIV protease inhibitors</kwd><kwd>pediatric leukemia</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum stress</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the recent advances achieved in the treatment of leukemia in children, the prognosis of relapsed and refractory disease remains dismal with more than 50% mortality rate.<xref rid="b1-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b3-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Acute and long-term toxicities of current chemotherapy agents often limit their further intensification, thus highlighting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to develop newer, safer treatment protocols.

Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM media (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 &#181;g/mL of streptomycin (Gibco) and incubated in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Cells were passaged approximately every 3&#8211;5 days, by centrifuging the suspension and resuspending the pellet in fresh media. Primary leukemic cells were obtained after ethics board approval (CHREB number: HREBA.CC-16-0286) and written informed consent from the parent or guardian. Normal lymphocytes were obtained from healthy volunteers after receipt of their verbal consent. Lymphocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>The antimicrobial library, consisting of 112 compounds (68 antibacterials; 39 antivirals; and five other) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Burlington, ON, Canada) and contained the PIs, NFV, indinavir, amprenavir, and atazanavir. Additional PIs &#8211; lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir (DRV), and saquinavir were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 10 mM. Subsequent dilutions were made using cell culture media, as needed, to gain concentrations of 40 to 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> &#181;M.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro cytotoxicity assays</title><p>For the antimicrobial library screening, three cell lines were used in the testing, C1, Molt3, and Poetic2.2. Cells were passaged during exponential growth and seeded in 96-well plates (Grenier BioOne, Monroe, NC, USA) at 5&#215;10<sup>3</sup> cells per well. Using four antimicrobial drug dilutions (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 &#181;M) and the corresponding DMSO vehicle control, the drugs were added to the plates and incubated. After 4 days, cell viability was quantified using Alamar blue assay (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) and cytotoxicity curves created. For the more detailed cytotoxicity curves, a larger dilution series was employed, and calculation of the half- and quarter-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>25</sub>, respectively) were determined for each drug based on independent cytotoxicity plots.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug combination studies</title><p>Pediatric leukemia cells were cultured as described above. SEM and Molm13 cell lines were selected as representative cell lines for the set and underwent the initial synergism screen against 35 chemotherapeutic agents, both conventional and novel. For the drug combination studies, the chemotherapy agents were first plated at 1 and 0.1 &#181;M concentrations in triplicate wells of 96-well plates. NFV was added to each according to predetermined IC<sub>25</sub> values. Cells were then plated at 5&#215;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well. After 4 days of incubation, cell survival was quantified as above. Agents with the highest activity (ie, lowest IC<sub>50</sub>) in combination with NFV were selected for more detailed analyses against all seven cell lines to confirm the consistency of the findings across the broader panel. Various concentrations, ranging from 10 to 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> &#181;M, were added to the wells alone or in combination with the corresponding IC<sub>25</sub> of NFV for that cell line. Cell numbers and viability were determined after 4 days. The combination indices (CIs) were determined as previously described,<xref rid="b24-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> where a CI &lt;1 indicates synergy between the agents, CI =1 indicates that the agents are working additively, and CI &gt;1 indicates that the agents are antagonistic.</p></sec><sec><title>Target modulation analyses</title><p>Target modulation by PIs was determined by Western blot analyses.

This provided the initial suggestion to further investigate this class of agents.</p></sec><sec><title>PIs as a class are cytotoxic to leukemia</title><p>Extending the findings from the initial screen, eight different US Food and Drug Administration-approved PIs were tested for cytotoxicity against the seven pediatric leukemia cell lines.

Assessment of activity against seven cell lines gave IC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 1 to 24 &#181;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-10-2581">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the degree of selectivity of NFV toward leukemia cells, two populations of normal lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were also screened and showed minimal cytotoxicity at the upper concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-10-2581">Figure 1A</xref>).

Here, we show that treatment of these cells with NFV induces ER stress in the cell, as shown by elevated levels of the phosphorylated ER stress marker, eIF2&#945; &#8211; a protein subunit that controls the initiation of mRNA translation. In its phosphorylated form, P-eIF2&#945; prevents the further translation of proteins, reducing the ER workload in an attempt to allow the cell to recover.<xref rid="b27-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> When cells are treated with NFV, a concentration- and time-dependent increase in this marker was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-10-2581">Figure 2</xref>). Also, there is simultaneous elevation of a downstream marker, CHOP, and an additional stress signaling marker, ATF3. This added cellular stress may subsequently induce the processes of autophagy and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-10-2581">Figure 3</xref>). Immunoblots of autophagy markers show relatively stable levels of Beclin-1 and LC3B), in the treated and untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-10-2581">Figure 3C and F</xref>), consistent with the complexity and specificity of measuring autophagy in such systems.<xref rid="b28-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We thus show additional support of the cells&#8217; reliance on this pathway through the use of autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and thapsigargin, which result in significant increase in cell death when the cell cannot rely on this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-10-2581">Figure 3D, E, G, and H</xref>). Analysis of apoptosis markers shows increasing cleavage of both PARP and caspase-9 (via loss of the whole caspase-9) in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner, supporting cytotoxicity through apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-10-2581">Figure 3A and B</xref>). As a negative control, we included darunavir &#8211; a PI with no cytotoxic effects at the doses tested, and it is noted that DRV does not induce elevation of any of the stress or apoptosis markers.</p></sec><sec><title>NFV inhibits Akt and mTOR signaling</title><p>Akt and mTOR signaling pathways are central to cellular proliferation and regulation of apoptosis in cells and are often upregulated in many types of cancers.<xref rid="b29-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> To determine the effects of NFV on these pathways, immunoblots were performed and show decreased phosphorylation of both Akt and mTOR with increasing concentrations of NFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-10-2581">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NFV activity shows synergy with specific antileukemic agents</title><p>To determine which drugs NFV could be combined with to provide enhanced antileukemic activity, the SEM and Molm13 cell lines were screened against a panel of 35 different chemotherapy agents, both novel and conventional, with diverse mechanisms of action.

Based on these results, compounds that showed more than an additive change in cytotoxicity when combined were selected for more detailed studies to assess synergy and determine CIs. Agents selected were JQ1 (BET inhibitor), AT101 (Bcl-2 family inhibitor), and Sunitinib (TK inhibitor). CIs when tested across the panel of leukemia cell lines ranged from 0.07 to 0.95 for JQ1; 0.05&#8211;1.8 for AT101; and 0.013&#8211;0.6 for Sunitinib, implying synergistic effects across most cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ott-10-2581">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ott-10-2581">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The acute and long-term toxicities of chemotherapy regimens used to treat refractory and relapsed pediatric leukemia have prompted the search for newer, safer agents.

NFV has already been considered in combination with other chemotherapy agents in clinical trials, including with doxorubicin for breast cancer<xref rid="b35-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and with bortezomib for myeloma.<xref rid="b17-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> For both cases, NFV was able to act synergistically with the standard therapeutics to overcome drug resistance. In the former case, NFV was able to enhance the effects of doxorubicin against a multidrug-resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7/Dox), considered to be multifactorial and involving suppression of P-gp-mediated drug efflux, inhibition of Akt activation, and induction ER stress, leading to autophagy.<xref rid="b35-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Similarly, in the case of myeloma, NFV was able to enhance bortezomib to overcome both bortezomib and carfilzomib resistance, again, attributed to ER stress leading to increased unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway-induced apoptosis.<xref rid="b46-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Additionally, owing to its influence on cellular stress, NFV has also been considered in combination with radiation therapy.<xref rid="b33-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b39-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b47-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> To consider NFV&#8217;s application in the treatment of pediatric leukemia, we examined a panel of mechanistically diverse chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with NFV. This screen revealed synergy with the BET inhibitor, JQ1, with CIs ranging from 0.07 to 0.97. Based on the evidence of NFV&#8217;s influence on cellular stress and signaling targets, synergy with agents that alter epigenetic processes may be postulated. Indeed, there is evidence of synergy in literature of epigenetic drugs with both ER stress inducers and mTOR inhibitors.<xref rid="b49-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b51-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Similarly, for other pathways revealed, the Bcl-2 family inhibitor, AT101, and the TK inhibitor, Sunitinib, synergy with drugs that induce ER stress have been shown previously.<xref rid="b36-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b52-ott-10-2581" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> For these combinations, in our studies, CIs ranged from 0.05 to 1.8 and 0.013 to 0.6, respectively, providing evidence for their use together.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pediatric leukemia remains a critical area for ongoing research as our current therapies remain toxic to healthy cells and relapses of chemoresistant-disease continue to occur at unacceptable rates. Here we show that HIV PIs, namely NFV, that has been employed for decades against the HIV virus in both adults and children, has selective anticancer effects with a therapeutic window compared to normal lymphocytes. We have also identified the potential mechanisms behind this observation. Finally, we show that the drug is able to act synergistically with certain currently approved antileukemic agents providing the framework to design of a future in vivo studies and subsequently early-phase clinical trials for refractory leukemia in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ott-10-2581"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Combination studies with known chemotherapy regimens in Molm13.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> Drugs were plated in 96-well plates alone and in combination with the IC<sub>50</sub> of NFV, determined from the corresponding cell line cytotoxicity screens.
