In spite of this, the faecal virome of healthy dogs has not been investigated. In this study we describe the faecal virome of healthy dogs and dogs with acute diarrhoea in Australia, using a shotgun metagenomic approach. Viral sequences from a range of different virus families, including both RNA and DNA families, and known pathogens implicated in enteric disease were documented. Twelve viral families were identified, of which four were bacteriophages. Eight eukaryotic viral families were detected: <italic>Astroviridae</italic>, <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, <italic>Parvoviridae</italic>, <italic>Adenoviridae</italic> and <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic>. Families <italic>Astroviridae</italic>, <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> and <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> were found only in dogs with acute diarrhoea, with <italic>Astroviridae</italic> being the most common family identified in this group. Due to its prevalence, characterisation the complete genome of a canine astrovirus was performed. These studies indicate that metagenomic analyses are useful for the investigation of viral populations in the faeces of dogs. Further studies to elucidate the epidemiological and biological relevance of these findings are warranted.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>PSM is supported by Becas Chile scholarship program, Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Investigaci&#243;n Cient&#237;fica y Tecnol&#243;gica (CONICYT), Chilean government (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.conicyt.cl/becas-conicyt/">http://www.conicyt.cl/becas-conicyt/</ext-link>).

The virome comprises all types of viruses, including those that infect prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, DNA or RNA viruses, and viruses that cause acute or chronic infections. Many of these viruses are difficult or impossible to propagate in cell culture, and molecular detection is difficult as no common gene such as the ribosomal 16S gene that is present in bacterial species exists in viruses. These limitations have hindered the identification and characterisation of uncultured viruses [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Only a single previous shotgun metagenomic study investigating the faecal virome of dogs with diarrhoea has been reported. In that study, mammalian viruses were found in 15 samples and two new virus species were described [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our study analysed 16 faecal samples from dogs (8 healthy and 8 diarrhoeic), and identified eukaryotic viruses in 12 samples, including all diarrhoeic samples and 50% of the healthy samples. Thus, 70% of canine faeces contained eukaryotic viruses, suggesting that mammalian viruses are a common component of the enteric microbial population in dogs.</p><p>Our results must be interpreted with caution, due to bias created by SISPA. Areas of exaggerated depth appear when the SISPA method is used, creating artefacts during <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. This results in regions of repetitive sequences [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In order to overcome this bias, all contigs/singletons were analysed at family level and only for viral eukaryotic families were the results further analysed to evaluate what percentage they covered to some specific viral species.</p><p>The most common viral contigs/singletons identified in both groups were bacteriophages, similar to previous findings from human and other animal faecal virome studies [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

This life-cycle may lead to bacteriophages conferring advantage to some bacterial species in the environmental niche [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the greater amount of contigs/singletons corresponding to bacteriophages identified in the group of dogs with acute diarrhoea, when compared to healthy dogs, means a higher amount of bacteriophages. If so, bacteriophages could have generated a change in the normal balance of bacterial population resulting in dysbiosis, and ultimately causing diarrhoea. Conversely, it could be that an initial change in the bacterial population in these dogs resulted from the acute diarrhoea [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178433.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] is the cause of the variation in the bacteriophage population. In our sample population, the latter explanation is most likely, because in a shelter environment a higher number of circulating pathogens, changes in diet and a stressful environment could contribute to the dysbiosis associated with acute diarrhoea [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The bacterial microbiome and the analysis of contigs/singletons matching specific bacteriophages were not assessed in this study, therefore further microbiome/virome cross analysis is necessary to elucidate the association between bacteria and bacteriophages in dogs. However, even this analysis would be unlikely to determine the cause or effect relationship between bacteriophages and dysbiosis at a single point in time.</p><p>The analysis of the lowest common ancestor of eukaryotic viral families, according to MEGAN, identified eight eukaryotic virus species (<xref rid="pone.0178433.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, each of these results require validation by targeted PCR, or whole genome characterisation of each species, as the NGS results after SISPA amplification may be biased and not accurate depiction at a species level [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Sequences matching those of human viruses (adenovirus and papillomavirus) were found in one sample from a healthy dog.

This finding could suggest contamination during collection or processing.</p><p>Known enteric pathogenic families <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> and <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> were identified in samples from both healthy dogs and dogs with acute diarrhoea. Interestingly, almost all positive samples were from puppies (between 4&#8211;8 months) that had been vaccinated less than one month prior to sampling. The lowest common ancestry analysis in MEGAN of the contigs/singletons matching <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> family, suggested they were canine parvovirus (CPV), but as CPV positive dogs (as tested by faecal antigen tests) were not included in this study it is highly likely these results represent vaccine derived sequences not detected by the CPV antigen detection kit, or represent a virus load below the level of detection. Previous studies have demonstrated that modified live vaccine virus can be detected in faecal samples for extended periods of time after vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0178433.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Further genome characterisation of these canine parvovirus is warranted to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Three individual samples contained <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> contigs/singletons, two of which were from puppies [ND10 and DD8] (<xref rid="pone.0178433.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and one from an adult dog [DD1] (<xref rid="pone.0178433.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
