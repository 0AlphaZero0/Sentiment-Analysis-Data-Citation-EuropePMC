These methods allow relatively easy modification of DNA sequences in small plasmids but become less efficient and faithful for large plasmids, necessitating full sequence verification. Introduction of mutations in larger plasmids requires subcloning, a slow and labor-intensive process, especially for multiple mutations. We have developed an efficient DNA mutagenesis technique, UnRestricted Mutagenesis and Cloning (URMAC) that replaces subcloning steps with quick biochemical reactions. URMAC does not suffer from plasmid size constraints and allows simultaneous introduction of multiple mutations. URMAC involves manipulation of only the mutagenesis target site(s), not the entire plasmid being mutagenized, therefore only partial sequence verification is required. Basic URMAC requires two PCR reactions, each followed by a ligation reaction to circularize the product, with an optional third enrichment PCR step followed by a traditional cloning step that requires two restriction sites. Here, we demonstrate URMAC&#8217;s speed, accuracy, and efficiency through several examples, creating insertions, deletions or substitutions in plasmids ranging from 2.6 kb to 17 kb without subcloning.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The URMAC concept, validation, and development including mutagenesis of pUC18 were supported by L.K.H. personal resources.

Most SDM techniques make use of one version or another of inverse PCR mutagenesis. Inverse PCR was developed by Hemsley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and later improved by the use of a proof-reading DNA polymerase, such as Vent [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and an enzymatic step to remove background template [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Another fast mutagenesis method developed by Papworth <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] uses a primer extension design to copy the plasmid, generating staggered nicks that are repaired by bacteria after transformation. These and other SDM methods have been commercialized in DNA mutagenesis kits such as ExCite and QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). Because these techniques rely on copying the entire DNA plasmid with primers containing the desired mutation, they generally work best for plasmids under 3.1 kb in size [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This approach has inherent limitations including the difficulty of copying large plasmids, an increased chance of encountering too-high or too-low GC contents that slow or stop PCR reactions, and the introduction of unwanted mutations in the plasmid due to polymerase errors. Introducing a mutation in plasmids larger than 8 kb usually requires subcloning a section of the plasmid containing the site of mutagenesis into smaller cloning vectors to make the SDM possible. Subcloning is an inherently slow process involving restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation, colony formation and selection, DNA isolation, sequence verification, and excision of the mutated DNA sequence from the subclone and its insertion into the original plasmid. All but the final insertion step are avoided in URMAC.</p><p>URMAC employs a minimalistic approach in which PCR reactions are performed on the smallest possible portion of a large plasmid that contains the mutagenic target site flanked by unique restriction sites. This approach significantly improves the rate of PCR success and the quality of the product. In this study, we provide several examples of the applicability of URMAC for deletion, insertion, or substitution of DNA sequences in plasmids ranging in size from 2.6 kb to 17 kb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>General description of the URMAC method</title><p>URMAC relies on the simple ability of DNA ligation to turn a linear PCR product generated from a plasmid template into a circular DNA that can be opened at a second site by amplification with primers containing the desired mutation(s), circularized by ligation again, and amplified with the original primers to reproduce the original DNA containing the desired mutation(s). The same reaction steps can be used to insert, delete, or substitute any number of DNA nucleotides.

At 40-nucleotide resolution scanning (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">methods</xref>), the plasmids contained a 79.5% GC region in pCG-H and 85.4% in pCG-F. We avoided the need to amplify these GC regions which would have been necessary if we had used inverse PCR mutagenesis, by amplifying and manipulating only the region of interest by URMAC.</p><p>The pCG-H and pCG-F plasmids contain the attachment (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of Edmonston B strain of measles virus (MV) [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Together, these two viral glycoproteins enable the MV virion envelope to attach to and fuse with the target cell membrane to initiate infection. When the H and F proteins are co-expressed on the cell surface during infection or following transfection, they interact with cellular receptors on neighboring cells causing cell-cell fusion resulting in the formation of syncytia. Based on this fusion phenomenon, we tested the functional ability of mutant H and/or F with a modified integrin-binding Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) motif to induce syncytia in two cell lines, Vero and BKH-21. In Vero cells, our positive control, the MV glycoproteins can use the cell surface CD46 molecule as a receptor to initiate fusion independent of interaction with the LDV motif. However, BHK-21 hamster cells do not express CD46, but they express the integrins that interact with the LDV motifs on viral H and F proteins. To determine whether or not the LDV motif in either the H or F glycoprotein is critical for fusion, we used URMAC to replace the central Asp (D) with the similar amino acid, Glu (E), to create an H protein variant, D<sub>79</sub>E, and an F protein variant, D<sub>461</sub>E.</p><p>To perform this mutagenesis, we designed a pair of <italic>Starter Primers</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0177788.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to amplify the region encoding the LDV motif in the F gene in pCG-F, and another pair for the H gene in pCG-H, including appropriate native restriction sites in the amplicons. The substitution reaction steps were performed as described above for pUC18. After generating the final plasmids that carry the desired modifications, the DNA of 5 clones for both mutants was sequenced at the mutation sites. All 10 sequenced clones contained the correct mutations. The biological significance of the mutations was investigated by performing a fusion assay(data not shown).</p><p>In addition to the D-to-E mutations in pCG-H and pCG-F, we generated several other mutations in the LDV motif of both the F and H proteins using a single <italic>Opener Primer</italic> in conjunction with a series of mutagenic <italic>Opener Primers</italic> on the same <italic>Closed Starter DNA</italic> template. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177788.g003">Fig 3B</xref> illustrates this approach that generated four different mutations, L78A, D79A, D79E, and V80A, using a single common Opener Primer (OP2) paired with a series of mutagenic Opener Primers (OP1). This approach easily enables any number of mutations to be built into a motif or region by changing the sequence of only one of the primers used in this step. Introducing mutations in the pCG-H and pCG-F took one day for the URMAC biochemical reactions and an additional 3 days to clone the <italic>Linear Modified DNA</italic> into the original plasmids. URMAC did not require extensive optimization since the PCR was used to copy only 10% of the plasmid in this case avoiding regions of high GC content. We conclude from this experiment that URMAC can be easily used to introduce mutations in 6&#8211;7 kb plasmids containing regions of widely disparate GC content without resorting to conventional subcloning.</p><fig id="pone.0177788.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0177788.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Pairing a variety of mutagenic Opener Primers (OP1 series) with a single common primer (OP2) was used to generate four different variants of the MV H glycoprotein.</title><p>The OP1 series (<xref rid="pone.0177788.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were used in separate PCR reactions with the same OP2 primer on the same Closed Starter DNA to simultaneously generate four different mutant Linear Intermediate DNA PCR products containing indicated mutations (lower panel).

DMD and BMD are characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration and development of cardiac disease leading to premature death, with DMD having an earlier childhood onset and a more severe disease progression than BMD. By contrast, XLDCM patients typically only develop severe cardiac disease and as a result, are treated with a cardiac transplant. To study the differential effects of mutations on the function of dystrophin in striated muscles, it is critical to ensure that only the desired mutation is introduced during the mutagenesis process.

Transcription of this plasmid in mammalian cells, along with the expression of the 4 viral proteins involved in genome replication and mRNA transcription, initiates continuous intracellular replication of this RNA virus replicon [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177788.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

In URMAC, mutagenesis is minimalistic: only the smallest region targeted for mutagenesis in a given DNA sequence/plasmid is subjected to molecular manipulation. For example, in our MV H and F gene mutagenesis experiments, URMAC was applied to only 287 bp and 512 bp of the pCG-H and pCG-F plasmids instead of the entire 6,669 bp and 6,411 bp, leaving more than 95% of the plasmids untouched by the DNA polymerase. This lends several benefits to the URMAC technology: 1) PCR reactions have a higher success rate with small fragments rather than with full-length plasmids; 2) URMAC has a lower chance of introducing polymerase errors than the primer extension SDM method (QuikChange) and inverse PCR because the fragment being amplified is much smaller; 3) regions of any plasmid that are not a direct target for mutagenesis remain untouched by DNA polymerase and therefore do not require sequence verification, a critical consideration when dealing with plasmids containing a very large gene such as the dystrophin gene, or multiple genes such as the RSV replicon; 4) URMAC is very fast compared to conventional SDM requiring subcloning, with an average of a single day to complete URMAC and an additional 3 days to clone the final product into the original plasmid, compared to at least 3&#8211;4 weeks required for subcloning; 5) URMAC can dramatically reduce the challenge of high GC-containing plasmids by avoiding PCR amplification of those parts of a plasmid; and 6) URMAC requires less labor and materials and therefore costs less than subcloning.</p><p>Furthermore, URMAC is versatile for handling any combination of insertions, deletions or substitutions. While QuikChange is fast in creating a single or double nucleotide mutation in a small plasmid, larger or multiple changes are more difficult. URMAC does not suffer from this limitation since the mutation is inserted at the 5&#8242; end of a short primer rather than in the middle of longer mutagenic primers. In this way, URMAC is similar to the inverse PCR techniques, yet it does not suffer from the size limitation of inverse PCR. Like URMAC, another method, called splice overlap mutagenesis (SOM) [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], requires the availability of restriction sites, but SOM primers must be complementary to the target DNA in both orientations at the joining ends of the two PCR products, limiting control over the primer design and their effectiveness. Since URMAC does not require the joining of PCR products, URMAC does not suffer from this limitation. When individual mutations are required in adjacent regions of the plasmid to generate multiple separate mutants, the <italic>Closed Starter DNA</italic> can serve as a template for all of the mutations by designing different <italic>Opener Primers</italic>. The <italic>Closed Intermediate DNA</italic> can be recycled as <italic>Closed Starter DNA</italic>, once for each mutation.</p><p>Although URMAC mutagenesis is not affected by the size of the original plasmid because the actual mutagenesis is performed on only a small region, inserting the final PCR product into the original plasmid does depend on the availability of unique restriction sites. In plasmids of 30 kb or larger, the availability of such restriction sites becomes limited. In this case, an alternative recombineering strategy [<xref rid="pone.0177788.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] could be incorporated into the URMAC technique to facilitate the insertion of the mutated sequences back into very large plasmids irrespective of the availability of restriction sites.</p><p>In summary, compared to conventional site-directed mutagenesis methods, including those that require subcloning, the URMAC technology is versatile, simple, efficient and cost-effective. It is particularly useful for large plasmids but also works well for small plasmids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Mutations in pUC18 accession number L09136</title><p>All PCRs were carried out using 100 pg pUC18 as a template and 75 pmol of <italic>Starter Primers</italic> 1 and 2 (<xref rid="pone.0177788.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in a total volume of 25 &#956;l containing 1 unit <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and the appropriate amplification buffer unless otherwise stated.
