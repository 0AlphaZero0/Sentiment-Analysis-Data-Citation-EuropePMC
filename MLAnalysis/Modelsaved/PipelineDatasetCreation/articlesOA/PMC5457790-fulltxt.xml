anxiety and stress in undergraduate dental students using the Depression,
Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).
</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted in
November and December of 2014. A total of 289 dental students were invited to
participate, and 277 responded, resulting in a response rate of 96%. The final
sample included 247 participants. Eligible participants were surveyed via a
self-reported questionnaire that included the validated DASS-21 scale as the
assessment tool and questions about demographic characteristics and methods for
managing stress.&#160;
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Abnormal levels of depression, anxiety and stress
were identified in 55.9%, 66.8% and 54.7% of the study participants,
respectively. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed multiple
predictors: gender (for anxiety b=-3.589, p=.016 and stress b=-4.099, p=.008),
satisfaction with faculty relationships (for depression b=-2.318, p=.007;
anxiety b=-2.213, p=.004; and stress b=-2.854, p&lt;.001), satisfaction with
peer relationships (for depression b=-3.527, p&lt;.001; anxiety b=-2.213,
p=.004; and stress b=-2.854, p&lt;.001), and dentistry as the first choice for
field of study (for stress b=-2.648, p=.045). The standardized coefficients
demonstrated the relationship and strength of the predictors for each subscale.
To cope with stress, students engaged in various activities such as reading,
watching television and seeking emotional support from others.
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The high occurrence of depression, anxiety and
stress among dental students highlights the importance of providing support
programs and implementing preventive measures to help students, particularly
those who are most susceptible to higher levels of these psychological
conditions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Keywords: Depression</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>dental student</kwd><kwd>psychological health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dental education can be a significant source of stress among dental students, and studies have observed higher levels of stress among dental students than in the general population.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A large body of literature examining stress in undergraduate dental students has revealed a significant increase in stress that intensifies with students&#8217; year of study.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Stress is a result of certain external physical or mental factors that affect an individual&#8217;s physical and psychological well-being.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>In their systematic review, Alzahem and colleagues<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> categorized stressors into five groups: living accommodation, educational environment, and personal, academic and clinical factors.

Anxiety is associated with autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, and subjective experience of an anxious affect, and it is defined by the American Psychological Association as an "emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes such as increased blood pressure".<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The World Health Organization defines depression as "a common mental disorder, characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite and feelings of tiredness and poor concentration.

Thus, it would be beneficial to examine depression, anxiety, and stress using one tool rather than multiple assessments. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) measures the three dimensions of these psychological conditions in a single, concise and comprehensive scale. To the best of our knowledge, this tool has not been applied to measure these psychological conditions exclusively in undergraduate dental students.</p><p>Although several studies have assessed levels of stress and identified stressors in the dental environment in Saudi Arabia, no studies have used measures of depression and anxiety to assess the psychological well-being of undergraduate dental students specifically. Therefore, our aim was to measure the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in dental students at King Saud University (KSU) using the DASS-21 and to investigate the relationship between these levels and previously reported stressors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at the College of Dentistry of KSU in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia, during November and December of 2014.

The first section included 11 questions related to demographic characteristics such as gender, marital status, year of study, grade point average (GPA), and whether dental school was the student&#8217;s first admission choice. Subsequently, the students answered questions scored on a Likert scale (from 0 to 5) assessing their satisfaction with their peer and faculty relationships and the academic environment in general. A final question addressed the students&#8217; stress coping methods (more than one option could be selected). The second section of the questionnaire contained the 21 items from the short-form version of the DASS.</p><p>The DASS was developed by Lovibond and Lovibond<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> to assess the core symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress and has also been used to evaluate patients&#8217; response to treatment.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The DASS has demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties and is comparable to other reliable scales.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>&#160;</p><p>The DASS-21 is the short-form version of the original self-reported 42-item questionnaire and has demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>adequate reliability and construct validity.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> It includes three self-reported scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.

Depression, anxiety and stress scores are calculated by summing the scores of the relevant items. Because the DASS-21 is a short-form version of the DASS (42 items), the final score for each sub-scale is multiplied by two and evaluated according to its severity rating index.

The first year is a general preparatory year that is common to all health colleges, followed by 5 years of dental school. The final year is a 12-month internship program. The first year consists mainly of courses in basic, medical, and dental science. Students enroll in dental school directly from high school; the level of competition is very high, and only the best students with the highest grades and performance indicators at school and on admission exams and interviews are accepted. This competition persists throughout dental education, as high grades and above-average performance are expected and represent the norm. Additional pressure stems from the large amount of new information that students must learn and the technical skills they must master. Schmitter and colleagues<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> noted that dental education is more stressful than even medical education.</p><p>In this study, the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and stress among dental students was high, and the levels of these conditions were abnormal in more than half the students.

In this study, we found that one of the strongest predictors of stress was peer relationships; satisfactory peer relationships protected against distress.

In our study, the majority of the students actively engaged in activities unrelated to the profession of dentistry to relieve stress. Previous studies have found that the most common coping method is emotional support from others, specifically, talking to friends and family.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> When students lack this source of social support, levels of stress increase.<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Smoking was one of the stress relievers mentioned by students in the current study, and in a recent study involving dental students at KSU, stress was found to be the main reason for smoking, reported by approximately half the students who smoked.<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> A less frequently mentioned but more serious source of stress relief was recreational drug use. Prinz and colleagues<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> reported that students with the highest levels of depression and anxiety exhibit higher degrees of dysfunctional coping. These adverse coping patterns could have potentially serious effects on both physical and mental health and should not be underestimated.</p><p>Research has also suggested that students with certain personality traits are more prone to distress. Specifically, the risk of depression may increase with maladaptive perfectionism,<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> type A personality, and anger suppression,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> whereas self-actualization, self-awareness, and a sense of fulfillment may lower the risk of depression.<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> Emotional intelligence has been found to both protect against perceived stress<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> and affect coping with stress.

These strategies could focus mainly on improving the perception of stressful situations, the development of coping skills and the avoidance of maladaptive coping. Additionally, more emphasis should be placed on the importance of humanistic faculty-student relationships. The current study site has implemented several positive changes to improve the learning environment for students, including establishing a student council, obtaining student feedback on faculty and courses, creating a student support unit, and assigning academic advisors to each student throughout his or her education. It is also suggested that students be allowed to choose the clinical instructors with whom they feel most comfortable working. The student-to-instructor ratio could also be reduced to promote more active student involvement and to allow for more effective feedback. Additionally, students can be trained to foster emotional intelligence and organizational and time-management skills,<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref> and students may benefit from training to improve their communication skills in order to facilitate interactions with faculty and administrators.<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref></p><p>Although this study has several strengths, such as the excellent response rate, random sampling method, and the simple and concise test tool, it also has some limitations. The cross-sectional design does not allow for assessments of changes in psychological status over time. In addition, given the self-reported nature of the assessment tool, we cannot rule out response bias. Furthermore, our literature review was limited to articles published in English, which may preclude comparisons with significant findings reported in other languages. To improve the accuracy of the outcomes, studies using a longitudinal design that include more schools at the national or international level are recommended for future research.&#160;&#160;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study aimed to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in undergraduate dental students and found that despite excluding participants currently undergoing psychological management, the levels of these conditions were relatively high. The actual numbers may be even higher than those reported herein. Participants with abnormal depression and anxiety scores require a clinical diagnosis to receive prompt treatment. Furthermore, to ensure early identification of and intervention for psychological conditions, both students and faculty should be educated regarding the physical and psychological signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression. More attention should be devoted to susceptible individuals, such as female students, with the aim of improving relationships and satisfaction levels. Strategies for stress prevention and management should be implemented in dental schools to improve students&#8217; well-being, prevent drop out and ensure proper patient care. The persistence of these problems may lead to further physical and psychological complications that could continue after graduation, resulting in unhealthy dentists or early retirement and thereby affecting both the quantity and quality of the workforce.</p><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the efforts of Dr Manal Alkadi, who had an important role and
