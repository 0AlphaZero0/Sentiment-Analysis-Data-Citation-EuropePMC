Nevertheless, cases also exist where marine-freshwater divergence is diffuse despite seemingly similar environmental settings. In order to assess what characterizes these highly different outcomes, we focused on the latter kind of system in the Odder River, Denmark. Here, a previous study based on RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequencing found non-significant genome-wide differentiation between marine and freshwater sticklebacks. In the present study, we analyzed samples on a finer geographical scale. We assessed if the system should be regarded as panmictic, or if fine-scale genetic structure and local selection was present but dominated by strong migration. We also asked if specific population components, that is the two sexes and different lateral plate morphs, contributed disproportionally more to dispersal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We assessed variation at 96 SNPs and the Eda gene that affects lateral plate number, conducted molecular sex identification, and analyzed morphological traits. Genetic differentiation estimated by F<sub>ST</sub> was non-significant throughout the system. Nevertheless, spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested fine scale genetic structure with a genetic patch size of 770&#160;m. There was no evidence for sex-biased dispersal, but full-plated individuals showed higher dispersal than low- and partial-plated individuals. The system was dominated by full-plated morphs characteristic of marine sticklebacks, but in the upstream part of the river body shape and frequency of low-plated morphs changed in the direction expected for freshwater sticklebacks. Five markers including Eda were under possible diversifying selection. However, only subtle clinal patterns were observed for traits and markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We suggest that gene flow from marine sticklebacks overwhelms adaptation to freshwater conditions, but the short genetic patch size means that the effect of gene flow on the most upstream region must be indirect and occurs over generations. The occurrence of both weak unimodal and strong bimodal hybrid zones within the same species is striking. We suggest environmental and demographic factors that could determine these outcomes, but also highlight the possibility that long-term population history and the presence or absence of genomic incompatibilities could be a contributing factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12862-017-0982-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptive divergence</kwd><kwd>Gene flow</kwd><kwd>Spatial autocorrelation</kwd><kwd>Sex-biased dispersal</kwd><kwd>Single nucleotide polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>Body shape</kwd><kwd>Eda</kwd><kwd>Hybrid zone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VKR022523</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>and EU Interreg (&#216;resund-Kattegat-Skagerrak)</institution></funding-source><award-id>MARGEN</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Selection is a key force enabling the adaptation of populations to local environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, selection must be seen in conjunction with gene flow and drift, and it is well established that gene flow may constrain local adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When selection is combined with gene flow across populations, this may lead to the establishment of clines. It has been suggested that disruptive/divergent selection acting along an environmental gradient can gradually sharpen clinal variation until a single ancestral population ultimately fragments into two or more species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conversely, clines may occur when previously isolated populations come into secondary contact and establish hybrid zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The shape and width of clines are strongly affected by gene flow or more specifically dispersal, defined as the geographical distance between the sites of reproduction by parents and their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Low dispersal rates and strong disruptive selection will essentially generate narrow clines whereas high dispersal and/or weak selection will generate wide clines. Additionally, a distinction has been made between bimodal hybrid zones, where parental genotypes predominate and only few hybrids are observed, and unimodal hybrid zones, where most genotypes represent hybrids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It has been suggested that different types of selection may underlie these different categories, with prezygotic isolation being particularly important for bimodal zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The geographical scale over which dispersal occurs within a life-time is an important factor for understanding interactions between gene flow and selection. Furthermore, different groups of individuals within a population may contribute disproportionally to dispersal. Sex-biased dispersal is often observed in vertebrates, with male- or female biased dispersal resulting from the specific mating systems and/or extent of resource competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, phenotypic differences not ascribed to sex may also affect the propensity for dispersal of individuals, such as intraspecific differences in body shape in salmonid fishes adapted to short- or long-distance migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the context of clinal patterns, non-random dispersal exhibited by different morphs and ecotypes therefore could have important consequences.</p><p>The threespine stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) is an excellent model for studying clines and hybrid zones, as it shows pronounced adaptation to different environments that can be identified both at phenotypic and genomic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Strong divergence is often observed between marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and this type of system has received considerable attention as a model for understanding adaptive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Marine sticklebacks are assumed to represent the ancestral form of the species, and in numerous instances freshwater populations have been founded by immigration of marine sticklebacks, which have adapted to freshwater conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is manifested in a number of phenotypic traits, such as marine sticklebacks being generally larger and exhibiting streamlined body shapes, whereas freshwater sticklebacks are smaller, deeper-bodied and with larger heads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Some of these body shape differences may reflect phenotypic plasticity rather than genetically based adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, the most studied morphological difference between marine and freshwater sticklebacks concerns the number of lateral plates, which has a clear genetic basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Hence, marine sticklebacks typically show full armor (full-plated morphs), most freshwater populations show reduced numbers of lateral plates (low-plated morphs), and the gene Ectodyplasin-A (Eda) on chromosome 4 has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The suggested selective agents include fish predation in marine environments selecting for full-plated morphs, predation by invertebrates favoring low-plated morphs in freshwater, along with abiotic factors such as Calcium concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>In most cases when transitions between pairs of marine and freshwater populations have been studied, clear bimodal distributions of lateral plate numbers have been observed. Molecular markers have shown that this corresponds to narrow hybrid zones with bimodal distributions of genotypes and strong differentiation between parental populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Important exceptions nevertheless exist, as full-plated morphs are in some cases widely distributed in freshwater environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and particularly in coastal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Two recent studies of sticklebacks in the North Sea region of Belgium and the Netherlands suggest that this is an outcome of gene flow overwhelming selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Hence, Raeymaekers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] investigated temporal dynamics of lateral plate and Eda variation in near-coastal freshwater populations and concluded that selection favored low-plated morphs and the associated Eda allele, but gene flow from marine sticklebacks nevertheless exceeded selection. Konijnendijk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] reached a similar conclusion based on analysis of gene-associated microsatellite markers that showed limited footprints of selection in this system despite being outliers in other marine-freshwater population pairs. Finally, a third recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] analyzed marine and freshwater populations in Denmark using RAD sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In one system, the Odder River which flows into the Kattegat Sea, the population was dominated by full-plated morphs. Genome-wide differentiation was non-significant between marine sticklebacks and samples from the river, and genomic regions of elevated differentiation potentially under selection were essentially absent. Hence, this system resembles that studied by Raeymaekers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and Konijnendijk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and similar dynamics may be acting.</p><p>It is striking that both distinct bimodal hybrid zones and cases of weak, almost undetectable divergence have been observed within the same species and across comparable environmental transition zones. Detailed analysis of cases of weak genetic divergence despite strong environmental differences could therefore provide further insights into the factors that lead to different outcomes of hybrid zone dynamics. In the present study, we focused on sticklebacks in the Odder River system. We sampled sticklebacks from the marine environment and from the river, extending from the river mouth until ca. 8&#160;km upstream. We analyzed morphological traits along with variation at 96 SNPs and an indel marker in close linkage with the Eda gene. In addition, we used a sex-specific genetic marker for determining the sex of individuals. We addressed the following research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How are we to consider cases like the Odder River system? Is it a completely panmictic population with no local adaptive responses, or is fine-scale genetic structure and local selection present but dominated by strong migration? Based on detailed spatial sampling and spatial autocorrelation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] we analyzed genetic structure. We furthermore analyzed clinal variation at traits and markers and conducted outlier tests for genetic markers. These analyses allowed us to characterize the system and test the hypothesis that gene flow by marine sticklebacks overwhelms selection, even several kilometres upstream.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do specific population components contribute more to dispersal in hybrid zones than others? In sticklebacks, full-plated morphs show reduced growth relative to low-plated morphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and it is possible that this could also translate into differences in dispersal between morphs. Also, threespine sticklebacks are polygynous, which should favour male-biased dispersal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. On the other side, however, a trait such as the spiggin glue excreted and used by males for nest-building may be adapted to local water chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which should pose an immediate selective cost for males dispersing across environmental gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Previous studies of sex-biased dispersal in sticklebacks have yielded contrasting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We made use of a powerful approach based on spatial autocorrelation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] for testing sex- and plate-biased dispersal. This allowed us to test if differences in dispersal among individuals within populations could be a contributing factor towards creating strong hybrid zones in some systems, whereas absence of selection in other systems could lead to strong gene flow and weak divergence. Based on the answers to these questions we considered possible scenarios that can explain why distinct molecular and phenotypic differences between freshwater and marine sticklebacks are evident in some systems but not in others, and from a general perspective why hybrid zones occur in some settings but are weak and absent in others within the same species.</p></list-item></list>

The river is ca. 16&#160;km long and up to ca. 5&#160;m wide and with no barriers to dispersal from the outlet to the most upstream sampled river stretches. Water depth in the downstream part is up to 1.5&#160;m and in the upstream part up to 1&#160;m. The lower ca. 500&#160;m are influenced by tides, as evidenced by halting or even reversal of water currents during high tide. The fish fauna is dominated by threespine stickleback and brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic>). Intensive electrofishing conducted during this study also showed the presence of a few nine-spine sticklebacks (<italic>Pungitius pungitius</italic>) and single specimens of northern pike (<italic>Esox lucius</italic>) and European eel (<italic>Anguilla anguilla</italic>). The river flows into Norsminde Fjord, a shallow estuary with mean average depth of 0.60&#160;m and about 3.5&#160;km long and 0.5&#160;km wide. It is characterized by shallow tidal flats, a deeper central channel and little vegetation. Salinity in the inner part coinciding with the river outlet ranges between 0.1&#8240; and 22.4&#8240;, and between 5.2&#8240; and 26.2&#8240; in the outlet to the Kattegat Sea, depending on tides and occasional strong inflow from the sea caused by storms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Visual inspection of the estuary during the spawning time suggested that it is not spawning habitat for threespine stickleback, but migration through the channel is clearly possible. The outlet of the fjord into the Kattegat Sea is regulated by a sluice. Threespine stickleback is highly abundant around the sluice and nesting males were observed in May&#8211;June.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sampling sites in the Odder River (freshwater) and Norsminde Fjord (marine). The three major groups of samples are as follows: (1) OddUa and OddUb are the two upstream localities in Odder River, pooled into the OddU group for some analyses. OddM denotes the group of samples that were collected continuously in the lower part of the river (as shown in the inserted box). Nor represents marine sticklebacks, sampled at three neighbouring localities and pooled into a single sample</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12862_2017_982_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>A total of 390 threespine sticklebacks were sampled in the Norsminde Fjord (marine) and Odder River system (freshwater) from 2 May to 13 June 2013. This coincides with the spawning time of the species, increasing the probability that individuals were sampled near their sites of reproduction. Sampling was conducted with dip nets and cast nets (in the marine environment) and electrofishing and minnow traps (in freshwater). We defined the marine location, i.e. the outlet of the Norsminde Fjord into the Kattegat Sea as distance 0&#160;m (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The outlet of the Odder River into Norsminde Fjord was at distance 3351&#160;m. Fine-scale sampling was conducted from the outlet of the river and about 2.4&#160;km upstream (distance 5756&#160;m), with about one hundred meters separating each sampled locality (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for details). In addition to the downstream region of the river, we sampled sticklebacks at two localities further upstream (distance 8702 and 11,627&#160;m, respectively; see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The latter site represents the upstream limit of the distributional range of sticklebacks in the river. Electrofishing further upstream revealed no sticklebacks but a much denser population of brown trout than further downstream, and it is possible that the absence of sticklebacks is a result of intense predation by trout.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sampled localities, sample sizes (N), geographic coordinates and distance from the sea (Nor&#160;=&#160;0)</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>The three major groups correspond to the pooling of the original samples for some aspects of statistical analysis: the marine (Nor), the downstream (OddM) and the upstream groups (OddU)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

DNA Tissue Extraction kit (OmegaBio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). Individuals were genotyped for 96 SNPs and an indel marker close to the Ectodysplacin (Eda) gene. The 96 SNPs represent a subset of 33,993 markers identified by RAD sequencing of a different set of Danish marine and freshwater threespine stickleback populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and encompassed both markers under putatively directional selection in freshwater versus marine environments as well as putatively neutral markers. These SNPs do not necessarily coincide with genomic regions identified as marine-freshwater outliers in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and in general Danish stickleback populations do not to the same extent exhibit parallel evolution for the same genomic regions as observed in several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The genomic locations of the SNPs can be found in Ferchaud et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The SNPs were genotyped on 96.96 Dynamic Arrays (Fluidigm Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA), using the Fluidigm EP1 instrument according to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations. Variation at Eda was assessed using the Stn381 indel marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and genotypes were determined by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel, followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization under UV light.

As initial tests showed that the assumption of normal distribution of lateral plate counts was not met (with or without log-transformation data), a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted for testing differences in lateral plate counts between the three major population groups (Nor, OddM and OddU).

Jolliffe cut-off and broken stick methods were used to assess the number of principal components that should be considered significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Thin-plate spline transformation grids were used to visualize where the largest shape differences were found between the three populations. The mean shapes for each major group were first calculated in PAST version 2.17c. Subsequently, mean shapes of the major groups were plotted pairwise. The Jacobian color-code (yellow to red for factor&#160;&gt;&#160;1, indicating expansion; and light to dark blue for factors between 0 and 1 indicating contraction) were used to visualize changes in shape between localities. A one-way MANOVA (Multivariate ANalysis Of VAriance) was conducted to test for equality of means of the three populations (Nor, OddM and OddU) and a Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) to test for separation between them.

Overall, the results indicate a shallow hybrid zone and/or change of selection regimes around 4100&#8211;5400&#160;m from the sea in the lower part of the Odder River, corresponding to ca. 350&#8211;1500&#160;m from the outlet of the river into the Norsminde Fjord.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of our study documented a system with very low and non-significant genetic differentiation between marine and freshwater sticklebacks sampled up to 8&#160;km inland. Yet, despite low differentiation spatial autocorrelation analysis showed fine-scale genetic structure in the river with a genetic patch size of ca. 770&#160;m. There was no evidence for sex-biased dispersal, but full-plated individuals showed higher dispersal compared to partial/low-plated individuals. At the phenotypic level, there was an increasing occurrence of shorter, deeper-bodied, larger-headed individuals and higher frequency of low-plated morphs in the upstream river (OddU) relative to downstream (OddM) and marine sticklebacks (Nor). Whereas trends for these traits are in the directions expected for differentiation between marine and freshwater threespine sticklebacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], it is nevertheless striking that even in the most upstream part of the river the prevalent plate morph was full-plated, and a concordant pattern was seen for the candidate locus Eda. There was some evidence for diversifying selection, particularly at the Eda locus. Also, some clinal patterns were evident at molecular markers and phenotypic traits, and there was concordance as to the geographical position of cline centres. Yet, all clines were shallow and for molecular markers they typically involved shifts of allele frequencies between 0.1 and 0.2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>In the following we consider how systems like Odder River sticklebacks can be characterized, we discuss the lack of sex-biased dispersal and the finding of plate morph-biased dispersal and its biological significance. Finally, we discuss possible reasons underlying the widely different patterns of marine-freshwater divergence observed in the stickleback system, which also parallels other findings of both bi- and unimodal hybrid zones within the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Characterization of system</title><p>We reject the hypothesis that the Odder River system and adjacent marine sticklebacks comprise a simple panmictic population. Even though analysis of tens of thousands of SNPs in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and analysis of hundreds of individuals using fewer SNPs in the present study yielded very low and non-significant F<sub>ST</sub> values, the spatial autocorrelation analysis nevertheless showed fine-scale structure. Hence, with a genetic patch size of ca. 770&#160;m the probability is low that individuals from e.g. the river mouth would interbreed with individuals 8&#160;km upstream. This also leads us to rule out a simple explanation of the results showing overall low adaptive divergence throughout the system, that is anadromy. If all individuals migrated to sea and returned to freshwater to spawn, then they would all be subject to selection regimes characteristic of marine environments, which could explain the dominance of full-plated morphs. However, in order for the fine-scale structure to persist this would require accurate natal homing from the sea to specific sites in the river up to 8&#160;km upstream. Transplantation and recapture of tagged sticklebacks in a small stream has demonstrated that they are able to home to the original point of capture when displaced up to 200&#160;m downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. However, this involves ability to return to a site that the individual is familiar with and not specifically natal homing. The genetic patch size of 770&#160;m corresponds roughly with findings of freshwater sticklebacks moving up to 1.8&#160;km over one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]; the 770&#160;m genetic patch size must be considered an average and does not exclude the possibility that some individuals could move further. This distance is much lower than the 8&#160;km upstream where sticklebacks were found in the Odder River. Therefore, while it is likely that sticklebacks in the most downstream parts of the river are anadromous, this is unlikely to account for the whole population.</p><p>It is also evident that some diversifying selection is ongoing in the system. Although the possibility of false positives must be taken into account when interpreting outlier tests, it is reassuring that the well-known candidate locus Eda was the most significant outlier. Nevertheless, F<sub>ST</sub> at this locus was relatively low (0.11); this corresponds to F<sub>ST</sub> values of 0.12 and 0.10 observed in some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], but is considerably lower than differentiation observed in a number of other studies reviewed by Raeymaekers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], with F<sub>ST</sub> ranging from 0.38 to 0.86. Even though clines at loci and traits were shallow, the fact that there was general concordance between the geographical positions of cline centers also suggests a response to an environmental gradient. Clines at some traits, notably infection by <italic>black spot disease</italic> could in principle reflect genetic adaption. However, they could also reflect differences in environmental conditions, such as salinity, which by themselves affect the abundance of the parasites without invoking adaptive responses. Geographical differences and clinal patterns for body shape variation may also reflect phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but the differences in lateral plate numbers have a genetic basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In total, the system is best characterized as a diffuse, unimodal hybrid zone, where gene flow overwhelms selection. However, gene flow affects the most upstream localities indirectly, in a step-wise manner and over generations. This result illustrates the point previously made by Peakall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] that in continuous habitats (like the Odder River system), populations of widespread species may be connected via gene flow over considerably longer distances than the scale of dispersal within one or a few generations. Hence, a pronounced local genetic structure may be present, even if at the same time genetic differentiation measured as F<sub>ST</sub> is low between geographically more remote sites. Although it may take some generations for marine-adapted alleles to travel to the most upstream part of the population, even low amounts of gene flow may constrain local adaptation. The classically inferred relationship between gene flow/migration (m) and selection (s) is that m&#160;&gt;&#160;s will lead to gene flow overwhelming selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. More elaborate models focusing on the constraints of gene flow on quantitative adaptive traits have been developed and show that even rates of m&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01 can have a constraining effect relative to the optimal phenotypic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Whereas we did not attempt to estimate quantitative genetics parameters in our system, and the complexity of dispersal in the system and low differentiation does not allow for estimating gene flow, we nevertheless expect that the rate of gene flow from marine sticklebacks affecting the most upstream parts of the population is &gt;&#160;&gt;&#160;0.01, potentially with a significantly constraining effect on local adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Dispersal differences among population segments</title><p>Sex-biased dispersal might account for differences in introgression of mitochondrial DNA, sex chromosomes and autosomal loci observed across some hybrid zones, such as in salamanders (<italic>Plethodon spp.</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and field voles (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In threespine stickleback there are arguments supporting hypotheses of both male- and female-biased dispersal, and two different studies have provided evidence in both directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Yet, we found no evidence for sex-biased dispersal, despite the fact that spatial autocorrelation was analyzed over an environmental gradient that could particularly incur fitness loss of dispersing males, if spiggin glue used for nest-building is adapted to different water chemistries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although our study represents just a single location, it is nevertheless interesting that no sex-biased dispersal was observed at a small geographical scale where dispersal clearly occurs and environmental heterogeneity exists. This raises the possibility that dispersal in threespine sticklebacks simply may not be sex-biased at all.</p><p>In contrast to sex-biased dispersal we did, however, observe different dispersal of lateral plate morphs. Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested that full-plated morphs exhibited higher dispersal than partial and low-plated morphs. The differences were small, but on the other hand we pooled partial and low-plated morphs to obtain sufficiently high sample sizes, and it is possible that a direct comparison between only full- and low-plated sticklebacks would have revealed stronger differences. We find it surprising that full-plated morphs normally characterizing marine sticklebacks disperse more in freshwater, but it could reflect a continual influx of full-plated marine sticklebacks that is not counter-balanced by downstream migration of low-plated individuals. Also, a behavioral study of sticklebacks exhibiting different morphs and Eda genotypes showed that individuals exhibiting full-plated alleles showed preference for a range of salinities, mainly determined by the salinities they were already acclimated to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Low-plated individuals, in contrast avoided intermediate salinities and preferred either fully marine or freshwater conditions. Whereas the precise biological significance of these differences could not be resolved, the findings are nevertheless congruent with our results showing higher dispersal of full-plated individuals along an environmental gradient. Differences in dispersal between plate morphs may therefore be a contributing factor towards the dominance of full-plated sticklebacks in the Odder River and other similar systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Contrasting results across studies</title><p>Why do we see so distinct genetic and phenotypic differences between marine and freshwater sticklebacks in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] but not in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], including the present? This question is reminiscent of the finding of both unimodal and bimodal hybrid zones within the same species, as in e.g. <italic>Triturus</italic> newt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], <italic>Corthicus</italic> grasshopper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and <italic>Bombina</italic> toads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], indicating different roles of natural selection, pre- and postzygotic barriers in different settings. We consider four possible scenarios: 1) Extinction and recent recolonization of sticklebacks in the Odder River, 2) presence or absence of fish predators, 3) the migration-selection balance and differences in migration rate between systems, 4) allopatric divergence and secondary contact in some systems but not in others.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>One obvious explanation of our results could be recent extinction of the freshwater population and recolonization by marine sticklebacks, and that adaptive divergence therefore is still in a process of establishment. However, we find it unlikely that a major extinction event should have occurred undetected. The Odder River has a large, indigenous self-sustaining population of brown trout. Although local extinction and recolonization in a few small tributaries has been recorded, the total population is stable and has never been stocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Hence, given the status of brown trout in the system there is no reason why sticklebacks should have experienced recent extinction-recolonization due to e.g. pollution events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Another possible explanation concerns differences in fish predator composition across different freshwater environments. In the Odder River the dense brown trout population may pose a significant predator pressure on sticklebacks, which should favor full-plated phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. European eel has also historically been an important fish predator in the system. Electrofishing in 1992 revealed the presence of numerous eels (Michael M. Hansen, personal observation) and the currently low number of eels likely reflects the general decline of the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. In that sense selection regimes imposed by fish predators may be quite similar in the marine and freshwater environments of the study area. This would resemble conditions in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada, where fish predators are abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In another related study, fish predators were observed in some, but not all of their study localities, and the authors did not emphasize this aspect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Even if fish predation could explain the dominance of full-plated morphs and Eda alleles in the Odder River, it remains striking that low divergence between freshwater and marine sticklebacks was a genome-wide effect, as shown by RAD sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Fish predation represents an aspect of selection regimes that could be different or similar between freshwater and marine environments, but other biotic and particularly abiotic factors would for sure be different, such as salinity. Some physiological traits under differential selection could be complex and determined by many genes, the effects of which would be difficult to demonstrate using genome scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. However, the ATP1a1 gene on Chromosome 1 is strongly involved in osmoregulation and has been found to be a marine-freshwater outlier in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Yet, RAD data from showed that differentiation is virtually zero between Nor and OddU for this genomic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The overall very low genome-wide divergence points to gene flow from marine sticklebacks overwhelming selection, but it still remains unresolved why gene flow from marine sticklebacks can overwhelm selection in some cases but not in others. A possible and testable hypothesis could simply relate to the population sizes of marine populations adjacent to freshwater habitats; larger marine population sizes could lead to higher immigration rates into freshwater populations and a stronger constraining effect on selection as opposed to smaller marine populations causing lower immigration rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Divergence between different stickleback ecotypes has been argued to represent speciation with gene flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. However, it has recently been suggested that most genomic islands of differentiation may instead reflect allopatric divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], although this has not been specifically addressed in marine-freshwater sticklebacks. If this is indeed the case, then the presence of bimodal hybrid zones observed in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] could reflect secondary contact after allo- or parapatric divergence, possibly involving prezygotic barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], that has occurred e.g. in lakes or mediated by other types of environmental heterogeneity within the systems. The Odder River system does not encompass lakes, and stickleback habitat is continuous from the river mouth to the upstream distributional limit of the species, leaving little opportunity for allo- or parapatric divergence. However, the localities in the North Sea region and the lower St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada analyzed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] comprise larger and more heterogeneous areas with ample opportunities for divergence in allo/parapatry. Yet these studies found similar low divergence between marine and freshwater sticklebacks as in the present study, which does not lend support to this hypothesis.</p><p>Nevertheless, an extended version of this scenario might be possible. It has been suggested that many instances of contact zones seemingly maintained by selection and adaptation to different environments may in fact represent endogenous genetic incompatibilities that interact with environmentally based selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The possibility of such incompatibilities increases when previously isolated groups or phylogeographic lineages make secondary contact. Coexistence and possible admixture of different phylogeographic lineages has been documented in e.g. the Pacific North-West, parts of Western Europe and Western Greenland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], thus providing potential for incompatibilities to be present. The Kattegat region, where the Odder River is situated appears to represent a single phylogeographical lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]; it would be interesting to assess if regions with pronounced bimodal hybrid zones coincide with areas of pronounced secondary contact, and if regions with low marine-freshwater divergence are characterized by phylogeographical homogeneity.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Odder River represents a system where the freshwater stickleback population is only weakly divergent from marine sticklebacks at the phenotypic and genetic levels. It is nevertheless best characterized as a unimodal hybrid zone, where gene flow from marine sticklebacks strongly constrains adaptive divergence in the freshwater environment. The system exhibits a fine-scale genetic structure and genetic patch size that renders it unlikely that marine immigrants can affect the most upstream part of the river within a single generation. Instead, the effects of gene flow occur indirectly over several generations. Even though the presence of both uni- and bimodal hybrid zones has been documented in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], freshwater and marine sticklebacks represent systems showing an almost extreme range of divergence, from weak unimodal to strong bimodal hybrid zones. Sticklebacks thus offer significant potential for understanding the factors that determine hybrid zone dynamics. In the present case, we identified unequal dispersal between different morphs as a factor that likely contributes to the dominance of full-plated morphs in the system. Among a range of factors that could lead to bimodal hybrid zones in some systems and unimodal in others, we suggest that the size of marine populations adjacent to freshwater habitats could determine immigration rates into freshwater, thereby possibly constraining effects on adaptation. We also advocate consideration of other factors than those strictly related to ecological and environmental factors, that is the possibility of secondary contact and endogenous incompatibilities in some systems and not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p>
