</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The development of chronic neural pain following tissue injuries in humans is an infrequent but disabling complication 1– 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The persistent pain usually begins gradually, continuing for months to years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Causes of soft tissue injuries include trauma 6, 7, such as industrial injuries, surgery, fractures 8, sprains, radiation, vibration, and repetitive motion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Disuse after injury or surgery also contributes to the tissue matrix stiffness, edema and pain 9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Despite a history of trauma, a trauma-specific neural lesion is seldom found in patients with neuropathic pain symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This absence of an identifiable lesion suggests the involvement of an occult lesion in the initiation and the maintenance of neuropathic pain 10, and many of these patients have been theorized to have a peripheral neural “generator” or an “ectopic” site of localized neuroinflammation 11– 18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Occult neural lesions are not usually detectable, as these patients usually do not have clinical evidence of either neural injury or physical abnormalities 10, 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Yet the persistence of pain behaviors in these individuals argues in support of a local neural activation site. In vivo peripheral nerve imaging techniques 20– 25 and diagnostics are presently being developed 26, 27; however, they cannot yet detect abnormalities in small branches of the distal peripheral nerves 10, which are the fibers most likely to be affected in soft tissue injuries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A logical cause for the gradual appearance of chronic pain following soft tissue trauma is the predictable changes that occur during the tissue repair process at the affected site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These changes involve the removal of debris, fibrosis, and the regeneration of damaged tissue, including muscle, nerve, vasculature and extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The gradual remodeling of tissue may result in nerve compression, with delayed onset of pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>One such example of the ability of minimal pressure on the nerve causing severe pain, is trigeminal neuralgia, where even micro-compression of the nerve root can cause severe pain 28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The timing of the onset of chronic neuropathic pain parallels tissue morphologic events that occur during healing and tissue remodeling of the affected area 29 ( Supplementary file S1: Tissue repair comparison chart). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that it is during tissue remodeling that an accumulation of fibrotic matrix (scarring) and possibly local edema alter the neural microenvironment and contribute to the compression of vulnerable nerve cells, resulting in focal neural injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These injuries can cause atypical matrix forces 30 resulting in abnormal function of peripheral glia and neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To test this biophysical hypothesis we have created a model of a discrete focal lesion in the rat rear limb that recreates clinical findings found in humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Presently, rodent models with neuropathic pain behaviors are created using forms of direct surgical nerve trauma or open surgery with neural irritation using chemicals, drugs, cold or heat 31, 32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The most common of these models 33– 35 use ligations, neurectomies or a combination to create pain with sensory and motor debility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>While these open surgical models are useful in mimicking direct nerve trauma, they do not reproduce the delayed onset of pain behaviors 36 without physical deformities as seen in many patients with neuropathic pain after tissue injuries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Doubts have been raised about whether or not rodents can represent the human condition in neuropathic pain because few effective analgesics have been discovered using them 1, 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We consider the social behaviors 38, tissue healing 39, 40, and the similarly evoked neural pain behaviors that humans share with rodents as confirmative to the relevance for their use in our study 41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We increased the relevance of the rodents by using those of a mature age with a biomimetic lesion 1, 42. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Our rodent model is based on clinical observations of patients treated for persistent pain that developed gradually after soft tissue injuries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>After a localizing anatomical examination for neuroinflammation, these patients were treated with targeted nerve blocks for regional neuropathic pain (MRH physician practice 1987–2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic blocks used low doses of the neuroprotective agents methylprednisolone or recombinant human erythropoietin to relieve and often resolve neural pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Our objective in developing the NeuroDigm GEL™ rodent model was to create the delayed onset of neuropathic pain with minimal nerve trauma and characterize the model’s responses to known analgesics and a targeted neuroprotective agent. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The small effects observed with the data of each individual allodynia stimulus (each of three von Frey fibers and the brush) indicated that an individual routine screening day’s mean in the GEL group could not reliably be expected to differ from the control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We were able to achieve this reliability by grouping the data in two ways: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>First, different days of testing for each stimulus could be averaged together for an individual variable, such as data for each individual von Frey fiber averaged together over 4 testing days to make a monthly average: this method was used in the allodynia and hyperalgesia line graphs ( Figure 3– Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Second, the scores for all four allodynia measurements could be averaged together to make a summary single variable, i.e., averaging data for all three von Frey fibers and the brush into a single number representing allodynia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This method was used for allodynia in the analgesic drug response bar graphs, to compare one day of pre-drug data to one day of post-drug data ( Figure 7– Figure 10). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>The nonsurgical aged NeuroDigm GEL™ model appears to translate key traits of many humans complaining of persistent neural pain by being of gradual onset, persisting for months, and lacking deformities or antalgic gait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>Our mature GEL model’s mechanical hypersensitivity responses to the analgesics studied suggest a negative predictive value for morphine and celecoxib, and a positive predictive value for gabapentin and duloxetine, similar to a meta-analysis of human studies 56. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>While the GEL™ appeared to be a moderately strong stimulus for tissue repair causing a pain response initially at 23 days ( Figure 2), the data shows that the sham fluid was a weaker stimulus for a tissue response than the gel, with the gradual consistent onset of pain behavior after 60 days in the five out of eight shams with pain ( Figure 2, Figure 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>The histological changes seen were restricted to the NeuroDigm GEL™ procedure group and are consistent with ongoing tissue remodeling in the area where the GEL was placed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>The GEL evoked changes of extraneural matrix tissue can result in nerve compression, resulting in neural remodeling with the delayed onset of pain. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>Notably, a large number of tightly packed unmyelinated fibers were within the nerves of the GEL procedure animals, consistent with regeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>The increased number of these fibers and their unusual clustered appearance raises the issues of adequate insulation and the possibility that some of the pain behavior might be due to ephaptic transmission 84– 86. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>Neural regeneration with ephaptic transmission is likely the underlying cause of both the Tinel’s sign 87, observed in some patients at sites of neural compression due to entrapment, and also the Pinch Reflex Test, found at sites of regenerating peripheral nerves in experimental rodents 88, 89. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>Such ephaptic sites of neural regeneration may also be related to a flinch jump reflex, mechanically elicitable in many neuropathic pain patients (MRH physician practice 1987–2017). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>The histology demonstrates that the neural response to the GEL procedure is restricted to a focal area of neural and axonal edema with neuroinflammation in the tibial nerve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed that the three shams (from the 5/8 with robust pain behavior) had no visible anatomic changes on histology, similar to the paclitaxel model 90. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>Our histology findings are consistent with regenerative neural remodeling found in neural biopsies of humans with persistent pain due to known nerve entrapments 87, 91, 92. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>The soft tissue reaction in our model uses the encoded response that occurs after any tissue injury in all vertebrates 93, 94, therefore, many neuropathic pain syndromes may be considered as a soft tissue disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic premise is that local injection of a mixture of biological materials typical of the extracellular matrix following tissue injury activates tissue repair processes which ultimately causes a constrictive nerve injury associated with the development of pain behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the view that traumatic injury is not involved in the development of this model must be incorrect, as the sham animals also develop pain behaviors, albeit to a lesser degree and with a delay compared to the active procedure arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biological processes involved are well schematized in Figure S1 and underscores that the involvement of both injury and repair processes in the development of the neuropathic state.  Unfortunately, pathological evaluation was performed only months after the initiating lesion, long after the acute and subacute effects of the procedure had resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the assumption that purely repair processes are involved in this model, it would be necessary to evaluate in a longitudinal manner molecular and other markers of tissue damage and repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, the presence or absence of inflammatory cells and quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the site of injection of the sciatic nerve in the days and weeks following the experimental procedure would determine to what extent inflammation is involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A better description of the pathophysiology of this model would be that of a delayed neuropathic state developing after mild peripheral nerve trauma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of general issues, the behavioral methodological details are unusually detailed and to aid readability of the manuscript, much could be moved to Supplemental Materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors are to be congratulated in following very rigorous blinding procedures for the behavioral testing which often are lacking in the published descriptions of neuropathy models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These strengthen greatly the behavioral observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A particularly interesting observation was the effect of estrogen-containing cream present on the experimenter on the pain behavior observed and further underscores the need for great care in limiting potentially confounding variables which reduce the fidelity of experimental observations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="?"><plain>In spite of the detailed description of the experimental procedures, one question arises: do the authors believe that the injection site targets only the tibial nerve? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If so, the exact testing location of the plantar surface will be important, i.e., whether in the tibial or sural nerve distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Many peripheral nerve models are characterized by sprouting from the adjacent sural distribution and this possibility needs to be evaluated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is a redundant exposition of experimental results: as just 2 examples, Figures 2 and 5 present the same data (Figure 2 is perhaps more useful for the reader) as do Figures 5-6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Streamlining the text and exposition of data, i.e. methods and results, would make the manuscript more readable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The “Summary of pain behavior” and “Conclusion” are redundant in my view. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The conclusion in the discussion that this model is one of focal peripheral nerve injury is premature, as evaluation of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia was not undertaken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The presence of contralateral behavioral findings, even within the sham group, implies that there is at the least critical spinal cord involvement in this pain model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The authors correctly point out that additional studies focusing on the central nervous system are needed to more completely define the pathophysiology of this model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of EPO-mediated pain improvement raises more questions than it answers and appears almost as an afterthought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there is not enough detail, especially at the pathological level, to confirm the effect is via “activation of repair”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The extremely fast response, occurring over a few days evidently, is not consistent with true repair which requires a much longer timespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the differentiation between local and systemic effects of EPO assumed in this study may not be correct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The dose of EPO administered (400IU/kg) is at the lower limit needed to exhibit beneficial effects in other neurological models and further, administration via the SC route would reduce the peak plasma EPO concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An intraperitoneal or intravenous route would have been preferable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Perhaps this observation would be better moved to supplementary material and speculation on the underlying biology limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this model is interesting and the very detailed methodology makes it a useful addition to the study of pharmacological treatment of pain behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The clear distinction between classes of agents used as treatment for neuropathic symptom increase optimism that the model can be useful for screening potential efficacy of new compounds or evaluating novel methods of treatment using existing pharmacotherapy. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Once established as being representative of patients, earlier studies can be done. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The paper’s main tissue focus is on the neural histology findings long after pain behaviors are established, limiting any explanation of the exact pathophysiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The hydrogel does not directly cause traumatic injury or acute inflammation in the first 14 days, as evidenced by the lack of significant pain behaviors, erythema, cyanosis, edema, or altered gait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the shams that developed late onset pain behaviors had no evidence of tissue damage on light microscopy, and may represent an obscure neural “dysfunction”. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Regarding the redundant exposition of experimental results: We agree that Figure 2 is in many ways more informative, and we used Figure 5 to provide a formal statistical analysis of the null hypothesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The EPO dose in mg/kg units is close to 300 units/kg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The systemic EPO dose was subcutaneous to limit stress, tissue damage and complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The repeat injection of EPO in 2/5 GEL rats discussed in paper suggests localized EPO placement is critical for this low dose to cause a reversal effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>You are correct in stating that this model of focal neuritis creating neuropathic pain may involve more than the discrete site on the nerve. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major concerns: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors equate responses evoked by mild mechanical stimuli (von Frey stimulation, gentle brushing, pin prick) with pain behavior and clinical pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even terms like allodynia and hyperalgesia are used to describe these responses although the paper provides no evidence that there is any pain involved in the model or that these responses are valid surrogate markers for clinically relevant pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These types of stimuli are undoubtedly useful both in psychophysical studies and quantitative sensory testing but rarely used to evaluate analgesic efficacy in clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>I would suggest using neutral, descriptive terms throughout the manuscript and bring up the translational relevance in the Discussion, taking into account the extensive literature on this topic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pharmacology is interpreted in terms of analgesia, which is questionable since there is no evidence for pain in the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The drugs used, perhaps with the exception of celecoxib in low doses, have known non-analgesic effects that may interfere with evoked responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While pharmacological characterization of a model is useful for various reasons, clinical relevance is a different matter and clinical efficacy is generally poorly predicted by animal models of neuropathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This is arguably the case here where the efficacy of the tested drugs are much more robust than the case is in well-controlled clinical trials and the order of efficacy, in spite of what is claimed, is at variance with the clinical data (for a recent, comprehensive review, see Finnerup et al 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It should be pointed out that comparing drug efficacy in single-dose experiments has limited utility, especially when pharmacokinetic data are lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Relating drug doses in this animal study to human clinical data is of course relevant but should be done in the Discussion with due reference to the many limitations of the current approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The use of literature references is in part inadequate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For instance, the short first paragraph of the introduction contains no less than 30 references and it is hard to identify the ones that may have relevance for the statements in the text. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Many of these references deal with conditions that are connected to the topic of the present study only in a general sense and it is not obvious how they may support the arguments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Since delayed development of sensory changes seems to be a main feature of the described model, specific reference to one or two key clinical papers would be helpful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It may be necessary to carefully match the text of the manuscript with the references and perhaps delete sections or statements that are not supported by literature; alternatively to reorganize the text so that speculations and personal opinions are clearly differentiated from information supported by evidence in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Specific suggestions &amp; comments Title (and in other places): The described method is referred to as “refined” but compared to what is not defined in the manuscript.Abstract: Background: The paragraph should be refocused to state the objectives / hypotheses of the study. Methods: The first sentence belongs to the Results paragraph. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Mention test methods and readouts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Some details e.g. age of rats, doses, routs of administration of drugs, would give the reader a chance of understanding what to expect from the paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Generic drug names should not be capitalized (correct in the following section). Results: As in the rest of the manuscript, avoid controversial terms like “pain behavior” and “analgesia”. Conclusion: The text is inaccurate in suggesting that there is direct evidence for pain behavior in the model and that this behavior is related to remodeling; the difference between the sham and gel treatments is mostly quantitative allowing for other interpretations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is not obvious that the effects of analgesics in the model reflect clinical efficacy.Introduction: In addition to the more general points raised above, concentrating the text on the present model into a single paragraph with a clear statement of objective may facilitate reading and sharpen focus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The text regarding relevance of animal models do not adequately address the rather extensive discussion that has been ongoing at meetings and in the literature for quite a while and the argument put forward is unspecific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>There is room for a more complete treatment in the Discussion where a number of issues relevant to the present study could be addressed, e.g. interpretation of readouts and the importance of pharmacokinetic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="?"><plain>In the introduction, perhaps pointing to the expected advantages of the present paradigm compared to previous work would suffice.Materials and methods: Bodyweight of animals also at the time of testing would be interesting. P5, left column, 4 th paragraph: How was the forces of the von Frey filaments confirmed? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Are these filaments stable under changing environmental conditions? P5, last paragraph: the meaning of the phrase “all with no change in pain behavior noted" is unclear. Some text could be deleted or moved to the discussion to provide easier reading, e.g. p5, left column, 3 rd paragraph ("Measures of …"), right column 2 nd paragraph ("The original doses ...")Results: In general, this part of the manuscript would benefit from limiting the text to what is necessary to understand the data, leaving discussion to the Discussion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Even figure legends should be edited to remove interpretations, speculations and explanation of what can be easily seen from the graphs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>All symbols should be explained in the legends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Number of animals, indication of statistical analysis (with details in methods and results), and how the means are calculated could be given in the legends and thus allow for a more succinct main text. P7 &amp; 8: “Results of behavioral data” - the first four paragraphs should be deleted or condensed and moved to the discussion (with appropriate succinct information added to the figure legends). The following paragraphs “Days of data..." could be condensed to a few descriptive sentences and the justification for various procedures moved to the discussion. I would suggest that Table 1 and associated text be moved to Supplemental material or deleted altogether; minor changes in the results may change the numbers significantly so the value of these calculations for future studies would be too limited to warrant an extensive presentation as in the present manuscript. P9, Section on von Frey: For consistency: mention the results of the GEL group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The sentence “Asterisks … “ should be moved to the figure legend (this also applies to the following sections). P10: “Individual data...”: It is difficult to see what this analysis contributes to the paper – in my view it distracts from the main findings and should be deleted or moved to Supplemental material. The following paragraph “Summary ...” is redundant; the “Factor influencing ...” is anecdotal and probably best deleted, alternatively mentioned in the Discussion. “Results of experiments...”: the information in the first paragraph fits better in other parts of the manuscript. Section on morphine: the first sentence is redundant / irrelevant. Later in the paragraph (p 11), the explanation of asterisks can be removed twice, it's adequately explained in the figure legend (same applies to text later in the Results). The last paragraph on morphine does not appear to ad value. p14: “Summary...” is redundant.Discussion: I would recommend an extensive revision of the Discussion, addressing methodological aspects and taking into account the limitations of the approach, some of which are delineated above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Careful scrutiny of the references to make sure that they are fair and representative as well as addressing the statements in the text would be another recommendation, also pertaining to the rest of the manuscript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As indicated above, there may be material in previous sections of the manuscript that would fit in the Discussion.Conclusion: Appears more as a continuation of the discussion and should be revised, preferably to reflect the objectives of the study and the initial hypotheses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Some areas were retained based on the comments of another, as in Table 1, which has the standard deviations desired by some. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The very thorough paper by Finnerup et al 2015 “Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis” (1) classifies gabapentin and duloxetine as first-line drugs for neuropathic pain with a “high quality of evidence” for both, and strong opioids as a third-line choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These analgesic classifications are supported by the findings in our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We agree that “clinical efficacy is generally poorly predicted by animal models of neuropathy” since their pathophysiology does not reflect what usually happens in patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We also consider the traditional neuropathic pain assays of mechanical hypersensitivity used for decades in research labs, that we used, to have unrecognized translational merit — as you note they are “rarely used to evaluate analgesic efficacy in clinical trials”, but should be considered in our estimation. </plain></SENT>
