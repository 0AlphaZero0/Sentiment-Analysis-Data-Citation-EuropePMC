The role of VMAT2 in histaminergic neurotransmission is poorly understood. We studied the structure and function of the histaminergic system in larval zebrafish following inhibition of VMAT2 function by reserpine. We found that reserpine treatment greatly reduced histamine immunoreactivity in neurons and an almost total disappearance of histamine-containing nerve fibers in the dorsal telencephalon and habenula, the most densely innervated targets of the hypothalamic histamine neurons. The reserpine treated larvae had an impaired histamine-dependent dark-induced flash response seen during the first second after onset of darkness, implying that function of the histaminergic network is VMAT2 dependent. Levels of histamine and other monoamines were decreased in reserpine treated animals. This study provides conclusive evidence of the relevance of VMAT2 in histaminergic neurotransmission, further implying that the storage and release mechanism of neural histamine is comparable to that of other monoamines. Our results also reveal potential new insights about the roles of monoaminergic neurotransmitters in the regulation of locomotion increase during adaptation to darkness.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The function of most monoamine neurotransmitters is dependent on the vesicular release made possible by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Serotonin and dopamine are loaded into secretory vesicles by VMAT2, and inhibition of VMAT2 leads to rapid depletion of these neurotransmitters through metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Since noradrenaline is synthesized from dopamine inside secretory vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, VMAT2 inhibition also lowers noradrenaline levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. VMAT2 inhibition by the indole alkaloid reserpine was previously used as a treatment for psychotic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Depression has often been reported as a side-effect of reserpine treatment, which was a key factor in the development of the monoamine depletion theory of depressive disorders and the reserpine treated animal model for depression, although the monoamine hypothesis has recently been challenged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings underline the significance of monoamine dependent neurotransmission in brain physiology.</p><p>The role of VMAT2 in histaminergic neurotransmission remains unclear. Like the other monoamines, histamine has been described as a substrate for VMAT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, histamine storage is controlled by reserpine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and reserpine induces changes in vesicle morphology and subcellular distribution of histamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, histamine is not known to be significantly metabolized by MAO, but is rather metabolized by histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) in the brain, followed by subsequent metabolism by MAO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In an explant culture from fetal rat hypothalamus, most histamine-immunoreactive neurons display VMAT2-immunoreactivity, with some neurons showing no VMAT2-immunoreactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Studies on the effect of reserpine on brain histamine have yielded mixed results. In the cat and mouse a decrease in brain histamine has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, while another study in mice and experiments in the rat have shown histamine levels to be largely unchanged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Reserpine has also been shown to inhibit L-histidine induced increase in brain histamine in rats and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The interpretation of these previous studies is complicated by the presence of extraneural histamine in brain mast cells, which contributes to histamine content in some brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A recent study in mast cell deficient mutant rats revealed histamine levels to be unchanged, while the levels of its main metabolite tele-methylhistamine were decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The same study also showed an increase in the activity of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the rate-limiting enzyme for histamine biosynthesis. The zebrafish lacks extraneuronal histamine, and is thus an optimal model for the study of the neurochemistry of histamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>The effects of reserpine on all monoamines, in particular the histaminergic neurons, genes associated with monoamine system and associated motor behaviours in the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were addressed in this study. We hypothesized that if neural histamine storage is VMAT2 dependent, reserpine should cause a decrease in brain histamine levels and histamine immunoreactivity. Also, histamine-dependent brain functions should be impaired.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioural phenotype after reserpine treatment</title><p>Both the 20&#8201;min and 24&#8201;h reserpine treatments (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for treatment setup) decreased the total distance moved observed during a 15&#8201;min tracking with lights on 24&#8201;h and 72&#8201;h after administration of reserpine (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, H(2)&#8201;=&#8201;23.9 <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001 and e, F(2,141)&#8201;=&#8201;22.07 <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001).

</p><p>When the light was turned off for a 2&#8201;min dark phase, all fish reacted with an increased locomotor activity; a behavioural pattern that has been previously described for normal larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. At 24&#8201;h after administering reserpine, the increase in activity during the dark phase was much stronger in reserpine treated fish compared with controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, 2-way ANOVA interaction effect F(22,1551)&#8201;=&#8201;24.91 <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). At 72&#8201;h after treatment, the magnitude of the increase in locomotion activity observed was more similar across groups (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

We have previously shown this dark-induced flash response to be histamine dependent, as knock-down of histamine synthesis and inhibition of histamine receptor H1 mediated signaling abolish this response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This dark-induced flash response was analyzed at each of the three light-dark transitions during the trial. 24&#8201;h after administration of reserpine the first dark-induced flash response was intact in both treatment groups, although its magnitude was significantly reduced in the group that was treated for 24&#8201;h (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Tukey&#8217;s <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0108 for the 24&#8201;h group).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that histamine immunoreactivity in the brain was strongly diminished by reserpine treatment both in neuronal cell bodies and, more importantly, their projections in key target areas in the dorsal telencephalon and habenula. This intraneuronal histamine represents the neurotransmitter pool of histamine, and thus its depletion should functionally impair histaminergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, the immunoreactivity in cell bodies was not uniformly diminished, with some cells retaining a clear cytoplasmic immunoreactivity and some cells showing a completely negative staining. Muroi <italic>et al</italic>. suggested the possibility of separate reserpine-sensitive and reserpine-resistant pools of histamine in neurons, with the reserpine-resistant pool being larger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A relative sparing of immunoreactivity in some neurons could support this hypothesis to some extent, with the neurons showing a retained immunoreactivity being also more resistant to reserpine. Interestingly, the number of neurons preserved was similar in both treatment groups and all time points observed, with the number of cells showing clear histamine immunoreactivity decreased by about 40% following reserpine treatment. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the reason for this heterogeneity. We found that all <italic>hdc</italic> mRNA positive neurons express <italic>vmat2</italic> mRNA. There is evidence of <italic>vmat1</italic> expression in the developing rat brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, we also investigated the possibility that <italic>vmat1</italic> might be expressed in a subset of histaminergic neurons. However, we saw no expression of <italic>vmat1</italic> in the zebrafish brain at this stage using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We therefore suggest that it is unlikely that the sparing of immunoreactivity in some histaminergic neurons would be explained by these neurons coexpressing another transporter. Our study presents strong data to support the hypothesis that histamine storage in neurons is VMAT2-dependent.</p><p>Our chromatographical data generally showed decreased levels of histamine, which is in agreement with the earlier chromatographic analyses of brain histamine after reserpine treatment in different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. More recent studies have reported unaltered histamine levels, but even in these cases reserpine treatment significantly lowered the levels of histamine metabolites and inhibited pharmacologically induced increases in histamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We also detected greatly decreased levels of other monoamines, which were lower than those found in VMAT2-heterozygous fish and of the same magnitude as those found in several other reserpine treated animal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The chromatographic analysis of brain histamine in rodents is complicated by the presence of histamine in mast cells. The study by Maldonado &amp; Maeyama accounted for this effect by using mutant rats lacking mast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The zebrafish lacks mast cell histamine, showing immunoreactivity only in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. An inherent weakness of chromatographic measurements is the inability to localize histamine to the actual neurons, and thus histamine levels in brain tissue samples might not accurately reflect the amount of histamine stored in neurons. This might to some degree explain the different results obtained in previous studies. In our study, the neural depletion was verified by histamine immunohistochemistry. As we measured the catecholamine and serotonin levels from whole larval homogenates, the observed decreases might also reflect changes in monoamine levels in other organs besides the brain. However, as <italic>vmat2</italic> in zebrafish is primarily expressed in the aminergic regions of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, it is likely that the effects on monoamines seen after vmat2 inhibition by reserpine would primarily reflect changes in the brain. However, as vmat2 has also been described to have functional roles in the peripheral nervous system in many species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, it is plausible that some of the effects observed reflect changes in the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>The increase in locomotion we observed during the short dark phase has been previously described by Burgess <italic>et al</italic>. as a form of dark adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The neural circuitry that initiates this behaviour is largely unknown, although Burgess <italic>et al</italic>. showed that dark-induced increases in locomotion were not dependent on the function of the Mauthner cells known to initiate rapid escape reactions in the zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We found that reserpine treatment significantly increased the magnitude of the dark-induced increase in locomotion at 24&#8201;h after administration of reserpine, which suggests that the circuitry regulating this response is negatively regulated by brain monoamines. In other animal models, reserpine has been shown to induce anxiety-like behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, although this effect has not been seen in all studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The dark-induced short-lasting hyperactivity has been suggested to represent shelter seeking behaviour after nightfall or a reaction to find a way back to light after sudden onset of darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In nature, such a situation could be caused by an approaching predator that casts a shade on the fish. The increased magnitude of this response may therefore represent a form of increased anxiety. A recent study showed that VMAT2-heterozygous zebrafish have increased dark-avoidance and an anxiety-like phenotype in the novel tank test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Recently, a group of reticulospinal (RS) neurons located in the nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) were identified as key modulators of locomotion velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. As this area also displays innervation by monoamine systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, it is possible that the neural mechanism behind the increased locomotion during a dark cue in reserpine treated fish is due to decreased modulation of the nMLF due to acute monoamine depletion. It is known that dopamine negatively modulates the initiation of locomotion and movement in larval zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. A study on the role of noradrenaline in sleep found that noradrenaline-lacking <italic>dbh</italic> knock-out zebrafish display a decreased arousal threshold for tapping stimuli, implying that noradrenaline negatively regulates locomotor responses to sudden stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Further studies will be needed in order to discover the exact monoamine network in question.</p><p>Although the general locomotion during the sudden dark phase was increased in the treated animals, the dark-induced flash response observed during the first second of darkness was progressively weakened during the days following reserpine treatment, and the flash response was absent in repeated light-dark transitions. In a previous study by our group, we showed that this flash response is strongly histamine-dependent and mediated by histamine receptor H1, as knockdown of histamine synthesis and pharmacological inhibition of histamine receptor H1 abolish this response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The weakened flash response observed could therefore be explained by the reserpine induced depletion of neural histamine. Our results also suggest that the underlying neural circuitry regulating the general increased locomotion following sudden darkness and the flash response during the first second of darkness is different. Ahrens <italic>et al</italic>. discovered that certain neurons in areas of the dorsal telencephalon and habenula respond to the fish being in either light or darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The dorsal telencephalon and habenula are the main targets of histamine neurons and strongly express histamine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting a histaminergic regulation of these light and dark responding neurons either directly or through local interneurons. In a recent study, serotonin has also been implicated to regulate dark avoidance behaviour in zebrafish larvae. Certain <italic>tph2</italic> expressing serotonergic neurons show high activity in darkness and inhibition of their function reduces dark avoidance behaviour in larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, our results would suggest that serotonin is not responsible for an increased locomotion in darkness, as serotonin levels were generally decreased in the reserpine treated larvae. The precise role of other monoamine systems than histamine in the regulation of the dark-induced flash response has yet to be determined.</p><p>After discovering that brain histamine levels are lowered by reserpine, we hypothesized that this might result in an upregulation of histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), the protein responsible for histamine synthesis. This idea is supported by earlier studies indicating that brain Hdc activity is increased in reserpinized mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We found, however, that <italic>hdc</italic> mRNA levels were completely unaltered in all reserpine treatment groups 72&#8201;h after the administration of reserpine. Interestingly, <italic>tyrosine hydroxylase 1</italic> (<italic>th1</italic>), <italic>tryptophan hydroxylase 1a</italic> (<italic>tph1a</italic>) and <italic>dopamine beta-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>dbh</italic>), the enzymes encoding the rate-limiting steps in the biosynthesis of dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, respectively, were significantly upregulated, implying that monoamine depletion stimulates synthesis of the other monoamines at the transcriptional level. This suggests that the increased Hdc activity observed in reserpinized mice might be due to post-translational modification of the enzyme rather than activation of <italic>hdc</italic> transcription. Again, as whole larvae were used to obtain the mRNA samples, the changes in gene expression observed might reflect transcriptional changes in both the peripheral and central nervous system, as discussed previously in the context of the HPLC results.</p><p>Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that histaminergic neurotransmission is inhibited by treatment with reserpine, showing an almost total depletion of histamine fiber immunoreactivity following reserpine treatment. The reduction in the histamine-dependent dark-flash response suggests that this depletion is functionally relevant. We thus suggest that the storage of neuronal histamine and histaminergic neurotransmission is VMAT2 dependent, and that histamine storage and release in neurons works through a similar vesicular mechanism as observed for other monoamine neurotransmitters. Our results also implicate an inhibitory role of the monoaminergic network in the increased locomotion occurring during dark adaptation, a mechanism requiring further studies using fish strains deficient of specific monoamine receptors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Larvae of the wild-type Turku strain of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were used in all experiments.

The probes were detected using anti-DIG-AP Fab-fragments (RRID: AB_514497, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the chromogenic color reaction was developed using NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium chloride) and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Microscopy and imaging</title><p>All fluorescent images were acquired using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) using a 488&#8201;nm argon laser, a 561&#8201;nm diode laser and a 633&#8201;nm helium/neon laser for fluorophore excitation. The emission ranges were selected at 500&#8211;550&#8201;nm, 570&#8211;622&#8201;nm and 650&#8211;750&#8201;nm, respectively. Cross-talk between the channels was excluded by sequential scanning and controlling that no bleed-through occurred using single fluorophore samples. The whole brain was visualized for cell counting using a HC PL APO 20x/0.70 CS objective, and close-up images were taken using a HC PL APO 40x/0.75 CS objective. Image stacks were analyzed and cells counted using Fiji software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and cell counting was performed blinded to the sample group.</p><p>Chromogenic samples were imaged using a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope. All samples were imaged using the same exposure settings. Scalebars were added to the images using Fiji software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Numerical data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#8217;s post-hoc test in Graph Pad Prism 7 software (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The time-nested behaviour data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#8217;s post-hoc test. In situations where variance between groups was significantly different as assessed by Bartlett&#8217;s test, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used instead of one-way ANOVA. Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn&#8217;s post hoc test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> of multiple comparisons were computed using R version 3.3.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Sample sizes used were estimated in accordance with our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and each <italic>n</italic> represents an independent experimental unit.
