The subtypes of nAChR are defined by their &#945;- and &#946;-subunit composition. The &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3 nAChR subtype is expressed in terminals of dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens and striatum and modulate dopamine release in brain regions involved in nicotine addiction. Although subtype-dependent selectivity of nicotine is well documented, subtype-selective profiles of other tobacco product constituents are largely unknown and could be essential for understanding the addiction-related neurological effects of tobacco products. We describe the development and validation of a recombinant cell line expressing human &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> nAChR for screening and profiling assays in an automated patch clamp platform (IonWorks Barracuda). The cell line was pharmacologically characterized by subtype-selective and nonselective reference agonists, pore blockers, and competitive antagonists. Agonist and antagonist effects detected by the automated patch clamp approach were comparable to those obtained by conventional electrophysiological assays. A pilot screen of a library of Food and Drug Administration&#8211;approved drugs identified compounds, previously not known to modulate nAChRs, which selectively inhibited the &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> subtype.

In the brain, nAChRs on presynaptic terminals modulate neurotransmitter release, and postsynaptic nAChRs depolarize neuronal membranes and can produce a calcium influx sufficient for activation of second messenger systems. Central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system&#8211;specific nAChR subtypes are defined primarily by their &#945;- and &#946;-subunit composition, which determines their pharmacological characteristics, including their selectivity to specific agonists and antagonists, as well as their biophysical properties such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion permeability and response kinetics. A nicotinic cholinergic component has been identified in several neurological conditions as well as tobacco addiction. For instance, &#945;4&#946;2 and &#945;7 subtypes are widely distributed in the brain and have been investigated on the basis of interest in tobacco addiction and cognitive deficit, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> By contrast, &#945;6* (where * denotes the inclusion of additional subunits) has a more restricted distribution, primarily in retina and catecholaminergic nuclei (e.g., locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area). The &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3 nAChR subtype, in particular, is expressed in terminals of dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens and striatum, where it modulates dopamine release in brain regions involved in nicotine addiction.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Despite its emerging physiological significance, &#945;6* receptors have been difficult targets to investigate as compared with other nAChR subtypes, in part because of poor in vitro performance in heterologous expression systems.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This limitation has been partially overcome by molecular engineering of the receptor proteins to create chimeric and/or mutated subunits with improved functional expression in cells. In particular, cell lines were previously created containing a chimeric &#945;6/&#945;3 subunit in which the &#945;6 extracellular N-terminal domain (a major determinant of ACh binding) is linked to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the &#945;3 subunit (including pore-lining segment).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> When cotransfected with cDNAs encoding &#946;2 and &#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> (valine to serine mutation cRNAs, located in the pore-lining region of &#946;3, that promotes function), the resulting &#945;6/&#945;3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> receptor generated ionic current in response to ACh, which could be inhibited by &#945;-conotoxin MII (a selective competitive antagonist of native &#945;6&#946;2* receptors).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, &#945;6/&#945;3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> recapitulates the native &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3 function in regard to the ligand-binding site. However, high-throughput patch clamp techniques suitable for screening and profiling have not yet been applied to the engineered &#945;6* receptors.

CHRNB3 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 with G418 resistance, and CHRNB2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1-hygro by standard molecular biology methods. The CHRNB3 sequence was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to change the codon encoding the amino acid at position 273 from valine to serine. To construct the chimeric CHRNA6/CHRNA3 cDNA, the 5&#8242; segment of CHRNA6 and 3&#8242; segment of CHRNA3 were amplified by PCR and ligated into pcDNA3.1-puro.

By contrast, the synthetic compound varenicline and the related, plant-derived cytisine behaved as partial agonists in line with the known characteristics of these compounds on &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup>.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Antagonist validation included mecamylamine, dihydro-&#946;-erythroidine, bupropion, SR 16584, and methyllycaconitine.

In single-point screening, we successfully detected known nicotinic agonists including nicotine, ACh, and varenicline, but novel agonists were not identified in this screen. From known antagonists that were detected in the initial screen, we selected five compounds for additional receptor subtype profiling. These included four from the Enzo library of drugs (bupropion, imipramine, mecamylamine, and pancuronium) and methyllycaconitine, a positive control. This group included both competitive inhibitors acting at the orthosteric ligand-binding site and noncompetitive inhibitors acting at allosteric sites to modulate receptor activity by one or more mechanisms such as voltage-dependent pore blockade and channel gating modulation. Methyllycaconitine<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and pancuronium<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> act as competitive inhibitors that displace agonists and show decreased affinity at elevated agonist concentrations. By contrast, noncompetitive inhibitors, which exhibit potencies independent of agonist concentration, are thought to act by a variety of mechanisms including open-channel (e.g., mecamylamine), closed-channel (e.g., imipramine), or channel state&#8211;independent blockade (e.g., bupropion).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Based on preservation of the &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3 ligand-binding site in the &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> construct, we hypothesized that competitive inhibitors would show the greatest degree of selectivity compared with the other subtypes, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors would show little selectivity between &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> and related receptor subtypes that included &#945;3 (i.e., &#945;3&#946;4 and &#945;3&#946;4&#945;5) or &#946;2 (i.e., &#945;4&#946;2) subunits. This expectation was supported by results that showed that bupropion and imipramine, antidepressants with known nicotinic receptor inhibitory effects, and mecamylamine, an antihypertensive ganglionic blocker, were relatively nonselective between the receptor subtypes. Compared with &#945;3&#946;4, &#945;3&#946;4&#945;5, and &#945;4&#946;2, however, &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> showed higher sensitivity to the muscle relaxant pancuronium and to the positive control, methyllycaconitine. Moreover, for these two compounds, &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> showed much less sensitivity than the unrelated &#945;7 subtype.</p><p>In addition to known inhibitors, the group of 33 actives included two compounds, epinastine and pentamidine, with novel subtype-selective effects not previously reported. In selectivity profiling experiments, these compounds showed submicromolar potency against &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> and modest levels of selectivity. Although not previously identified as a nicotinic receptor antagonist, epinastine, an anti-allergenic drug that acts as a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and N-type calcium channels<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> at micromolar concentrations. Also, pentamidine, an anti-infective drug, shows evidence of ion channel modulating activity, including potent inhibition of ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptors<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and proton-activated ASIC channels.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Compared with related subtypes (&#945;3&#946;4, &#945;3&#946;4&#945;5, and &#945;4&#946;2), &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> showed selectivity for epinastine ranging from 6.9-fold greater potency versus &#945;4&#946;2 to 2.6-fold versus &#945;3&#946;4&#945;5. Similarly, pentamidine was selective for &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> by a ratio of 5.8-fold versus &#945;4&#946;2 to 2.0-fold versus &#945;3&#946;4&#945;5. This pattern of selectivity is consistent with activity against the orthosteric ligand-binding site on &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup>, but additional work would be necessary to establish a competitive mechanism of action. By contrast, compared with the unrelated &#945;7 subtype, &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> showed little selectivity, 1.9-fold and 0.3-fold, respectively, for epinastine and pentamidine.</p><p>It is interesting that in patients, epinastine plasma levels (C<sub>max</sub>) can reach ~0.1 &#181;M,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> well within range of the &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> concentration-response (epinastine IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.5 &#181;M). However, epinastine crosses the blood-brain barrier with efficiency of only ~10%, lessening the significance for generating CNS side effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Similarly, pentamidine can reach micromolar plasma concentrations (~1.8 &#181;M),<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> but its efficiency in crossing the blood-brain barrier is quite low (~0.04%),<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2472555217696794" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> making CNS side effects via &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.52 &#181;M) or &#945;7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.15 &#181;M) unlikely.</p><p>In conclusion, our validation experiments with reference compounds demonstrated the capability of the test system for evaluating concentration-dependent &#945;6/3&#946;2&#946;3<sup>V273S</sup> modulation in a functional, 384-well patch clamp platform. Moreover, the capability of the assay to identify potent, subtype-selective inhibitors was verified in pilot library screening and profiling experiments. Therefore, we suggest that the high-throughput automated patch clamp tool described in this investigation will be a valuable method for evaluation of nicotinic subtype selectivity. This investigative tool advances tobacco regulatory science as it provides a rapid screening method to identify tobacco product constituents that act at &#945;6&#946;2&#946;3 nicotinic receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Material.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1333" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplementary material is available online with this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors acknowledge funding from the United States Food and Drug Administration HHSF223201510026C and HHSF223201310070C.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2472555217696794"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
