Indeed, AMPs have presented great potential toward pathogenic bacterial strains by means of complex mechanisms of action. However, reports have increasingly emerged regarding the mechanisms by which bacteria resist AMP administration. In this context, we performed a comparative proteomic study by using the total bacterial lysate of magainin I-susceptible and &#8211;resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. After nanoUPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> analyses we identified 742 proteins distributed among the experimental groups, and 25 proteins were differentially expressed in the resistant strains. Among them 10 proteins involved in bacterial resistance, homeostasis, nutrition and protein transport were upregulated, while 15 proteins related to bacterial surface modifications, genetic information and &#946;-lactams binding-protein were downregulated. Moreover, 60 exclusive proteins were identified in the resistant strains, among which biofilm and cell wall formation and multidrug efflux pump proteins could be observed. Thus, differentially from previous studies that could only associate single proteins to AMP bacterial resistance, data here reported show that several metabolic pathways may be related to <italic>E. coli</italic> resistance to AMPs, revealing the crucial role of multiple &#8220;omics&#8221; studies in order to elucidate the global molecular mechanisms involved in this resistance.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The abusive usage of antibiotics has been considered one of the most important factors that has led to the emergence, positive selection and dissemination of bacterial pathogens resistant to a wide variety of conventional antibiotics applied in animal and human therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria have been commonly associated with nosocomial infections in healthcare units. However, even considering the pharmacological and social importance of both groups, the Gram-negative bacteria from clinical isolates have demonstrated an impressive increase antibiotic resistance, mainly the Enterobacteriaceae members such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, which have been related to 95% of infections in healthcare units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Bacteria have demonstrated diverse biological mechanisms of resistance, which are divided into intrinsic (natural) or acquired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among them we can cite the direct action of &#946;-lactamase, as well as modified bacterial enzymes in the inactivation of cephalosporin, penicillin, aminoglycosides, gentamicin and streptomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In Gram-negative bacteria, studies have shown mechanisms that target the way the drugs are transported, including the selective activity of porins, drug penetration blockage and efflux pumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, in resistant bacteria the existence has been reported of multi-resistant regions composed of mobile elements such as integrons and transposons, which, once combined, can contribute actively to bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">One of the proposed strategies to avoid the bacterial resistance phenomenon includes the usage of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These well-known multifunctional molecules have been widely prospected from several organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, also acting as mother molecules for rational design approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, AMPs have gained more and more attention due to their efficacy in inhibiting multidrug-resistant strains by complex mechanisms of action involving membrane destabilization and disruption, interference in several biosynthetic pathways, generation of reactive oxygen species and enzyme inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Among AMPs is the cathelicidin family, including 30 members such as cecropin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, bactenecins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and magainins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Magainins, the object of our study, are cationic, amphipathic helical peptides, with 23 amino acid residues in length, which were first isolated from the African frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These peptides are divided into two subfamilies encoded by the same gene, denominated magainin I and magainin II, which differ in their primary sequence at positions 10 and 22 (Gly<sup>10</sup> and Lys<sup>17</sup> for magainins I; Lys<sup>10</sup> and Asp<sup>17</sup> for magainins II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that magainins mainly interact with negatively charged acidic phospholipids, which are more characteristic of prokaryotic membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies have related that magainin&#8217;s amphiphilic &#945;-helical structure can form ion-permeable channels, resulting in membrane depolarization, irreversible cytolysis and finally leading to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Allied to such properties, magainin peptide analogues (e.g. pexiganan&#174;, an antibacterial drug) represent a select group of AMPs, with more than 1,158 patents deposited in the US Patent Ful-Text Database Boolean Search server. This group of AMPs were evaluated in advanced clinical trials and submitted for the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus revealing the importance behind bacterial resistance to these cathelicidin members.</p><p id="Par5">Although the above-mentioned AMPs seem to be promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics we cannot discard the fact that studies have already shown that bacteria are able to respond to AMPs by different strategies. Among them is the expression of extracellular proteins such as metallo-, serine- and cysteine proteinases involved in AMP degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, the expression of exopolymers such as polysaccharide intracellular adhesin (PIA) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) has been described as a strategy to capture or repel AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It was observed that nontypeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> Gram-negative strains can express Sap (sensitivity antimicrobial peptides) ABC transporters to resist <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> AMP treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, it has been suggested that a series of Sap transporters may act in a potassium-dependent manner in order to deliver AMPs to the bacterial cytoplasm for further intracellular degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Since the first contact with the bacterial membranes is one of the initial steps for AMP action, some strains have also evolved the capacity of modifying the physicochemical properties of their surfaces and cytoplasmic membrane, preventing AMP electrostatic binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, even when AMPs have overcome the initial physical barriers (cell wall and membranes), reaching the intracellular environment, resistant bacteria are able to expel them by efficient efflux pumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, so far, although such mechanisms of resistance have been elucidated, only a few works have explored the molecular networks involving omics technologies in order to explain the development of resistance to AMPs.</p><p id="Par6">We have previously reported the evaluation of the cytosolic subproteome of magainin I-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains by 2D electrophoresis allied to tandem mass spectrometry <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing. However, in addition to this approach, the usage of high-throughput strategies such as nanoUPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> has been reported in the literature as an important technique used to trace the global functional profile of bacteria, allowing us to analyze how these microorganisms are able to trace routes in order to escape from antimicrobial agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, here we focused on a deep comparative nanoUPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> analysis by using the total lysate extract from <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that are susceptible and resistant to the AMP magainin I, evaluating the differential expressed, as well as exclusive proteins in order to shed some light on the global molecular mechanisms involved in this resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protein identification and classification</title><p id="Par7">The proteins from the total bacterial lysate of <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 8739), control magainin I-susceptible (C1-3) and -resistant (R1-3) strains were obtained according to the experimental procedure previously described in the methodology section. After strain selection, a total proteinaceous yield of 24&#8211;29&#8201;mg was obtained.

With that in mind, here we reported a comparative proteomic study between <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that are susceptible and resistant to the well-studied AMP magainin-I. After induction of resistance, as well as molecular identification of resistant strains, the total bacterial lysates were submitted to nanoUPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> analyses. A total of 742 proteins were identified, 73% being related to bacterial metabolism. Also, 407 proteins were common to all groups studied. Moreover, from the 587 proteins shared by magainin I-susceptible and &#8211;resistant strains, 25 proteins could be identified with differential expression patterns, and 10 were upregulated (3 uncharacterized) and 15 downregulated (2 uncharacterized). Furthermore, 60 proteins were found to be exclusive to magainin I-resistant strains.</p><p id="Par13">Among the upregulated proteins, three were characterized as outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and three as periplasmic transport proteins involved in bacterial resistance, homeostasis and nutrition. The OMPs were here represented by OmpW, OmpC and OmpF. This class of proteins has been well described as porins responsible for creating a size-selective channel in order to transport small hydrophilic molecules, including some classes of antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In <italic>E. coli</italic> the presence of OmpC and OmpF has been related to the resistance of this strain to &#946;-lactams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Also, some studies have shown that OmpW, when associated with the small multidrug resistance protein member (EmrE), facilitates the efflux of toxic quaternary cationic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in contrast to what we observed in our work, some studies have reported that a downregulation in the major pore proteins, including OmpC, OmpF and OmpW, favors bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, works regarding <italic>E. coli</italic> porin expression have revealed that OmpW and OmpC were upregulated in tetracycline and nalidixic acid resistant strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. All these findings might indicate an antibiotic-specific pattern of porin expression, which can also be associated with bacterial resistance to different classes of AMPs.</p><p id="Par14">An oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) was also upregulated. OppA is located at the periplasmic space and participates in different biological processes including oligopeptide and protein transport, as well as response to heat. Studies performed with clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> (K12) have shown that decreasing the levels of OppA or inducing its depletion leads to this strain becoming resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, more recently, it was reported that two different members from the aminoglycoside class, amikacin and neomycin, might contribute differentially in the expression level of OppA in <italic>E. coli-</italic>resistant strains, where the first induces the downregulation and the second the upregulation of this protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Due to these divergent data, two hypotheses have appeared, suggesting that a downregulation of OppA might hinder the entrance of antibiotics, leading to resistance, or that its upregulation probably facilitates the transport of antimicrobial agents to the cytosol for proteolytic degradation. The latter hypothesis has been more accepted in the field of AMPs, including in our work, where different ABC transporters are described to participate in the proteolytic pathway of these molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">A zinc resistance-associated periplasmic protein (ZraP) was also found to be upregulated in our magainin I-resistant strains. ZraP is produced in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and it is also associated with envelope homeostasis, as well as chaperon and regulatory functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Studies have also highlighted the importance of ZraP in bacterial strains submitted to envelope stress, sometimes caused by the presence of bactericidal agents such as AMPs. When pore-forming AMPs (eg. magainin) display their activities on bacterial surfaces, an increase in the production of ZraP is expected in order to maintain the periplasmic space homeostasis, providing an optimal environment for other resistance-related enzymes and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, such stress response due to antibiotic/AMP presence has also been shown to induce magainin I-resistant strains to invest in proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as the maltose operon protein (MalM), which was also upregulated in this study. MalM is poorly studied and its function is as yet unclear. However, it is known that MalM is expressed as a part of the <italic>malK-lamB</italic> operon, perhaps acting as a carbohydrate transporter and, thus, assisting bacterial nutrition during stress conditions, in this case, magainin I presence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Among the downregulated proteins, seven could be distributed into biological pathways, where three participate in the phospholipid metabolism and four in the processing of genetic information. Those related with phospholipids were divided into two classes of enzymes, a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ), and two cytosolic anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GlpA and GlpB). One of the strategies that bacteria adopt to escape from AMPs is modifying the physicochemical surface properties, affecting AMP attachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This modification may be intermediated by the acetylation of phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In this situation GlpQ appears, which is capable of hydrolyzing deacylated phospholipids into glycerol-3-phosphate and alcohol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Allied to that, in the intracellular environment GlpA and GlpB, jointly with GlpC, form the enzymatic complex (GlpA/B/C/) responsible for converting dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glycerol-3-phosphate, a precursor in the synthesis of phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, reports have shown that differential expression of GlpQ, GlpA and GlpB assists the modification and distribution of phospholipids within bacterial membranes, also favoring bacterial resistance to AMPs and antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in the case of pore-forming AMPs, including magainin I, such membrane modifications are of great importance, since they can divert these molecules away from their main target.</p><p id="Par17">In addition to cytosolic GlpA and GlpB, we also identified the biological pathways for a chaperone protein DnaK, a glutaminase 1 (glsA1), a glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB) and a NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (WrbA). As reported in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, here we also observed alterations in the patterns of expression of DnaK in a non-stress environment. DnaK is involved in several biological processes, including DNA replication, response to heat, and protein folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Moreover, the levels of DnaK have been evaluated in different works regarding bacterial exposure to antimicrobial agents, also indicating the crucial role of this protein for bacterial survival under stress conditions due to its ability to capture protein aggregates accumulated in bacteria during antibiotic/AMP treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Also, in response to stress, bacteria can produce NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (WrbA), which is supposed to reduce quinones into their hydroquinone states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. This reaction prevents the interactions between semiquinones and O<sub>2</sub>, also avoiding the formation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, which are toxic to bacterial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. In addition, the alteration in the expression of a glutaminase 1 (GlsA1) also indicates bacterial adaptation after AMP exposure. Indeed, GlsA1 is known to catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of L-glutamine in L-glutamate and NH<sup>4+</sup>&#8201;
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Besides, it has been reported that glutaminases (eg. GlsA) belong to the group of serine &#946;-lactams and penicillin-binding proteins and, for this reason, represent an important class of molecules in the advent of bacterial resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Carbon is an essential compound for the biosynthesis of several bacterial molecules, including those in response to antibiotics/AMPs. Here, the differential expression of a glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB) was also observed. Studies have shown that NagB is able to catalyze the deamination and isomerization of D-glucosamine-6-phosphate reversely into D-fructose 6-phosphate and an ammonium ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in <italic>E. coli</italic> strains it was found that NagB is activated by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phophate, further participating in the catabolism of amino sugar, facilitating the use of glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as carbon sources by bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Finally, downregulated proteins that could not be allocated in any biological pathways in our analyses may be involved in amino acid degradation, copper export, DNA protection and transcriptional regulator. Moreover, 60 exclusive proteins were identified in the magainin I-resistant strains, mostly related with metabolism and processing of genetic information. Among them, it is important to highlight the presence of proteins related to biofilm formation (YoaB) and cell wall formation (DblB). Biofilms are of great concern nowadays, representing 65 to 85% of all human infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Also, it has been proved that bacteria in their biofilm state may present 100 to 1000-fold increased resistance to antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The presence of a biofilm-related protein (YoaB) in our magainin I-resistant strains clearly demonstrates an adaptive strategy to escape from magainin I by improving physical and chemical barriers. The peptidoglycan layer also consists of a physical barrier that bacteria developed for their defense. The protein D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (DblB) is an enzyme involved in the production of one of the components of peptidoglycan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. DblB was here identified as exclusive to magainin I-resistant strains. In the case of AMPs overcoming bacterial physical barriers, bacteria can also express efflux pump proteins in order to expel AMPs from the periplasmic and cytosolic spaces. Here a multidrug efflux pump subunit (AcrA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> was also exclusive to magainin I-resistant strains, once more indicating how complex and diverse the mechanisms of resistance are that bacteria adopt in response to AMPs.</p><p id="Par20">Differentially from previous studies that only associated single proteins with bacterial resistance to AMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the exploratory data here reported, using protein identification and quantitative assessment (Log(e) ratio and variance), suggest that several metabolic pathways may be related to <italic>E. coli</italic> resistance to AMPs. These data provide global molecular information that could further support biochemical studies of the resistance-related proteins identified. In general, the bacterial response observed here illustrates the process of adaptive resistance present in an environment that is non-hostile to bacterial growth conditions, such as ideal conditions of temperature, pH, source of nutrition, aeration and without the negative pressure of AMPs. Furthermore, we have shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> resistant to magainin I developed a complex and diversified molecular mechanism of adaptations and bacterial defense, also indicating that the mechanism of action of this peptide appears to be much more complex than just the interference in the stability of the bacterial cell membrane. Moreover, it is important to highlight the relevance and urgency for more studies that involve analyses using proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics in order to further elucidate the complete panel of bacterial resistance to AMPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Magainin I synthesis</title><p id="Par21">The peptide magainin I was purchased from Peptide 2.0 Incorporated (USA) at 95% purity (after TFA removal) by the stepwise solid-phase method using the N-9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry on a Rink amide resin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p id="Par22">

In addition, the entire experiment was also performed in the absence of magainin I as a negative control in the resistance procedures in order to minimize further observation of differential expressed proteins due to divergent bacterial manipulation and experimental conditions.

The proteins expressed in the biological and the technical replicates in all groups were considered common proteins, and the proteins expressed only in a specific group were considered exclusive proteins. As regards the differential protein expression, two more parameters were also considered for quantitative assessment.
