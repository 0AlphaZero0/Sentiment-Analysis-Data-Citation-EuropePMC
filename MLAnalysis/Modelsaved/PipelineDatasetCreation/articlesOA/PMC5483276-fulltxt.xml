In this meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy of each post-operative radiation modality with respect to tumor recurrence and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched through June 2016 for cohort studies reporting outcomes of SRS or WBRT after metastasis resection.

Comparing SRS to WBRT, the overall crude risk ratio using the fixed-effect model was 0.59 for local recurrence (95%-CI: 0.32&#8211;1.09, I<sup>2</sup>: 3.35%, P-heterogeneity&#8201;=&#8201;0.36, 3 studies), 1.09 for distant recurrence (95%-CI: 0.74&#8211;1.60, I<sup>2</sup>: 50.5%, P-heterogeneity&#8201;=&#8201;0.13; 3 studies), and 2.99 for leptomeningeal disease (95% CI 1.55&#8211;5.76; I<sup>2</sup>: 14.4% p-heterogeneity: 0.28; 2 studies). For the same comparison, the risk ratio for median overall survival was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.41&#8211;0.54; I<sup>2</sup>: 79.1%, P-heterogeneity&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01; 4 studies) in a fixed-effect model, but was no longer significant (0.63; 95%-CI: 0.40&#8211;1.00) in a random-effect model. SRS was associated with a lower risk of leukoencephalopathy (RR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07&#8211;0.33, 1 study), yet with a higher risk of radiation-necrosis (RR: 19.4, 95% CI: 1.21&#8211;310, 1 study).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Based on retrospective cohort studies, the results of this study suggest that SRS of the resection cavity may offer comparable survival and similar local and distant control as adjuvant WBRT, yet may be associated with a higher risk for developing leptomeningeal disease.

Approximately, 20&#8211;40% of cancer patients with primary extracranial cancer will develop brain metastases during the course of their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the United States alone, this represents about 98,000 to 170,000 new diagnoses each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Median survival without treatment is estimated at 1&#160;month, and increases to 3&#8211;12 months when cranial radiation therapy is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Traditionally, the standard of care for patients with solitary brain metastasis has been resection plus whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Resection allows for histopathological examination of the tissue and has been shown to improve neurological symptoms, functional independence, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, several studies found that when resection was followed by adjuvant WBRT, it resulted in improved intracranial tumor control and lower rates of neurologic deaths compared to resection alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) assigned patients to WBRT or observation following either initial surgery or SRS. While the researchers did not find the addition of WBRT to affect overall survival when compared to observation, they did find that following either surgery or SRS, the addition of WBRT reduced the 2-year relapse rate when compared to surgery without adjuvant WBRT. More specifically, WBRT reduced the probability of relapse from 59 to 27% following surgery. A similar trend was noted following SRS, in which adjuvant WBRT reduced the probability of relapse from 31 to 19%. While the former result is consistent with what other experiments have also demonstrated (i.e. improved disease control with adjuvant WBRT following resection), the latter result is novel in that it suggests a possible role for adjuvant SRS in the management of brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The fact that SRS followed by WBRT offered better control than SRS alone, along with the fact that surgery plus WBRT led to improved outcomes as compared to surgery alone, suggests the possibility that SRS following surgery may offer similarly improved rates of disease control without the sequelae associated with radiation exposure to the entire brain.</p><p id="Par29">Furthermore, WBRT is associated with both short and long-term neurological complications, such as radiation-induced edema, leukoencephalopathy, and cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given that patients with systemic cancer are now living longer due to improved extracranial anti-tumor strategies, concerns related to these delayed, radiation-induced neurotoxic effects are prompting neuro-oncologists to assess alternatives to WBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many centers are therefore using targeted techniques with limited radiation exposure, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). SRS is associated with fewer global cognitive side effects, CNS preservation, and better quality-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">In this study, we used the current published literature to compare local recurrence, distant recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, and overall patient survival amongst patients who underwent resection plus SRS to patients who underwent resection plus WBRT for treatment of one to three intracranial metastases. Given the available data and abovementioned RCT, we hypothesize that SRS may lead to similar rates of local control as compared to WBRT following resection, but, based upon the targeted scope of SRS, may lead to poorer rates of distant control and overall patient survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par31">This meta-analysis was done in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

SRS was defined as a single or few fractions of high dose radiation to a small intracranial target that was encompassed by at least 50% of the prescribed dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Because Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) meets most of the salient features of SRS as described by the Radiation Oncology Therapy Group protocol, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] studies reporting IORT were included within the SRS treatment groups. Studies reporting on the use of Local Brain Radiotherapy (LBRT), however, were excluded for not meeting the criteria of SRS. Studies reporting outcomes on patients receiving prior WBRT and studies that did not compare post-operative WBRT to post-operative SRS were also excluded. After title and abstract screening, remaining articles were read full-text. Three authors (NL, IM, and LM) performed full-text screening and two (NL and LM) extracted the data.

When available, relative risks (RR) comparing SRS to WBRT were extracted for local recurrence risk, distant recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, and overall survival. Duration of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) for both local and distant recurrence was also noted. Furthermore, data on the number of patients that died from neurological causes and on observed neurotoxicity were extracted. In one study reporting outcomes of multiple metastases per patient, the reported percent recurrence by number of cavities was considered as equivalent to the percent recurrence by number of patients, as the number of metastases per patient approximated 1:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Study quality was assessed by the New-Castle Ottawa Scale, and the quality of our recommendation was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria.

Of note, there was a significant increased risk for the development of LMD in patients who received postoperative SRS as compared to WBRT, and a possible survival benefit to WBRT shown only in the fixed effects model with considerable heterogeneity. Though there was little published on leukoencephalopathy and radiation necrosis in these patients, it appeared that SRS reduced the risk of leukoencephalopathy and increased the risk for radiation necrosis as compared to WBRT. These results were in support of our hypothesis regarding similar rates of local control between the two treatment arms, but against our hypothesis predicting that SRS would lead to poorer rates of distant control. The possible survival benefit with WBRT in the fixed effects model was consistent with our hypothesis.</p><p id="Par47">No randomized controlled trials have yet been completed for post-operative radiation modalities. However, a meta-analysis on the effect of the addition of WBRT to SRS or surgery did show less intracranial disease progression, but no effect on overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This is in line with the results of a trial evaluating additional WBRT to SRS that found improved intracranial tumor control but no effect on survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the addition of SRS to WBRT was found to result in longer survival in a randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A systematic review evaluating linac-based SRS to resection cavities concluded that this treatment strategy provided good local control rates but poor distant intracranial control. This is different form our study that focused on a comparison between SRS and WBRT after resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Other studies have reported on the high risk of LMD in patients receiving SRS to the resection cavity, and have cited incidence rates around 12&#8211;14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Breast cancer metastases have been shown to have a particularly high rate of LMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally, many studies reported on the adverse side effects of WBRT, including physical symptoms such as alopecia, somnolence, hearing loss, skin changes, and neurocognitive decline, manifested as memory loss and learning impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In particular, the cognitive decline following WBRT has been linked to leukoencephalopathy, which is supported by the increased risk for leukoencephalopathy in patients receiving post-operative WBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] Another study, evaluating 59 patients treated with primary SRS, found that even after multiple courses of SRS, quality of life (QOL), measured with the EQ-5D instrument, was preserved in 77% of patients at 12&#160;month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, considering that our present analysis demonstrates similar results with respect to local recurrence, distant progression, and potentially survival in post-operative SRS patients, SRS is a valid treatment option that can help maintain neurocognition and QOL.</p><p id="Par49">In patients with a limited number of brain metastases receiving resection, the results of this study suggest that it is important to understand the risks and benefits of both WBRT and SRS. The possibility for an improved quality of life should be considered when discussing treatment options. Although there is still not a clear formula to guide use of SRS or WBRT following resection, the fact that SRS may offer similar tumor control as WBRT, with the potential for fewer cognitive side effects and less invasiveness, suggests that SRS should be considered as a valid treatment option for brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While it has been widely acknowledged that WBRT is associated with cognitive decline, SRS has also been associated with radiation induced necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While these studies showed a potential survival improvement in WBRT as compared to SRS in the random effects model, it is important to note that the fixed effects model was not significant and that the considerable heterogeneity between the studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this. Both continent and journal impact factor were identified as significant sources of heterogeneity. Lastly, we demonstrated an increased risk for LMD in patients receiving postoperative SRS to the resection cavity, which is an important outcome to discuss with patients considering SRS.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par50">A major limitation of this review and meta-analysis was the heterogeneity among the included studies. Amongst the nine studies included, one included only colon cancer patients, one included melanoma patients only, and the remaining six consisted of patient populations with varying proportions of melanoma, colon, renal, breast, and unknown histologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, the number of brain metastases was not reported homogenously between studies, and reported outcomes were not specific to the number of brain metastases and treatment modalities. Therefore, it was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis by histology type or number of metastases, or address potential sources of heterogeneity by these covariates. This is most likely of importance, because certain tumors, such as melanoma, colon, and renal carcinomas, are considered radioresistant for WBRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and it is possible that outcomes could differ in patients with only a single metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Of note, one study included in the analysis reported patients with 2&#8211;4 metastases in a single group, but noted that the number of metastases did not have an effect on the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A further limitation of this analysis was that some studies reported death as a hazard ratio, while other used the Kaplan Meier method. Reporting a hazard ratio is a more accurate method and the variation in reporting limits the strength of the conclusions. Lastly, the studies included in the analysis were all retrospective in nature. Therefore, the different treatment-strategies implemented for each set of patients were the result of the tumor boards&#8217; selection of patients whom they felt would benefit from that regimen, resulting in a selection bias. This is further complicated by the different forms of radiation administered in each study, as some studies described outcomes of IORT instead of SRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. No studies were identified that compared WBRT with hypofractionated SRS, which has become a viable treatment strategy for lesions not treatable with a single fraction SRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Despite these limitations, this meta-analysis based on cohort studies evaluated several different outcomes after extensive review of the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on this topic. The use of both random- and fixed-effect models together with heterogeneity analysis resulted in a critical evaluation of our outcomes. Furthermore, an increased risk for the development of LMD after SRS compared to WBRT following surgical resection was identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Future directions</title><p id="Par52">There is a clear necessity for the improvement of care for brain metastasis patients as they tend to live longer. Currently, several treatment strategies exist for brain metastasis, but data on the most effective strategy is lacking. Factors such as radiation dose, treatment timing, chemotherapy combinations among others should be evaluated in future studies in order to evaluate the most effective treatment modalities. The wide range of treatment modalities also provides a potential to strive towards more individualized patient care. In addition, evaluated outcomes should not be limited to survival or progression and should include quality of life. Indeed, currently a phase III randomized trial is being conducted to evaluate postoperative SRS versus WBRT in brain metastasis patients (NCT01372774) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Primary endpoints will be evaluation of survival and neurocognitive progression and secondary endpoints will be QOL, adverse events, and functional independence among others. Last, the use of &#8220;big data&#8221; may provide a method to evaluate these outcomes more thoroughly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">This meta-analysis suggested that post-operative, localized SRS may offer local protection of a similar degree as post-operative WBRT in patients with one to three lesions. WBRT as compared to SRS, however, seemed to offer better protection from LMD and may offer better protection from distant progression of intracranial metastases with improved survival, albeit not reaching statistical significance in this meta-analysis. However, because WBRT has been consistently associated with post-operative development of physical and cognitive symptoms, SRS is a valid alternative to consider, and can be used in multiple sessions if distant metastases eventually do develop. Notably, the long-term risks of radiation from SRS must also be considered and weighed against the long-term risks of WBRT.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Appendix 1</title><p id="Par61">Search String.
