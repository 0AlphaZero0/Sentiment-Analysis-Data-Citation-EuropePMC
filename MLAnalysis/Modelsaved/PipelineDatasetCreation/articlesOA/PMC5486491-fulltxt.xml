The efficacy and potency of several GPCR agonists change as a consequence of peripheral inflammatory injury. Whether these changes reflect alterations in expression of the G proteins themselves is not known. This study examined the expression of transcripts and proteins for the &#945; subunits of three classes of heteromeric G proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) of male rats four days and two weeks after intraplantar injection of complete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant (CFA) or saline. Levels of G&#945; transcript in the dorsal horn or RVM were unchanged by CFA treatment. However, in the dorsal horn, G&#945;<sub>i</sub> protein decreased in cytosolic and membrane fractions four days after CFA treatment. Levels of G&#945;<sub>z</sub> protein decreased in the membrane fraction. Levels of the other G&#945; subunits did not differ. Levels of the G&#945; subunits were unchanged two weeks after CFA treatment. In the RVM, G&#945;<sub>z</sub> protein levels decreased in the cytosolic fraction four days after CFA treatment. No other differences were observed. Two weeks after CFA, the levels for all G&#945; subunits trended higher in the RVM. These data indicate that peripheral inflammatory injury induces subtle changes in the abundance of G&#945; subunits that is specific with respect to class, subcellular compartment, tissue, and time after injury. These changes have the potential to alter the balance of the different subcellular signaling pathways through which GPCR agonists act to modulate nociception.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>dorsal horn</kwd><kwd>rostral ventromedial medulla</kwd><kwd>complete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant</kwd><kwd>inflammatory pain</kwd><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1744806917715210"><funding-source id="funding1-1744806917715210"><institution-wrap><institution>International Association for the Study of Pain</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005924</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1744806917715210">John J.

In addition, peripheral nerve or inflammatory injury that results in enhanced sensitivity to innocuous or noxious stimuli is accompanied by up- or downregulation of GPCRs or changes in receptor affinity in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). By comparison, virtually nothing is known about the impact of peripheral injury on the expression of the G proteins that are responsible for transduction and the engagement of subcellular signaling pathways. This study undertook a systematic analysis of the expression of transcript and protein for three different classes of G proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which contains the first synapse in afferent pain pathways, as well as in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a nucleus with a critical role in the bulbospinal modulation of nociception. It further assessed whether peripheral inflammatory injury, produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant (CFA), altered levels of transcripts or proteins.

This preabsorption did not eliminate labeling of the appropriate band for any subunit, although signal for G&#945;<sub>s/olf</sub> and G&#945;<sub>q</sub> was slightly diminished.

The decrease was evident in both cytosolic and membrane fractions for G&#945;<sub>i</sub>, whereas it was evident only in the membrane for G&#945;<sub>z</sub>. This observation is consistent with a loss of inhibition in the dorsal horn and could have a permissive role in the development of heat hyperalgesia and mechanical hypersensitivity after inflammatory injury.

In the absence of injury, agonists for each of these receptors produce antinociception upon intrathecal administration.

The only significant effect observed four days after CFA was a decrease in cytosolic levels of G&#945;<sub>z</sub>, a pertussis-toxin insensitive G protein. Interestingly, two weeks after CFA, virtually every G&#945; isoform in the membrane fraction trended upward.

However, given that these samples were run on the same blots as for the four-day treatment groups, the uniform trend is intriguing.

The twofold increase in G&#945;<sub>s</sub> is particularly intriguing as it could provide an additional mechanism for opioids to produce antinociception or antihyperalgesia. Specifically, it could entail a coupling of &#181; opioid receptors to G&#945;<sub>s</sub> and a direct activation of pain inhibitory neurons, as it has been shown to occur in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following traumatic neuropathic pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1744806917715210" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> These findings provide intriguing evidence for possible plasticity in the coupling of G&#945; proteins to mu opioid receptors following persistent inflammatory injury and to pleiotropic actions of mu opioid receptor agonists. Although this potential mechanism can be addressed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the &#181; opioid receptor and the different G&#945; protein subtypes, such experiments must await the generation of a suitably specific &#181; opioid receptor antibody for use in the rat.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1744806917715210" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-1744806917715210" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec19-1744806917715210"><title>Regulation of G protein signaling</title><p>Other receptors and pathways are likely to be affected by the plasticity that occurs in the RVM and dorsal horn under persistent inflammatory conditions.
