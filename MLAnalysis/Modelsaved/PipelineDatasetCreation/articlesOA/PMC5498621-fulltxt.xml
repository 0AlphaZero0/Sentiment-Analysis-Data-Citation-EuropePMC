VPA and its derivatives exhibit a variety of effects which are cell- and tissue-specific, differ based on disease state, age, gender and ethnicity, and may be effective or deleterious. VPA is a weak blocker of sodium and calcium ion channels, and may inhibit key enzymes in the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), including ABAT (4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase) at physiologically relevant concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). There is also evidence that VPA exerts its antiepileptic action through differential regulation of the <italic>GRIN2B</italic> (Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor NMDA Type Subunit 2B) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). VPA is an effective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), with an IC<sub>50</sub> (0.4&#160;mM) well within the therapeutic range of VPA (0.35&#8211;0.7&#160;mM in serum). VPA causes robust chromatin decondensation, with potent acetylation of core histones such as H3 and H4 that leads to activation of development gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). VPA has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>), and in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). In a swine model of TBI and hemorrhagic shock (HS) VPA decreases brain lesion size, improves neurologic recovery, and down-regulates genes associated with necrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). The HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, with a mechanism of action like that of VPA, has been shown to activate neurogenesis in rodent brain following ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). These results suggest different ways in which VPA may act in parallel to provide benefit in epilepsy, mood disorders, migraine, as well as recovery following trauma.</p><p id="Par70">It appears that VPA-induced histone acetylation is not sufficient for chromatin decondensation, but rather a downstream effect of HDAC inhibition, suggesting that the drug suppresses the expression of proteins involved in maintenance of heterochromatin and/or uses chromatin remodeling proteins as intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). It is also routinely used to remove histone methylation in cellular domains such as the lamina-associating domain (LAD) located just interior of the nuclear membrane, a region containing heterochromatin, in which exposure to VPA abolishes H3K27 and H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>).</p><p id="Par71">Recent studies of the epigenomic control of gene expression that has identified distinct mechanisms through which chromatin interactions mediate transcriptional programs involving topologically-associating domains (TADs), enhancer-promoter loops and actively transcribed regions of the human genome characterized by the histone mark H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).

Due to confounding related to polypharmacy these studies were excluded.

The highly significant changes related to neuroplasticity that is observed in our animal model of TBI and hemorrhage suggest this may be true. However, it is most probable that VPA acts through different pathways following traumatic injury than that observed in healthy tissue. Previous studies in rodent models of ischemia followed by treatment with HDAC inhibitors including VPA and sodium butyrate have observed activation of neurogenesis in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>), although repair mechanisms may depend on the post-injury timeframe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>).</p><p id="Par108">Our results show that existing sources of disparate data can be used to model transcriptional networks that are activated by VPA in the human CNS. VPA generates widespread changes in chromatin state in the genome accompanied by targeted transcriptional changes that mediate neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Although VPA in combination with other small compounds may be able to induce neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>), previous research suggests that it acts, in part, through TFs responsible for determination of neuronal cell fate, such as NEUROD1 and TBR1 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>): Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Specific chromatin modifying protein complexes that include ARID1A are critical for chromatin remodeling during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>), including acetylation of the histone mark H3K27, which defines active enhancers and promoters. Based on these findings we have devised a model that attempts to explain VPA&#8217;s mechanism of action in the human adult brain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This model consists of 3 components: (1) Activation of AKT1/mTOR signaling pathways by GABA receptors and/or growth factors that activate genes whose expression provides neuroprotection, (2) Opening of chromatin through HDAC inhibition, leading to histone acetylation and widespread gene expression including expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, and (3) Induction of chromatin state remodeling complexes such as npBAF containing proteins encoded by ARID1A, BCL11A and CHAF1B, which act as intermediaries for pioneer TFs to initiate neurogenesis and repression of non-neuronal gene expression. These mechanisms of action are not mutual exclusive and occur concurrently with suppression of TFs such as ST18, which is responsible for glial cell fate programming during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Putative mechanisms of VPA in human brain. <bold>(1)</bold> Activation of AKT1/mTOR signaling pathways by GABA receptors and/or growth factors that activate genes whose expression provides neuroprotection, <bold>(2)</bold> VPA acts directly to open chromatin through HDAC inhibition, leading to histone acetylation and widespread gene expression including expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, and <bold>(3)</bold> Chromatin state remodeling complexes such as npBAF containing proteins encoded by ARID1A, BCL11A and CHAF1B, act as intermediaries to prepare for pioneer TFs to initiate neurogenesis and repression of non-neuronal gene expression. There is evidence that PAX6 acts as a pioneer factor in concert with BAF during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11095_2017_2130_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par109">In cell lines, treatment with VPA causes rapid and extensive chromatin decondensation, suggesting that VPA broadly and directly acetylates histones for transformation of chromatin state from heterochromatin to euchromatin. Thus, it may be that VPA acts directly to inhibit histone deacetylases. Alternatively, rapid activation of chromatin remodeling proteins such as the ARID1A component of the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complexes npBAF and nBAF may mediate chromatin remodeling following administration of VPA. Ultimately, it may be that all of these mechanisms contribute to VPA&#8217;s mechanism of action in the human CNS.</p><p id="Par110">Adequate data now exist to elucidate the transcriptional program that resolves all of the components that are necessary and sufficient to determine VPA&#8217;s mechanism in the human brain using knowledge-based discovery. This capability has been demonstrated in other domains, including modeling of the core regulatory circuits in different human tissues and cell lines, including super-enhancers, master TFs and TFs responsible for specifying cell fate (Supplementary Tables&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In this study, we identified important master TFs such as NEUROD1 and TBR1 that are induced by VPA following TBI in adult brain, but normally expressed at low levels in the mature human telencephalon.</p><p id="Par111">Preliminary data from postmortem human brain must be considered preliminary, as complete medical histories are not available on either patients or controls, there is heterogeneity in the data, and this microarray expression reflects variability associated with a single time point in the analysis of postmortem human brain tissue lacking cause of death in most cases. In addition, although controls were selected based on lack of medication history, medical history was not well characterized.</p><p id="Par112">Since VPA relieves symptoms in disorders such as bipolar disorder, which involves neuronal loss and neural atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that VPA may have a positive effect on a range of damaged brain tissue, from mild atrophy to the critical damage that is often observed following TBI. Conversely, VPA may generate aberrant hyperplasia of different cell types in human brain as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>). This could account for rebound seizures and CNS impairment including encephalopathy after chronic treatment with VPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>).</p><p id="Par113">Further investigation is warranted to completely understand how VPA and other HDAC inhibitors can provide functional recovery after severe trauma to the human brain and spinal cord, and to a lesser extent, suppress epileptogenesis, alleviate mania in bipolar disorder, and act as an analgesic in migraine. Modeling using rich data resources as was performed in the current study generate testable hypotheses for more focused experiments in subsequent studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11095_2017_2130_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 2041 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
