ABC transporters are membrane proteins that use ATP to exclude a diverse range of molecules including endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics from cells. The <italic>ABCG2</italic> gene, located in chromosome 4, encodes a 655 amino acid long peptide chain that forms an intracellular N-terminal ATP-binding domain followed by six transmembrane helices. The detailed organization in the cell membrane remains to be elucidated since there is no available crystal structure of ABCG2. The structure of ABCG2 is different from typical ABC-transporters that have 12 or more transmembrane helices and two ATP-binding domains. Due to its &#8220;half-transporter&#8221; structure, ABCG2 has to form dimers to exert its transport function, but it has also been suggested to function as tetramers or higher order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Expression of ABCG2 in cancer cells increases resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents such as mitoxantrone, topotecan and methotrexate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Due to its localization in the intestine, liver and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), ABCG2 increases elimination of substrate drugs and decreases absorption and bioavailability. ABCG2 also has a protective role in limiting distribution of xenobiotics in distinct organ compartments such as the brain and placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). In addition to transporting drugs and toxins, ABCG2 disposes of endogenous metabolites, including estrogen metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). ABCG2 is one of the transporters involved in uric acid transport in the body and dysfunction of ABCG2 is shown to be related to gout risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). On the other hand, ABCG2 null alleles have been linked to a Junior (a-) blood group phenotype that results in adverse effects in blood transfusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). It is suggested that ABCG2 and its variant forms could also be involved in photosensitivity, since it is involved in cellular porphyrin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). In addition to this, many more xenobiotic substrates as well as a plethora of inhibitors have been identified in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, which means that there is a great potential for unwanted ABCG2-mediated pharmacokinetic events. A decrease in ABCG2 transport activity arising from interindividual genetic variations or inhibition can result in unexpectedly high concentrations of substrate drugs due to increased absorption and decreased elimination.</p><p id="Par15">Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) introduce an amino acid change in the peptide sequence, which can alter the expression, function or localization of the proteins they encode. Genotyping studies of <italic>ABCG2</italic> have revealed several hundred naturally occurring nonsynonymous SNPs (424 variants listed in the Ensembl GRCh37 database, release Oct2016). The majority of these variants occur at a frequency of&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1% in most populations. The most common variants are V12M and Q141K, which cause amino acid changes in the intracellular regions of ABCG2. They occur at a frequency of 19.2% and 31.9%, respectively, in the Japanese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>), but are rarer in other populations, with the Q141K minor allele frequency being roughly 10% in Caucasians and 3% in blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). In addition to being linked to gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>), the Q141K variant alters pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). The decreased transport of Q141K, observed to be around 50% of wild-type (WT) ABCG2 in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, can be explained by reduced plasma membrane expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). The other common variant, V12M, does not appear to confer changes in expression level or function of ABCG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">An acquired transmembrane domain SNP, resulting in the change of R482 to threonine or glycine, was identified in several cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro.</italic> It has received considerable interest, because it was shown to be a gain-of-function mutation leading to increased mitoxantrone and doxorubicin resistance compared to the WT as well as the ability to transport daunorubicin, rhodamine 123 and LysoTracker green, unlike WT ABCG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). Discovery of the R482 mutant lead to a number of mutational studies on other transmembrane residues and decreased transport function of mitoxantrone resistance has been linked for example to changes at positions 336, 557 and 630 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). These results indicate that changes in the transmembrane helices of ABCG2, which line the substrate binding cavity, can have a significant effect on substrate recognition.</p><p id="Par17">Here we present the function and expression of nine naturally occurring SNPs (G406R, F431L, S441N, P480L, F489L, M515R, L525R, A528T and T542A) that are predicted to reside in the transmembrane domains of ABCG2 and were therefore hypothesized to impact ABCG2 transport activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>).

ABCG2 was detected using the BXP-21 antibody, which reacts with the intracellular domains of ABCG2 (amino acid residues 271-396) and therefore the presence of the studied amino acid changes are not expected to change the affinity of the antibody. ABCG2 protein could be detected in all of the Sf9 and HEK293 vesicle preparations of ABCG2 variants, but the levels in HEK293 vesicles were lower than in Sf9 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In Sf9 vesicles, six of the variants were expressed at levels above 50% of WT, whereas 54% was the highest relative expression achieved with any of the variants in the HEK293 vesicles. The expression of G460R, S441N and M515R was significantly lower than the WT (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) in the Sf9 vesicles and only negligible amounts (&lt;2% of WT) of these three variants could be detected in the HEK293 vesicles.

Wild-type ABCG2 transduced in HEK293 cells showed typical membrane staining when probed with the mAB BXP-21 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). All samples transduced with ABCG2 variants showed some ABCG2 expression in line with the results from western blotting. Due to the nature of the baculovirus system, leading to overexpression in affected cells, some ABCG2 was also retained inside the cell. On the other hand, not all cells were transduced by with the virus and expressed ABCG2. No expression of ABCG2 was detected in the control samples of non-transduced cells or eYFP-transduced cells. Cell surface expression, seen as an intensified band-like signal at cell edges, could be observed for variants F431L, P480L, F489L, A528T and T542A. On the contrary G406R, S441N, M515R and L525R did not show an increased signal at the cell surface, but instead tended to accumulate inside the cells or show low expression in general.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">In this study, nine naturally occurring variants predicted to be localized in the transmembrane helices of ABCG2 were expressed in both Sf9 insect cells and human derived HEK293 cells. We used these two cell systems because despite insect cells being widely used to study ABC transporters, Sf9-ABCG2 preparations have decreased activity compared to mammalian systems due to the lower cholesterol content in Sf9 cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). ABCG2 has been shown to localize in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts in cell membranes and exhibit reduced transport activity with cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). Moreover, insect cells are grown at 27&#176;C and mammalian cells at 37&#176;C. It has been shown in several studies that expression at low temperatures may rescue certain protein variants that were not expressed at 37&#176;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). In addition to this, insect cells differ from mammalian cells with regards to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can be detected in western blotting, but glycosylation differences do not appear to affect ABCG2 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). The activity of the ABCG2 variants studied here relative to the WT ABCG2 were very similar between the Sf9 and HEK293 preparations, despite differences in the relative expression levels. Strikingly, we detected significantly decreased transport of the two test substrates used in this study for all nine variants. Five of these variants have previously been studied <italic>in vitro</italic>, while to our knowledge the activity of the variants G406R, P480L, M515R and T542A has not previously been characterized.</p><p id="Par33">The F431L, S441N and F489L variants are the most studied of the naturally occurring transmembrane SNPs. The F431L and F489L variants have been reported to have substrate dependent changes in transport activity; methotrexate transport was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>), while cells carrying the variants still displayed resistance towards other substrates like mitoxantrone and SN-38, even though the resistance was reduced compared to the WT ABCG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). In contrast, the S441N variant appears to be unable to transport any of the tested substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). These findings correlate well with our results, as we observed some transport activity by the F431L and F489L variants, while no transport activity could be detected by the S441N variant. Moreover, the F431L and F489L variants were expressed on the cell surface in HEK293 cells as has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>), while the S441N variant was mainly found intracellularly as expected from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Based on previous studies in Flp-In-293 cells, the S441N variant appears to be unstable, since the presence of proteasomal proteolysis inhibitors was able to rescue the protein and increase cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). The glycosylation pattern of S441N has been reported to differ from WT ABCG2 and indeed two bands were also seen for S441N in this study, with the main band in the Sf9 preparation being the lower molecular weight form.</p><p id="Par34">The L525R and A528T variants have not been as well characterized. In a study by Skoglund <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>) both variants were found at the plasma membrane, but the L525R variant had significantly decreased expression and provided low resistance towards tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a cellular assay, while the A528T variant had similar expression levels compared to the WT, but still displayed a decreased resistance towards the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We attained very similar results, as L525R was unable to transport either of the tested substrates, while A528T was the most active of the tested variants, with a transport activity of approximately half of the WT ABCG2. L525R was mainly retained inside the cells and expression in the HEK293 membrane vesicles was reduced by 75% compared to WT. Immunostaining showed that A528T was correctly localized at the cell membrane, but the expression in vesicles was roughly half of the WT. The relatively high activity of the A528T variant in comparison to the other transmembrane variants might be explained by the localization of the SNP at the edge of the predicted fourth transmembrane helix of ABCG2. If the topological prediction is correct and the amino acid is not positioned within the membrane, this substitution could be well tolerated since both alanine and threonine are fairly small, neutral amino acids at physiological pH.</p><p id="Par35">
<italic>In vitro</italic> functionality or expression of the variants G406R, P480L, M515R and T542A has not been reported previously. The transport activity of these variants was significantly impaired in both Sf9 and HEK293 vesicles for LY as well as E<sub>1</sub>S in the HEK293 vesicles. Low activity in membrane vesicles could be partly explained for G406R and M515R by the retention of ABCG2 inside the HEK293 cells seen in the immunofluorescence studies and the western blot. However, it cannot be solely explained by this since transport was low also in Sf9 vesicles despite a 39- and 45-fold higher relative expression level in Sf9 than HEK293 vesicles for G406R and M515R, respectively. G406 is the first of the glycines in the dimerization motif G/A/SXXXG, which is conserved in the ABCG-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). Mutation of either of the glycines to leucine impaired substrate transport of ABCG2, while substituting both glycines with alanine did not interfere with the function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). As the arginine is likely to disrupt the molecular architecture in the transmembrane domain of the protein to an even higher degree than the leucine substitution, it was not unexpected that the G406R variant showed extremely low transport activity, similarly to the M515R and the L525R variants. P480L and T542A did localize at the cell membrane in HEK293 cells, although the&#160;expression was lower than WT. The low activity of these variants in the Sf9 vesicles, despite high expression, points to functional defects of the protein. Interestingly, the T542A substitution may display substrate dependent effects on transport activity as it appears able to transport E<sub>1</sub>S but not LY.</p><p id="Par36">The online tools SIFT and Poly-Phen were used to predict the consequences of amino acid substitutions on protein function (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Similar effects were predicted for seven of the variants with both services while contrasting predictions are given for the F431L and A528T substitutions. Both programs predicted that four of the nine transmembrane SNPs are tolerated or benign. Since all of the studied variants decreased the apparent function of ABCG2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, it can be concluded that these tools are not capable of predicting the effect of all polymorphisms. Both programs correctly predicted the disruptive effect of the substitutions to arginine, as well as the proline to leucine substitution. However, the programs failed to predict the damaging effect of substitutions where the amino acid properties did not change as much, <italic>i.e.</italic> the phenylalanine &#8211;leucine or threonine-alanine and even the serine-aspargine substitution. The poor predictions might be due to the localization of the SNPs in the transmembrane region, which is not considered by the programs. The substitutions are likely to cause improper folding of the protein due to the membrane localization, which is less tolerant to changes in the peptide sequence. Subsequently the misfolded protein is not translocated to the plasma membrane, but remains intracellular.</p><p id="Par37">The global allele frequency of the studied variants is generally low (&lt; 1%) based on genotyping studies in the Japanese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) and the 1000 Genomes Project database (1000genomes.org). This is the case for most ABCG2 SNPs, with the notable exceptions of the Q141K and V12M variants. Due to the low frequency, the effect of the studied variants is unlikely to be identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or clinical studies that are mainly suited to recognize commonly occurring SNPs. However, the observed significant decrease in the <italic>in vitro</italic> transport activity suggests that patients harboring these variant alleles are at risk for adverse effects of ABCG2 substrates or diseases linked to ABCG2 function, such as gout. Since amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane regions do not appear to be well tolerated, it is likely that other nonsynonymous SNPs localized to the membrane helices have similar damaging effects on ABCG2 function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">In conclusion, we have shown that nine naturally occurring polymorphic variants of ABCG2 display significantly decreased transport function in the vesicular transport assay. The damaging effect of variants G406R, P480L, M515R and T542A is, to our knowledge, reported here for the first time. The findings were confirmed by using two independent expression systems and they are in line with previous literature. Non-functionality could be explained for some variants by altered expression patterns as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. These results indicate that patients harboring these ABCG2 variant forms could suffer from unexpected pharmacokinetic events of ABCG2 substrate drugs or have an increased risk for diseases where ABCG2 is implicated. This type of <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of variants is important especially for variants with low allele frequencies which are difficult to pick up in the limited sample populations used in pharmacogenetic studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="11095_2017_2127_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 15 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
