To clarify their mechanism, we report here the crystal structure of a functional construct of the kinesin-13 Kif2C/MCAK in an ATP-like state and bound to the &#945;&#946;-tubulin heterodimer, a complex mimicking the species that dissociates from microtubule ends during catalytic disassembly. Our results picture how Kif2C stabilizes a curved tubulin conformation.

This movement leads the &#946;5a&#8211;&#946;5b motif to interact with the distal end of &#946;-tubulin, whereas the neck and the KVD motif, two specific elements of kinesin-13s, target the &#945;-tubulin distal end.

Most kinesins move along microtubules to translocate molecules or organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> or to slide microtubules apart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, kinesins regulate microtubule dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, in particular acting as depolymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Kinesins of class 13 (kinesin-13s) are unique depolymerizing enzymes in that they are not motile but target microtubule ends, either directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or by diffusing along microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, to induce disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Unique also is the observation that kinesin-13s are active as monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, the minimal functional construct comprising the motor domain and the proximal part of a neck region, N-terminal to the motor domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been shown that kinesin-13s have an unusual nucleotide cycle that is adapted to their function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Whereas motile kinesins not bound to microtubules are trapped in an ADP-bound state, spontaneous nucleotide exchange occurs at high rate in kinesin-13s allowing them to bind ATP in solution and to start interacting with microtubules in this nucleotide state. Furthermore, although still debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the current view is that ATP hydrolysis is not required for the depolymerization step per se (removal of tubulin from microtubule ends) but for the recycling step (dissociation of the kinesin from this detached tubulin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Sequence and structural analyses have identified several kinesin-13 features likely involved in their specific function. First, kinesin-13s share an elongated L2 loop folded as a &#946;-hairpin, with a conserved lysine-valine-aspartate (KVD) motif at its tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mutation studies, targeting the KVD motif residues directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> or indirectly through the shortening of both strands of the L2 hairpin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, have demonstrated the necessity of this motif and of its precise positioning for efficient microtubule depolymerization. Structural models, either constrained by electron microscopy or based on the structure of tubulin&#8211;motile kinesin complexes, converge in placing the KVD motif at the inter-tubulin longitudinal interface of a protofilament<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. But these models do differ when it comes to identifying the KVD binding site on tubulin, which therefore remains uncertain.</p><p id="Par5">A second feature of kinesin-13s needed for the depolymerization activity is the neck region, although the more divergent kinesin-13 pKinI from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is active as a motor domain construct only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A model wherein the positively charged neck enhances the association rate with microtubules by interacting dynamically with the flexible, negatively charged, C-terminal tails of tubulin has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In line with this model, the depolymerization efficiency of a kinesin-13 construct made inactive by deleting the distal part of the neck is restored by introducing a stretch of basic residues at the N-terminal end of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These studies highlight the importance of the basic nature of the neck and suggest that a precise conformation of this neck is not required for the function. In partial agreement with this proposal, in the available crystal structures of isolated kinesin-13s, the distal part of the neck is disordered whereas its proximal moiety folds as an &#945;-helix and has been reported to point in two different directions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, an electron microscopy analysis of dolastatin-induced rings of tubulin decorated by a neck+motor kinesin-13 construct indicates that only half of the motor binding sites are occupied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that, once a kinesin-13 construct is bound, its neck obstructs the neighboring site, hence implying a rather rigid conformation of the neck relative to the motor domain, at least when it is bound to tubulin. Taken together, the structural function of the neck in microtubule depolymerization needs to be defined further.</p><p id="Par6">A third peculiar structural feature of kinesin-13s is the tubulin-binding &#945;4 helix, one of the main kinesin elements that interact with microtubules. In the structure of isolated kinesins, the N-terminal part of this helix is most often disordered and becomes ordered upon microtubule binding. However, in the absence of microtubules, the length of this helix varies, e.g., a longer &#945;4 helix has been observed in kinesin-3 Kif1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the case of kinesin-13s, the &#945;4 length is also variable but the same orientation, which is tilted by about 5&#176; compared to ADP-bound Kif1A and 30&#176; compared to ATP-like Kif1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, is found in all the kinesin-13 structures determined so far. This orientation has been proposed to account for the preferential binding of these kinesins to curved tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, modeling studies have suggested that, upon tubulin binding, the kinesin-13 &#945;4 helix adopts an orientation similar to that found in the tubulin&#8211;kinesin-1 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, one needs to determine a higher resolution and experimentally defined structure to specify the binding mode of kinesin-13s to tubulin.</p><p id="Par7">We report here the crystal structure of a monomeric functional construct of the human kinesin-13 Kif2C, also named MCAK, in complex with tubulin. The Kif2C construct comprised the motor domain and the C-terminal part of the neck region and has been called &#8220;short neck+motor&#8221; (Kif2C-(sN+M))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). For crystallization purpose, Kif2C-(sN+M) was fused to a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> that binds tubulin and prevents its self-assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The structural data clarify several features of Kif2C that had remained ambiguous. Altogether with the study of the effect of structure-based designed mutations, these data ultimately provide insights into the structural mechanism of microtubule catalytic disassembly by kinesin-13s.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of Kif2C-DARPin constructs. <bold>a</bold> Schematic presentation of Kif2C, of Kif2C-(sN+M), and of Kif2C-DARPin chimerical constructs. <bold>b</bold> SEC-MALLS analysis of tubulin in complex with Kif2C-(sN+M) linked to the D1 DARPin by a (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>3</sub> peptide.

The profile of the second peak and the mass estimate of its tail (about 110&#8201;kDa, elution volume 8.9 to 9.09&#8201;ml) are consistent with some dissociation of the complex in the column.

We initially applied the same strategy in the case of kinesin-13s but it failed for a long time, at least in part because of the propensity of these kinesins to aggregate tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To stabilize Kif2C&#8211;tubulin&#8211;DARPin complexes further, we gathered in the same protein Kif2C-(sN+M) and a DARPin, by linking the C-terminal end of the former to the N-terminal end of the latter, using linkers based on G<sub>4</sub>S repeats (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">First, we generated a fusion protein between Kif2C-(sN+M) and the D1 DARPin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> using a (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>3</sub> linker (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Mixing tubulin with this chimerical construct gave two main species on gel filtration, which are in equilibrium (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analysis indicated that the mass of the earliest eluting species corresponds to that of a 2:2 tubulin:Kif2C&#8211;DARPin complex, whereas the second peak is consistent with a 1:1 complex (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Given that a tubulin:Kif2C-(sN+M):DARPin mixture (in which the kinesin and the DARPin are not fused) eluted at a position similar to that of the second peak and that the first peak was absent from this chromatogram (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), we concluded that the first peak is a consequence, most likely an artifact, of the Kif2C&#8211;DARPin chimeras with inappropriate linker length. Indeed, the relative amount of these two peaks varied according to the length of the linker (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). For these additional experiments, we took advantage of affinity-improved DARPins, which dissociate from tubulin two orders of magnitude slower than the parental one to reach a dissociation constant at equilibrium (<italic>K</italic>

A construct of Kif2C-(sN+M) fused to the A-C2 DARPin via an optimized linker length of four G<sub>4</sub>S repeats plus three additional amino acids (two Gly and one Ser) gave mainly a 1:1 complex with tubulin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

In particular, Kif2C binds at the &#945;&#946; interface of a curved tubulin heterodimer (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The tubulin curvature (14.7&#176;) is slightly larger than those observed in the complexes with kinesin-1 (9.2&#176; and 11.6&#176; in the structure with kinesin-1 without nucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and in ATP-like state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, respectively), but is similar to values found in other tubulin structures, e.g., in a tubulin&#8211;CPAP&#8211;DARPin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (pdb id 5ITZ). In the complex, Kif2C was bound to the stable ATP analog AMPPNP, leading to a nucleotide binding site conformation at the image of those of the kinesin-5 Eg5 bound to AMPPNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>), of the AMPPNP form of a kinesin-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and of ATP-like kinesin-1 bound to tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Of note, the L9 loop, which comprises the Switch 1 motif, folded as an extended structure in these different kinesins, suggesting that this conformation is a feature shared in the kinesin superfamily and used for the stabilization of the &#947;-phosphate nucleotide by conserved Switch 1 residues. In contrast, and different from what is observed in motile kinesins, the L9 loop is poorly ordered in isolated kinesin-13s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which may contribute to the fast spontaneous nucleotide release rate observed in these kinesins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

A closer look indicated that the Kif2C elements that deviate most are those that interact with tubulin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>), except for the L2 hairpin (see below). These elements correspond mainly to the &#945;4-L12-&#945;5 region and to the short &#946;5a-&#946;5b &#946;-sheet motif and have been gathered in a &#8220;tubulin-binding subdomain&#8221; in kinesin-1 structural studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Removing this subdomain from the superposition led to a much better fit (r.m.s.d. 0.59&#8201;&#197;; 218 C&#945;s compared).

</p><p id="Par14">The large movement of the &#945;4 and &#945;5 helices upon tubulin binding, with a ~25&#176; rotation to adopt a conformation similar to that in tubulin-bound kinesin-1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), led also to the reorganization of the &#945;5/&#946;5a&#8211;&#946;5b interaction. In particular, Glu423 (in &#946;5a), which interacts with Arg540 (belonging to the L12 loop) in the structure of isolated Kif2C, was displaced towards Arg549 (in &#945;5). This movement freed the kinesin-conserved Arg540 residue and made it available to interact with acidic residues of the &#946;-tubulin H12 helix (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Consistently, replacing Arg540 by an alanine led to an R540A Kif2C mutant that is unable to depolymerize microtubules (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). The &#946;5a&#8211;&#946;5b movement also placed the N-terminal &#946;5a residue (Arg420) in the vicinity of the N-terminal end of this &#946;-tubulin H12 helix and of the preceding loop (and in particular in the vicinity of Asp414 and Glu417). Arg420 is a relatively well conserved residue in Kif2 proteins (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), whereas in kinesins of most other classes the nature of the residue at this position is not conserved. To characterize further the contribution of this residue to the Kif2C mechanism, we mutated Arg420 into serine, the residue found at this position in human kinesin-1. We found that the R420S mutant has lost the ability to depolymerize microtubules (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>). This mutation also led to a 10-fold decrease of the microtubule-stimulated ATP hydrolysis rate (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These results validate &#946;5a&#8211;&#946;5b as a zone of interaction with the N-terminal part of the &#946;-tubulin H12 helix, whereas the C-terminal moiety of this helix interacts with the Kif2C L12 loop (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of the properties of the Kif2C-(sN+M) mutants studied</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>n.d.: not determined</p><p>

</p><p id="Par15">The movement and lengthening of &#945;4 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) led several conserved kinesin-13 residues to point toward tubulin, bringing in particular Arg510 in the vicinity of Glu113 of the tubulin &#945; subunit, Lys524 in that of &#945;-tubulin Glu414 and Glu415, and Glu525 in the vicinity of Arg402 from the same tubulin subunit (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Consistently, the mutation in kinesin-13s of the residues equivalent to Kif2C Lys524 and Glu525 leads to proteins inactive for the depolymerase activity and with an impaired microtubule-stimulated ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To explain these results, a decrease of the kinesin affinity for microtubules and the loss of the ability to discriminate between microtubule lattice and ends have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We also studied the R510A mutant. Whereas a recent study has shown that dimeric Kif2C R510A and R510L mutants depolymerize GMPCPP-microtubules as efficiently as the wild-type protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, in our hands, using Taxotere-stabilized microtubules as a substrate, the R510A substitution led to a slight decrease of the depolymerase activity of Kif2C-(sN+M) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The mutation led also to a 15-fold increase of the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub>MT compared to wild-type (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), consistent with a lowering of the affinity for microtubules. The D506A mutation, in the L11 Loop, also lowered the depolymerizing activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), but in that case the microtubule-stimulated ATPase remained equivalent to that of the parental protein (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Therefore, the contribution of Asp506, which is close to Lys112 of &#945;-tubulin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), is likely to be different from that of charged residues of the &#945;4 helix and might be related to that of another specificity of kinesin-13s, a one residue insertion in L11, which is described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>An insertion in the L11 loop is important for activity</title><p id="Par16">Upon tubulin binding, as in the case of motile kinesins, the Kif2C L11 loop became fully ordered (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Remarkably, in kinesin-13s, the L11 loop is one residue longer than, e.g., in kinesin-1, downstream to the Switch 2 motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To evaluate the contribution of this insertion to the Kif2C mechanism, we deleted either the Kif2 specific residue Gly499 (G499del mutant) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) or the neighboring Ala500 (A500del), or replaced the Ser503-Ser504 motif by one glycine (SS-to-G). We found that the G499del and A500del Kif2C-(sN+M) deletion mutants have lost the ability to depolymerize microtubules and that this activity is substantially reduced in the case of the SS-to-G mutant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These results show that the length of the loop is what matters and not so much the nature of the additional residue. As a reference, a G499A mutant behaved as wild-type Kif2C-(sN+M). Moreover, when the shortened L11 loop mutants in stoichiometric amounts compared to tubulin were tested in the turbidity assay used to monitor microtubule disassembly, instead of a decrease, we observed a signal increase (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, inset) likely resulting from microtubules bundling as indicated by an electron microscopy characterization (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The kinesin-13 specific one-residue insertion in the L11 loop is required for microtubule depolymerization. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Turbidity traces of 2&#8201;&#956;M microtubules in the presence of 0.1&#8201;&#956;M wild-type Kif2C-(sN+M) or of Kif2C proteins mutated in the L11 loop, as indicated.

</p><p id="Par17">When these results are considered in light of the structure of the tubulin&#8211;Kif2C (sN+M) complex, it is clear that Gly499 may interact with the N-terminal end of the &#945;-tubulin H12 helix (with Glu417 in particular) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), an interaction that may be prevented by shortening L11. The D506A mutation, which has a milder effect, might proceed similarly by weakening the anchoring point to this tubulin region. Overall, our results suggest that this interaction is important for the catalytic disassembly of microtubules by Kif2C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The KVD motif points to the tubulin longitudinal interface</title><p id="Par18">In agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, in the tubulin&#8211;Kif2C&#8211;DARPin structure, the Kif2C KVD motif at the tip of the L2 hairpin interacts with the distal end of the tubulin &#945; subunit (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), corresponding to the inter-tubulin longitudinal interface of a protofilament. The contribution of the L2 loop leads Kif2C to bury a larger surface with the &#945; subunit (about 1000&#8201;&#197;<sup>2</sup>) than with &#946;-tubulin (about 720&#8201;&#197;<sup>2</sup>), different from kinesin-1 in which the buried surface is more evenly distributed between the two tubulin subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. At the current resolution, the KVD binding mode is indistinguishable from that inferred from the model we have built based on kinesin-1 bound to tubulin (see Fig. 3 in Ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). In particular, the KVD Lys297 residue of Kif2C is in the vicinity of acidic residues (Asp431, Glu434) of the &#945;-tubulin H12 helix. Interestingly, the opposite (N-terminal) end of this helix also interacts with Kif2C, but with L11 and &#945;4 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In contrast to other tubulin-interacting elements (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>), the L2 hairpin did not change orientation upon tubulin binding. Indeed, after superposition of ADP-Kif2C (pdb id 2HEH) on Kif2C in the complex, whereas the overall r.m.s.d. was about 1.3&#8201;&#197; (see above), that of the 16 residues forming the L2 extension (from Val291 to Asn306) was substantially lower (0.66&#8201;&#197;) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This observation confirms that the L2 hairpin is an element of the rigid P-loop subdomain in Kif2C (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), as its shorter version in kinesin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The neck helix orientation and the depolymerization activity</title><p id="Par19">In the crystal structure, the neck helix pointed toward the solvent and interacted neither with the Kif2C motor domain nor with tubulin (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This orientation is different from that observed in the structures of isolated kinesin-13s, in which, most often, the neck helix interacts with the motor domain and in particular with the L2 hairpin (e.g., pdb id 4UBF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, 2HEH, 2GRY, see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

Altogether with a gel filtration analysis that did not show dimerization of monomeric Kif2C-(sN+M), these results suggest that helix swapping was stabilized in the crystal but occurs rarely in solution.

</p><p id="Par20">To validate this hypothesis, we targeted the interaction of the neck helix with the motor domain core and prepared the L304R mutant and the M235Q-I236E double mutant. The Kif2 highly conserved Leu304 residue (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), which belongs to the L2 hairpin, points to a hydrophobic cavity of the neck helix boxed in by residues Phe232, Met235, Ile236, and Phe239 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). We reasoned that the L304R mutation should destabilize the L2&#8211;neck interaction, as should the mutation of the neck residues Met235 and Ile236, also well conserved and which are at the hydrophobic interface with the motor domain. Whereas these mutants had a microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity that is similar to that of the wild-type protein (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), they were unable to disassemble microtubules (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Instead, when a higher concentration of L304R mutant was tested in the turbidity assay used to monitor microtubule depolymerization, we observed an increase of the turbidity signal associated with microtubules bundling (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), as was already the case of the deletion mutants in L11 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The behavior of L304R suggests that the neck is involved in microtubule bundling. As additional support to this hypothesis, we deleted one residue in the L11 loop of a (neck-less) Kif2C motor domain construct and did not observe any bundling from this construct.</p><p id="Par21">Apart from the L304R and M235Q-I236E mutations, designed to push the neck helix away from the motor domain, we also introduced proline residues in the neck helix to destabilize its helical nature. The corresponding mutants (A233P and R240P) were less efficient microtubule depolymerases, retaining about half of the activity of wild-type Kif2C-(sN&#8201;+&#8201;M) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The activity of a double mutant A233P-R240P was further decreased (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Interestingly, this activity could only be conveniently measured at low Kif2C protein concentration (e.g., 0.1&#8201;&#956;M A233P-R240P; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Starting from 0.2&#8201;&#956;M mutant concentration added to 2&#8201;&#956;M microtubular tubulin, a bundling activity took place and this activity predominated at higher A233P-R240P concentrations, as inferred from the variation of the turbidity signal (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">Finally, beyond the neck helix, the ca. 12 N-terminal residues of our Kif2C-(sN+M) construct bound to tubulin were not seen in the electron density maps, a feature shared with the structures of isolated kinesin-13s.

</p><p id="Par24">Our data also clarify the structural role of the neck in the microtubule disassembly mechanism. Whereas the neck helix orientation we found has not been observed previously in structures of isolated kinesin-13s, this orientation likely results from a helix swapping mechanism stabilized in the crystal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by mutations aiming to disrupt the interaction of the neck helix with the motor domain, which lead to depolymerization-defective mutants (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Collectively these data support a model wherein the neck helix interaction with the motor domain is conserved from free Kif2C to Kif2C bound to tubulin (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In this last case, the neck helix points toward the distal end of the tubulin &#945; subunit, as does the KVD motif at the tip of the L2 hairpin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), bringing the neck N-terminal peptide in the vicinity of the longitudinal interface of this tubulin subunit. There, it contributes to the binding affinity of Kif2C for tubulin, because removing the neck region of our Kif2C-(sN+M) construct leads to a 20-fold increase of the corresponding <italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Because it is disordered in the complex we studied, this N-terminal peptide possibly targets some tubulin flexible parts, e.g., the C-terminal tails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and therefore is expected to remain flexible. Consistently, microtubules treated by subtilisin, which cleaves the tubulin C-terminal tails, are resistant to disassembly induced by the <italic>Xenopus</italic> kinesin-13 XKCM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Such a dynamic interaction involving the N-terminal peptide is also consistent with the behavior of neck helix mutants. Whereas a helix deletion mutant is inactive, as is also the case of the neck helix-motor domain interface mutants mentioned above, the mutation of neck helix residues to a proline leads to partially active kinesins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), suggesting that the neck helix works at least in part as a spacer that brings the N-terminal neck residues close to tubulin. For full activity, though, a precise interaction with the motor domain is required.</p><p id="Par25">We recently proposed that each Kif2C monomer removes two tubulin heterodimers per catalytic cycle of microtubule disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this framework, the N-terminal part of the neck, whose potential length is sufficient to reach a neighboring tubulin molecule positioned as along a curved protofilament<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, seems ideally placed to interact with this second tubulin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In synergy, the KVD motif would target the longitudinal interface of this assembly, with Asp299 also in position to interact with this neighboring tubulin, in particular with basic residues of the &#946; subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These interactions would stabilize a 2:1 tubulin:Kif2C complex which ultimately detaches from microtubule ends. Such a complex is consistent with electron microscopy data showing that kinesin-13s stabilize similar curved protofilament-like assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Finally, a microtubule bundling activity of Kif2C is unveiled by depolymerization-defective mutants. This activity depends on the presence of the neck, because mutations introduced in a motor-only construct do not lead to bundling. The most likely explanation is that, for bundling, the neck detaches from the motor domain it is bound to and targets a nearby microtubule. Some mutations we have studied were indeed designed to break the interaction between the neck helix and the motor domain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>). But other mutations, which inhibit the depolymerization activity and are farther from the neck helix (e.g., mutations in the L11 loop; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), also lead to bundling. This observation implies that the interaction of the neck with the motor domain, which is needed for the depolymerization activity, is somehow dynamic. This scheme is reminiscent of what is observed in kinesins from other classes, which comprise a second microtubule binding domain in addition to the motor domain. The two microtubule binding domains may bind to the same microtubule, as proposed here in the case of &#8220;functional&#8221; Kif2C. Examples include the kinesin-8 Kif18A, where the additional domain is needed to target the microtubule-(+)-end, either to cap this end or to induce disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The two domains may also target different microtubules, leading to crosslinking and bundling as in the case of &#8220;impaired&#8221; Kif2C. Examples include kinesin-14s, which slide a microtubule with respect to another one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">To sum up, the structure we present enlightens several aspects of the tubulin&#8211;kinesin-13 interface and the Kif2C structural changes upon tubulin binding. Remarkably, many of the mutations that annihilate the depolymerizing activity of Kif2C involve residues that contact curved tubulin, as seen in the complex depicted here, suggesting that stabilizing curved tubulin, in particular in the context of the ends of a microtubule, is critical for the depolymerizing activity of Kif2C. More generally, because there are still few high resolution structures of tubulin&#8211;kinesin complexes, the tubulin&#8211;Kif2C structure will guide the modeling of other such complexes involving depolymerizing but also motile kinesins, some of which also have a depolymerizing activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Constructions and protein purification</title><p id="Par28">Kif2C-DARPin chimerical constructs were obtained by connecting by overlap extension PCR the Kif2C-(sN+M) C-terminal end with the N-terminal end of DARPins using different lengths of (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>n</sub>-based linker.

The R540A mutant behaved differently, with an ATPase activity that was hardly enhanced in presence of microtubules.
