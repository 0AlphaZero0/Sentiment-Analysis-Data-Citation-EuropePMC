As a multifunctional mediator of carcinogenesis, metadherin (MTDH)/astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) overexpression has been associated with numerous types of cancer, with reported roles in tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. At the molecular level, MTDH has been shown to interact with proteins that drive tumorigenesis, including nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF), BRCA2- and CDKN1A (p21Cip1/Waf-1/mda-6)-interacting protein &#945; (BCCIP&#945;) and staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1). Through the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive endometrial and breast cancers, we found that over 25% of all gene expression correlated with MTDH. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we characterized the differences in gene expression between estrogen-treated parental and MTDH-deficient endometrial and breast cancer cells. We also explored a possible interaction between MTDH and ER by immunoprecipitation, and found that MTDH and ER associated in both breast and endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that acute estrogen stimulation promoted the interaction of MTDH with ER in the nucleus. These data, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first evidence that MTDH and ER&#945; interact in the nucleus with estrogen treatment to regulate gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metadherin</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>estrogen</kwd><kwd>endometrial cancer</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metadherin (MTDH), also known as astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) or LYRIC, is a protein encoded by the <italic>MTDH</italic> gene. MTDH is frequently overexpressed in cancers of the breast, prostate, ovary and endometrium, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (<xref rid="b1-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). MTDH influences several oncogenic signaling pathways and transcription factors, such as the Ras, Myc, PI3K/AKT, nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt pathways (<xref rid="b3-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), suggesting that MTDH plays an important role in disease development and progression.</p><p>MTDH is highly basic and contains a transmembrane domain and multiple nuclear localization signals, with reported localizations in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, nucleolus and endoplasmic reticulum. Not surprisingly, distinct interaction partners have been reported for the various locales, allowing MTDH to contribute to a diverse range of intracellular events (<xref rid="b4-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, MTDH has been shown to interact with several proteins to drive tumorigenesis, including NF-&#954;B, promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF), BRCA2- and CDKN1A (p21Cip1/Waf-1/mda-6)-interacting protein &#945; (BCCIP&#945;) and staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1) (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b8-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). MTDH also interacts with the steroid hormone receptors RXRs (RXR&#945;, &#946;, &#947;) to negatively regulate RXR function and RXR-mediated transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="b9-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Recently, some reports have suggested that MTDH overexpression inversely correlates with the estrogen receptor (ER) status, and MTDH may induce resistance to tamoxifen in ER&#945;-positive breast cancer cells (<xref rid="b10-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b12-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the potential association between MTDH and ER. Estrogens control multiple cellular functions via estrogen receptors (ER-&#945; and ER-&#946;), modular proteins that belong to the steroid/nuclear receptor family of intracellular homeostatic regulators. Ligand binding in the cytosol results in conformation changes that promote receptor translocation into the nucleus, thereby promoting gene expression or repression through interactions with chromatin and transcriptional co-regulatory complexes. In this study, we found that the expression of a number of genes correlated with MTDH expression in ER positive cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and we also found a transient interaction of MTDH with ER&#945; following estrogen treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis</title><p>Gene expression data from the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments were downloaded from the TCGA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) data portal for breast and endometrial cancer. For RNA-seq only level 3 data was available. Data at level 3 are already preprocessed, normalized and log2-transformed (for more details see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/about-data/datalevelstypes">https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/about-data/datalevelstypes</ext-link>). In addition, metadata and clinical data were extracted and downloaded to identify clinical parameters, such as endometrial histological types (serous vs. endometrioid), and molecular characteristics, such as ER-positive vs. ER-negative breast cancer. <xref rid="tI-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="table">Table I</xref> shows the patients included in the analysis.</p><p>To abstract unique gene expression data we used the Biometric Research Branch (BRB) ArrayTools (version 2.13.2 for X64 systems) software suite. BRB-ArrayTools was developed by Dr Richard Simon and colleagues, and is an integrated package for visualization and statistical analysis utilizing Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) as the front end, with tools developed in the R statistical system. MTDH expression was correlated with the expression of all other genes in breast and endometrial RNA-seq experiments using rank-based Spearman correlation to allow for non-linear relationships between several gene expression values. To control the false discovery rate (FDR) we used the q-value for statistical significance (qFDR) and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A significant correlation was considered a correlation with a p-value &lt;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> after controlling for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and generation of MTDH-deficient cells</title><p>The human endometrial cancer cell line, ECC1 (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA); all cells were incubated at 37&#176;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Genomic deletions of MTDH were created in the ECC1 cells using 3 pairs of chimeric single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) as previously described (<xref rid="b13-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Briefly, sgRNA oligos were synthesized and cloned into the lentiCRISPR transfer plasmid for virus production. Viral vectors were produced in 293T cells (ATCC), followed by infection of ECC1 cells as described. MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells were selected with 5 <italic>&#181;</italic>g/ml puromycin after 48 h of transduction. MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells were grown at low density for 2 weeks to select clones. MTDH expression was determined by western blot analysis to identify clones with no or low MTDH protein expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray assay and data analysis</title><p>ECC1 and MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% charcoal stripped FBS for 24 h then treated with 10 nM estrogen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or treated with ethanol as a control for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA sample preparation for hybridization and the subsequent hybridization to the Illumina beadchips were performed at the University of Iowa IIHG Genomics Division using the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Briefly, 100 ng total RNA were converted to amplified biotin-aRNA using the Epicentre TargetAmp-Nano Labeling kit for Illumina Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The amplified Biotin-aRNA product was purified through a Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup column (Qiagen) according to modifications from Epicentre (Madison, WI, USA). Subsequently, 750 ng of this product were mixed with Illumina hybridization buffer, placed onto Illumina-Human H12 v4 BeadChips (part no. BD-103-0204), and incubated at 58&#176;C for 17 h, with rocking, in an Illumina hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the arrays were washed, blocked and then stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the Illumina Whole-Genome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay protocol. Beadchips were scanned with the Illumina iScan system (ID #N0534) and data were collected using the GenomeStudio software v2011.1. Microarray data have been deposited at GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>) under the accession no. GSE78182. The microarray data were analyzed for data summarization, normalization and quality control by using BRB ArrayTools (version 2.13.2 for X64 systems) software suite. To select the differentially expressed genes, we used threshold values of &#8805;2 and &#8804;&#8722;2-fold-change and a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value of 0.001. The data were log2-transformed and median centred by genes using the Adjust Data function of Cluster 3.0 software, and then further analyzed with hierarchical clustering with average linkage.

The expression levels of MTDH and ER were detected by western blot analysis in these cells (<xref rid="f1-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and the differences in gene expression between estrogen-treated parental ECC1 cells and MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells were then investigated using microarray assay. By using threshold values of p&lt;0.001 and fold-change &#8805;2 or &#8804;&#8722;2, the ECC1 cells had 46 and the MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells had 42 significantly altered genes induced by estrogen treatment (<xref rid="f1-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Of note, 27 genes were induced by estrogen in both parental the ECC1 and MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells (<xref rid="tII-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). These genes are estrogen induced and not related with MTDH status, and thus these genes may be associated with the function of estrogen receptors independent of MTDH. There were 19 estrogen-regulated genes that were dependent on MTDH expression (<xref rid="tIII-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>).

The IP results revealed that MTDH and ER&#945; can 'pull down' each other following estrogen treatment for 2 h (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We acquired similar results in the MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>We then wished to determine where MTDH and ER&#945; interact in the cell. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of ECC1 cells treated with 10 nM estrogen were immunoprecipitated with anti-ER&#945; antibody, followed by immunoblotting with ER&#945; or MTDH antibody. The results indicated that the interaction of MTDH and ER&#945; occurs in the nucleus (<xref rid="f2-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we detected the co-localization of MTDH and ER by immunostaining in a subset of cells in ER-positive breast cancer and endometrial cancer tissues (<xref rid="f3-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cancer progression is a multifactorial process that includes alterations in proliferation, cell death, apoptosis, genetic instability, and changes in the expression and activity of tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, growth factors and cell adhesion molecules (<xref rid="b14-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b16-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The overexpression of MTDH is frequently observed in most human cancers, and several studies have suggested that MTDH may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, progression and regulation of apoptosis. Estrogen receptors are overexpressed in approximately 70% of breast and endometrium tumors. Similar to MTDH, estrogen signaling through ER promotes cell proliferation and survival and inhibits apoptosis, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that the expression of many genes correlated with the expression of MTDH in ER-positive cancers using TCGA data, and we defined an interaction between MTDH and ER by co-IP. Our data suggest that the interaction is dependent on estrogen and is a short-term process.</p><p>ERs are involved in pathological processes, including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, osteoporosis, hypertension and coronary artery diseases (<xref rid="b17-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b19-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). One of the main risk factors for endometrial cancer is high levels of estrogen (<xref rid="b20-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, we used the human endometrial cancer cell line, ECC1, and MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells, treated with or without estrogen, and assessed the gene expression profiles by microarray assay. Our results demonstrated that most estrogen-induced genes were common in the ECC1 cells and MTDH-deficient ECC1 cells, indicating that approximately 60% of the genes induced by estrogen were unrelated with the MTDH status, and that MTDH may only participate in parts of ER function.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that MTDH interacts with and activates the transcription factor, NF-&#954;B, to regulate gene expression (<xref rid="b3-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ijmm-40-02-0303" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In this study, we found that MTDH transiently interacted with ER in the nucleus of cancer cells, the interaction is dependent on estrogen and it is a short-term process. Based on this time course, the biological function of this transient interaction may relate to the transcriptional activity of ER&#945;. Indeed, the long-standing dogma in the hormone receptor field is that ligand binding and receptor-mediated transcriptional activation are highly transient events. Microarray data indicated that MTDH had some effect on estrogen-regulated genes, and they jointly control the expression of a subset of ER-regulated genes. MTDH thus may play an important role early in ER-mediated transcriptional regulation. Further studies on understanding the interaction of MTDH with ER and the related genes may provide new insight into the function of MTDH and ER in tumors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants R01CA184101 (to X.M. and K.K.L.) and R01CA99908 (to K.K.L.) and by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research Development Fund (to K.K.L.).
