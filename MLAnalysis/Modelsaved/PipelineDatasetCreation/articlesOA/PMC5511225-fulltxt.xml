A total of 705 samples collected from 9 provinces in China between January 2008 and February 2015 were identified as HRSV-positive and were subsequently sequenced. Of these, 336 samples were HRSV subgroup A (HRSVA), 368 samples were HRSV subgroup B (HRSVB), and 1 sample contained both HRSVA and HRSVB. These 705 HRSV sequences, together with 766 HRSV sequences downloaded from GenBank, were analyzed to understand the recent circulation patterns of HRSV in China. HRSVB predominated in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, whereas HRSVA predominated in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons; HRSVA and HRSVB co-circulated during 2012/2013 and 2014/2015. Phylogenetic analysis showed most of the HRSVA sequences clustered into 2 genotypes, namely, NA1 and ON1. The ON1 genotype was first detected in China in 2011, and it quickly replaced the NA1 genotype to become the most prevalent HRSVA genotype circulating in China between 2013 and 2015. Continuous epidemiological surveillance and molecular characterization of HRSV should be conducted to monitor the evolution of HRSV in China.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the leading causes of acute respiratory tract infection in young children (&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;5 years old), the elderly or immunocompromised patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In 2005, about 33.8 million new episodes of HRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years of age. Among these patients, approximately 66,000&#8211;199,000 died from the infection, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In China, a study of 28,369 patients with ALRI from 81 (out of 108) sentinel hospitals in 22 provinces showed that the most frequently detected virus was HRSV (9.9%), and HRSV was the most common etiology (17.0%) in children younger than 2 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In New York City, HRSV infection was a major cause for hospitalization due to respiratory infection for patients with age&#8201;&lt;&#8201;4 or&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;75 years old; these patients may need additional control measures to mitigate the risk of infection during HRSV seasons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Annual infection rate of HRSV in the USA ranged from 2% to 10% in community-dwelling older adults, and 5% to 10% in older adults living in congregate settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, HRSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection is a big concern for public health.</p><p id="Par3">HRSV is a member of the <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> subfamily in the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. It consists of a non-segmented, single-strand negative RNA genome packaged in a lipid envelope. The genome of HRSV is about 15.2&#8201;kb in length and encodes 10 genes and 11 proteins: NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The F protein and G protein are the major surface glycoproteins. Both of them can stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies. The sequence of the F protein is highly conserved, while that of the G protein is hypervariable. Due to the genetic diversity in the G gene, sequence encoding the second hypervariable region in the C-terminal (HVR2) of the G protein has been used for genotyping of HRSV. According to the genetic characteristic and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, HRSV is classified into 2 subgroups, A (HRSVA) and B (HRSVB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To date, there are 15 genotypes of HRSVA (GA1-GA7, SAA1, CB-A, NA1-4 and ON1-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and 24 genotypes of HRSVB (GB1-GB4, SAB1-SAB4, URU1-2, BA1-12, GB5/CB1 and CBB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Most of the 242 samples (228; 94.21%) were collected from inpatients, and the rest (14; 5.8%) were from outpatients. The age of the patients ranged from 1&#8201;day to 75 years old, with median age being 2.28 years old. Most of the patients were less than 4 years old (92.15%) and the majority of the patients (53.11%) were less than 1 year old. The male to female ratio was 2.13:1 (68.05% vs 31.95%).

For the surveillance of HRSV infection between 2008 to 2015 in China, we found that HRSVA and HRSVB occasionally co-circulated in the same HRSV season, but more often, one predominant subgroup was observed in each season (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). HRSVB was the predominant subgroup in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons, while HRSVA was prevalent in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons. However, both HRSVA and HRSVB co-circulated in China from September 2012 to March 2014, whereas HRSVA subsequently became the predominant subgroup during the 2014/2015 season. Moreover, of all the sequences included in the analysis, 216 of them were ON1 genotype, which had a 72-nucleotide duplication in the sequence encoding the C-terminal of the G protein. The first ON1 genotype sample identified in this study was isolated in Shanghai province in February 2011. Following that, a total of 12 (5.56%) ON1 genotype sequences were identified from 2011 to 2013, and a total of 203 sequences (93.98%) of the ON1 genotype were detected in 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b and c</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">For the yearly and geographic distribution of HRSVA genotypes in China from 2008 to 2015, the NA1 genotype was the predominant genotype found in Beijing, Gansu, Shanghai, Chongqing, and the Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR) between 2008 and 2012, and circulated in Jilin, Hebei, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Tibet provinces between 2009 and 2013 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b and c</xref>).

However, the GA2 genotype was replaced by the NA1 genotype from 2008 to 2013 in China. The NA1 genotype was first reported in Beijing of China from 2007 to 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and circulated in Chongqing between 2009 and 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, the NA1 genotype was also detected in Beijing and Chongqing, as well as in Gansu, Shanghai, Hong Kong SAR from 2008 to 2012 and expanded to circulate in other provinces, such as Jilin, Hebei, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Tibet between 2009 and 2013. These data indicated that the NA1 genotype had circulated throughout mainland China from 2008 to 2013. The circulation of the NA1 genotype was also widely reported during the same HRSV seasons in Canada, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and other countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Similarly, the ON1 genotype was first detected in Canada in 2010, and its detection has been reported in the USA, Latvia, Germany, Cyprus, Kenya, China, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Western India, Thailand and other countries since then<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our study, the ON1 genotype was first detected in Shanghai in February 2011, which was earlier than its detection in Beijing in 2012 as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. After that, the ON1 genotype became more and more prevalent, and replaced the NA1 genotype to become the predominant genotype in China between 2013 and 2015. Globally, the ON1 genotype has been reported in 21 countries and was evolving and disseminating quickly throughout the world with different ON1 lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Based on the high prevalence and quick evolution of the ON1 genotype, it is expected that new lineages would emerge from the this genotype. In our study, we detected a potential new lineage (lineage 1) of the ON1 genotype in samples collected from 2014 to 2015 in China.</p><p id="Par15">The sequence duplication in the ON1 genotype occurs in the HVR2 region of the G protein, an important antigenic region containing multiple epitopes. The structural flexibility of this region allows HRSV to generate variants with changes in key epitopes to overcome the pressure of antibodies raised after a natural infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In additional, the 24-amino acid duplication found in the ON1 genotype increases the length and/or change the structure of the G protein, which may contribute to the antigenicity of the G protein or evade host immunity. Interestingly, a similar sequence insertion was discovered in the HRSVB subgroup years before the discovery of the ON1 genotype: genotype BA with a 20-amino acid insertion in the HVR2 region of the G protein. More importantly, the BA genotype has circulated all over the world and evolved into 12 subgenotypes since its emergence in 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The spread of the BA genotype globally during the past decade suggested that the sequence repeat may provide some advantage to the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Recent report showed that the BA genotype with the sequence duplication had a fitness advantage compared to the virus without the sequence duplication <italic>in vitro</italic>: the 20-amino acid insertion augmented virus attachment and fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The ON1 genotype has circulated in many countries during the past 5 years since its emergence in 2010. Continuous molecular epidemiology surveillance needs to be conducted to determine if the sequence insertion also influences the transmissibility of the ON1 genotype and if the ON1 genotype circulates widely and for a long period of time like the BA genotype.</p><p id="Par16">When compared with the first identified ON1 genotype sequence (Canada strain, ON67&#8211;1210, GenBank number: JN257693), a number of Chinese ON1 sequences identified in this study had 2 amino acid substitutions in the G protein: T249I and E262K. Sequences with these 2 substitutions clustered into a new lineage, named lineage 1 in this study. Both substitutions were detected in Beijing, Shandong and Jilin provinces in 2014 and 2015. The lineage 1 sequences from Beijing were classified as a new branch named ON1/NB previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The 3 provinces with lineage 1 sequences were located in northern and eastern China, where winter and spring last longer than most of the other parts of China. Studies had shown that for both HRSV subgroups, the geographical and temporal factors may play a role in the their genetic evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Although the impact of these 2 substitutions to the biologic function of the G protein was not clear to date, these 2 amino acids are located close to the antigenic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Due to these substituions, the property of the amino acids changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic for residue 249, and from acidic to alkaline for residue 262. Both changes might affect the antigenicity of the protein and/or viral attachment to the host. Residue 249 is close to the antigenic site at amino acids 250&#8211;258<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and this site has been suggested to be under positive selective pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Residue 262 had also been suggested to undergo adaptive evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Interesting, while substitution from Glu to Lys at residue 262 (E262K) was detected in samples from lineage 1 in the ON1 genoype, the same amino acid (Lys) is found at the same residue (262) in sequences of the GA2 and NA4 genotypes (i.e. K262). As shown in this study, the GA2 and NA4 genotypes had not circulated in China in recent years, while the NA1 genotype was found circulating widely in China from 2008 to 2013. The residue 262 of the G protein of the NA1 genotype was Glu, which was different from Met found at the same residue in the reference strain (Long). The biological significance of the substitution at residue 262 from Glu (e.g. NA1 and ON1 except lineage 1) to Lys (e.g. GA2, NA4 and lineage 1) or from Met (e.g. Long) to Glu (e.g. NA1 and ON1 except lineage 1) remains to be determined.</p><p id="Par17">The genotype-specific substitutions identified in the NA3 genotype included S283P, as well as N255D and S280H which have been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Substitution S283P was found in all of our NA3 sequences, whereas substitutions N255D and S280H occurred in most of the genotype NA3 sequences with the exception that 2 sequences had no substitutions at residue 255, but had S280Y instead of S280H. Meanwhile, the genotype NA4-specific substitutions N237H, T239S, I244G, and L274Q were found in all of the NA4 sequences in this study. Substitution N242I was identified as a genotype NA4-specific substitution from samples collected in Beijing previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, but a mixure of 2 different substittuions were identified at residue 242 in NA4 sequences analyzed in this study: N242I (in a total of 3 sequences from Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing) and N242T (in 2 sequences from Shanghai). The significance of the genotype-specific substitutions requires further investigation.</p><p id="Par18">Among the 337 HRSVA sequences generated in this study, 52 of them were from clinical isolates and the rest of them were from clinical samples that have not been passaged <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have compared these 52 sequences with the sequence of a reference strain (Long strain) and sequences from clinical samples. No specific amino acid changes were detected in sequences from clinical isolates; the substitutions detected in the sequences from these 52 clinical isolates were also found in sequences from clinical samples.</p><p id="Par19">There were some limitations of our study due to the difference of sample collection in each year or geographic location that may impact the estimation of the prevalence of HRSVA genotypes in China: fewer samples were collected in 2008&#8211;2009, the number of samples from each province was different, and samples were not collected from some provinces every year. Also, samples were collected from 14 representative provinces instead of from all provinces in China. Due to the large amount of data generated from the analysis of Chinese HRSVA and HRSVB sequences in this project, results of the analysis for HRSVA and HRSVB sequences are described in separate reports.</p><p id="Par20">In conclusion, this is an extensive study to investigate the yearly and geographic distribution of HRSV in 14 provinces in China from 2008 to 2015. After 5 years of consecutive circulation in mainland China from 2008 to 2012, the NA1 genotype appeared to have been replaced by the ON1 genotype in recent years. The ON1 genotype, detected as early as in 2011 in Shanghai, has become the predominant HRSVA genotype circulating in China between 2013 and 2015. Due to the widespread transmission and rapid evolution of HRSV, continuous and long-term epidemiological surveillance and molecular characterization need to be conducted to provide the scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of HRSV infection in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par21">In this study, there was no human experimentation; only nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal precipitates were collected from patients who were identified as potentially infected with HRSV infection.
