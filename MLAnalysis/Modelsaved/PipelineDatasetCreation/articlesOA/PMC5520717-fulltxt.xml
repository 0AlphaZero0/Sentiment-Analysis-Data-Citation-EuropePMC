Syngeneic recipients repopulated with GFP<sup>+</sup> APL cells were treated with or without ATRA or ATO for 6 days, and GFP<sup>+</sup> APL cells within the BM were collected for RNA sequencing and other analyses. In agreement with the data from the previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Both ATRA and ATO reduced PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> level, whereas ATRA but not ATO reduced RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Both ATRA and ATO resulted in differentiation of APL cells as evidenced by morphological alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Flow cytometry analyses showed that ATRA or ATO treatment for 6 days resulted in a partial myeloid differentiation as indicated by elevated CD11b expression, and a mild c-Kit reduction was detected following ATRA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>, upper panel). Interestingly, both ATRA and ATO also mildly induced the expression of granulocytic lineage marker Gr-1 but not that of monocytic/dendritic lineage marker CD11c of the CD11b<sup>+</sup> APL sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>, bottom panel).

Nevertheless, the extent to which ATRA or ATO corrects the dysregulated gene pool in APL progenitors remains largely unexplored. In this regard, the identity for the cells of origin of APL remains undetermined, and they might originate from multiple stages of myeloid progenitors (MPs), including granulocytic and monocytic precursor (GMP), common myeloid precursor (CMP), and even megakaryotic and erythroid precursor (MEP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> To make this issue more complicated, the leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) were recently shown to reside at more than one differentiation stages in all subtypes of human AML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Therefore, in a comprehensive manner, we first delineated a pool of genes that were differentially expressed between all c-Kit<sup>+</sup> APL progenitor cells and the normal BM c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>&#8722;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#8722;</sup> subpopulation that are enriched with multiple types of MPs, including CMP, GMP, MEP, monocytic progenitor and granulocytic progenitor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and assumed the differentially expressed genes as a likely candidate 1pool of dysregulated genes in immature APL cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, the expressions of 916 genes were downregulated, whereas those of 865 genes were upregulated in the immature c-Kit<sup>+</sup> APL progenitors (fold change &gt;1.5, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Surprisingly, the overlap analyses between the ATRA/ATO-responsive genes and the dysregulated genes showed that only ~10% of these potentially dysregulated genes were ATRA/ATO-responsive genes, leaving about 90% of them basically refractory to ATRA or/and ATO signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Reference to a well-characterized PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>-target gene pool that was identified in human APL cells revealed that 101 potentially downregulated genes in the APL progenitors were the direct target genes of PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Similarly, only ~10% of these genes (13 out of 101) were significantly upregulated by ATRA or ATO, whereas 88 were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, upper panel). In a similar rate, of 125 potentially upregulated PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>-target genes in the APL progenitors, 8 were downregulated by ATRA or ATO, whereas 117 were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Next, we focused on characterizing the biological nature of those 88 repressed but ATRA/ATO-refractory genes. Gene ontology analysis indicated that 15 of them belonged to transcription factors or signal transducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Of note, these potential key regulators of myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation included several well-documented tumor suppressors such as <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Ldb1</italic> and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>The repressed but ATRA/ATO-refractory genes in APL progenitors contain an Irf8-centered regulatory pathway of AML</title><p>Then, we explored whether a potentially dysregulated myelopoiesis regulatory pathway was embedded within these repressed but ATRA/ATO signaling-refractory genes in the APL progenitors. Given the critical functions of transcription factors in normal or leukemic hematopoiesis, we addressed this issue by inspecting the transcription factors included in this gene pool, especially the top 10 most suppressed ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2a and b</xref>). Interestingly, The Cancer Genome Atlas data indicated that the mRNA levels of <italic>MEIS1</italic>, <italic>IRF8</italic> and <italic>MEF2C</italic>, which constitute an IRF8-centered innate immunity pathway that suppressed the malignancy of AML cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> but not the other transcription factors, were lower in APL cases than in other subtypes of AML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2c</xref>). This result indicated that this IRF8-centered pathway was commonly dysregulated in human APL cases.

In support of this, previous studies have shown that human APL progenitors bear monocytic differentiation potential in certain cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> in addition to their well-documented granulocytic differentiation potential. Similarly, we observed that the expression of several genes that marked monocytic maturation, such as <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Tlr7</italic>, and the expression of a few granulocytic genes were upregulated with the spontaneous maturation of the c-Kit<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>++</sup> APL cells from c-Kit<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> or cKit<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>&#8722;</sup>AA4.1<sup>++</sup> APL progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated two essential roles for <italic>Irf8</italic> in the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation: promoting the maturation of the monocytic lineage at the expense of granulocytic maturation from GMPs and the terminal maturation or survival of two types of dendritic cells (DCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>Irf8</italic> repression served as a key PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>-driven oncogenic mechanism to restrict monocytic/dendritic differentiation leakage of the APL progenitors, which otherwise would erode their leukemogenic potential. Consistent with this notion, PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> overexpression inhibited <italic>Irf8</italic> induction, which was accompanied by DC differentiation retardation from the normal Lin<sup>&#8722;</sup> immature hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4a and b</xref>).</p><p><italic>Irf8</italic> induction <italic>in vivo</italic> induced the generation of monocytic/dendritic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas <italic>Irf8</italic> knockdown increased the generation of granulocytic Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells from APL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and b</xref>). Analogous to this phenomenon, <italic>Irf8</italic> induction also promoted the monocytic/dendritic differentiation of APL cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4c and d</xref>). Furthermore, RT-PCR assay showed that <italic>Irf8</italic> induction promoted the expression of monocytic/dendritic differentiation-related genes and inhibited granulocytic differentiation and stemness maintenance-related gene expression, which was reversed to what was observed after <italic>Irf8</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c&#8211;e</xref>). <italic>Irf8</italic>-induced APL cells consistently displayed a monocytic rather than a granulocytic cell-like morphology, whereas APL cells in the sh<italic>Irf8</italic>-3G mice still morphologically resembled immature MPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, <italic>Irf8</italic> induction did not alter PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> degradation and the PML nuclear body (NB) structure or increase p53 and p21 expressions, which was shown to be related to downstream pathways of ATRA and ATO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4e&#8211;h</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Irf8</italic> knockdown but not <italic>Irf8</italic> induction moderately decreased <italic>&#946;</italic>-catenin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4g and h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> has been shown to act via more than one route, the fusion protein transforms MPs and maintains their malignancy largely by interfering with the transcription of genes whose dynamic expression (regulated by physiological cues, such as RA) is required to execute stepwise and branching myeloid differentiations. In this study, we characterized how the transcription profile of APL cells was altered by ATRA or ATO administration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similar to the data from the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of human APL cell lines, our expression analyses indicated that ATRA specifically promoted granulocytic differentiation. Nevertheless, unlike what was suggested by the previous studies &#8211; ATO mainly induced apoptosis rather than myeloid differentiation of APL cells &#8211; we showed a granulocytic differentiation-promoting effect of ATO that was even stronger than the inducing effect of ATRA administration. The underlying reason for this discrepancy between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies is currently unclear. However, it can be postulated that, although ATO induced a significant activation of p53 signaling pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, a likely resultant apoptosis-inducing effect on APL cells could be counteracted by the supportive role of the remodeled hematopoietic microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup></p><p>Next, we analyzed whether ATRA or ATO corrected the expressions of all of the dysregulated genes that were potentially involved in the maintenance of immaturity and leukemogenic potential of the immature APL cells. Consistent with the recent observations revealing the differentiational heterogeneity of AML LSCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> our cell-sorting and transplantation experiments indicated that c-Kit<sup>+</sup> APL cells, without or with an obvious CD11b expression, both retained substantial leukemogenic potential. Although the normal counterparts of these c-Kit<sup>+</sup> APL cells within the normal hematopoietic hierarchy have remained unclear, accumulating evidences indicate that the APL LSC most likely originated from the malignant transformation of CMP and GMP, and to a lesser extent from MEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Moreover, c-Kit<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> APL progenitors might developmentally resemble the unipotent monocytic or granulocytic progenitors or even promyelocytes. Therefore, we chose the normal Sca-1<sup>&#8722;</sup>Lin<sup>&#8722;</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> MPs that contain CMPs, GMPs, MEPs, monocytic progenitor and granulocytic progenitors as the normal counterparts of APL progenitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> The comparison of APL progenitors and normal MPs produced a potential pool of dysregulated genes. To further enrich the real dysregulated genes in immature APL cells from this pool, we then overlapped these genes with the pool of PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The observation that the expressions of only ~10% of these repressed genes were significantly reversed by ATRA or ATO indicated that ATRA or ATO was unable to correct all of the transcription repression resulting from PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>. Our results coincided with the previous observation that ATRA was able to correct the expression of ~10% of PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> target genes in human NB4 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Notably, an IRF8-centered regulatory pathway that has been shown to repress AML malignancy through upregulating innate immunity program was identified in this repressed but ATRA/ATO-refractory gene pool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup></p><p>Interestingly, we noticed that <italic>Irf8</italic> expression increased along with a likely spontaneous monocytic/dendritic differentiation of mouse APL cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the reasons behind this monocytic differentiation preference remain obscure and this spontaneous differentiation proceeded in quite a low rate. These observations are interesting within the context of the following three previous findings from other investigators: (1) the LSCs of APL probably differentiationally correspond to normal GMPs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> and therefore possess a bipotent differentiation potential towards granulocytic or monocytic direction; (2) monocytic differentiation can be induced in certain APL cases and also in human APL cell lines;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and (3) <italic>Irf8</italic> itself is a master gene that drives the monoytic differentiation of normal MPs and also promotes the maturation and survival of DCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Taken together, these observations suggest that the repressed <italic>Irf8</italic> expression stands as a potentially crucial mechanism for the maintenance of the immaturity and malignancy of APL LSCs by precluding a possible monocytic maturation leakage. This notion was supported by the Dox-induced expression and knockdown experiments of <italic>Irf8</italic> in APL cells, which showed a function role of <italic>Irf8</italic> to drive monocytic/dendritic differentiation at the expense of granulocytic differentiation, to be accompanied by a reduction in the leukemogenesis of APL cells. Why Irf8 knockdown did not significantly increase the leukemogenic potential of APL is current unclear. One possible explanation is that <italic>Irf8</italic> knockdown might potentiate the leukemogenic potential leakage through accelerating the granulocytic differentiation of immature APL cells. As <italic>Irf8</italic> induction drives a differentiation path of APL cells distinct from that by ATRA or ATO, it may serves an alternative differentiation induction strategy for those APL cases that are basically resistant to ATRA- or ATO-based therapies.</p><p>The reason why so many PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic>-dysregulated genes do not respond to ATRA or ATO treatment despite evidence of the induced PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> degradation and granulocytic differentiation should be determined in the future work. For <italic>Irf8</italic>, we hypothesize that ATRA or ATO exerts dual roles in modulating the expression of <italic>Irf8</italic>. On one hand, the removal of PML/RAR<italic>&#945;</italic> might derepress <italic>Irf8</italic> expression.
