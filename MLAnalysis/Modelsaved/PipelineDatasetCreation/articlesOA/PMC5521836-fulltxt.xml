For example, many long non-coding RNAs have been associated with tumourigenesis and in this context their molecular functions often involves impacting on chromatin and transcriptional control processes. One important cellular control system that is often deregulated in cancer cells is the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Here we have investigated whether ERK pathway signaling in response to EGF stimulation, leads to changes in the production of long non-coding RNAs. We identify several different classes of EGF pathway-regulated lncRNAs. We focus on one of the inducible lincRNAs, <underline>E</underline>GF <underline>i</underline>nducible long intergenic <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>c</underline>oding <underline>R</underline>NA 1 (<italic>EINCR1</italic>). <italic>EINCR1</italic> is predominantly nuclear and shows delayed activation kinetics compared to other immediate-early EGF-inducible genes. In humans it is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is mainly confined to the heart but it exhibits little evolutionary conservation. Importantly, in several cancers <italic>EINCR1</italic> shows elevated expression levels which correlate with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. In the context of lung adenocarcinomas, <italic>EINCR1</italic> expression is anti-correlated with the expression of several protein coding EGF-regulated genes. A potential functional connection is demonstrated as <italic>EINCR1</italic> overexpression is shown to reduce the expression of EGF-regulated protein coding genes including <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSB</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7395-9552</contrib-id><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanley</surname><given-names>Neil A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust to ADS and to NAH (WT088566MA), including the Infrastructural Strategic Support Fund (WT097820).

The discovery of these genes arose due to the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies which indicated that up to 80% of human genome is transcribed [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. LncRNAs are defined as transcripts that are over 200 nucleotides long and do not contain protein coding open reading frames [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Functional studies have implicated lncRNAs in many cellular processes including the regulation of transcription, RNA processing, siRNA attenuation and RNA stabilisation [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]&#8211;[<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over recent years, lncRNAs have become prominent elements of regulatory networks associated with cell growth, differentiation and cancer progression. Many lncRNAs have been associated with controlling gene expression (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) with arguably the best studied lncRNA being <italic>MALAT1</italic> and its role in cancer. For example, <italic>MALAT1</italic> was recently shown to be a critical factor in breast cancer metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These findings have triggered other studies into the role of lncRNAs in cancer. For example RNA-seq experiments in prostate cancer cells identified 121 novel lncRNA associated with that disease [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further investigation of the most upregulated lncRNA, <italic>PCAT1</italic>, indicated that it is predominantly repressive in nature and it influences expression of genes associated with mitosis and cell cycle. Recently, it has been shown that transcription of <italic>PCAT1</italic> is regulated by a specific distal regulatory element (via ONECUT2 transcription factor) and that <italic>PCAT1</italic> itself is regulates expression of androgen receptor late response genes in LSD1-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The identification of additional lncRNAs whose expression changes in disease states or in response to cellular signalling would therefore likely identify new potential regulatory molecules that are important in signal-dependent processes.</p><p>The EGF signaling pathway and its effects on protein coding gene expression has been extensively studied and represents an excellent model system in which to identify and investigate the function of lncRNAs. For example previous studies using the human MCF10A breast epithelial cell line have identified dynamic changes in the expression of protein coding genes and miRNAs following EGF induction [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Protein coding genes which are upregulated are typically from the immediate-early class of genes including well studied genes like <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>EGR1</italic>. Many of the genes activated by EGF signaling encode transcription factors that propagate downstream transcriptional events. However, a number of feedback loops are triggered that act to turn off or moderate the levels of the initial transcriptional wave, including a role for miRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The immediate-early genes are also activated by different growth factors and other mitogenic signals through activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Importantly, EGF receptor tyrosine kinases and the downstream ERK pathway are commonly upregulated in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], meaning that the identification of novel downstream effector molecules is potentially important for enhancing our understanding of the tumourigenic process. Here we used RNA-seq to identify EGF-regulated lncRNAs and identify several different classes of lncRNA. We focus on one of the lincRNAs, <underline>E</underline>GF <underline>i</underline>nducible long intergenic <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>c</underline>oding <underline>R</underline>NA 1 (<italic>EINCR1</italic>), and characterise its transcriptional activation mechanism, its subcellular localisation, its expression profile and potential role in controlling gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification EGF-inducible lncRNAs</title><p>To identify lncRNAs that are inducible by EGF pathway signalling, we treated non-tumourigenic human breast epithelial MCF10A cells with EGF for 30 mins and performed RNA-seq. We focussed on the nuclear RNA fraction as many lncRNAs are known to be preferentially localised to this subcellular compartment [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We identified a total of 482 transcripts (&gt;200 bp) that are upregulated or downregulated by EGF (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;0.58, P-value &lt;0.05), the majority of which are upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Well characterised protein coding genes such as <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>EGR1</italic> are among the upregulated genes although lncRNAs are also upregulated including one which we have named <italic>EINCR1</italic>.</p><fig id="pone.0181902.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0181902.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>EGF-stimulation leads to transcriptional induction of lncRNAs.</title><p>(A) Scatter plot of differential gene expression before (0 min) and after (30 min) EGF stimulation.

As expected, for upregulated protein coding genes we observed a general increase of downstream sequencing reads on the sense strand but little indication of significant activity or changes in transcriptional levels either upstream from the TSS or on the anti-sense strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; left panel). In contrast, for upregulated lncRNAs, in addition to the expected increase in downstream sense strand transcription, we also observe a high level of sequencing reads upstream from the TSS on the sense strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, right panel). This indicates the presence of upstream sense strand transcriptional activity in a large proportion of the lncRNAs. To further investigate this phenomenon we plotted the average read densities around the TSS of individual genes and subjected these to cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). There was generally little evidence of transcriptional activity on the sense strand upstream from the TSS of protein coding genes. However, a large number of lncRNA transcripts showed evidence for upstream transcriptional activity on the sense strand of the lncRNA encoding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, bottom panel). This indicates the presence of upstream transcriptional units originating from coding genes as exemplified by the <italic>DUSP5</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, top panel). Here, both the <italic>DUSP5</italic> locus and the downstream lncRNA are EGF-inducible. Little anti-sense activity was detected around the transcriptional start sites for both protein coding and lncRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, right panels). However, there are examples of lncRNAs that are closely positioned in the anti-sense direction downstream from protein coding genes as observed at the <italic>EDN1</italic> locus. This gene is EGF-inducible, and at this locus, the downstream anti-sense lncRNA transcript (termed <italic>EINCR2</italic>) is also EGF inducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>We also examined the RNA levels surrounding genes which are downregulated following EGF treatment. Very few protein coding genes are downregulated but a large number of lncRNAs are downregulated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). In contrast to the EGF-induced lncRNAs, there is evidence for large amounts of anti-sense transcription in the region upstream from the TSS of many EGF-downregulated lncRNAs, suggesting the existence of divergent promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Collectively, this data indicates that many EGF-regulated lncRNAs form a subclass that is located immediately up or downstream from other transcriptionally active genes. In the case of the EGF-inducible lncRNAs, the existence of upstream sense strand transcription units is suggestive of polymerase run-ons from the upstream gene, a phenomenon that has recently been reported by others [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We focussed on the EGF upregulated transcripts and subclassified the lncRNAs according to known genomic annotations or by belonging to the &#8220;polymerase run-on&#8221; or &#8220;anti-sense&#8221; classes identified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).173 of these transcripts (55%) are non-coding RNAs, and of these 67 (21%) are known pseudogenes or are derived from &#8220;polymerase run-ons&#8221;. The rest of the lncRNAs can be subdivided into either antisense or intronic lncRNAs or long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA). We identified 13 known lincRNAs and 76 novel lincRNAs. To validate these findings, we performed RT-qPCR on a selection of EGF up- and down-regulated lincRNAs and observed the expected patterns of regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). The kinetics of activation and repression varied across a 6 hour time course depending on the lincRNA studied. For example, XLOC-036745 is rapidly induced and rapidly returns to basal levels within 1 hour of stimulation whereas XLOC-014669 (<italic>EINCR1</italic>) shows more sustained activation beyond 90 mins.</p><p>We have therefore identified a large number of lncRNAs that are either up or downregulated following EGF stimulation that can be subcategorised into different classes. Due to its rapid and sustained induction kinetics and also its genomic location which is clearly distinct from any neighbouring genes, we decided to focus on characterising one of the lincRNAs <italic>EINCR1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title><italic>EINCR1</italic> is an EGF regulated lincRNA</title><p><italic>EINCR1</italic> is located &gt;50 kb from the nearest annotated coding gene, indicating that it should be classified as a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA). To establish whether <italic>EINCR1</italic> is a true non-coding RNA, we examined its coding potential using PhyloCSF [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>EINCR1</italic> scored as a non-coding RNA like <italic>XIST</italic> rather than a protein coding gene such as <italic>GAPDH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Next we asked whether <italic>EINCR1</italic> is associated with the ribosomal fraction, and hence its likelihood for undergoing translation. In the presence of cycloheximide, there was little difference between <italic>EINCR1</italic> levels and <italic>GAPDH</italic> levels associated with the ribosomal fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, top). However, upon treatment with EDTA, <italic>GAPDH</italic> was released from the ribosome as expected for an RNA undergoing translation upon ribosomal subunit dissociation, whereas the relative levels of <italic>EINCR1</italic> increased, suggesting that any association was likely due to contamination during the fractionation process, rather than undergoing active translation. These results therefore indicate that EINCR1 is a non-coding RNA but we cannot rule out that under some circumstances, short peptides might be generated from the EINCR1 transcript.</p><fig id="pone.0181902.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0181902.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title><italic>EINCR1</italic> is an EGF-regulated, nuclear long intergenic non-coding RNA.</title><p>(A) Cumulative phyloCSF scores of <italic>EINCR1</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>XIST</italic>.

First we compared the extent of the transcription unit we had identified with the annotated transcripts in this genomic region. Two putative non-coding RNAs, RP11-7F17.7 and RP11-7F17.1 (also known as LINC01629 or linc-KIAA1737-2) had previously been documented in this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Our RNAseq data provide supporting data for the existence of two of the annotated exons, indicating that transcript splicing occurs and the <italic>EINCR1</italic> transcription unit appears to span these two loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). We confirmed the existence of the splice junction by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Next we established the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the <italic>EINCR1</italic> lincRNA by 5&#8217; RACE. The start site we identified is located two bp upstream from the one identified for RP11-7F17.7 and corresponds exactly with the most common start site identified in CAGE data from cell lines examined by the FANTOM5 consortium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181902.s002">S2B Fig</xref>; [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). The region surrounding this TSS is highly conserved amongst other primates and is also well conserved with rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, while the promoter region is conserved, the region further downstream from the TSS shows much lower conservation in rodents, suggesting a lack of functional conservation for the lincRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, middle). There is a putative TATA-like element which is specific to humans and is potentially associated with promoter functionality in this species. We also examined the histone marks which are associated with the locus in MCF7 cells and found evidence for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac which demarcate active chromatin regions but little sign of the repressive marks H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, bottom). However, the H3K4me3 peak is not located close to the TSS as commonly found in active genes and the H3K27ac mark is spread over a wide area rather than delineating a single promoter or enhancer unit. We also examined RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq data from EGF stimulated HeLa cells and found regions of enrichment around the TSS and H3K4me3 peak which increased in magnitude following EGF induction and spread across the entire locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, bottom), consistent with the EGF-inducible transcription of <italic>EINCR1</italic> that we observe in MCF10A cells.

MCF10A cells were stimulated with EGF in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. EINCR1 was efficiently induced following EGF treatment for 15 mins but this response was abolished upon MEK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), indicating that <italic>EINCR1</italic> is induced through ERK pathway signalling. Other EGF-inducible genes like <italic>FOS</italic> belong to the immediate-early class of genes and can be activated in the absence of new protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181902.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

In contrast, although initially <italic>EINCR1</italic> induction kinetics were unaffected, sustained <italic>EINCR1</italic> message production is lost in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that new protein synthesis is essential for the second phase of <italic>EINCR1</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, bottom). EGF stimulation leads to the production of new AP1 complex components such as FOS (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) which might contribute to this later phase of <italic>EINCR1</italic> induction.

Little difference was seen for many cancers as illustrated by bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181902.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

This suggests a potentially reciprocal relationship between <italic>EINCR1</italic> and other EGF-regulated genes. To further explore this phenomenon, we analysed the expression of <italic>EINCR1</italic> and two EGF-inducible genes, <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSB</italic> across the lung adenocarcinoma samples in the TCGA-LUAD dataset.

Here we have identified a large number of lncRNAs whose expression is altered in response to signalling pathway activation following EGF treatment. These lncRNAs belong to different categories but the major class is lincRNAs, of which the majority are novel transcripts. One interesting additional class we identified corresponds to the previously identified &#8220;polymerase run-ons&#8221; which occurs at the 3&#8217; ends of genes where the transcript extends beyond the usual termination site [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the case of <italic>DUSP5</italic>, this could be explained by inefficient transcriptional termination in the face of high levels of EGF-induced transcription. However, there are several instances where the expression of the upstream coding region is unaffected but the &#8220;run-on&#8221; transcription is enhanced following EGF induction. It is not clear what mechanism is involved in lncRNA induction at these loci, nor is it clear what the functional significance of these events is.</p><p>We focussed on one of the EGF inducible lincRNAs, <italic>EINCR1</italic>. This lincRNA is rapidly induced following EGF induction but unlike typical EGF-inducible protein coding genes such as <italic>FOS</italic>, it exhibits extended activation kinetics. <italic>FOS</italic> is classified as an immediate-early gene due to the lack of requirement for protein synthesis for its induction and subsequent super induction following treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. However, while <italic>EINCR1</italic> is still induced in the presence of cycloheximide, its prolonged activation is lost, indicating that it is not susceptible to the same negative feedback loops as <italic>FOS</italic> and requires new protein synthesis for its sustained activation. One such factor appears to be AP1 family transcription factors, several of which are inducible by EGF (including FOS, FOSB, JUN and JUNB). This therefore suggests an interesting regulatory network in which EGF-inducible protein coding genes like <italic>FOS</italic> cause increases in intracellular AP1 levels that enhance the expression of <italic>EINCR1</italic> which in turn could act to dampen down any further activation of EGF-coding genes.</p><p>Our data indicate that <italic>EINCR1</italic> is predominantly nuclear although ideally future studies should utilise additional approaches such as FISH to confirm this and detect potential subnuclear localisation. However its nuclear localisation suggests that <italic>EINCR1</italic> might have a role in controlling gene expression either directly or indirectly through alterations to the underlying chromatin state. Our initial studies point to such a possibility as overexpression of <italic>EINCR1</italic> leads to decreased expression of a cohort of EGF-induced protein coding genes such as <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSB</italic>. This observation is consistent with the observation that in several human cancer subtypes, <italic>EINCR1</italic> is overexpressed, and in the case of lung adenocarcinomas its expression is anti-correlated with the expression of these genes. Thus, one function of <italic>EINCR1</italic> might be to dampen down the levels of gene induction in response to EGF pathway activation. In humans, <italic>EINCR1</italic> is predominantly expressed in the heart, and future studies are needed to study whether <italic>EINCR1</italic> plays a role in modulating the output from receptor tyrosine kinase pathway signalling in this context. Although not highly expressed in the majority of tissues, our observation that <italic>EINCR1</italic> expression is EGF inducible might reflect low basal level expression and yet the potential for activation under defined signalling conditions in a wider cellular context. Moreover, induction by other signalling events might also broaden its expression repertoire and a lincRNA transcribed from the same locus (KIAA1737-2), has been shown to be induced by cytokine treatment of human PTEC kidney cells [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. EINCR1/ KIAA1737-2 might therefore by a commonly upregulated gene that responds to many different stimuli.</p><p><italic>EINCR1</italic> is upregulated in several different cancer subtypes, including lung adenocarcinomas. This is not a general phenomenon shared by all lincRNAs as <italic>MALAT1</italic> is often associated with cancer progression (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0181902.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) but is only upregulated in a subset of the cancers where <italic>EINCR1</italic> is overexpressed. It is not clear what role <italic>EINCR1</italic> might have in the tumourigenic process but as <italic>EINCR1</italic> is a target of the EGF pathway and EGFR-regulated pathways are often activated in cancer cells it appears likely that it might be an important mediator of dysregulated signalling. The reciprocal expression of <italic>EINCR1</italic> and other EGF-regulated protein coding genes suggests a functional relationship which is reinforced by our over-expression studies. Additional work will be needed though to investigate the relevance of this relationship in the context of cancer.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a large number of EGF inducible lincRNAs and shown that one of these, <italic>EINCR1</italic>, is potentially important in the context of human cancer.
