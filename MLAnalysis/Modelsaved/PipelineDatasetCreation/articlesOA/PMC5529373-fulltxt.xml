We also examined angiogenesis (VEGFR2, p-ERK, p-PLCr1/2), hedgehog (Gli1, Ptch1, SMO), and mTOR (pS6K1) signaling pathways to determine the mechanism of action of itraconazole. Furthermore, we evaluated the synergistic effects of itraconazole and paclitaxel using orthotopic mouse models with established EOC cells (SKOV3ip1 or HeyA8) as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Itraconazole treatment inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on EOC cells. The endothelial cell antiproliferative effect was associated with inhibition of hedgehog, and mTOR pathways and angiogenesis. In xenograft models of EOC using SKOV3ip1 or HeyA8, mice treated with the combination of itraconazole and paclitaxel had significantly decreased tumor weight than the control, paclitaxel-alone, or itraconazole-alone groups. Tissue derived from these tumors had significantly lower microvessel density than tissue from the other groups as well as hedgehog and mTOR pathway inhibition. We confirmed those effects in two EOC PDX models. These results suggest that itraconazole selectively inhibits endothelial cells rather than cancer cells by targeting multiple pathways including hedgehog, and mTOR pathways and angiogenesis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the second most common gynecologic cancer. It is the most fatal disease and the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Patients with advanced EOC have a 5-year survival rate of only 40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The standard treatment for EOC is surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant combination chemotherapy. Despite improvements in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, the majority of women with relapsed EOC eventually die from the disease, and there is an unmet and urgent need to improve treatment.</p><p id="Par3">Itraconazole, a widely used antifungal drug, has recently been shown to have anti-cancer effects against several cancer types. It significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in primary xenograft models of human non-small cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a prostate cancer mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The suggested mechanisms of its antitumor effect are inhibition of VEGFR2 and its downstream substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, target of rapamycin (mTOR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, as well as inhibition of hedgehog signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Currently, there are several active clinical trials evaluating itraconazole as a cancer therapeutic in non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02357836), esophageal cancer (NCT02749513), and basal cell carcinoma (NCT02120677). A recent study also reported that itraconazole is a feasible treatment option for metastatic basal cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Several emerging agents with novel targets are in development for treatment of EOC. Among those agents, the addition of bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic agent, to the standard therapy of taxane and carboplatin was shown to significantly improve progression-free survival and arguably has become the standard of care for select patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the overall gain in survival is marginal with a high cost of maintenance. The limitations of anti-VEGF therapy have been attributed to the presence of alternative pathways in pro-angiogenic signaling networks; drugs that can target multiple pathways simultaneously are therefore required.</p><p id="Par5">The purpose of this study was to test the anti-cancer effects of itraconazole on tumor development and growth in EOC models, including orthotopic cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and to determine the possible underlying mechanisms. This study offers the first assessment of the efficacy and mechanisms of itraconazole as an anticancer therapeutic in preclinical models of EOCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Itraconazole significantly affects cell proliferation and apoptosis of endothelial cells but has no direct effects on ovarian cancer cells</title><p id="Par6">Human (HUVEC) and mouse (SVEC4-10) endothelial cells were initially treated with itraconazole for 48&#8201;h to confirm the inhibitory activity of itraconazole on endothelial cell proliferation. Itraconazole inhibited proliferation of HUVEC and SVEC4-10 endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A and B</xref>). To assess the relative specificity of its inhibitory activity on endothelial cells, the antiproliferative effects of itraconazole were examined in an ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3ip1). Itraconazole had no effect on proliferation up to the maximum tested concentration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Apoptosis induction measured by annexin V-incorporation after treatment with itraconazole (250&#8201;nM for HUVEC and 500&#8201;nM for SVEC4-10) resulted in significantly greater apoptosis in itraconazole-treated endothelial cells than control cells, but not in SKOV3ip1 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D and F</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation following treatment with itraconazole.

To test this, HUVEC, SVEC4-10, and SKOV3ip1 cells were incubated in the presence of varying dose of itraconazole, and VEGFR2 expression was determined by Western blotting. Treatment with itraconazole markedly decreased the expression of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A and B</xref>), but not in SKOV3ip1 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).

</p><p id="Par9">Phosphorylation of ERK and phospholipase C gamma 1/2 (PLCr1), a direct binding partner of VEGFR2, was also examined (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D&#8211;F</xref>). In three cell lines, ERK phosphorylation was inhibited 1&#8201;h after itraconazole treatment (HUVEC 1&#8201;uM, SEVC4-10 and SKOV3ip1 1.5&#8201;uM). PLCr1 phosphorylation peaked 30&#8211;60&#8201;min after itraconazole, and the signal decayed thereafter. Itraconazole did not block PLCr2 activation in either endothelial or cancer cells. As itraconazole has been found to affect the hedgehog pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we examined the expression of Gli1, Ptch1, and SMO, which are central for the activation of this pathway. Gli1 were inhibited by itraconazole in endothelial cells, but their levels remained unchanged in SKOV3ip1 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A&#8211;C</xref>). The protein levels of Gli1, Ptch1, and SMO were examined after itraconazole treatment, and signals decayed after peak in endothelial cells, which was not shown in cancer cell (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D&#8211;F</xref>). Next, we determined the effect of itraconazole on the phosphorylation state of S6 kinase, a canonical mTOR substrate. Like rapamycin, itraconazole inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K1 in a dose-dependent manner in endothelial cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G and H</xref>). Inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation was not observed in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting specificity of inhibition in endothelial cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>).

These observations support further development of novel anti-angiogenic strategies for patients with ovarian cancer, including agents with mechanisms of action distinct from currently available monoclonal antibodies and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).</p><p id="Par20">Itraconazole is an orally bioavailable antifungal agent that inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14a-demethylase. Chong <italic>et al</italic>. initially reported that itraconazole inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and blocked several growth factors involved in angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We demonstrated in this study that the antiangiogenic activity of itraconazole is attributable to its ability to inhibit the VEGFR2, hedgehog, and mTOR pathways. Treatment with itraconazole significantly decreased the expression of VEGFR2 and phosphorylation of ERK and phospholipase C gamma 1/2 (PLCr1), a direct binding partner of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The expression of Gli1, Ptch1, and SMO, markers of the hedgehog pathway, was also inhibited by itraconazole. In addition, the phosphorylation state of S6 kinase, a canonical mTOR substrate, was inhibited by itraconazole. Although conventional angiogenesis inhibitors are available in the clinic for EOC, their efficacy is modest due in part to the existence of alternative and compensatory signaling pathways. This study shows that itraconazole has potential anti-angiogenic effects, which is important for the prevention of chemoresistance.</p><p id="Par21">In EOC, a combination of agents is important to ensure that chemotherapy is efficacious and to prevent chemo-resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Itraconazole had synergistic effects when used in combination with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, one of the most effective agents available to treat EOC. The greatest effect was observed for endothelial cells and suggests the prevention of acquired resistance. In recent studies, several combinations of itraconazole were shown to be effective against various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Typical tissue culture conditions, including high oxygen tension, high glucose concentration, and low hydrostatic pressure, are different from the biologic conditions in which tumors naturally arise. We therefore employed an alternative approach based on primary ovarian cancer xenografts. The primary xenograft model depends on immediate transfer of human cancers from patients into recipient mice without intervening tissue culture or cell line derivation <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p><p id="Par23">Oxidative stress results in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) thus promoting leukocyte adhesion and increasing endothelial permeability. The resulting chronic injury stimulus results in progressive cellular hypometabolism, which appears to be a central initiating factor for vascular abnormalities and mitochondrial damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Mitochondria are the predominant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It is estimated that 90% of cellular oxygen is consumed in the mitochondria and about 2&#8211;4% of that oxygen is converted to ROS. These studies emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial control of Nox1 redox signaling, an important factor for designing possible therapeutic strategies against cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">In this paper we have demonstrated the synergy of a standard of care chemotherapeutic with the addition of widely used antifungal agents to enhance efficacy in xenograft and PDX models. Re-purposing of clinical drugs can allow for more rapid and cost effective transition to clinical studies compared to new drug entities. In conclusion, our findings have important clinical implications for administration of itraconazole as a novel antiangiogenic agent for treatment of EOC. Systemically administered itraconazole showed synergistic effects when combined with paclitaxel with regard to inhibiting the growth of ovarian cancer in a mouse allograft model and did so at serum levels comparable to those in patients undergoing antifungal therapy. Clinical trials evaluating the combination of paclitaxel and itraconazole are needed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Chemicals and cell culture</title><p id="Par25">Itraconazole was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.
