The most commonly used methods, thermodilution and the Fick principle, are subject to substantial error from intrinsic inaccuracy or imprecise assumptions. Thermodilution is particularly unreliable in the setting of intracardiac shunts or tricuspid regurgitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Calculations using the Fick principle require knowledge of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) that is rarely measured directly, and instead is usually assumed from age, sex and heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both methods commonly are inaccurate by over 25%.</p><p id="Par46">In contrast, velocity encoded phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a well-validated technique to directly measure stroke volume through a major vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], for example the pulmonary artery or aorta, from which cardiac output can be derived. CMR flow measurements have been shown to be superior to Fick for calculation of hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance that establish diagnosis, guide treatment and inform prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Pressures and cardiac output should preferably be measured simultaneously. Right heart catheterization (RHC) can be safely performed in the CMR scanner using CMR fluoroscopy (also known as real-time CMR) to guide catheter navigation through the vasculature and cardiac chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], avoiding ionizing radiation, and affording full anatomic and functional evaluation with CMR&#160;together with invasive hemodynamic assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">We report our experience of CMR fluoroscopy guided RHC in 102 patients, and compare cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance measurements using CMR flow versus Fick, under resting conditions and under physiological provocation with inhaled oxygen and nitric oxide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par14">Consecutive patients referred for cardiac catheterization between February 2011 and March 2016 were invited to undergo CMR guided RHC. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (NCT01287026). All patients gave written informed consent. Patients were excluded for cardiovascular instability (including ST-elevation myocardial infarction, refractory angina, or refractory congestive heart failure), pregnancy or nursing, an estimated glomerular filtration rate&#160;&lt;&#160;30&#160;mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, or ineligibility for CMR. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, invasive hemodynamic and CMR findings, technical details, and procedural complications were prospectively recorded.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Real-time CMR guided cardiac catheterization</title><p id="Par15">CMR guided RHC procedures were performed under moderate sedation. Moderate sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation, with no interventions required to maintain a patent airway or spontaneous ventilation. All procedures were performed in the catheterization laboratory at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The laboratory comprises a 1.5 Tesla CMR scanner adjacent to a conventional X-ray fluoroscopy catheterization laboratory, with the ability to easily transfer patients between the two modalities. More details of the physical setup of an CMR catheterization laboratory and technique for CMR fluoroscopy guided RHC have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At our institution, in addition to the interventional cardiologist operator, a cardiovascular technologist, CMR technologist, cath lab nurse and moderate sedation nurse are present for every procedure. Vascular access was obtained in the adjoining X-ray room using ultrasound guidance. If indicated, left heart catheterization and selective coronary angiography was performed under X-ray guidance. Patients were then transferred to the CMR room, by docking the X-ray and CMR tables (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Seamless hemodynamic monitoring with 12-lead ECG, O<sub>2</sub> saturation, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and invasive pressure waveforms was maintained throughout the transfer. Baseline CMR scanning was performed followed by CMR guided RHC using an intrinsically CMR-safe balloon wedge end-hole catheter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with the balloon filled with dilute gadolinium contrast. The catheter was navigated through the heart under real-time CMR guidance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Catheterization time was defined as the total time required to navigate catheters through the heart and vasculature, perform pressure measurements, acquire CMR data and sample blood for oxygen saturation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Interventional CMR (iCMR) cardiac catheterization laboratory.</p><p>

</p><p id="Par16">Patients underwent vasoreactivity testing if there was a clinical indication, specifically elevated pulmonary artery pressures, using a combination of inhaled nitric oxide (40&#160;ppm) and 100% oxygen. If procedural workflow time permitted, additional patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures also underwent vasoreactivity testing to serve as controls. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated using the formula PVR&#160;=&#160;(mean pulmonary artery pressure &#8211; mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure)/cardiac output. Cardiac output was obtained with phase contrast CMR and the Fick principle, resulting in two PVR measurements. Indexed PVR (PVRi) was calculated using the formula PVRi&#160;=&#160;PVR / body surface area. Estimated oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) using the LaFarge-Miettinen formula was used for cardiac output calculations with the Fick principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">CMR fluoroscopy (also known as real-time CMR) allowed catheter navigation for complete RHC in 97/102 patients with a range of cardiovascular diagnoses. The procedure was safe, had a high success rate, and had acceptable catheterization times. This is the largest published series of paired comparisons of cardiac output and PVRi measured by both CMR flow and Fick techniques. We demonstrated excellent agreement between the two methods at baseline and reasonable agreement during physiological provocation with inhaled 100% oxygen and 40&#160;ppm NO, which is a circumstance when Fick is less accurate because of reduced signal-to-noise&#160;due to narrow arteriovenous oxygen difference.</p><p id="Par29">We previously tested feasibility of CMR guided RHC, comparing timings of specific procedural steps with X-ray guided RHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In that experiment, total RHC times (&#8216;sheath to sheath&#8217;) were equivalent irrespective of image guidance modality (X-ray 19.4&#160;+&#160;11.5&#160;min, CMR with air-filled balloon 21.4&#160;+&#160;6.0&#160;min, CMR with gadolinium-filled balloon 21.0&#160;+&#160;8.8&#160;min, <italic>p</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.347). We also compared relative conspicuity of air-filled versus gadolinium-filled catheter balloons, with a clear operator preference for gadolinium. Integration of dedicated pulse sequences that darken blood while preserving background tissue signal further facilitates catheter visualization. Only the balloon at the tip of the catheter can be visualized, not the catheter shaft, and so the operator must learn to interpret catheter configuration based on balloon tip movement. This is not difficult for an experienced interventional cardiologist to learn. CMR guided RHC has been designated a standard clinical procedure at NIH. All patients are now offered CMR guided catheterization, even if they are not participating in research.</p><p id="Par30">Vascular access was obtained in the adjoining X-ray room using ultrasound guidance, as there are currently no commercially available CMR-conditional guidewires to enable access to be obtained close to the CMR scanner. Fluoroscopy is certainly not required and therefore any adjoining room could be used for vascular access. An adjoining X-ray room does allow selective coronary angiography to be performed in the same sitting as CMR guided RHC. If needed, a patient can also be transferred from CMR to X-ray for a planned or bailout intervention. If general anesthesia is used, as is common in pediatrics, both CMR and cardiac catheterization can be performed during a single general anesthesia, sparing the child the need for a second.</p><p id="Par31">We have learned that in the absence of available CMR-conditional guidewires, it is prudent to have several differently shaped balloon catheters to maximize procedural success (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Depending on operator choice of central venous approach and patient anatomy, straight or angled catheters are more appropriate to reach target chambers or vessels. We failed to reach the pulmonary artery in 5 patients with severely dilated right heart chambers caused by pulmonary hypertension. In all 5 patients, pulmonary artery catheterization under X-ray guidance was also unsuccessful without the aid of a guidewire. CMR-conditional guidewires are in development, which should improve the procedural success rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CMR-conditional guidewires will also permit more complex interventions to be performed under CMR guidance.</p><p id="Par32">Mean PVRi at baseline was 5.1&#160;&#177;&#160;6.3WU.m<sup>2</sup> in the original report by Muthurangu et al. in which PVRi comparisons using the Fick principle and CMR flow were made in 15 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The correlation coefficient at baseline on room air was excellent in their study (<italic>r</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.91, <italic>p</italic>&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05). The bias between the two methods was 2.3% with limits of agreement &#8722;45.5% and 50.2%. On inhaled 100% O<sub>2</sub> and 20&#160;ppm NO, the correlation coefficient was poor (<italic>r</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.59, <italic>p</italic>&#160;=&#160;0.02). Bias between the two methods was 54.2% with limits of agreement &#8722;66.0% and 174.4%. Our results, with substantially larger number of paired calculations, also showed a strong correlation between the two methods at baseline on room air. We observed a stronger correlation on inhaled 100% O<sub>2</sub> and 40&#160;ppm than that reported by Muthurangu et al., although the limits of agreement were still much wider than at baseline. This may be due to a number of factors, including higher number of paired calculations in our study, use of estimated rather than measured VO<sub>2</sub>, and lower mean PVRi at baseline.</p><p id="Par33">We tested the hypothesis that current criteria for positive vasoreactivity to inhaled 100% O<sub>2</sub> and 40&#160;ppm NO, defined as &#8805;10&#160;mmHg reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure and to below 40&#160;mmHg, may miss subtle RV changes to pulmonary vasodilation. Using the older and less stringent criterion for positive vasoreactivity of &#8805;20% reduction in PVRi, we did observe small differences in RV volumes and ejection fraction between groups (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Although some of these differences met statistical significance, they were not clinically meaningful. More information is needed to address whether evaluating RV response to pulmonary arterial vasodilators has prognostic or therapeutic merit. Even without vasodilator testing, patients in this study with pulmonary hypertension had increased RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and a trend towards lower stroke volumes and ejection fraction at baseline. For these patients, this incremental anatomic and functional information proved useful to guide treatment and inform prognosis because RV function is one of the strongest prognostic factors in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Future directions</title><p id="Par34">We believe that exercise CMR catheterization is a very promising clinical tool to unmask latent pathology, particularly in patients with unexplained dyspnea and normal non-invasive and invasive testing at rest. Most cardiac symptoms are not apparent at rest, and only manifest with stress. Exercise is unquestionably the most physiological form of stress. Barber et al. elegantly demonstrated the feasibility and value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in a CMR scanner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Quantification of RV dimensions and function during exercise is feasible using real-time CMR sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We previously validated free-breathing motion-corrected cine imaging for cardiac chamber volume and function analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other groups have shown that exercise during CMR catheterization is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and CMR ergometers that permit carefully titrated workload are already commercially available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par35">Due to protocol-specified procedure time limitations, we did not perform repeated measurements of cardiac output using CMR flow and Fick principle. Therefore, it is not possible to comment on repeatability of either technique. Neither did we perform an analysis of intra- or inter-observer variability.</p><p id="Par36">CMR guided cardiac catheterization requires additional infrastructure. Most important, noise-suppressing headsets for communication, screens to visualize real-time images for the operator in the CMR room, and hemodynamic recording system. Many of these elements are now commercially available. It is possible to equip existing diagnostic CMR rooms to perform CMR guided invasive cardiac catheterization. The major limitation to performing more complex CMR guided interventions remains lack of CMR-conditional devices, catheters and guidewires. However, key components are now commercially available or under development, including electrophysiology ablation and mapping system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], CMR endomyocardial bioptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and CMR-conditional guidewires.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">In conclusion, real-time CMR fluoroscopy guided RHC is feasible with high procedural success rate, acceptable procedure times and excellent safety. Cardiac output and pulmonary vascular resistance quantification with CMR flow correlated well with Fick principle at baseline, and under physiological provocation with inhaled 100% oxygen and NO. Using this approach, it is possible to perform high quality invasive hemodynamic studies together with anatomic and functional assessment in patients with cardiopulmonary disease using solely CMR guidance.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CMR</term><def><p id="Par6">Cardiovascular magnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GRAPPA</term><def><p id="Par7">Generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LV</term><def><p id="Par8">Left ventricle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVR</term><def><p id="Par9">Pulmonary vascular resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RHC</term><def><p id="Par10">Right heart catheterization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RV</term><def><p id="Par11">Right ventricle</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Dr. Dana C.
