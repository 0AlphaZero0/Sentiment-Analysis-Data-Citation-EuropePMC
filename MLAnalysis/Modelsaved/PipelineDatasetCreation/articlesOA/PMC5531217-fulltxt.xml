Although accurate in specialist practice the performance of narrow band imaging (NBI), colonoscopy in routine clinical practice is poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>NBI-assisted optical diagnosis was compared with reference standard histopathological findings in a prospective, blinded study, which recruited adults undergoing routine colonoscopy in six general hospitals in the UK. Participating colonoscopists (N=28) were trained using the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification (relating to colour, vessel structure and surface pattern). By comparing the optical and histological findings in patients with only small polyps, test sensitivity was determined at the patient level using two thresholds: presence of adenoma and need for surveillance. Accuracy of identifying adenomatous polyps &lt;10&#8197;mm was compared at the polyp level using hierarchical models, allowing determinants of accuracy to be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Of 1688 patients recruited, 722 (42.8%) had polyps &lt;10&#8197;mm with 567 (78.5%) having only polyps &lt;10&#8197;mm. Test sensitivity (presence of adenoma, N=499 patients) by NBI optical diagnosis was 83.4% (95% CI 79.6% to 86.9%), significantly less than the 95% sensitivity (p&lt;0.001) this study was powered to detect. Test sensitivity (need for surveillance) was 73.0% (95% CI 66.5% to 79.9%). Analysed at the polyp level, test sensitivity (presence of adenoma, N=1620 polyps) was 76.1% (95% CI 72.8% to 79.1%). In fully adjusted analyses, test sensitivity was 99.4% (95% CI 98.2% to 99.8%) if two or more NICE adenoma characteristics were identified. Neither colonoscopist expertise, confidence in diagnosis nor use of high definition colonoscopy independently improved test accuracy.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>This large multicentre study demonstrates that NBI optical diagnosis cannot currently be recommended for application in routine clinical practice.

Additionally, exploratory work has suggested a short learning curve for NBI-assisted optical diagnosis, making it an attractive option that could be applied widely into clinical practice, if minimal training was required. Notably, the majority of studies were performed by experts in the field of optical diagnosis or in academic centres with limited data from non-expert centres suggesting that the accuracy may not be consistently reproducible in non-expert hands. Confirming whether NBI-assisted optical diagnosis can reproducibly achieve the required level of accuracy is one of the most pressing questions within the field of GI endoscopy. It is essential to establish its accuracy before recommending its use in routine clinical practice.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the largest multicentre diagnostic study in this field. The study demonstrates that NBI-assisted optical diagnosis cannot currently be recommended for routine use outside of expert centres. The accuracy, both at polyp and patient level, was substantially below recommended levels. Importantly, polyp level analyses identified that accuracy was acceptable when two or more of the features of the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification system were positively identified. Possible explanations are that not all polyps exhibit NICE characteristics or that colonoscopists vary in their ability to identify these characteristics.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The results of this study confirm that optical diagnosis cannot be recommended for use in routine clinical practice. Further research is required to understand what factors influence the reported variation in the accuracy of NBI-assisted optical diagnosis in this study.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consequently, national bowel cancer screening programmes (BCSPs) have been developed, with over 14 million screening colonoscopies performed annually in the USA alone.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Improved training, technology and awareness of colonoscopic quality have led to increased polyp detection rates. Over 90% of polyps detected at colonoscopy are small (6&#8211;9&#8197;mm) or diminutive (&#8804;5&#8197;mm), with the latter forming the majority.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Cancer risk or advanced features (villous elements or high-grade dysplasia) particularly in diminutive polyps is low.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The incidence of dysplastic serrated polyps, thought to be precursors of cancer via an alternative pathway, is lower still, 0.3&#8211;0.5%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Approximately half of small polyps are non-neoplastic with the majority of these being hyperplastic<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; therefore, many polypectomies are performed unnecessarily, increasing procedure-related risks such as bleeding and perforation. Currently, even diminutive polyps are resected and examined histologically. The number of adenomas detected is one of the best determinants of long-term risk of advanced neoplasia and informs surveillance decision-making. Diagnosing small polyps by optical diagnosis would allow recto-sigmoid hyperplastic polyps, with no malignant potential, to be diagnosed and left in situ and small adenomas to be resected and discarded without histopathology. Additionally, a positive diagnosis could be made for small polyps not retrieved or unsuitable for histological analysis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Optical diagnosis would enable immediate determination of surveillance intervals, with associated time and cost savings.</p><p>Traditional white light technology, used at routine colonoscopy, is not accurate enough for optical diagnosis to replace routine histopathological assessment. However, a number of image-enhancing, user-friendly technologies have been developed. NBI (Olympus, Japan) has been the most widely studied. It is a &#8216;blue light&#8217; optical imaging modality operated by a button on the colonoscope that, by enhancing mucosal detail and vascular structures, allows assessment of microvascular density.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Neoplastic tissue is characterised by increased angiogenesis making adenomas appear darker using NBI.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The learning curve to accurately assess microvascularity appears to be short,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> making it an attractive and practical option for optical diagnosis.</p><p>A large meta-analysis of 56 studies using NBI for optical diagnosis found overall sensitivity to be 91.0% (95% CI 88.6&#8211;93.0%), specificity 85.6% (95% CI 81.3&#8211;89.0%) and negative predictive value of 82.5% (95% CI 75.4&#8211;87.9%).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Another systematic review and meta-analysis of optical diagnosis for diminutive polyps suggested that accuracy was higher in academic centres and when performed by experienced endoscopists; however, only 3 of 20 NBI studies were undertaken in non-academic settings.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Detect Inspect Characterise Resect and Discard (DISCARD) 2 was designed to determine whether clinical management based on NBI-assisted optical diagnosis is accurate in routine clinical practice outside academic centres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study design</title><p>A UK multicentre, prospective, blinded study comparing surveillance intervals determined by NBI-assisted optical diagnosis and histological assessment in patients referred for colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>NBI-assisted optical diagnosis correctly characterises small colonic polyps as adenomas or hyperplastic, allowing assignment of surveillance intervals with 95% sensitivity compared with histological assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Patients</title><p>Adult patients referred for non-emergency colonoscopy (symptomatic referrals and Faecal Occult Blood positive (FOBT) BCSP referrals) between July 2012 and February 2014 were invited to participate and written informed consent obtained.

Using NBI and NICE classification (<xref rid="GUTJNL2015310584TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), colonoscopists documented polyp colour, microvessel type and surface pattern, and classified each as adenoma, hyperplastic, cancer or other. Colonoscopists also recorded their diagnostic confidence as high or low. High confidence indicated hypothetically that the colonoscopist would have discarded the polyp without histological assessment, while low confidence indicated sending the polyp for histology. Confidence was considered during polyp level analysis only. Where all polyps identified in a patient were &lt;10&#8197;mm, a surveillance interval (using the British Society for Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines) based on optical diagnosis was assigned and recorded.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> All polyps were resected by snare polypectomy or by excision biopsy removal and sent for histological assessment. However, if multiple rectal hyperplastic polyps were found, endoscopists were not required to remove all and removal or sampling was done for the first five only. Colonoscopists were given feedback on their optical diagnosis accuracy after every 30 polyps assessed and were informed how well their optical diagnosis correlated with histopathology at per polyp level.

Accuracy of adenoma characterisation at the polyp level in the present study was 83%. The NHS BCSP provides a high standard of practice with colonoscopists accredited and regularly quality assured. In this study, performance was better for screening colonoscopists in univariable analysis but not in adjusted models.

It is recommended that polyp size is estimated against an instrument of known size such as an open biopsy forceps. Even using such an approach, estimation of size maybe inaccurate.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Tools such as the endoscopic lesion measurement system have been developed. This consists of a graduated measurement device that can be passed down the biopsy channel and placed alongside the lesion to aid measurement and has been shown to be superior to clinician estimation.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such systems warrant further evaluation as size is a fundamental part of a potential Discard policy.</p><p>The rate of SSPs reported in this study is low when compared with the reported prevalence of 0.3&#8211;0.5%.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> One study has suggested that the use of NBI might improve the detection of SSPs although the increase detected did not reach statistical significance.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, colonoscopists were asked to classify polyps as adenomas, hyperplastic, cancer or other and were not expected to specifically diagnose sessile serrated adenomas or polyps. Recent work has highlighted typical endoscopic features that may be used to distinguish SSPs from hyperplastic polyps.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These features, together with the NICE classification, have been combined to develop the Workgroup serrAted polypS and Polyposis (WASP) classification. Using WASP, it has been shown that, following training, an accuracy of optical diagnosis for SSA/Ps 0.87 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.95) could be achieved when diagnoses were made with high confidence. Six months after training, accuracy was 0.84 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) when made with high confidence. The use of the WASP classification could be incorporated into future training modules in optical diagnosis.</p><p>Accurate adenoma identification by NBI was heavily dependent on identification of the three NICE polyp characteristics. If two or more features were present (55.9% of polyps), the sensitivity for correctly identifying adenomas exceeded 99%. The discrepancy between this finding and overall test sensitivity, combined with a high percentage of high confidence diagnoses, raises the possibility that endoscopists were relying on factors other than NICE criteria to make the optical diagnosis. Where NICE features were identified, accuracy was high but the present study cannot determine whether NICE features were not consistently present or features were incorrectly interpreted. Previous studies suggest a short learning curve for optical diagnosis<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; however, training using still images and videos may not translate into accuracy in vivo. The current study is consistent with a previous study where 12/13 community-based gastroenterologists identified adenomas with &gt;90% accuracy following training but only 3/12 managed this in vivo.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This was a pragmatic study designed to examine whether NBI worked in clinical practice. While double reporting of histology was undertaken to assess reliability and training and feedback on NBI were given, it did not incorporate more formal testing of reliability and did not aim to test explanatory factors related to how NBI did or did not work.</p><p>As this was a pragmatic study generalisable to routine clinical practice, the protocol did not mandate use of HD or SD colonoscopes. Consequently, only 22% of patients (20% of polyps) were assessed with HD, although this did not significantly alter test sensitivity. Most studies that have achieved results comparable to reference standard have used HD systems<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; however, a meta-analysis of all NBI studies reported that HD significantly decreased the performance of NBI, a possible explanation was that some of these studies also used magnification, making data more heterogeneous.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Optical diagnosis remains an attractive idea because of the potential for reducing costs and streamlining care. This study demonstrates that correctly characterising diminutive polyps using optical diagnosis represents a major challenge. One method for improving accuracy could be the use of computer-aided diagnosis, which has been shown to be feasible in a pilot study.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Should the accuracy of optical diagnosis be improved, validated accreditation programmes and on-going quality assurance would be required in order for it to be incorporated into routine practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Previous research, predominantly from single sites and academic groups, suggests that NBI-assisted optical diagnosis has acceptable accuracy to determine surveillance without histology. These findings were not replicated in this large, multicentre study of NBI use in routine practice, either at the polyp or patient level. The marked variation of accuracy according to the polyp characteristics detected is notable: either a proportion of polyps present without NBI detectable signs or colonoscopists vary in their ability to evaluate them. The first explanation would require imaging advances; the second further research into training and accreditation. NBI-assisted optical diagnosis of small polyps during colonoscopy cannot currently be recommended for routine use outside of specialist centres.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> The study team wish to acknowledge the collaborators in this study: Laura Neilson, Adil Ahmed, Roisin Bevan, Mike Bradburn, Faheem Butt, Andrew Douglass, Vikki Edge, John Greenaway, Wendy Gregory, John Hancock, Lindsay Hurst, Babur Javaid, Diamond Joy, Deepak Kejariwal, Susan McConnell, Jestina Miles, Sarah Mills, David Oliver, Simon Panter, Francisco Porras-Perez, John Silcock, Joanne Topping, Christopher Wells; the hospital research teams that supported them; County Durham and Darlington, Cumbria, Northumbria, North Tees, South Tees and South Tyneside NHS Trusts for infrastructural support.
