As a vital component of the host innate immune system, the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptor, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role against H1N1 viral infection. However, the function of NLRP3 inflammasome in host immunological responses to the lethal H7N9 virus is still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that mice deficient for NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), were less susceptible to H7N9 viral challenge than wild type (WT) controls. Inflammasome deficiency in these animals led to significantly milder mortality and less pulmonary inflammation compared with WT mice. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor deficient mice also exhibited a higher survival rate than WT controls. Thus, our study reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome is deleterious for the host during H7N9 infection in mice, which is due to an overwhelming inflammatory response via caspase-1 activation and associated IL-1 signal. Therefore, fine-tuning the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome or IL-1 signaling may be beneficial for the host to control H7N9 associated lethal pathogenesis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In March 2013, the novel avian-origin influenza A virus (IAV) H7N9 was identified in China.

The severe symptoms and high mortality associated with H7N9 infection pose a big threat to the public health. Although recent studies of H7N9 have achieved great progress, clear definition of the host immunological responses to H7N9 is still lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Influenza virus infection mainly induces two types of innate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

The H7N9 virus was intranasally inoculated and inhaled into bronchoalveolar spaces, then infected the epithelial cells. At the early stage of first few rounds of viral replication (24~72&#8201;hours), the local inflammation was limited (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and macrophages/dendritic cells and a few other cells started to be recruited to the infected area by chemokine MIP-1&#945; (Figs&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#8211;c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The production of IL-1&#946; was still at low level at this stage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). With the development of disease, at 7 d.p.i., severe inflammation occurred in the infected lung tissue (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). With the migration of the lymphocytes, especially B cells, to the inflammatory area (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), the total number of infiltrated inflammatory cells were increased but the percentage of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells were decreased (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The infiltrated inflammatory cells produced large amount of IL-1&#946; (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which accelerated the pulmonary inflammation.</p><p id="Par15">From 7 d.p.i. to 14 d.p.i, the body weight of survived WT mice recovered completely, whereas <italic>Casp1/11</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice could not returned to the initial level (0 d.p.i) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Microscopic analyses revealed that on 14 d.p.i, most tissues from WT mice exhibited complete recovery, while the <italic>Casp1/11</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> tissues still manifested strong inflammation (data not shown). Thus, WT mice suffered more due to the lung damage and inflammation in the early phase (before 7 d.p.i) of H7N9 infection and either died of organ failure, or recovered at the later phase. In contrast, <italic>Casp1/11</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup>mice did not develop as strong inflammation and lung damage as seen in WT counterparts in the early phase, consequently fewer of them died. However, <italic>Casp1/11</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice failed to recover completely at the later phase. These results might suggest a potentially dual role for caspase-1 in H7N9 infection, detrimental role to the host upon H7N9 infection before 7 d.p.i. and possibly necessary role for recovery from the lung inflammation after 7 d.p.i. phase, likely due to a contribution to tissue regeneration. But it should be kept in mind that the comparison between 20% surviving WT and 60% surviving <italic>Casp1/11</italic>
<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> is not justified, and more stringent experiments are needed for further explorations on the role of caspase-1 to host recovery.</p><p id="Par16">Studies on the role of NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome during IAV infection produced conflicting results. Some studies have demonstrated that NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome is protective against H1N1 infection through viral clearance or virus induced pulmonary necrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>

The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 causes hypercytokinemia and severe tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Therefore, for the highly pathogenic influenza virus the hyperactivated proinflammatory responses may be detrimental for the host.
