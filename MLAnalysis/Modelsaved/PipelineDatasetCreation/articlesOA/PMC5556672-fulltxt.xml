Interferon tau (IFNT) secreted by trophoblast cells, a well-known pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants, acts on the uterus to prepare for pregnancy.

In cattle, although the fertilization rate is estimated to be about 90% by artificial insemination, the majority of embryonic losses occur between 8 and 16&#160;days after insemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], indicating the importance of the duration within the uterus. When pregnancy is established, interferon tau (IFNT), a well-known pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is secreted by embryonic trophoblast cells between days 10 to 25 of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. IFNT acts to prepare the body for pregnancy, such as the inhibition of luteolytic action, induction of immune modulation, promotion of embryonic growth, and implantation of the conceptus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly accepted that many normal reproductive processes display hallmark signs of inflammation, including ovulation, implantation, and parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the embryo as well as endometrial tissue play key roles in physiological inflammatory phenomena, including implantation; therefore, uncontrolled and/or pathological situations such as an infection or disease in the uterus may directly lead to infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Aging is the result of complex interactions causing dysfunctions in cells and organs. Recently, it has been widely recognized that physiological or pathophysiological aging can be driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The plasma concentrations for various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1&#946; (IL1B), IL6, and exhibit age-dependent increases in healthy humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting the emerging concept of &#8220;inflammaging&#8221; as an age-dependent low-grade, chronic, and systemic inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In terms of reproduction, it is well known that advanced maternal age is associated with reduced fertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the age-related decline in oocyte quality is well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We recently suggested that the oviduct senescence was dependent on the aging of cows because aged oviduct epithelial cells exhibited higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, excessive reactive oxygen species production, and decreased villous and proliferative activities compared to young oviduct epithelial cells in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In terms of uterine function, the uterine dysfunction and senescence and contractile activity in the myometrium in young rats was significantly greater than that in aged rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, immune- and inflammatory response-related pathways were upregulated depending on the age of rat uterine horn as shown by microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, Hirota et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated that uterine-specific p53 deficiency conferred uterine senescence, resulting in the promotion of preterm birth in mice. However, there have been few investigations on the age-dependent functional changes in the uterus.</p><p id="Par32">In the present study, we hypothesized that bovine endometrial cells exhibit age dependent changes in their characteristics and functions, and thus an investigation of this system could be a powerful tool for understanding uterine aging. We further hypothesized that the influence of IFNT on endometrial cells will change as cows age, resulting in difficulties in the induction of appropriate changes for pregnancy by IFNT. Therefore, we examined intrinsic changes in the mRNA expression patterns depending on aging and the effect of IFNT between endometrial cells obtained from young and aged cows by next generation sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection of bovine uterine tissue</title><p id="Par33">Japanese Black cow uteri were collected from a local slaughterhouse within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of exsanguination.

Uterine tissues ipsilateral to the corpus luteum were collected at days 10&#8211;15 of the estrous cycle because during this phase embryo elongation and IFNT secretion from trophoblast cells within the uterus occurs. Tissue samples were transported to the laboratory (ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotics), and utilized for cell culture. In the present study, we defined cows aged between 150 and 210&#160;months as old (mean 173.5&#160;months), and cows aged between 28 and 68&#160;months as young (mean 45.2&#160;months). Our in vitro experiment used 8 young and 12 aged uterine tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Isolation of endometrial cells</title><p id="Par34">Endometrial cells were isolated from uterine tissues as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] because they showed that IFNT clearly stimulated ISGs expression using mixed culture system between epithelial and stromal cells. Briefly, uterine horns were cut and then washed with PBS containing amphotericin B (1&#160;&#956;g/mL) and gentamicin (0.5&#160;&#956;g/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The uterine lumen was flushed slowly with PBS. Endometrium tissues, including epithelial and stromal cells (without uterine muscle layers), were cut to 5&#160;mm in size. These tissues were collected and incubated in 0.1% collagenase solution (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in Dulbecco&#8217;s modified Eagle&#8217;s medium/F-12 (DMEM/F-12; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 60&#160;min at 37&#160;&#176;C with gentle stirring. After centrifugation at 500&#160;g&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;min at room temperature, the pellet was resuspended and filtered (70&#160;&#956;m). The cells were washed and treated with erythrocyte-lysing buffer (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), amphotericin B (1&#160;&#956;g/mL), and gentamicin (0.5&#160;&#956;g/mL). The cells were plated and cultured at a concentration of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>cells/well in 24- or 48-well culture plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). As the endometrial cells, including epithelial and stromal cells, attached within 48&#160;h after plating, the culture media was changed and cells were further cultured for another 24&#160;h. The isolated endometrial cells were not pooled and cultured separately for each individual cow. Using fluorescence immunocytochemistry of cytokeratin (a marker of epithelial cells) and vimentin (a maker of stromal cells), we confirmed existence of cytokeratin- and vimentin-positive cells in mixed culture model (data not shown). In addition, we confirmed the mRNA expression of markers such as epithelial cells (e.g. KRT18, KRT19) and stromal cells (e.g. vimentin, desmin, MMP1) in this culture model and the expressions of these markers (RPKM value) did not differ between endometrial cells obtained from young and aged cows (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Transcriptome analysis of endometrial cells</title><p id="Par35">For transcriptome analysis, we used endometrial cells obtained from 4 young and 5 aged cows, respectively. After cultured for 24&#160;h, the cells were washed twice in PBS and treated in the absence (as a control) or presence of IFNT (1&#160;ng/mL) in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with antibiotics for 24&#160;h because we reported this dose of IFNT clearly stimulated ISGs expression in bovine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recombinant bovine IFNT was gifted by Professor RM Roberts (bTP-509A, University of Missouri, Columbia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The activity of IFNT was then determined by a viral resistance assay using bovine kidney MDBK cells and was found to be 59,050&#160;IU/mL (5.95&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;IU/mg at 456&#160;&#956;M). After incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and total RNA was extracted using an RNAqueous RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In this next generation sequencing analysis, RNA samples were pooled in each group. After assessing the RNA quality (RIN value 7.0 or more) using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), libraries were prepared with a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina; San Diego, CA). Using these libraries, clusters were generated with an Illumina cBot and one lane for the two groups were sequenced as 100-base reads (single end) by an Illumina HiSeq Sequencing System. Image analysis, base calling, and quality filtering were performed with CASAVA ver. 1.8.4 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive, DRA005722). Derived sequence data were aligned with the bovine genome sequence (UMD3) to count the sequence reads using CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen; Redwood City, CA). To predict upstream transcriptional regulators, significantly differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Canonical Pathways, Upstream Regulator function, and Diseases and Bio Functions in Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) program (Qiagen). IPA was used to identify biofunctional signaling networks associated with differential changes in mRNA expression in young or aged bovine endometrial cells. Kal&#8217;s z-test was used to analyse gene set enrichment in the functional categories. The data used for this analysis comprised a gene list of 24,596.

We defined cows aged more than 150&#160;months as old, and cows aged between 28 and 68&#160;months as young. Then, we performed next generation sequencing and demonstrated that mRNA expressions in bovine endometrial cells are age-dependently changes, especially pro-inflammatory signaling-, interferon signaling-, and cell cycle/cell division-related components.</p><p id="Par49">In the present study, the top ranked canonical pathway (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and diseases and bio functions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4) were &#8220;Role of Pattern Recognition Receptors in Recognition of Bacteria and Viruses&#8221; and &#8220;Inflammatory response&#8221;, respectively, which were predicted to be activated in endometrial cells obtained from aged cows. These findings suggest that inflammatory signaling spontaneously increases with age in cow endometrial cells. Similarly, Elmes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported that maternal age affected the upregulation of genes related to immune and inflammatory responses in rat uteri. IL1A, as a candidate molecule within the predicted canonical pathways, is one of the essential pro-inflammatory cytokines. Age-related increases in IL1A have also been reported in endometrial stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Uri-Belapolsky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported that <italic>Il1&#945;</italic> deficient mice exhibited a higher pregnancy rate (81%) with higher litter sizes in aged mice compared with wild-type aged mice (pregnancy rate: 53%). In addition, Gardner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] demonstrated that senescent vascular smooth muscle cells secrete multiple inflammatory cytokines in an IL1A-dependent manner. Therefore, it has been suggested that an age-dependent increase in inflammatory responses, including IL1A, are associated with endometrial cellular senescence, resulting in reproductive dysfunction.</p><p id="Par50">Recently, it has been reported that IFN activity and its signaling are elevated with aging, contributing to the aging-related diseases in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To support these results, we showed that Interferon Signaling as a canonical pathway and IRF7 and IFNG as upstream regulators were activated in aging endometrial cells compared with young cells. Indeed, Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported that IFNB activates the p53-p21 axis, promoting cell senescence in vitro. On the other hand, type I IFNs bind to common receptors such as IFNA receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and 2 (IFNAR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The Janus kinases (JAKs) &#8211;signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways are major regulators of the transcription of ISGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, JAK-STAT signaling and ISG15 expression were also spontaneously enhanced dependent on aging of epidermal stem cells, skeletal muscle, and skin in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, a shorter telomere (as a marker of senescence) induced ISG15 expression together with inflammation and cellular senescence (&#946;-galactosidase activity), whereas the induction of a longer telomere resulted in a lower grade ISG15 expression and cellular senescence, suggesting that upregulation of ISG15 with telomere shortening may contribute to chronic inflammatory states in human aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that an age-dependent increase of IFN-JAK-STAT-ISGs systems are associated with the promotion of uterine aging in cows.</p><p id="Par51">Mitotic checkpoint genes are believed to be prime targets for deregulation in human infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Actually, Jin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] demonstrated that Cdc20, the activating subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, was critical for meiosis and fertility in mice. They showed that female mice with low amounts of Cdc20 almost exclusively produced aneuploidy embryos, resulting in failure to thrive and death early in development, and suggested the possibility that Cdc20 insufficiency may be a cause of infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In the present study, the comparison of canonical pathways represented the activation of &#8220;Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation&#8221; and the inhibition of &#8220;Mitotic Role of PLK&#8221; in aged endometrial cells, hypothesizing that the accumulation of DNA damage with aging of endometrial cells and the stopping of cell proliferation due to cell cycle arrest. To support this hypothesis, we observed the lower proliferative levels of endometrial cells obtained from aged compared with young cows. Also, we observed the different speed to confluence in endometrial cells obtained from between young and aged cows (observation by microscopy). In addition, mammalian tissues from aged individuals retain unrepaired DNA damage (DNA double-strand breaks) associated with DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and an inflammatory situation induces fragmented DNA in the preimplantation-stage of embryos and uterine cells, causing poor embryonic development and improper preparation of the uterine microenvironment for pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, tissues with accumulating DNA damage produce endogenous IFNs and stimulate IFN signaling, promoting IFN-induced senescence and amplifying DNA damage responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These above findings with our present data suggest that bovine endometrial cell aging is associated with an imbalance in the cell cycle due to the accumulation of DNA damage and hyper activation of IFN signaling.</p><p id="Par52">In contrast to data showing the activating Interferon Signaling as upstream regulators, we showed that PTGER2 as an upstream regulator was inhibited in endometrial cells obtained from aged cows compared with young cows. PTGER2 is one of the specific receptors for PGE2. The importance of the PGE2-PTGER2 axis in pregnancy has been well demonstrated for various phenomena and it has multiple roles in ovulation, fertilization via expansion of oocytes from cumulus cells, embryo development, maternal recognition, and implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that downregulation of PTGER2 signaling with aging may lead to infertility or a declining pregnancy rate. Indeed, PGE2 concentrations increased significantly in human endometrial fluid during the window of implantation, and PGE2 levels were markedly lower in patients who did not achieve pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, Peloffo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] reported that the chronic administration of a selective PTGER2 antagonist resulted in a significant contraceptive effect without adverse side effects in female macaques. These findings suggest that endometrial cells obtained from aged cows have the potential to reduce embryo development via lower PGE2-PTGER2 signaling. In future research, we plan to investigate age-dependent interactions between the early embryo and endometrial cells.</p><p id="Par53">To address the issue from a different angle, we asked that signal transduction by IFNT changed with aging in endometrial cells in cows. To test our hypothesis, we comprehensively analyzed the influence of IFNT on bovine endometrial cells depending on aging using a next-generation sequencer. Contrary to our expectation, the analysis of canonical pathways and upstream regulators revealed that there was no difference in the effect of IFNT depending on the age of bovine endometrial cells (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). As results in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, it has been reported that type I IFNs including IFNT regulate these three activated upstream regulators (IRF7, EIF2AK2, and DDX58) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], whereas USP18 acts as an inhibitor of IFN signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similar to the data of predicted canonical pathways, the predicted upstream regulators after IFNT treatment also completely matched between endometrial cells obtained from young and aged cows. These findings indicated that the influence of IFNT is almost the same between endometrial cells obtained from young and aged cows. Gierek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] reported that a low IFNT dose (0.01 and 0.1&#160;ng/mL) had a less inhibitory effect in the proliferation of lymphocytes in cows (multiparous), whereas the same dose IFNT clearly inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in heifers (15&#8211;16&#160;months of age), indicating that lymphocytes from young heifers were more susceptible to IFNT treatment. Similarly, we found that the stimulatory effect of IFNT was obviously higher in endometrial cells obtained from young cows than that in aged cows. Possible reasons for the different responsiveness to IFNT could be: (1) IFNT responsiveness may change according to the situation such as advancing age or pregnancy experience, and (2) basic levels of interferon signaling and ISGs are high as endometrial cells advance in age, resulting in the relatively low responsiveness to IFNT treatment.</p><p id="Par54">A limitation of the present study was the use of in vitro bovine endometrial cell models: the use of in vitro models to study in vivo situations does not reflect the in vivo condition perfectly. Therefore, in vivo investigations about the effect of aging in bovine endometrium functions are required to clarify these issues. In addition, although endometrial cell function at days 10&#8211;15 of the estrous cycle changed with aging, we did not investigate the aging effect in endometrial cell function using other estrous cycle periods or pregnancy state. Moreover, because we wanted to verify the comprehensive change with age in the bovine endometrium, we did not distinguish between epithelial and stromal cells in uterine tissues when we isolated cells with reference the past investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, because these cells exert different functions in an in vivo situation, the effect of aging may be changed depending on cell types. Thus, further investigations are required to clarify these issues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par55">We demonstrated that comprehensive gene characteristics of bovine endometrial cells differed depending on their age. Endometrial cells obtained from aged cows exhibited spontaneously higher levels of inflammatory signaling and IFN signaling, and dysfunction of cell division was associating with chronic inflammation, activation of IFN signaling, and accumulation of DNA damage. A high basal level of IFN-related mRNA expressions in endometrial cells of aged cows may lead to lower susceptible for IFNT compared to younger ones, which is suggested as &#8220;inflammaing&#8221; in bovine endometrial cells. Further investigations are needed to elucidate age-dependent functional changes in the uterus, to understand its physiological roles during pregnancy, and the pathophysiology of complications in pregnancy related to the uterus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
