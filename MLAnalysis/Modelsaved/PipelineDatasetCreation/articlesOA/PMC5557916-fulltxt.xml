The function of YhdE (earlier known as <italic>orfE</italic>) was completely unknown until a homolog was found in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Sharing 46% sequence identity with YhdE, overexpression of this homolog in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> causes inhibition of cell division and extensive filamentation of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Hence this protein is named multicopy associated filamentation (Maf) protein. Now it is known that Maf is a highly-conserved protein found in various organisms from archaea to eukaryotes, forming a large protein family. There was no further function study of Maf family proteins until crystal structures of Maf protein were determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These crystal structures exhibit 3D structure similarities with nucleotide pyrophosphatase such as Mj0226<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and YjjX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> proteins, which suggested the pyrophosphatase activity of Maf family. Subsequent enzymatic studies have identified NTPase activity for Maf proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although lacking direct experimental evidence, it has been postulated that Maf proteins may be involved in the regulation of DNA/RNA damage repairing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and are &#8220;house-cleaning&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes.</p><p id="Par3">Overexpression of <italic>E. coli</italic> YhdE, a Maf family member, is also found to result in long rod shape of cell and the YhdE knockout cells seem to exhibit more spherical shape compared to wild-type cells. Furthermore, similar to other Maf proteins YhdE also possesses hydrolysis activity towards dTTP, UTP, 5-methyl-UTP and pseudo-UTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although YhdE and other Maf proteins are classified as pyrophosphatases which hydrolyze NTP to NMP as detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, it is currently unknown whether the other hydrolysis product is phosphate (Pi) or pyrophosphate (PPi). The two scenarios would necessitate different reaction mechanisms. Direct production of Pi would suggest as a two-step sequential reaction, while formation of PPi would represent a non-sequential mechanism. Furthermore, PPi is a very important anion in biological processes in energy transduction in organisms, and it appeared to be a more favourable source of energy than ATP in early history of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. PPi is also involved in glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, mitochondrial membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and calcium-phosphate deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> in different organisms. Therefore, further study of YhdE hydrolysis may provide new insights into the enzymatic mechanism of YhdE and other Maf family proteins.</p><p id="Par4">PPi is unstable and can be readily hydrolyzed to Pi in acidic environment and conditions used for mass spectrometry analysis. As such, in most enzymatic assays of pyrophosphatases, PPi is not directly detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These methods all suffer from their indirect nature in which the amount of PPi produced cannot be directly measured. These indirect methods used to assay pyrophosphatases do not answer the question of whether PPi or Pi is produced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Further, the multi-step procedure and the need of various reagents including specific enzymes can be cumbersome. In recent years, highly sensitive and selective chemosensors that can quantify PPi directly are being developed. Since the pioneering work on the fluorescent sensing of PPi by Czarnik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>
<italic>et al</italic>., there has been steady progress in developing PPi sensors in the past two decades. In some of the recent studies, PPi sensors have been tested to monitor PPi real-time for cell imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, DNA sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, or for real-time fluorescence assay to examine inorganic pyrophosphatase with PPi as the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We developed a new PPi sensor, 4-isoACBA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which is highly fluorescent itself but the fluorescence is quenched when two 4-isoACBA molecules coordinate with a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion. The 4-isoACBA-Zn(II) complex binds with PPi with high specificity and the fluorescence is recovered. This sensor has remarkable binding affinity and high sensing selectivity for PPi and can work in various buffer solution of neutral pH which is harmless and appropriate for most proteins such as YhdE.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we reveal that PPi is the direct product of dTTP hydrolysis by YhdE using a fluorescence sensor, 4-isoACBA-Zn(II) complex. This is the first time that such a sensor is applied to detection of PPi formation for pyrophosphatase. Using the fluorescence sensor, we also show that the method is highly sensitive which can detect very weak hydrolysis activity of an YhdE active-site mutant (YhdE_E33A), which was previously shown to be completely inactive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We have further determined the crystal structure of YhdE_E33A and revealed the structural basis for its weak activity through a compensatory mechanism by the neighboring Glu32.

This new fluorescence sensor was used to determine whether the hydrolysis product of dTTP (or UTP) by YhdE is PPi or Pi. We first tested the specificity of the PPi sensor in which the fluorescence was monitored in the presence of various anions (as sodium salts). As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, only PPi elicited significant fluorescence response, while other samples including Pi, dTTP and UTP exhibited no appreciable fluorescence response in the same conditions. We next examined YhdE hydrolysis reaction mixture in the same buffer condition and strong fluorescence signal was observed. The difference in fluorescence signal strength between YhdE reaction and the substrate (dTTP or UTP) alone without hydrolysis is ~7&#8211;12 times, clearly demonstrating the release of PPi as the direct product of YhdE-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nucleotides. This is the first time that PPi is shown to be one of the hydrolysis products of YhdE and most likely other Maf family proteins as well. Thus, the covalent bond between &#945;-phosphoryl and &#946;-phosphoryl of dTTP or UTP is cleaved when it is hydrolyzed by YhdE, essentially eliminating the possibility of sequential hydrolysis (releasing one phosphate at a time in two steps).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pyrophosphatase assays of YhdE by fluorescence probe.

</p><p id="Par15">In all previous activity studies of Maf family proteins, PPi was indirectly assayed, in which PPi was further hydrolyzed to Pi by inorganic pyrophosphatase. The released Pi reacts with ammonium molybdate and malachite green to produce a colored complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The coloration time of this complex can take as long as 30&#8201;minutes. In contrast, the PPi sensor can bind PPi directly and generate fluorescence instantly, which can be used for real-time analysis the pyrophosphatase activity of YhdE (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). Furthermore, the sensitivity is greatly enhanced. Using the indirect method, we could not detect any activity of the active site mutant in which Glu33 is changed to Ala (YhdE_E33A) and used this mutant for co-crystallization studies in a hope to form a substrate-bound complex (more see below). Interestingly, we found that the YhdE_E33A mutant still has week pyrophosphatase activity when assayed using our PPi sensor (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In addition, the apparent K<sub>m</sub> of YhdE_E33A binding with dTTP is 75&#8201;&#956;M which, somewhat surprisingly, is similar to that of the wild-type YhdE. This indicates that the loss of Glu33 residue does not influence the binding affinity of YhdE for substrate dTTP. However, the apparent K<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> of YhdE for dTTP is ~100 times of the YhdE_E33A mutant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>). The much weaker pyrophosphatase activity of YhdE_E33A which could not be detected by the conventional method suggests that the Glu33 residue plays a critically important role in YhdE&#8217;s hydrolysis activity. A main reason that conventional method involving conversion of PPi to Pi is less sensitive is because of the high Pi background. We also used this new method to detect the ITPase activity of YjjX protein and observed fluorescence signal change in the reaction mixture (data not shown), indicating that the method is generally applicable for pyrophosphatase proteins. Therefore, our new method offers a more robust and more accurate pyrophosphatase enzymatic assay than the conventional assays.</p><p id="Par16">Although we were initially surprised to find that the YhdE_E33A mutant exhibits weak activity since it is known that Glu33 is critical for YhdE hydrolysis activity, we are able to rationalize the residual activity based on binding experiment and structural analysis. Enzymatic analysis by PPi fluorescence sensor shows the apparent K<sub>m</sub> of YhdE_E33A with dTTP is similar to that of wild-type YhdE, which indicates that Glu33 is probably not directly involved in dTTP binding. To help understand the hydrolysis mechanism of YhdE, we previously crystallized YhdE_E33A in the absence and presence of dTTP through co-crystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, dTTP was not found in the YhdE_E33A structure from the co-crystallization, which is now not surprising because of the residual weak activity seen using our new PPi probe. In this work, we attempted a range of soaking experiments in which different amounts of dTTP was added, different soaking time, as well as additional dTTP using co-crystals. A representative structure of YhdE_E33A under soaking condition was determined at 2.04&#8201;&#197; resolution with R factor and R-free of 17.89% and 21.07% (Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), respectively. These efforts still did not produce a substrate-bound complex structure, although our hope was that the weak hydrolysis activity of YhdE_E33A would not be a less serious problem if sufficient amount (and/or continued supply) of dTTP is provided. Interestingly, there is subtle but potentially informative difference when the three structures of YhdE_E33A (YhdE_E33A, YhdE_E33A co-crystallization and YhdE_E33A soaking) are compared. In the structure YhdE_E33A without adding dTTP, side chains of Arg12 and Glu32 point to the opposite direction away from the active site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the co-crystalized YhdE_E33A structure, Arg12 and Glu32 rotate inwards and point to the active site. Our new soaking structure of YhdE_E33A has revealed yet another conformation in which the side chain of Glu32, but not Arg12, moves from the outside position to the inside position. This new conformation seems to represent an intermediate state between the open (no dTTP) and closed (co-crystallization) conformations. Apparently, the presence of dTTP has altered the active site conformation, exerting more influence in the solution (co-crystallization) condition than the solid state (soaking). The high B factor (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) of Glu32 supports the notion that Glu32 is flexible and likely able to partially compensate for Glu33 which would explain the observed activity of the YhdE_E33A mutant.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Structure superposition of four structure of YhdE_E33A.

There are evidences that substrate dTTP is bound in the conserved binding cleft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Docking approach was employed to insert dTTP to the active site of the YhdE_E33A crystal structure (PDB ID: 4P0U). The docked structure (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) was subjected to energy minimization and MD equilibration for 2&#8201;ns before QM calculation. In the equilibrated structure from MD, the triphosphate group of the substrate dTTP is positioned in the catalytic pocket (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), in agreement with the structure of homologous Bacillus subtilis Maf protein (PDB ID: 1EXC). In the active site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), the basic residues including Arg12, Arg13, Lys82 and Lys146 form extensive electrostatic interactions with the triphosphoryl group of dTTP. Two oxygen atoms of Asp70 and one oxygen atom from each of &#945;-, &#946;- phosphoryl groups along with two water oxygen atoms coordinate Mn<sup>2+</sup> to form an octahedral structure, stabilizing the position of substrate dTTP and making the &#945;-phosphorus atom of dTTP more electrophilic which can be readily attacked by a nucleophile group. There is no room for the active site pocket to accommodate an acidic residue to attack the &#946;- or &#947;-phosphoryl which would generate Pi like in the case of Kinases and typical ATPase. Given the spatial position of glutamic acid residue in the active loop relative to the substrate, it can only attack the &#945;-phosphoryl of dTTP with the help of a water molecule, yielding products dTMP and PPi. Based on these considerations, we thus built the cluster model which includes substrate dTTP, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and other conserved residues which interact with the substrate and metal ion. Site-directed mutagenesis and pyrophosphatase activity analysis of YhdE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> suggest that Glu33 may act as a proton receptor and attack the &#945;-phosphoryl group of dTTP with the help of a water molecule. As mentioned previously, in the mutant crystal structure Glu32 takes place of Glu33 to partially retain the pyrophosphatase activity. Therefore, in our model we kept a glutamic acid (Glu32) in the active loop.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The complex structure model of YhdE_E33A and dTTP.

</p><p id="Par18">As aforementioned, our model predicts that Asp70 of YhdE is a Mn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residue and may also play a modest role in the stabilization of the substrate dTTP, amongst multiple residues including the four basic amino acids. To provide experimental validation for our model, we tested the interaction between the YhdE D70A mutant with Mn<sup>2+</sup> or dTTP using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In the ITC experiment, wild-type YhdE protein and YhdE D70A mutant were titrated by Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The binding constant K<sub>a</sub> of YhdE for Mn<sup>2+</sup> is ~1.65&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;M<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, indicating a strong interaction (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a</xref>). In comparison, YhdE_D70A (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4b</xref>) showed no binding between the mutant and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, the binding constant K<sub>a</sub> of YhdE_D70A and dTTP were similar in the presence and absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4c</xref>). In agreement with our model, these results suggest that the YhdE_D70A mutation has impaired Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding but is insufficient to compromise dTTP interaction with the protein. This is not surprising since dTTP is stabilized by many more interactions than Mn<sup>2+</sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>ITC experiments and interaction studies of the YhdE_D70A mutant with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and dTTP.

</p><p id="Par19">Based on the validated model and the identification of PPi as the product, we proceeded with computational studies to investigate the hydrolysis reaction mechanism by density functional theory (DFT). Two pathways of dTTP hydrolysis mechanism of YhdE were identified (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The first one is a stepwise pathway or, more specifically, a two-step associative pathway (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In this mechanism, the lytic water molecule attacks the &#945;-phosphorus atom of the substrate dTTP in the first step, followed by the release of PPi. The &#945;-phosphorus which is highly electrophilic as a result of coordinating Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The structural changes along the reaction path are shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. By crossing a 25.11&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> energy barrier (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), Glu32 serves as a proton acceptor to extract a proton from the lytic water. Then the dTTP together with the nucleophile hydroxyl group form a pentavalent intermediate. This step is the rate-determining step of the reaction. In the subsequent step, the new P-O bond gradually becomes tighter and the old P-O bond from the opposite position is broken and releases the PPi group. The second pathway represents a concerted reaction mechanism in which the water attacks the &#945;-phosphorus atom and PPi group is released at the same time (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). In this process, the two P-O bonds are being broken and formed simultaneously at the top of the &#8220;energy hill&#8221;. The energy barrier of this pathway is 26.61&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), ~1.5&#8201;kcal&#8201;mol<sup>&#8722;1</sup> higher than the stepwise pathway. Optimized structures along this pathway are shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. Based on the computational results, we suggest that the two-step associative pathway is the favored pathway for YhdE&#8217;s pyrophosphatase reaction (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Besides, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and the glutamic acid in the active loop play important roles in both pathways, which is consistent with our previous experiments.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Calculated energy profile along the reaction coordinates in two YhdE hydrolysis pathways.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">We have revealed that PPi is the product of YhdE hydrolysis reaction for the first time using our PPi fluorescence sensor. Based on the structures of YhdE and other Maf proteins, through MD simulation, QM calculation and PPi detection experiment we have established the enzymatic pathway. Whereas the basic residues (Arg12, Arg13, Lys82 and Lys146) in YhdE active pocket interact with triphosphate group of the substrate, Asp70 and &#945;-, &#946;-phosphoryl groups of the substrate coordinate Mn<sup>2+</sup>. A glutamic residue in the active site loop together with a water molecule attack the &#945;-phosphorous of dTTP and generate PPi and dTMP. Given the highly-conserved nature (particularly in the active site) of Maf proteins, the reaction mechanism is most likely applicable to the entire Maf family. The precise physiological function of Maf family proteins is still not very clear and further investigation is warranted. Additionally, the role of PPi resulted from Maf protein&#8217;s NTP hydrolysis in cells is also a mystery, which may be implicated the function of Maf family proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec10"><p>
