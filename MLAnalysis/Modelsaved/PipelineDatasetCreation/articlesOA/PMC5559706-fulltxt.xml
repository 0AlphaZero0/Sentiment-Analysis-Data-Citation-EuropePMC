However, little is known regarding the gradual impact of pre-weaning diet on the establishment of the rumen microbiota. Here, we employed next-generation sequencing to investigate the effects of the inclusion of starter concentrate (M: milk-fed vs. MC: milk plus starter concentrate fed) on archaeal, bacterial and anaerobic fungal communities in the rumens of 45 crossbred dairy calves across pre-weaning development (7, 28, 49, and 63 days). Our results show that archaeal, bacterial, and fungal taxa commonly found in the mature rumen were already established in the rumens of calves at 7 days old, regardless of diet. This confirms that microbiota colonization occurs in the absence of solid substrate. However, diet did significantly impact some microbial taxa. In the bacterial community, feeding starter concentrate promoted greater diversity of bacterial taxa known to degrade readily fermentable carbohydrates in the rumen (e.g., <italic>Megasphaera, Sharpea</italic>, and <italic>Succinivribrio</italic>). Shifts in the ruminal bacterial community also correlated to changes in fermentation patterns that favored the colonization of <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. A4 in the rumen of MC calves. In contrast, M calves displayed a bacterial community dominated by taxa able to utilize milk nutrients (e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus, Bacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>). In both diet groups, the dominance of these milk-associated taxa decreased with age, suggesting that diet and age simultaneously drive changes in the structure and abundance of bacterial communities in the developing rumen. Changes in the composition and abundance of archaeal communities were attributed exclusively to diet, with more highly abundant <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> and less abundant <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> in MC calves. Finally, the fungal community was dominated by members of the genus SK3 and <italic>Caecomyces</italic>. Relative anaerobic fungal abundances did not change significantly in response to diet or age, likely due to high inter-animal variation and the low fiber content of starter concentrate. This study provides new insights into the colonization of archaea, bacteria, and anaerobic fungi communities in pre-ruminant calves that may be useful in designing strategies to promote colonization of target communities to improve functional development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>rumen</kwd><kwd>dairy calves</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>age</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003593</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">157168/2012-3</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Coordena&#231;&#227;o de Aperfei&#231;oamento de Pessoal de N&#237;vel Superior<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002322</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">PE 99999.002493/2014-04</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">National Institute of Food and Agriculture<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100005825</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">WIS01729</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="90"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="13170"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In adult ruminants, the rumen harbors a diverse microbiota composed of archaea, bacteria, fungi, and ciliated protozoa species that act synergistically to degrade feedstuffs and provide nutrients such as, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), protein, minerals, and vitamins to the host (Hungate, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). However, young ruminants have an immature gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and are thought to be sterile at birth (Taschuk and Griebel, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, the rumen's contributions to nutrient degradation and the provision of energy are minimal in the pre-ruminant calf, relative to more advanced stages of development.</p><p>Until the third week of life, calves are considered non-ruminants, because their rumen is anatomically and physiologically underdeveloped (Davis and Drackley, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Baldwin et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). At this stage, their diet is predominantly milk, which bypasses the rumen and is carried by the esophagical groove into the fourth stomach, termed the abomasum (Davis and Drackley, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The beginning of solid food intake (i.e., starter concentrate) around 3 weeks of age triggers a critical process of transition from a functional non-ruminant to a true ruminant that relies on the establishment and activity of the rumen microbiota. During this transition stage (3&#8211;8 weeks), solid intake increases, and this increasing supply of substrates allows for microbial degradation, resulting in increased VFA concentrations within the rumen. These events promote a cascade of morpho-physiological shifts (i.e., rumen papillation and increased volume) in the digestive system that result in a fully functional rumen at weaning (Warner et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Davis and Drackley, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Given the critical nature of the rumen microbiota in developing calves, surprisingly little is known about the establishment and changes in composition of the rumen microbiota during the pre-weaning period. Because bacteria constitute a predominant and diverse GIT microbial domain that plays several roles, including modulation of the immune system (Bauer et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and metabolism of nutrients (Hungate, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>), most research has focused on the bacterial community (Li et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Jami et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This provides a restricted picture of the microbial diversity that exists within the calf rumen.</p><p>In addition to bacteria, methanogenic archaea are also known to colonize the GIT shortly after birth (Gagen et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Guzman et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and play an important ecological role in the mature rumen by continuous removal of hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>), which may constrain microbial growth and carbohydrate degradation at high levels (Wolin et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). However, ruminal archaea also synthesize methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which is a potent greenhouse gas released during eructation and a relevant source of dietary energy loss for the host (Liu and Whitman, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Knapp et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Given that manipulation of the archaeal community is desirable for both environmental and nutritional aspects, the identification of the factors that affect its establishment in the developing rumen may guide efforts in the formulation of strategies to mitigate enteric methane emissions with long-term effects and economic viability.</p><p>Anaerobic fungi, like the ruminal bacteria, are known to play a prominent role in the degradation of fibrous plant material due to their ability to disrupt vegetal tissues and facilitate the colonization of fiber particles by fibrolytic bacteria. The ruminal fungi also produce a wide range of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes to ferment complex carbohydrates, releasing great amounts of H<sub>2</sub> that favor the archaeal community (Bauchop, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; McAllister et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Therefore, anaerobic fungal activity may shape the structure of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the mature rumen, and consequently, influence fiber utilization efficiency and methanogenesis (Tripathi et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kittelmann et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Some anaerobic fungal communities are able to establish in the rumen even in the absence of dietary fiber, as observed in lambs (Fonty et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>), but the factors that affect their establishment, distribution and survival in the developing bovine rumen remains poorly explored.</p><p>Like the anaerobic fungi, ciliate protozoa have a close association with rumen archaeal and bacterial communities and can impact nutrient digestibility, fermentation and methanogenesis (Newbold et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, unlike other microbial groups, the establishment of ciliate protozoa in the rumen of young ruminants is reliant on direct or indirect contact with the saliva of adult animals (Coleman, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). In contrast to beef cattle production system where calves experience maximum maternal care, dairy calves are separated from their dams right after birth and kept isolated until weaning. Under these conditions, dairy calves are naturally protozoa-free (Sahoo et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Overall, information related to the archaeal and fungal communities in the developing rumen is limited to a handful of studies (Fonty et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Gagen et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Guzman et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) with only one study investigating all three microbial domains in calves concurrently (Dill-McFarland et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Previous work reported that bacterial communities change with age (Jami et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dill-McFarland et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) but no sequencing-based analysis has been done to concurrently assess archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities in response to pre-weaning diets.</p><p>The identification of intra- and inter-communities co-occurrence and interactions may guide the elaboration of strategies to promote colonization of microbial groups linked to health and performance of dairy calves, especially bred in challenging systems. Lastly, since the ruminant microbiota is resilient to change once it is established (Weimer, <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), it is important to track changes in the microbiota of young calves in order to determine the most suitable window of time for microbial interventions.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that diet composition impact the establishment of the rumen microbiota by selecting for taxa adapted to dietary substrates and that the ruminal microbial community changes with age by responding to the increase of solid feed intake, leading to increased microbial fermentation and rumen metabolic development. As such, the objective of this study was to characterize changes in the rumen archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities of Holstein-Gyr crossbred dairy calves across pre-weaning development on two different diets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted according to protocols approved by the Universidade Federal de Vi&#231;osa (Minas Gerais, Brazil) Animal Care and Use Committee, protocol number 27/2013. The study was carried out at the Experimental Field of Embrapa Dairy Cattle, located in Coronel Pacheco, Minas Gerais, from October to April 2014. A total of 45 newborn male crossbred (3/4 to 15/16 Holstein &#215; Gyr) dairy calves from a fixed-time insemination protocol were removed from their dams after birth (within 24 h), weighed (35 &#177; 3.6 kg), identified and housed in individual shelters to avoid direct contact between calves and mature animals. Colostrum from their dams was offered to 10% of body weight at birth (BW), fractionated into two daily meals (morning and afternoon) until the 3rd day of life. Calves were randomly assigned to one of two diets (M: only whole milk to 10% of BW or MC: whole milk to 10% of BW plus starter concentrate <italic>ad libitum</italic>) and four slaughter age groups (7, 28, 49, and 63 days). Thus, 7 groups were formed: M-7d (<italic>n</italic> = 6), M-28d (<italic>n</italic> = 6), M-49d (<italic>n</italic> = 7), M-63d (<italic>n</italic> = 6), MC-28d (<italic>n</italic> = 6), MC-49d (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and MC-63d (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Regardless of diet group, water was available to all animals <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Calves slaughtered at 7 days of age were fed exclusively colostrum and milk, because starter concentrate intake is negligible in the first week of life. The starter concentrate was formulated to provide National Research Council (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) dietary recommendations for dairy calves, and was made available in buckets, which were refilled daily after evaluating intake (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>Calves were euthanized with an injection of Acepromazine (0.013 mg/kg), Thiopental (0.125 mg/kg), and Potassium chloride (80&#8211;120 mL). Immediately after euthanasia, the body cavity was opened and the rumen was isolated with polyethylene seals (zip locks) to avoid reflux of ingesta between compartments. Ruminal aliquots (50 and 25 mL) were collected and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C until DNA extraction and VFA analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Volatile fatty acid analysis</title><p>The VFA concentration of rumen samples was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In brief, the samples of ruminal fluid were thawed at room temperature, centrifuged (12,000 &#215; g for 10 min at 4&#176;C) and the supernatant (1.5 mL) was treated using the methods described by Siegfried et al. (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) and analyzed by HPLC using a Dionex Ultimate 3,000 Dual system with a Shodex RI-101 refractive index detector and a Phenomenex Rezex ROA (300 &#215; 7.8 mm) ion-exclusion column at 45&#176;C. The mobile phase was analyzed using H2SO4 (5 mM) at a flow of 0.7 mL/min. Samples were compared to standards containing increasing concentrations (up to 20 mM) of acetate, butyrate, propionate, formate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, succinate, valerate, and lactate.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction and sequencing</title><p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from rumen fluid following methods described by Stevenson and Weimer (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Briefly, the samples of ruminal fluid were thawed at room temperature, centrifuged (8,000 &#215; g for 25 min at 4&#176;C) and the supernatant was discharged. The cells were re-suspended in 2 mL of cold extraction buffer and 1 mL of cell suspension was lysed by heating and mechanical disruption. DNA was purified by phenol and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and resuspended in TE buffer. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and shipped on dry ice to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for sequencing. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA, V6-V8 of the archaeal 16S rRNA and the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) were amplified using primers described by Klindworth et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Kittelmann et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For bacteria, PCR reactions consisted of 50 ng template DNA, 0.4 &#956;M of each primer, 1X Kapa Hifi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems), and water to 25 &#956;L. For archaea and fungi, DNA was increased to 100 ng and primers to 1.6 &#956;M each. PCR was performed at 95&#176;C for 3 min, 95&#176;C for 30 s, 55&#176;C for 30 s, 72&#176;C for 30 s (25 cycles for bacteria; 35 cycles for archaea and fungi) and a final extension step at 72&#176;C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by PureLink&#174; Pro 96 PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen) and a second PCR was performed on products to attach Illumina sequencing adapters and unique dual indices. PCR reactions were similar to those for V3&#8211;V4 (bacteria) except 5 &#956;L of unquantified PCR product was used as template DNA and 8 cycles were performed. PCR products were recovered by gel extraction in AquaP&#333;r LM low-melt agarose (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Purified DNA was quantified by Qubit&#174; Fluorometer (Invitrogen) and equimolar pooled to create a single sample at 1 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> ng per &#956;L). Sequencing was performed using the 2 &#215; 300 bp paired-end method on an Illumina MiSeq following manufacturer's guidelines (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All DNA sequences have been deposited in the NCBI's Short Read Archive under BioProject <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:sra" xlink:href="PRJNA381944">PRJNA381944</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Archaea, bacteria and fungi sequences were processed separately using mothur (v1.35.0) (Schloss et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) with procedures modified from Kozich et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Briefly, paired-end reads were joined using default parameters in make.contigs (same base bonus = 1, different base penalty = &#8722;1, gap penalty = &#8722;2, gap extension penalty = &#8722;1). Sequences with a length shorter than 250 bp or longer than 600 bp containing ambiguous characters or exhibiting a homopolymer greater than 8 bp were removed. Archaeal and bacterial sequences were aligned using the SILVA 16S rRNA gene reference database (Pruesse et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and pre-clustered to remove sequencing errors. Fungal sequences were de novo aligned and pre-clustered. The Uchime algorithm was used to detect chimeric sequences (Edgar et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and sequences that did not align to the correct region or were chimeric were removed. The sequences were taxonomy assigned using the Wang method, with a bootstrap cut-off of 80. Taxonomic assignment of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal ITS sequences was performed using respectively, the RIM-DB (Seedorf et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), Greengenes (DeSantis et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and Neocallimastigomycota (Koetschan et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reference databases. All sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by uncorrected pairwise distances clustered by the nearest neighbor method with a similarity cutoff of 97%. Coverage was assessed by Good's coverage and samples that displayed coverage &lt;95% (two samples in the fungi data set) were discarded prior to normalization. Due to different sequencing depths, OTU tables were normalized to equal sequence counts, with 103 archaeal, 3,012 bacterial, and 107 fungal sequences per sample. The normalized OTU tables were used to determine the alpha diversity (Chao1, Shannon and inverse Simpson) indexes and the relative abundance (reads/total reads in a sample) of OTUs and higher taxa in each rumen sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (v3.2.3) and tests were assessed as significant if <italic>P</italic>-values and or False Discovery Rate (FDR) &#8804; 0.05.

Differences in archaeal, bacterial, and fungal alpha-diversity, as determined by Chao1, inverse Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices as well as VFA concentration of rumen samples in response to diet, age, and interaction (diet<sup>*</sup>age), were assessed by a two-way ANOVA (type III error). The <italic>P</italic>-values were adjusted for FDR using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. This analysis was performed in R using functions available in the car package (Fox and Weisberg, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Beta-diversity of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities were determined by two approaches: Venn diagrams to visualize how many unique OTUs are shared across developmental stages of M and MC calves, as well as canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to assess dissimilarities in the microbial community composition. Venn diagrams were built with OTUs that represented &#8805;0.1% of the total community within each of the microbial groups (bacteria, archaea or fungi) in at least one sample and that were detected in at least two calves in each diet<sup>*</sup>age group using functions available in the R packages VennDiagram (Chen, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and venn (Dusa, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The CAP analysis was performed with OTUs (at &gt;0.1% relative abundance in at least one sample) clustered by the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index corrected according to Legendre and Legendre (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The permutation test (nperm = 999) was performed to assess the significance of constraints for each factor (diet, age, and diet<sup>*</sup>age) as well as for each constrained axis (CAP1 and CAP2). The Bray-Curtis dissimilarities ordinated by CAP were plotted according to diet and age groups with ellipses defined by standard deviation with a 95% confidence limit. These analyses were performed in R using functions available in vegan (Oksanen et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and ggplot2 (Wickham, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Differences in the relative abundance of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal taxa in response to diet, age, and diet<sup>*</sup>age were assessed by Poisson regression (Jonsson et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), followed by analysis of deviance (<italic>F</italic>-test, type III error) and Tukey's Honest Significant Difference test (HSD).

Studies performed with culture-based techniques suggested that microbial colonization is sequential because bacteria are the first microbial group found in the neonatal rumen (1&#8211;2 days old), followed by methanogenic archaea (calves 3&#8211;14 days of age), anaerobic fungi (lambs 8&#8211;10 days of age), and then protozoa (calves &gt; 56 days of age) (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1987a</xref>; Fonty et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Minato et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). However, more recent work with molecular techniques identified archaea and bacteria in the rumen within hours of birth (Skillman et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gagen et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Guzman et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that initial colonization occurs prior to or during calving. Moreover, little is known regarding how important early-life factors like diet impact the colonization and persistence of microbes in the rumen. To address this, we characterized the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities in the rumen of pre-weaning dairy calves fed two diets (M: milk-fed and MC: milk plus starter concentrate fed) across four developmental stages (7, 28, 49, and 63 days old) and investigated the impact of diet on the composition and abundance of pre-weaning rumen communities.</p><p>The results of our study reveal that the main microbial groups commonly found in the mature rumen are established in the rumen of dairy calves at 1 week of age. These include methanogenic archaea, (<italic>Mbb. gottschalkii</italic> clade, <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. A4 and <italic>Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus</italic>), bacteria known to occupy different metabolic niches (<italic>Bacteroides, Butyrivibrio, Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus</italic>) and anaerobic fungi with known prominent roles in fiber degradation (<italic>Caecomyces, Orpinomyces</italic>, SK3). These results show that colonization of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities occur prior to the introduction of solid food (Bryant et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>; Fonty et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Guzman et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and supports the suggestion that microbiota-related interventions could be viable right after birth (Abecia et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The main substrate for rumen microorganisms in calves prior to solid feed intake is liquid colostrum, milk or milk replacer that fails to flow directly to the abomasum through the esophageal groove and instead, enters the rumen (Wise and Anderson, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">1939</xref>; Wise et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1942</xref>; Anderson et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1987b</xref>; Rey et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>). The bucket feeding system used in this study increases the frequency of esophageal groove failure and the amount of liquid food entering the rumen (Wise and Anderson, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">1939</xref>; Wise et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1942</xref>; Labussi&#232;re et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that we identified VFAs in ruminal samples from 7-day-old calves fed exclusively colostrum and milk (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">8</xref>). These findings support the model that some bacteria and fungi establish in the rumen early on in life, and utilize milk nutrients such as lactose and carbon as energy sources (Russell and Baldwin, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Marounek et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Phillips and Gordon, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Rainey, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Further, the presence of members from the archaeal genus <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> in the rumen of M calves may be favored by lactose-fermenting bacteria and fungi that release hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), both of which are substrates for methanogenesis (Bauchop and Mountfort, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Wolin and Miller, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>).</p><p>However, milk-associated nutrients fail to explain the presence of members from the genus <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. A4 in very young calves. <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. is known to obtain energy exclusively from the reduction of methanol. Methanol is produced in the rumen through the hydrolysis of pectin, a carbohydrate absent in milk (Miller and Wolin, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Pol and Demeyer, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Fricke et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that alternative pathways for methanol production may be present (Dorokhov et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), or that some <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. capable of utilizing other substrates exist in the rumen of M calves. Likewise, the spillage of milk into the rumen may not be directly responsible for the presence of members from genus <italic>Succiniclasticum</italic>, which convert succinate to propionate as their sole energy-yielding mechanism (van Gylswyk, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). We speculate that establishment of <italic>Succiniclasticum</italic> may be supported by <italic>Bulleidia</italic> and <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> (succinate-producers), given the positive association among these genera in the rumen of M calves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This strong and positive association between <italic>Succiniclasticum</italic> and <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> in M calves was not observed in MC calves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), likely due to the greater availability of succinate resulting from starch fermentation by other succinate-producers. Overall, our data suggests the existence of opportunistic associations between rumen microorganisms in response to diet.</p><p>While the establishment of the microbiota occurs regardless of solid food intake, diet was a strong determinant of the abundance of bacterial and archaeal taxa in the rumen of calves. In the bacterial community of MC calves, the introduction of starter concentrate intake promoted an increase in the relative abundance of taxa known to degrade readily fermentable carbohydrates (i.e., <italic>Succinivibrio, Sharpea, Megasphaera</italic>) at 28 days of age, although these taxa did not persist with increasing age. In contrast, we observed that the bacterial community in the rumen of M calves was dominated by taxa from the genera <italic>Lactobacillus, Bacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>, whose abundances decreased with age but remained higher than in MC calves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This suggests that diet is an important factor that affects the bacterial community over this short time frame, potentially by acting as a selective mechanism for taxa adapted to new substrates. However, the persistence of diet-related responses in older calves likely depends on other factors that accompany increasing age, such as ruminal development and host-microbe interactions.</p><p>Consistent with our results, previous work has shown that the genus <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> is present in low proportions in the rumen of calves at 2 days old and that its abundance increases after the provision solid food (Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), followed by a subsequent decrease post-weaning (Meale et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The primary <italic>Succinivibrio</italic> found in the rumen (<italic>S. dextrinosolvens</italic>) ferments starch hydrolysis products (maltose, dextrin, glucose) into primarily succinate, acetate, and formate (Bryant and Small, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>) and has a negative association with ruminal pH (Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and molar proportion of acetate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Another specialist genus whose abundance increased in response to calf starter was <italic>Megasphaera</italic>. In a similar study, the abundance of this genus was very low in the rumens of neonate calves, and displayed a tendency to increase with age or solid food provision (Jami et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> was identified at low proportion (0.4&#8211;0.6%) in the rumens of calves pre- and post-weaning (Meale et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and its presence was not reported in studies performed with calves fed milk replacer (Li et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or milk with starter concentrate and hay (Malmuthuge et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Rey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the abundance of <italic>Megasphaera</italic> in the developing rumen is low, and that dietary strategies to promote its colonization may be of interest, as members of this genus, like <italic>M. elsdenii</italic>, are known as efficient lactate-utilizing bacteria whose activities result in propionate and butyrate production, VFAs known to stimulate the development and differentiation of the rumen epithelium (Counotte et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Malhi et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, the activity of <italic>M. elsdenii</italic> may prevent the accumulation of lactic acid from lactate-producers, thereby minimizing ruminal acidosis in calves during adaptation to starter concentrate (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1987b</xref>; Quigley et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the ruminal bacteria, we found that the relative abundance of methanogens was responsive to the inclusion of concentrate in the calf diet. Previous reports indicate that <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> are dominant in the rumens of calves fed milk plus starter concentrate (Rey et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and that <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> increases markedly after the beginning of solid food intake (Rey et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). Here, we observed higher relative abundances of <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. A4 in the rumens of MC calves. This is likely directly attributed to diet composition, as pectin was present in the main ingredients (Malathi and Devegowda, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) of the starter concentrate used in our study (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>). Thus, we posit that the methanol produced through the fermentation of pectin is made available to <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. A4 as well as methanol-utilizing bacteria such as <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, whose abundance was also significantly higher in the rumen of MC calves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Although <italic>Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus</italic> would be able to reduce methanol and or other methylated compounds for methanogenesis (Borrel et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the diet composition did not promote its colonization in the rumen of MC calves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Indeed, in both diet groups the abundance of <italic>Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus</italic> decreased markedly with age (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), probably due to competition with other methanogens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial changes resulting from the inclusion of concentrate intake (i.e., increase in the abundance of amylolytic populations) can also lead to decreases in the acetate-to-propionate ratio and H<sub>2</sub> availability within the rumen (Johnson and Johnson, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Martin et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), which in turn affects the archaeal community (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These dynamics may reflect changes in the archaeal community by favoring <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> sp. that require only 1 mol of H<sub>2</sub> to produce 1 mol of CH<sub>4</sub>, as opposed to <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> species that require 4 mols of H<sub>2</sub> in order to produce 1 mol of CH<sub>4</sub> (Miller and Wolin, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Fricke et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Sun et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, the abundance of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> in our study was negatively correlated with <italic>Methanosphaera</italic> across developmental stages of M and MC calves (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), possibly due to competition for H<sub>2</sub> within the rumen (Miller and Wolin, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Janssen and Kirs, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the ruminal archaea and bacteria, diet and age did not affect the rumen fungal communities in our study. Members from the genera <italic>Caecomyces</italic> and SK3 were identified in at least 60% of all calves at 7 days old, remained abundant, and were irresponsive to the inclusion of starter concentrate. In addition, we observed that members from the genera <italic>Anaeromyces, Piromyces, Neocallimastix</italic>, and DT1 did not establish in all calves and were not identified as part of the core fungal community in M or MC calves. These results are comparable to calves raised on milk plus starter pellets, where rumen fungi were highly variable pre-weaning and not dramatically impacted by diet (milk-replacer plus calf starter) until the weaning transition (Dill-McFarland et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In contrast, Fonty et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) identified <italic>Neocallimastix frontalis</italic> and <italic>Caecomyces communis</italic> (previously <italic>Sphaeromonas communis sensu Orpin</italic>) in the rumen of lambs at 8&#8211;10 days old, although these fungi disappeared in almost all of the lambs after concentrate and hay were offered. Given the importance of rumen fungi in fiber degradation, these results may indicate that fungi do not effectively establish until a continual influx of fiber is available to the rumen, although further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>The fungal genera identified in our study (<italic>Neocallimastix, Orpinomyces</italic>, and <italic>Piromyces</italic>) and in previous reports (Fonty et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Dill-McFarland et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) include species well known for fiber degradation; many of these species are also able to utilize starch and its breakdown products. The extent to which this occurs depends on the fungal species and carbohydrate source (Phillips and Gordon, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, McAllister et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Starch fermentation is a sought-after niche in the rumen, and the slow growth rate of fungi, relative to bacteria, constitutes a limiting factor for competition of these substrates (McAllister et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). The rapid release of acetate, formate and lactate from starch fermentation causes a drop in ruminal pH that may inhibit fungal growth (Srinivasan et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Collectively these factors have been ascribed to decreases in the rumen fungal community of adult ruminants fed a grain-rich diet, relative to animals on a forage-based diet (Denman et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Boots et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kumar et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results provide new insights into the colonization and associations within the microbiota of the developing calf rumen. We found that archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities co-occur in the rumen early on during calf development but are impacted differently by pre-weaning diet and age. We observed that the inclusion of starter concentrate significantly affected rumen bacterial communities by promoting increases in bacteria known to readily degrade fermentable carbohydrates and depressing those reliant on milk components like lactose. These bacterial changes likely resulted in apparent diet-driven differences in the archaeal community, likely due to altered fermentation patterns and availability of hydrogen in the rumen. No such differences were found for ruminal fungi, likely due to the low availability of fiber content in the provided concentrate. These results indicate that pre-weaning manipulation of the rumen microbiota may be possible through dietary intervention and our study serves as a useful framework for designing strategies aimed at promoting colonization of target microbes linked to improved development of the calf.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>JD, MM, and FM designed the experiment.
