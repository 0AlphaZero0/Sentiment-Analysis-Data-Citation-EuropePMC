Giantin, encoded by the <italic>golgb1</italic> gene, is a member of the golgin family of proteins that reside within the Golgi stack, but its function remains elusive. Loss of function of giantin in rats causes osteochondrodysplasia; knockout mice show milder defects, notably a cleft palate. <italic>In vitro</italic>, giantin has been implicated in Golgi organisation, biosynthetic trafficking, and ciliogenesis. Here we show that loss of function of giantin in zebrafish, using either morpholino or knockout techniques, causes defects in cilia function. Giantin morphants have fewer cilia in the neural tube and those remaining are longer. Mutants have the same number of cilia in the neural tube but these cilia are also elongated. Scanning electron microscopy shows that loss of giantin results in an accumulation of material at the ciliary tip, consistent with a loss of function of retrograde intraflagellar transport. Mutants show milder defects than morphants consistent with adaptation to loss of giantin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary:</bold> Morpholino knockdown of Golgb1/giantin leads to a severe cilopathy phenotype twinned with longer, misshapen cilia.

It is estimated that one-third of the proteome traverses the ER-to-Golgi transport pathway (<xref rid="BIO025502C38" ref-type="bibr">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>). This includes delivery of key developmental signalling receptors to the plasma membrane and assembly of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which presents a major secretory load during development of the early embryo (<xref rid="BIO025502C39" ref-type="bibr">Zhong, 2011</xref>). The organisation of Golgi membranes into flattened disc shapes is orchestrated by 11 members of the Golgi matrix protein family (golgins) that decorate the Golgi surface to form a mesh. Many of these proteins mediate the docking and tethering of coat protein (COP) coated transport vesicles, COPI and COPII, at the Golgi cisternae, whilst others are involved in inter-cisternal tethering (<xref rid="BIO025502C12" ref-type="bibr">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>). These functions are carried out by coiled-coiled domains common to all golgins, which autonomously fold into long rod-like structures. Golgins are sufficient to direct the tethering of incoming vesicles to the Golgi with some overlap seen in their function (<xref rid="BIO025502C36" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The largest member of the golgin family is giantin (encoded by the <italic>golgb1</italic> gene), which has a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) and 37 predicted coiled-coiled domains. As such, its &#945;-helical coils have a predicted reach of up to 450&#8197;nm into the cytoplasm from the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>medial</italic> Golgi membranes (<xref rid="BIO025502C23" ref-type="bibr">Munro, 2011</xref>). The exact function of giantin is still unclear. There is biochemical evidence of a role for giantin in tethering COPI vesicles (<xref rid="BIO025502C37" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura et al., 2004</xref>), however, artificial relocation of giantin to mitochondria does not reveal a clear role in tethering incoming vesicles (<xref rid="BIO025502C36" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). This suggests that either it does not act as a tether or that its function is redundant with that of other golgins. Giantin is present in all vertebrate genomes but is not found in invertebrates including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In those organisms that express it, giantin is widely expressed and is found in almost all tissues.</p><p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based apical cell projections, built as extensions from the mother centriole in almost all non-cycling cells. Ciliary cargo, varying from cilia-specific proteins to signalling pathway components, is trafficked along the microtubule-based axoneme by intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde movement from the base to the tip is driven by IFT-B/kinesin-2, whereas retrograde transport is IFT-A/dynein-2 driven (<xref rid="BIO025502C11" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>). This equilibrium between anterograde and retrograde IFT is crucial for cilia to act as signalling platforms for many signalling pathways, including some which are key to development, such as the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling cascade. Multiple members of the IFT complex and Hh signalling cascade are mutated in ciliopathies associated with severe skeletal defects, including short rib polydactyly and Jeune syndrome (<xref rid="BIO025502C14" ref-type="bibr">Huber and Cormier-Daire, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work revealed an unexpected role for giantin in ciliogenesis (<xref rid="BIO025502C1" ref-type="bibr">Asante et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that acute depletion of giantin in epithelial cells results in fewer but longer cilia (<xref rid="BIO025502C1" ref-type="bibr">Asante et al., 2013</xref>). Giantin is required for the localisation of the dynein-2 intermediate chain WD-repeat protein 34 (WDR34) at the base of the cilium. Since dynein-2 is the retrograde motor for IFT within cilia, we reasoned that loss of giantin might affect transport within the cilium and explain the defects in both ciliogenesis and length control.</p><p>Rodent models with loss-of-function mutations in giantin have been described. A spontaneous 10&#8197;bp insertion in <italic>Rattus norvegicus golgb1</italic> (Rn-Golgb1) was shown to be a functional knockout of giantin. This recessive mutation leads to an osteochondrodysplasia (ocd) phenotype with homozygous mutant pups exhibiting craniofacial abnormalities, oedema, shorter limbs, and defects in collagen-rich matrix deposition, leading to late embryonic lethality (<xref rid="BIO025502C15" ref-type="bibr">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, <italic>golgb1</italic> knockout mice were generated using both N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis (<xref rid="BIO025502C20" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2016</xref>). These animals show no gross abnormalities in skeletal development, including development of craniofacial structures, other than cleft palate and an abnormal deposition of glycosylated bone ECM as recognised by peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin (<xref rid="BIO025502C20" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2016</xref>). The discrepancies in severity of the phenotypes of these rodent models could be due to species differences or genetic background. Nonetheless, both show extensive defects in ECM secretion and/or assembly.</p><p>Here, we describe that acute depletion of giantin in zebrafish leads to defects in cilia number and structure. These data show that acute depletion of giantin <italic>in vivo</italic> recapitulates ciliary defects seen <italic>in vitro</italic>. They also suggest that species-specific adaptive changes might underlie the phenotypic variability seen in these giantin knockout animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Acute knockdown and genetic knockout approach to assess giantin function in the zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish giantin is encoded by 20 exons, with the translational start site (TSS), the human to zebrafish conserved coding sequence for the p115 binding site, and C-terminal TMD at exon 2, 3, and 20, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>A).

To knockdown giantin, two antisense morpholinos (MOs) were designed against the zebrafish <italic>golgb1</italic> gene, the first targeting the TSS (ATG MO) located in exon 2 (ATG MO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>A), and a second targeting a highly-conserved splice site located across intron 13 and the start of exon 14 (E14 MO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>A). We validated the efficacy of the E14 MO using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on cDNA generated from RNA extracted from controls and E14 morphants. Abnormal splicing following injection with the E14 morpholino was demonstrated by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>B). To complement our MO knockdown experiments, we also examined the role of giantin using two mutant alleles. The sa11389 mutant, carries a (C&gt;T) point mutation in exon 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>A,C) resulting in generation of a premature stop codon at glutamine-2948 (henceforth denoted <italic>golgb1<sup>Q2948X</sup></italic>). In addition to the ENU allele, we generated a new mutant line by TALEN mutagenesis, whereby TAL arms were targeted to a conserved region in exon 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>A). Injection of capped mRNA including these arms gave rise to genetically mosaic fish, and by screening the F1 generation we identified a carrier with an 8&#8197;bp insertion in exon 14 in the spacer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>C). This resulted in a frameshift at position 3029, and a premature stop codon at position 3078 (E3027fsX3078-T3028_A3029del, henceforth called <italic>golgb1<sup>x3078</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>D,E). This carrier transmitted the identified mutation through the germline allowing a mutant line to be maintained. Both lines are predicted to be loss-of-function mutations as they include premature stop codons that terminate the coding region upstream of the transmembrane spanning region at the C-terminal end of the protein.</p><p>Embryos injected with either the ATG or the E14 MO show no obvious morphological defects for the first 24&#8197;h of development, however by 2&#8197;days post fertilisation (dpf) larvae display a range of phenotypes including smaller eyes, reduction in total body length, kinks and curls in the tail and frequent oedema of the heart and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>F). These phenotypes are characteristic of ciliopathies in zebrafish, as seen upon dynein-2 and polycystin-2 depletion (<xref rid="BIO025502C9" ref-type="bibr">Fogelgren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO025502C19" ref-type="bibr">Krock et al., 2009</xref>). We characterised relative severity based on phenotypical characteristics depicted in giantin morphants into four groups: wild type-like (WT-L), mild, moderate, and severe. The mild classification was assigned when one or two characteristics were observed in a mild manner. Identifying three characteristics of which at least one in a severe manner or four &#8216;mild&#8217; phenotypes were classed as moderate. Severe labels were assigned to individuals exhibiting four or more phenotypical outcomes, of which at least two severe at 2&#8197;dpf. The relative distribution of phenotypes between ATG and E14 MOs were similar at 48&#8197;hpf. Moreover, co-injection with p53 MO did not alter the phenotypes observed in giantin MOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>G). Furthermore, injection of lower ATG or E14 MO dosages resulted in lower penetrance (59.4% and 52.9%, respectively) of the observed &#8216;severe&#8217; phenotype (data not shown).</p><p>To determine whether the phenotypes seen on acute knockdown of giantin using morpholinos would be recapitulated in a knockout, we studied the larvae of the two loss-of-function mutant alleles described above. Somewhat surprisingly, these homozygous giantin knockout fish did not show any major morphological defects at 5&#8197;dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>H). Interestingly, homozygous mutants carrying either allele are viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>H) and can produce viable offspring. During juvenile development, they did show a small but significant difference in growth (a reduction of 11.86% and 5.4%, respectively, along the anterior to posterior axis) at 50&#8197;dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>I,J).

We injected the E14 splice morpholino into the <italic>Q2984X</italic> mutant line. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>, when the MO was injected into WT embryos 73% of larvae exhibited the &#8216;severe&#8217; ciliopathy-like phenotype. In contrast, <italic>golgb1<sup>Q2948X/Q2948X</sup></italic> embryos injected with the same concentration of E14 morpholino did not display the most severe phenotypes, instead a majority (77.5%) of the mutants displayed a mild phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F5">Fig.&#160;5</xref>D, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F5">5</xref>E). Our interpretation here is that the severe phenotypes (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F1">Fig.&#160;1</xref>) are due to depletion of giantin following MO injection and not due to off-target effects.</p><p>While knockdown and knockout fish show similar phenotypes, there are clear differences in terms of severity. These differences between acute and chronic loss of giantin are perhaps most easily explained by long-term compensation in the mutant fish via changes to expression of other genes. Since golgins have been shown to have overlapping functions (<xref rid="BIO025502C36" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>) indicating functional redundancy, we performed qPCR of golgins (GRASP55, GRASP65, GM130, GMAP-210, golgin-160, golgin-84, CASP, GCC88, GCC185, golgin-97, golgin-245, GORAB, and TMF) and p115, a well-defined giantin interacting protein, to determine whether any were upregulated at the transcriptional level in response to loss of giantin function. No significant difference in golgin expression was found when determining the mRNA expression levels of 15 amplicons from three independent total RNA pools of 5&#8197;dpf WT and <italic>golgb1<sup>Q2948X/Q2948X</sup></italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO025502F5">Fig.&#160;5</xref>F).

Consistent with this, smoothened trafficking was also indistinguishable between WT and giantin knockdown hTERT-RPE1 cells (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.025502.supplemental">Fig&#160;S3</uri>). Therefore, the phenotypes described here are not likely to result from defective Shh signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we show that the largest Golgi matrix protein, giantin, plays a role in ciliogenesis and control of ciliary length <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous work showed that giantin is required for the ciliary localisation of the WDR34 intermediate chain subunit of the retrograde IFT motor dynein-2 (<xref rid="BIO025502C1" ref-type="bibr">Asante et al., 2013</xref>). Knockdown of giantin in mammalian cells also led to a reduction in cilia number whilst the remaining cilia were longer (<xref rid="BIO025502C1" ref-type="bibr">Asante et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in human dynein-2 components lead to skeletal ciliopathies (<xref rid="BIO025502C22" ref-type="bibr">McInerney-Leo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="BIO025502C26" ref-type="bibr">Schmidts et al., 2013a</xref>,<xref rid="BIO025502C27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="BIO025502C28" ref-type="bibr">Schmidts et al., 2015</xref>), where defects in cilia formation and/or function result in pathologies associated with formation of the skeleton (<xref rid="BIO025502C14" ref-type="bibr">Huber and Cormier-Daire, 2012</xref>). These ciliogenesis defects seen in cells are phenocopied here <italic>in vivo</italic> where we show that <italic>golgb1</italic> morpholino knockdown leads to a ciliopathy-like phenotype. Bulbous ciliary tips are seen upon acute depletion of giantin in zebrafish and in cultured pig kidney epithelial cells, consistent with a defect in retrograde IFT. This is also consistent with other work showing loss of the dynein-2 motor heavy chain subunit leads to shorter cilia and bulbous tips in the zebrafish (<xref rid="BIO025502C19" ref-type="bibr">Krock et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with morphant data, we found that cilia in the neural tube were significantly longer in homozygous mutant fish. This phenotype was not fully penetrant as cilia number was normal, potentially through tissue-specific compensation upon chronic loss of giantin.</p><p>Some phenotypic discrepancies between giantin morphants and homozygous mutants were observed, suggesting a compensation mechanism following gene knockout. Overall, the effect of giantin knockout is less significant than depletion by morpholino injection. It has been estimated that 90-95% of genomic zebrafish knockouts do not resemble the acute morpholino knockdown phenotypes (<xref rid="BIO025502C18" ref-type="bibr">Kok et al., 2015</xref>). This discrepancy between knockdown and genetic knockout phenotypes has also been shown in other model systems including mouse (<xref rid="BIO025502C7" ref-type="bibr">Daude et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO025502C8" ref-type="bibr">De Souza et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="BIO025502C10" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="BIO025502C24" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al. (2015)</xref> described that &#8216;long term&#8217; ECM-dependent compensatory mechanisms are active to compensate for chronic loss of vascular ECM regulator <italic>egfl7</italic>. RNA sequencing screening led to the identification of Emilin2 and Emilin3 ECM components as compensatory factors in genetic <italic>egfl7</italic> knockouts (<xref rid="BIO025502C24" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>). Our work suggests that genetic compensation in the mutant fish is unlikely to have occurred through changes in expression of other golgins, as mRNA transcript levels were equivalent in WT and mutant fish. Owing to a lack of effective reagents, we were not able to determine the effect on protein expression by immunoblot or immunofluorescence. Similarly, we were not able to rescue phenotypes on exogenous stimulation of hedgehog signalling and we could detect no defects in smoothened trafficking to cilia in siRNA duplex giantin-depleted cells in culture.</p><p>We also note considerable variation in phenotypes between the mouse (<xref rid="BIO025502C20" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2016</xref>), rat (<xref rid="BIO025502C15" ref-type="bibr">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>), and zebrafish <italic>giantin</italic> knockout animal models. Knockout mice have non-syndromic cleft palate but show limited skeletal phenotypes; knockout rats show osteochondrodysplasia with oedema. Both rodent models die during late embryonic development. In contrast, our fish survive to adulthood, and this might reflect differences in developmental pathways, or in the mechanisms of compensation for loss of giantin function. Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> work implicated giantin in the secretion of ECM (<xref rid="BIO025502C21" ref-type="bibr">McCaughey et al., 2016</xref>) and we are now actively studying this in our knockout models. It is possible that the capacity to adapt the ECM during development varies between both tissues and species and that this could compound the variation in phenotypes observed. This variety of phenotypes may also partially explain why acute knockdown and chronic knockout of <italic>golgb1</italic> show differences, since acute knockdown may not trigger an adequate compensatory response due to giantin protein remnants. In summary, our data using <italic>in vivo</italic> models complement our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> work to support a role for giantin in controlling cilia formation and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and transgenic lines</title><p>The London AB (AB), Tupfel long fin (TL), and AB/TL strains were used and maintained according to standard conditions (<xref rid="BIO025502C35" ref-type="bibr">Westerfield, 2000</xref>) and staged accordingly (<xref rid="BIO025502C17" ref-type="bibr">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>).
