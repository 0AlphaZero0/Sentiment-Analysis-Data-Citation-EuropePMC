Parasites optimize their metabolism to utilize the available inadequate resources by adapting to those environments. Lately, a number of metabolomics studies have revived the interest to understand metabolic strategies utilized by the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite for optimal survival within its hosts. For the first time, we propose a reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model for <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> JPCM5, the analyses of which not only captures observations reported by metabolomics studies in other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species but also divulges novel features of the <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolome. Our results indicate that <italic>Leishmania</italic> metabolism is organized in such a way that the parasite can select appropriate alternatives to compensate for limited external substrates. A dynamic non-essential amino acid motif exists within the network that promotes a restricted redistribution of resources to yield required essential metabolites. Further, subcellular compartments regulate this metabolic re-routing by reinforcing the physiological coupling of specific reactions. This unique metabolic organization is robust against accidental errors and provides a wide array of choices for the parasite to achieve optimal survival.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Leishmaniasis is a complex, widespread neglected tropical disease in humans caused by <italic>Leishmania</italic> protozoan parasites, spread through infected female sandfly bites. There are around 1 million cases reported for cutaneous leishmaniasis in the last 5 years and between 200,000 to 400,000 infected cases reported annually for the deadlier clinical manifestation, visceral leishmaniasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The long-standing association with hosts has equipped the parasite with unique metabolic features that support their existence within the hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Mechanisms of metabolic adaptation of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite to a variety of external metabolite sources and their stage-specific utilization has been a recurring question<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recent<sup>13</sup>C-isotope-labelled tracing studies in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> indicate that glucose and amino acids, like aspartate, alanine, proline and glutamate, are catabolized through common metabolic routes employed by both the promastigote and amastigote stages of the parasite and propose stage-specific flux changes of pathways that are hard-wired to the differentiation signals within the parasite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The common metabolic routes specify the use of a core set of enzymes within <italic>L. mexicana</italic> metabolism that can metabolize different sources in both stages. The knowledge of these core metabolic routes and enzymes is still incomplete in other <italic>Leishmania</italic> species. Furthermore, the causal reasons for the choice of specific metabolites and their metabolic routes to satisfy the cellular demand of the parasite are still debated upon. One of the speculated reasons is that the differentiation of promastigote to amastigote brings about a lower uptake of non-essential amino acids, higher fatty acid uptake and hypoxic environment in amastigote metabolism as compared to the promastigote stages, that constrains the choice of metabolic routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>; although the intrinsic adaptation of the metabolic network structure to the environment is less discussed. Also, the metabolic enzyme repertoire across developmental stages in <italic>Leishmania</italic> (DNA microarrays in <italic>L. major</italic> and mass-spectrometry based quantitative proteomics in <italic>L. infantum</italic>) has been speculated to be constitutively expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, raising the question of how the flux changes between metabolic states for the two stages might be achieved. This is also supported by the observations from whole genome comparisons of codon usage among different species of <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which outline very few differences within metabolic genes between the species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. All the above observations motivated us to investigate the role of the underlying metabolic network structure in metabolic adaptation of <italic>L. infantum</italic> to the host environment.</p><p id="Par3">Genome-scale metabolic models of eukaryotic parasites provide a comprehensive overview of metabolic pathways and attempt to understand the stage-specific nature of parasite metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. No genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is available for <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> till date. For the first time, we propose a new manually reconstructed genome-scale metabolic network model (iAS556) for the species <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> JPCM5 (a well characterized <italic>L. infantum</italic> strain), consisting of 1260 reactions and 1160 metabolites (see Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, Methods, and Sections&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> of Supplementary Information). We hypothesize that the underlying reaction stoichiometry and reversibility present within the <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolic network are adequate to explain these specific route selections, which remain conserved across developmental stages; although, the corresponding flux changes are strong-armed by constraints on uptake of environmental metabolites. Auxiliary to the hypothesis, analyses of the proposed <italic>L. infantum</italic> genome-scale constraint-based model reveals the simplicity of metabolome organization within <italic>Leishmania</italic> and its utility to achieve complex metabolic phenotype traits for optimal usage/synthesis of essential metabolites under varying environments. Related to this, the factors that govern metabolome organization and their effects on distribution of metabolites are also unknown. Our results suggest that&#160;the coupling of specific reactions for reasons of mass, redox and energy balance, driven by subcellular compartmentalization of enzymes might be the most vital component for appropriate distribution of metabolites within the network. This organization ensures unaltered production of biomass metabolites despite random changes occurring within the parasite metabolome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Formulation of <italic>Leishmania-specific</italic> metabolic demand reaction</title><p id="Par4">A <italic>Leishmania-specific</italic> metabolic demand reaction was formulated using relative signal intensities per cell protein of metabolites normalized to the sum intensity of the total metabolite pool reported for log phase <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes averaged for 3&#8211;6 days of <italic>in vitro</italic> growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Also, the possible strategic routes to utilize a variety of carbon sources within the two stages, were also demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Given these boundary (exchange) constraints (Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> of Supplementary Information), we asked the question whether the present constraint-based model demonstrates similar metabolic routes in the <italic>L. infantum</italic> network or not. Re-creating the above-mentioned scenarios, the fate of different carbon resources between promastigote and amastigote metabolic states was predicted (see Methods) and compared (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The predicted reaction steady state fluxes represent the stoichiometrically adjusted percentage conversion of a given substrate (fate) into a subsequent product. For example, glucose is entirely converted to glucose-6-phosphate (same stoichiometry). Hence, flux of glucokinase is equal to flux through glucose uptake and represents a 100% conversion of total input glucose into glucose-6-phosphate. With sufficient availability (promastigote), glucose was largely driven towards optimal production of overflow metabolites (2.34%), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) formation (2.34%), phospholipids (20.2%), glutamate (23.7%), aspartate (23.7%), alanine (23.7%) and mannan (3.9%); further, characterized by NAD redox coupling occurring between glycolysis and succinate fermentation, entry of pyruvate, succinate and glutamate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and regeneration of NAD reducing equivalents from C4-dicarboxylic acids by oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the amastigote, which experiences a decrease in glucose uptake, the quantity of glycolytic flux is largely compromised. The preference of glucose utilization is relatively more towards AMP formation (4.41%) and mannan synthesis (7.36%) when compared with the sufficient glucose situation. The remaining glucose is utilized towards alanine formation (45%) and phospholipid formation (38.27%), whereas asparagine, tyrosine and isoleucine are utilized for formation of glutamate, glutamine and proline.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fate of environmental metabolites within the <italic>L. infantum</italic> iAS556 metabolic network.

</p><p id="Par7">As opposed to glucose, majority of alanine was utilized for satisfying the cellular demand; some of it (6.05%) was converted to pyruvate, which was&#160;either utilized for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation within glycosome or secreted as overflow in both abundant and constrained scenarios. Similarly, environmental aspartate in the promastigote is consumed and transaminated into glutamate (96.83%) and oxaloacetate in cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Oxaloacetate forms malate, which enters mitochondria as fumarate, ultimately forming alanine (56.69%). In the amastigote, aspartate uptake reduces despite &#65279;being catabolized via a similar route, the only difference being the sole formation of alanine (47.83%). Sufficient environmental glutamate is used for synthesis of glutamine (14.72%) via glycosomal GMP synthase, synthesis of proline (44.74%), aspartate by reverse de-amination of glutamate (14.72%), and glutamylcysteine to form trypanothione. In the amastigote, reduced glutamate uptake coerces its utilization into cellular metabolic demand and not as a precursor. Proline uptake (AA in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, see Methods) is preferred as the sole carbon source to produce glutamate, in order to satisfy the metabolic demand in absence of environmental glutamate (5.14%).

Under hypoxic conditions (amastigote condition), as biomass formation is sub-optimal, their utilization into biomass decreases.</p><p id="Par8">Glycine was produced solely from threonine. Leucine and isoleucine, both are utilized for provision of reduced FAD within mitochondrion. In the process, isoleucine converts into glutamate. As glutamate uptake largely reduces in amastigote, formation of glutamate and proline is largely compensated by isoleucine and leucine. Fatty acids are preferred only under glucose deficient conditions (amastigote metabolic state) and primarily provide acetyl-coA to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, thereby eventually forming glutamate. All the aforementioned predictions have also been experimentally observed from metabolomics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to the above carbon sources, the utilization of amino sugars (N-acetyl glucosamine) and mannose was also investigated. N-acetyl glucosamine is exclusively utilized under intracellular glucose-deficient, hypoxic conditions. N-acetyl glucosamine and mannose, both are utilized for provision of fructose-6-phosphate, which enters into mitochondria via succinate formation to produce alanine (98.3% and 87.76%, respectively). The uptake rates of both these sugars were predicted to decrease under hypoxic conditions of the amastigote; although, they do compensate the scarcity of glucose required for production of non-essential amino acids and mannan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, mannose also forms mannan (4.89%) and compensates the reduction in glucose uptake within the amastigote. To further support the accuracy of model predictions, experimentally observed knockout phenotypes were compared with model-predicted phenotypes. 81% known phenotypes in promastigote and 84% known phenotypes in amastigote situations were accurately predicted from the model (Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> of Supplementary Information).</p><p id="Par9">The stage-specific comparison between promastigote and amastigote flux-profiles as predicted by the model and<sup>13</sup>C isotope enrichment of metabolites, for the glucose-only situation is given in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>. It is important to note that, as there was no such targeted<sup>13</sup>C metabolomics study available for <italic>L. infantum</italic> JPCM5 and because the metabolic microenvironment experienced by different <italic>Leishmania</italic> species is rather similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the predicted reaction fluxes were compared with the&#160;<sup>13</sup>C isotope enrichment of metabolites reported in the metabolomics study available for <italic>L. mexicana</italic>.

From Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, it is clear that amastigotes demonstrate a lower synthesis of majority metabolites from glucose as compared to promastigotes owing to the reduced glucose uptake, in both experiments and model. Mannan production during the amastigote stage is larger than the&#160;promastigote in our <italic>L. infantum</italic> model, as compared to <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. The upregulation of mannan synthesis in amastigote was also observed in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A slight upregulation of the pentose-phosphate shunt was observed in the <italic>L. infantum</italic> amastigote indicating its role in satisfying the requirement of AMP under a reduced glucose uptake. It can also be observed that similar metabolites are produced from glucose in both <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> but with significant quantitative differences in both stages. The quantitative differences observed between the predicted reaction steady state fluxes in <italic>L. infantum</italic> JPCM5 and the<sup>13</sup>C isotope enrichment of metabolites available for <italic>L. mexicana</italic> might be&#160;due to &#8211; a) species-specific genes unique to <italic>L. mexicana</italic> or <italic>L. infantum</italic>. For example, metabolites of the incomplete urea cycle, are largely independent of glucose utilization and are optimally produced from different carbon sources like arginine for utilization into the metabolic demand within the <italic>L. infantum</italic> network which might not be the case in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, due to differences in underlying network structure, b) multiple subcellular locations of different enzymes that might lead to alternative paths for distribution of intermediate metabolites produced from glucose within the pathways of glycolysis, pentose-phosphate-pathway and non-essential amino acid synthesis unique to the <italic>L. infantum</italic> JPCM5 metabolic network, and/or, c) metabolic demand being different between <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, leads to an increased drain of intermediate metabolites like non-essential amino acids into the <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolic demand as compared to <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. The aforementioned reasons are only suggestive of the possibilities underlying the observed differences. Further inferences based on comparison of flux profiles in the two species can only be performed from an evolutionary perspective, given the degree of evolutionary divergence between <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and the relatedness of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> with the Sauroleishmania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which can be addressed in a future work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dynamic role of the non-essential amino acid motif in metabolic flux re-organizations</title><p id="Par10">The observation of glucose being primarily diverted towards alanine under glucose-deficient conditions specifies that glucose can be substituted by a variety of other carbon sources to fulfill metabolite requirements other than alanine. The foremost question here is how this substitution can be achieved? To answer this, we introduce the notion of a &#8220;non-essential amino acid motif&#8221;, which re-routes different metabolic inputs towards specific outputs under absence of preferred carbon sources, via implicit non-essential amino acid inter-conversions. The motif comprises of glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, tyrosine catabolic pathways, proline biosynthesis, glutamine biosynthesis, incomplete urea cycle, glycolytic and succinate fermentation pathways. To investigate their functionality, a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effect of glucose and uptakes of all amino acids, while optimizing for the formation of glutamate, alanine, aspartate, glutamine, proline, glycine, myoinositol and mannan, the formation of each considered as a separate objective function (see Methods). Apparent optimal production of each amino acid due to self-uptake was not included in analysis. Further, the metabolic demand reaction was constrained to zero flux in each case.</p><p id="Par11">Alanine is formed from a variety of resources and hence, tends to be an important overflow metabolite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Presence of environmental glucose, isoleucine and tyrosine along with asparagine or aspartate amplifies production of alanine. Alanine is also produced when both proline and glucose are present in the environment, or when glutamate, glucose and tyrosine are made available. Glucose and tyrosine provide excess glutamate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Aspartate is optimally formed from asparagine, but sub-optimally formed from environmental proline and glucose or glutamate, glucose and tyrosine combinations. Similarly, glutamine is strictly formed when asparagine, aspartate and proline are part of the environment. Aspartate and isoleucine in the environment amplify flux towards production of glutamate, glutamine and proline (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Glucose and tyrosine increase flux through proline degradation and glutamate formation, thereby producing excess glutamine (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Glutamate biosynthesis follows the same route as glutamine. Proline, like any other non-essential amino acid is formed primarily from environmental asparagine and aspartate. Glutamate uptake from environment can also supplement glucose and tyrosine to form proline. The choice of various input metabolite combinations to produce a precise repertoire of outputs is largely governed by their ability to generate internal glutamate as a precursor. The importance of glutamate has also been previously discussed in the context of energy metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Also, these metabolite utilizations are typically due to presence of a redox and energy balance between the reactions utilizing these metabolic precursors.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sensitivity of flux towards synthesis of internal metabolites to specific input metabolite uptakes &#8211; Each bar in the plot represents the maximum flux through the synthesis of specific internal metabolites due to specific input metabolites, each synthesis considered as a separate metabolite drain (objective function) in the model.

Given the absence of glycolytic regulation machinery in Trypanosomatids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, glycosomes supervise this utilization of glucose towards appropriate outputs by promoting redox coupling between upper and lower part of glycolysis via NAD, glycosomal trypanothione reductase and pentose phosphate shunt via NADP, and cytosolic glutamate dehydrogenase with proline biosynthesis again via NADP, in glucose sufficient conditions. This dictates the use of precise combinations of external metabolites and their directed catabolism towards various internal metabolites via the non-essential amino acid motif. The glycosome also restricts the exchange of ATP/ADP and NAD/NADH generated from glycosomal reactions into the cytoplasm, thus, creating a balance between them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This balance is maintained by upper and lower part of glycolysis, argininosuccinate synthetase, and nucleotide salvage pathways within the glycosome.

The presence of mitochondrion directs tyrosine and glucose into the non-essential amino acid motif to produce glutamate, glutamine, proline, aspartate and alanine.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Physiological coupling between metabolic reactions is robust against random reaction deletions</title><p id="Par16">The above results demonstrate that structural constraints within the metabolic network confine the parasite to utilize specific environmental metabolites and direct it towards synthesis of various biomass metabolites. To answer the question, why the network might have been organized in a specific way, the flux-coupled subnetwork (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, see Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> of Supplementary Information) derived from the whole genome-scale network was subjected to random perturbations while monitoring the re-organization of physiological flux coupling relationships within the network (see Methods). These flux relationships represent a complete set of coupled reactions within the <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolic network, with respect to all the exchanges considered in the network. It was observed that the median number of fully and directionally coupled pairs reduced with the increase in number of simultaneous deletions (see Methods, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4A and B</xref>, Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> of Supplementary Information) and it requires at least 5 simultaneous deletions to notice a significant variation in their numbers. This suggests that reaction stoichiometry and reversibility impose constraints on the <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolic network structure in such a way that only a few, specific reactions are tightly coupled to each other and rest of the reactions remain either isolated or coupled to fewer number of reactions. This lowers the chances of a coupled reaction set to be damaged by random errors. This is also supported by the fact that the flux-coupled graph generated from the unperturbed bipartite <italic>L. infantum</italic> iAS556 metabolic network contains few numbers of reactions [256] that have greater than average connectivity and a large number of reactions [693] with less than average connectivity (Average connectivity&#8201;=&#8201;14.67; Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Also, the median number of reactions represented within modules remains unchanged with the increase in number of simultaneous deletions suggesting that the modular nature of the network is insensitive to random deletions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4.C</xref>, Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> of Supplementary Information).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Network representation of the flux-coupled graph computed for the iAS556 metabolic network by flux coupling analysis.

</p><p id="Par17">We further wanted to investigate the biological significance of these specific couplings towards parasite metabolism and its effect on the biomass metabolites. To answer this, the fraction of biomass metabolites whose synthesis would be totally blocked after each sequential deletion, was calculated. The synthesis of a biomass metabolite was considered to be completely obstructed, if all the reactions forming that metabolite were deemed to be blocked after a sequential deletion (see Methods). The median percentage of metabolites expected to be blocked, also gradually increase with increasing number of reaction deletions; although only around 7% of biomass metabolites can be expected to be completely blocked after 20 sequential deletions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). Also, the chance of obtaining more than 2% of metabolites to get completely blocked is higher (distribution skewed towards higher fractions) only if greater than 10 reactions are inhibited simultaneously (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). This suggests that a large number of less flux-coupled reactions observed within the network provide robustness to biomass-metabolite formation. Further, it seems that biomass-metabolite reactions are physiologically coupled to less number of reactions (median&#8201;=&#8201;4) as compared to other non-terminal network reactions (median&#8201;=&#8201;6), which on the other hand, tend to be coupled to a large number of other network reactions; although the fraction of variation explained by the difference between the biomass-forming vs. non-terminal reaction flux couplings is sufficiently small (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, W&#8201;=&#8201;54107, Z&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;2.9627, r&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.09, <italic>P&#8201;=&#8201;</italic>0.003, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This probably suggests that biomass-forming reactions are not blocked any more than other non-terminal reactions and that any effect is due to a handful of biomass reactions which demonstrate a low flux-coupling, rather than being a general effect specific to all biomass reactions. Also, 37 of the 40 biomass metabolites are formed by more than one reaction groups (connected components) within the flux-coupled graph, probably for unhindered production of the important biomass metabolites.

Flux analysis of parasite metabolism established that the parasite possesses a unique network of metabolic reactions whose functioning can be explained with respect to the stoichiometric and reversibility constraints imposed by the underlying metabolic network structure alone; the network structure being largely governed by the species-specific occurrence of enzymes in multiple subcellular locations (Section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> of Supplementary Information). Comparison of predicted steady state reaction fluxes in <italic>L. infantum</italic> JPCM5 with<sup>13</sup>C isotope enrichment of metabolites in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> indicated that similar metabolic routes of glucose utilization are chosen within <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolism. Also, subtle differences in flux re-organization among the two species was observed, attributing to a probable indication of species-specific genes, multiple subcellular location of enzymes that provide new paths for flux redistribution, species-specific choice of external metabolites for satisfying metabolic demand and an increased drain of intermediate metabolites like non-essential amino acids, into the metabolic demand under a glucose-only situation. Thus, this result demonstrates the existence of a unique network structure within <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> JPCM5 metabolism. Also, the metabolic states within the promastigote and amastigote scenarios were predicted unde&#65279;r appropriate uptake constraints. Mainly, it was observed that fatty acids, amino sugars and mannose can compensate for reduced glucose uptake within the amastigote. Fatty acids produce intracellular glutamate, whereas amino sugars and mannose satisfies the production of intracellular aspartate and mannan, respectively.</p><p id="Par19">The organization of <italic>L. infantum</italic> metabolism, though simple, can be dynamic enough to re-route external metabolites towards synthesis of specific internal biomass metabolites. This dynamic nature is due to the non-essential amino acid motif-based reaction sets within the metabolic network that get coupled with respect to various combinations of environmental metabolites. The dynamic non-essential amino acid motif diverts specific input metabolites towards specific outputs and constrains the utilization of diverse resources simultaneously. This analysis also suggests that glucose and tyrosine alone cannot produce other biomass metabolites, and their role is to only supplement the quantities of output metabolites formed through non-essential amino acids, indicating a tight coupling between glucose, tyrosine and non-essential amino acids. This constrained distribution is largely influenced by the presence of subcellular compartments that restrict coupling of specific reactions to achieve redox or ATP balance. Glycosome restricts the transfer of ADP between the glycosomal reactions and the cytoplasmic reactions, thereby inducing a redox coupling between trypanothione reductase and pentose phosphate shunt, and upper and lower part of glycolysis in the promastigote. Similarly, due to reduced glucose uptake observed in the amastigote, NAD redox coupling between fatty acid <italic>&#946;</italic>-oxidation and lower part of glycolysis is established. The role of mitochondrion on the other hand, is to redirect C4 dicarboxylic acids produced from glycolysis and non-essential amino acid motif towards TCA cycle for formation of mitochondrial glutamate, which regenerates reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p id="Par20">The <italic>L. infantum</italic> flux-coupled network structure is highly modular and assortative, thereby remaining robust to a random node failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This also suggests that the modular nature of the network and presence of enzymes in dual/multiple subcellular locations are important characteristics of <italic>L. infantum</italic> network that provide adaptation to the changing environment. The network robustness ensures an unobstructed production of biomass metabolites. Furthermore, the benefit of the network structure being robust to random mutations is not only gained by biomass-forming reactions but also equally by all the other network reactions. Few biomass metabolites like ergosterol, heme A, isoleucine, leucine, valine, pantothenate, and zymosterol, are produced only from a set of specific enzymes, which form a highly connected, single connected component (central within the flux coupled subnetwork, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which might be useful as drug targets.
