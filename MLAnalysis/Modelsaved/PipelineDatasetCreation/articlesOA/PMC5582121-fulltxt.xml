In this paper, we focus on parameter randomness which, in the context of AP modelling, corresponds to the natural variability of the cardiomyocyte electrical properties such as its capacitance, ionic channel conductances and gate time constants. Owing to the large number of free parameters in AP models, these parameters are, in practice, unidentifiable [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, different combinations of these parameters can lead to the same AP. Therefore, we choose to restrict our analysis to ionic channel maximal current densities which, for convenience, are referred to as conductances in the following. Among these conductances, a subset is selected to account for the observed variability depending on the available dataset. AP measurements may result from heterogeneity within a population of cells (inter-subject variability) [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or from dynamic variations within a single cell (intra-subject variability) [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this paper, we propose a novel way to study the variability of parameters of AP model in both contexts. From a modelling point of view, it is convenient to ignore the variability of electrophysiology measurements (and therefore of the underlying parameters) since a set of fixed parameters is sought. However, investigating the variability of parameters of the AP model has several motivations. It can be used to predict the response of cardiomyocytes to certain drugs [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It can also provide insight into cell modifications at the origin of common heart diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF) [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or ventricular arrythmia [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>There are two main strategies to estimate the parameters' variability given a set of AP measurements. First, one could fit the AP model to each measurement individually and therefore obtain a set of parameters from which useful statistics may be computed. The problem of fitting an individual AP has been addressed many times using a large variety of methods [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSIF20170238C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the computational cost of such a strategy scales with the number of available experimental samples and may therefore be prohibitive. As a consequence, only a low number of cells can be analysed this way. The second strategy belongs to the so-called population of models approach. The experimental set is considered as a whole and the parameters statistics are estimated by solving a statistical inverse problem. Several techniques were developed to solve such problems [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and their application to electrophysiology has recently generated much interest [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSIF20170238C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present approach belongs to the second strategy. The AP model parameters are described as random variables associated with an unknown probability density function (PDF). The proposed method aims at estimating the parameters PDF, thus generalizing the commonly used mean &#177; standard deviation intervals. The PDF is sought so that it &#8216;explains&#8217; the observed variability featured by a given set of AP measurements. More precisely, the estimated PDF is the solution of a constrained optimization problem which is an adaptation of the maximum entropy principle [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The method, later referred to as observable moment matching (OMM), is detailed in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Contrary to other approaches such as Monte&#8211;Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or Approximate Bayesian computation [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the present method does not guarantee to converge to the true parameters distribution. Instead, it proposes a way to obtain an approximation of the underlying PDF at the fraction of the cost of other finer methods. In this paper, the OMM method is applied to the estimation of the PDF of key conductances from AP measurements. These measurements may be the AP time series (sometimes referred to as waveforms or traces) or be in the form of biomarkers, i.e. features extracted from the time series. Four different case studies are presented to illustrate the use of the OMM method in different scenarios. Test Cases 1 and 2 feature synthetic datasets with AP biomarkers and time series. Test Case 3 features an experimental dataset with intra-subject variability and Test Case 4 features an experimental dataset with inter-subject variability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Electrophysiology measurements</title><sec id="s2a1"><label>2.1.1.</label><title>Synthetic datasets</title><p>For validation purposes, the proposed method is first applied to synthetic measurements, i.e. APs generated by a computational model and corrupted by some noise to solve our statistical inverse problem.

Using different models serves two purposes. First, it illustrates the fact that the OMM method can successfully be applied to different scenarios. Different cardiac cellular models were used to illustrate that our methods are not model specific. Second, it is more natural to use models that were designed from experimental set-ups that are close to those of the available datasets. In Test Cases 2 and 4, the human atrial model by Courtemanche <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] was used. It is one of the first human heart cell models. Mostly based on the Luo &amp; Rudy [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] membrane currents formulations, it was developed using experimental recordings from human atrial cells. In Test Case 1 (respectively, 3), the canine ventricular model by Decker <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (respectively, Davies <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) was used. Both models are improvements of the Hund &amp; Rudy model [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with updated current formulations to fit canine epicardium (for the Decker model) and mid-myocardial (for the Davies model) cells. All three models belong to the so-called second generation [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for they provide detailed descriptions of the main ionic channels, pumps and exchangers as well as the internal calcium dynamics. For the sake of convenience, these models will be referred to by their first author's name. We will focus on the PDF estimation of six key conductances corresponding to the following currents: the fast sodium current <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>, the inward rectifier potassium current <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, the transient outward potassium current <italic>I</italic><sub>to</sub> (<italic>I</italic><sub>to1</sub> in the canine models), the rapid (respectively, slow) delayed rectifier potassium current <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> (respectively, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) and the L-type calcium current <italic>I</italic><sub>CaL</sub>. For the sake of clarity, <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>K1</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>CaL</sub> will refer to a multiplicative coefficient for the corresponding values found in the literature. For instance, <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> = 1 means that <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> is set to the same value as that of the original paper. When necessary, a table will summarize the conductances that have been modified from their reference values.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><label>2.2.2.</label><title>Numerical methods</title><p>The previously mentioned models consist of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose formulae are detailed, e.g. on the CellML project website [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Courtemanche and Davies models were implemented in an in-house C++ code and the simulation outputs were compared with those of the Matlab implementations found on the CellML website. The time integration of the ODEs is carried out using the CVODE library [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which implements the Backward Differentiation Formulae. This state-of-the-art time integrator is well suited to stiff problems as those encountered in electrophysiology. It is adaptive, in time step and order, which can significantly save computational time. For all the test cases, the absolute and relative tolerances of the CVODE solver were set to 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>. For the Decker model, the time integration was carried out using variable but non-adaptive time steps. The stimulation protocol consists in stimulating at a frequency of 1 Hz (or 2 Hz for Test Case 2) over a few cycles so that the recorded AP lies in a permanent regime. In practice, the number of these transition cycles was set to 5 (10 for APs stimulated at 2 Hz) and the relative difference norm between two consecutives AP is less than 0.1%. Unless stated otherwise, the stimulation duration is set to 2 ms and its amplitude to 20 &#956;A.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><label>2.2.3.</label><title>Action potential time series</title><p>In Test Case 1, the AP time series are used as the observable. This means that the inverse procedure possibly uses the AP value at every available time step. This has not only the advantage of capturing all of the available information but also the disadvantage of increasing the computational cost of the inverse procedure because the number of time steps may be large. To tackle this issue, a time-step selection algorithm was developed and is described in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It uses the pre-computed simulation database to approximate the sensitivities with respect to each parameter and for each time step. Using these sensitivities, the time steps are clustered using an agglomerative clustering algorithm and a representative is chosen for each cluster. Only the representatives are retained for the inverse procedure. In practice their number is much lower than the total number of time steps, thus alleviating the computational cost of the inverse procedure. Indeed, as described in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the OMM procedure cost is dominated by the inversion of a dense matrix of size (<italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> &#215; <italic>N</italic><sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, reducing the number of time steps is motivated by numerical considerations because the conditionning of this matrix deteriorates as the number of time steps increases. This time-step selection comes at no cost because it uses the already computed simulation database.</p><p>As the ODEs are solved using an adaptive time-stepping, each AP simulation is discretized on a different time grid and later interpolated on a common grid. This interpolation procedure introduces a numerical error which may be considered as a numerical noise, alongside the noise in the measurements (whether synthetic or experimental).</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><label>2.2.4.</label><title>Action potential biomarkers</title><p>In Test Cases 2, 3 and 4, the inverse procedure is applied to so-called biomarkers, which are quantities computed from the AP time series. They describe the main features of the AP such as its shape or its duration. We will focus on the following biomarkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20170238F1">figure 1</xref>): the AP duration APD90 (respectively, APD50, APD30 etc.) at 90% repolarization (respectively 50%, 30% etc.), the resting membrane potential (RMP), the maximum upstroke velocity d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, the AP value at 20% repolarization V20 (which roughly corresponds to the AP plateau value), the AP value 30 ms after depolarization <italic>V</italic><sub>notch</sub> and the area under the curve (AUC), i.e. the AP time integral over one cycle.
<fig id="RSIF20170238F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Biomarkers computed from an AP. (Online version in colour.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rsif20170238-g1"/></fig></p><p>Even though these quantities seem to capture well the main features of a given AP, they generally do not convey enough information about the underlying parameters for the inverse procedure. Therefore, the pairwise products (APD90 &#215; APD50, APD90 &#215; APD20 and so on) of the above biomarkers are added to the constraints of moments. Note that the AP triangulation is a commonly used biomarker and may be interpreted as the pairwise product between APD90 and 1/APD30. For the synthetic measurements, the noise is added to the AP time series before computing the biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><label>2.2.5.</label><title>Parameter calibration</title><p>We restrain our parameter estimation study to three to six conductances. This assumption is critical and is discussed in the Discussion section. This means that the parameters of interest are allowed to vary, while all the other parameters of the model remain fixed. While it seems reasonable to choose the values found in the literature for these parameters, it often proves to be a bad choice when dealing with real data. Therefore, one needs to calibrate these parameters before performing the inverse procedure using the most representative experimental sample of the available data set. In Test Case 3, the most representative sample is the one whose biomarkers are the closest to the median values (there is one representative for each group). In Test Case 4, the most representative sample is the AP whose APD90 is the closest to the median value. Once these representative samples are identified, a parameter calibration procedure is performed for all ionic conductances. Electronic supplementary material, table S9, shows the values obtained from the literature for these parameters as well as their estimated counterparts for both Courtemanche and Davies models. The table also shows concentrations of some external ion. These were directly set using the bath descriptions available in the publications associated with the experimental datasets. The parameter calibration is actually a constrained minimization problem where the cost function <italic>J</italic> to be minimized reads<disp-formula id="RSIF20170238M2x2"><label>2.2</label><graphic xlink:href="rsif20170238-e2.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where <italic>y</italic> is the experimental quantity of interest, <italic>u</italic> the corresponding simulation output and <italic>N</italic><sub>t</sub> the number of values to be fitted (number of biomarkers or number of time steps depending on the test case). The second part of the cost function is a regularization term, where <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> is the number of conductances to fit, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> the estimated value of the <italic>j</italic>th conductance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="rsif20170238-i1.jpg"/></inline-formula> its nominal value and <italic>K</italic> is a user-defined regularization parameter. This term ensures that the conductances remain within a reasonable range around the nominal values. In practice, this parameter is chosen to be small compared to the first term in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSIF20170238M2x2">2.2</xref>) so that the conductances are weakly constrained around relevant values without too much impact on the fitting quality. When possible, this parameter <italic>K</italic> may even be set to zero. In the electronic supplementary material, figure S1, a brief study of the effect of <italic>K</italic> is performed. The models considered in this work are not well suited to classical gradient optimization techniques, as they consist of many and strongly nonlinear ODEs, making the gradient computations challenging and the cost function highly irregular. For the sake of simplicity, we, therefore, used gradient-free optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We chose the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) evolutionary algorithm [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], for it is currently one of the most performant genetic algorithms and was used successfully in a variety of applications. Furthermore, a Python (as well as other languages) implementation of the CMA-ES algorithm is available online<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="EN0003">3</xref></sup> and behaves like a black-box optimization tool. The CMA-ES algorithm was recently used in a similar context in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where conductances of several models (including the Davies model) were estimated from both synthetic and experimental measurements. Note that values of all parameters are not allowed to take negative values, but they are not limited by any upper bound. An exception is made for the fast sodium conductance <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> (which is limited to five times its nominal value) for numerical reasons. Indeed, a high value of <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> may lead to a failure of the time integration around the upstroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3.</label><title>Observable moment matching method</title><p>We now give an overview of the OMM method.

The parameter space is discretized using the Sobol sequence [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This sampling method is well suited to the present framework: it uniformly spans the parameter space in a low-discrepancy manner while featuring a simple Monte&#8211;Carlo quadrature rule; it requires little knowledge of the true parameters distribution; furthermore, as the latin hypercube method used in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it only requires a lower and upper bound for each parameter and the total number of samples. Points in the discretized space will be called collocation points and the total number of these points will be denoted by <italic>N</italic><sub>c</sub>. The discretization of the parameter space is, therefore, given by the set {<bold><italic>&#952;</italic></bold><sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, <bold><italic>&#952;</italic></bold><sub><italic>N</italic><sub>c</sub></sub>}. For each collocation point, one AP is simulated using the numerical protocol described above and stored.

The goal of the OMM method is to find the PDF <italic>&#961;</italic> such that the moments, up to a certain order <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub>, of the simulations and of the experiments match at every point <italic>t</italic>. This moment-matching condition will later be referred to as the moment-matching constraints. As explained above, in the case where many observable quantities are available, a procedure has been set up to select a subset for which the moment-matching constraints hold. In general, however, the stated moment problem is under-determined, meaning there exists an infinity of different <italic>&#961;</italic> that satisfies the moment constraints. We propose to regularize the problem using the maximum entropy principle where the entropy of a given PDF <italic>&#961;</italic> is given by<disp-formula id="RSIF20170238UM3"><graphic xlink:href="rsif20170238-e5.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>This type of regularization roots in information theory [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it is considered the most natural choice when limited information about a PDF is available. It is also well suited to our optimization problem for practical mathematical reasons. In Section 2.4.2. of [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we propose an analysis of the error on the PDF estimation made by adopting the maximum entropy regularization. In Prop. 1. of the same paper, it is shown that under certain conditions on the regularity of the observable and identifiability of the parameters, the error on the PDF is bounded. The conditions on the regularity of the observable may not be easy to check formally because of the nonlinearities of the state equations. Nevertheless, for the practical problems considered in this work, they do not seem critical. The condition on the identifiability may also be difficult to assess in general. In our algorithm, the identifiability issues are circumvented by regularizing the Hessian in the optimization problem and by selecting the points in which the moments are matched (see Discussion section). Finally, the estimated PDF is the solution of the following constrained optimization problem:<disp-formula id="RSIF20170238M2x3"><label>2.3</label><graphic xlink:href="rsif20170238-e6.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>The optimization problem is recast using Lagrange multipliers for the constraints and the corresponding Euler&#8211;Lagrange multipliers are solved using a quasi-Newton method.

On the contrary, the proposed approach performs the PDF estimation by taking into account only the statistical moments of the set of measurements. Its main advantage is that it does not scale with the number of measurements samples.

Second, there is a significant increase in <italic>g</italic><sub>K1</sub> and a significant decrease in <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>CaL</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>Kur</sub> from the SR to the AF group. These modifications are commonly considered as a good AF remodelling strategy [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSIF20170238C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For each set of estimated conductances, an AP is simulated using the Courtemanche model. One obtains a typical or most representative AP for each group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20170238F7">Figure 7</xref> shows such APs along with the AP obtained with the reference parameters found in the literature. The AF AP features a shorter APD and a more triangular shape than the SR one, which is typical of AF [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This figure also highlights the fact that choosing the literature values as baseline may not be a good choice for the SR group, and to a greater extent for the AF group. In the same figure is added an AP that was obtained by applying the suggested AF remodelling found in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to the SR model (65% decrease of <italic>g</italic><sub>CaL</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub>, 49% decrease of <italic>g</italic><sub>Kur</sub> and 110% increase of <italic>g</italic><sub>K1</sub>). Both AF APs are very different and this suggests that AF remodelling should be designed specifically for a given experimental set.

The results of the inverse procedure are presented in electronic supplementary material, table S10 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20170238F7">figure 7</xref>. As no exact solution is known, one may only qualitatively interpret the result. While <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> follows a common distribution in both groups, the other three conductances show striking differences. One way to validate the results is to compare the estimated PDF of the obervable quantities (the four biomarkers of interest) with the experimental one. By construction, they must have the same mean and standard deviation because two moments are matched for each biomarkers. However, this does not guarantee that the distributions are identical because an infinite number of distributions satisfy the moment constraints.

The distributions are very similar for each biomarkers which suggests that chossing <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> = 2 is sufficient in this particular case. Note also that, even though the distributions of biomarkers are close to Gaussian ones, this is definitely not true for the distributions of conductances.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have presented the OMM method which serves the general purpose of estimating the PDF of uncertain model parameters from a set of measurements. It has been applied to electrophysiology measurements and illustrated with four different test cases.</p><p>Test Cases 1 and 2 illustrate the proposed method with synthetic datasets, which has two advantages. First, one may try configurations of a large variety of parameters which may be difficult or impossible to obtain in experimental conditions. Second, knowing the true distributions of the parameters allows for a thorough evaluation of the estimated parameters PDF. In Test Case 1, the proposed method is applied to synthetic measurements generated from the Decker canine model. The OMM method was applied to estimate the PDF of six uncertain conductances. It showed that the OMM method is able to simultaneously estimate the PDF of several conductances.</p><p>The authors stress that the proposed method provides an estimation that is an approximation of the real underlying PDF of the parameters. This approximation is less precise than what would be achievable with finer methods such as Bayesian inference but has the advantage of being computationally less demanding in general. In [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the authors suggest that the present approach could serve as a prior generator for Bayesian inference.</p><p>The quality of the estimation obtained depends on the identifiability of the parameters given the available data. However, if a parameter is poorly identifiable (which is the case of <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> in this particular scenario) or even unidentifiable, the method does not fail owing to the approximation of the Hessian associated with the problem in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RSIF20170238M2x3">2.3</xref>) and the regularization induced by the choice of a subset of time steps where the moments are matched. In that case, such a parameter is characterized by a flat estimated distribution. In the context of experimental data, a strategy may be set up to assess which parameters of the model are actually identifiable, prior to applying the inverse procedure. Such strategies exist (see e.g. [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) but were not investigated in the present work. Nevertheless, when faced with an estimated flat distribution for one parameter, it is possible to perform the following numerical experiment to assess whether this parameter is unidentifiable or its PDF is, in fact, uniform. Small perturbations (that conserve the norm and positivity of the PDF) may be added to the estimated PDF along the direction of the seemingly unidentifiable parameter. If the moment constraints are still verified, then it probably means that the parameter is, in fact, unidentifiable. To improve the estimation of the hidden <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> parameter, an artifical drug block remodelling was applied to the Decker model. This drug was designed to block the currents that were responsible for the unidentifiability of <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub>. This remodelling consisted, in practice, in reducing the values of corresponding parameters to 10% of their nominal values. This strategy proved to significantly improve the estimation of <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> and showed that the OMM has potential applications in two contexts. First, it may be used to infer the effect (or toxicity) of a drug using actual experimental data. Second, it may help gain insight into experimental protocols that can be set up to estimate quantities that are otherwise hidden. These findings must however be mitigated by the fact that, in real cells, it is improbable that a given drug only affects a set of targeted ionic currents. It most probably affects the whole cell kinetics and dynamics, including quantities that were supposed to remain unchanged in our artificial scenario. It is also important to note that some stimulation protocols or drug block experiments are not easily achievable in real experiments. In most cases, especially when using human tissue, it is simply not possible to conduct additional experiments, because the tissue is critical to answer more novel research questions. It is an important practicality that makes recordings using animals different from those possible using human tissue. Nevertheless, it may prove useful to inform novel experiments that can be conducted to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of profiles of conductances based on successful numerical scenarios.</p><p>The OMM method is related to the populations of models (POM) approach but differs from it in certain aspects. Whereas the focus of our method is to approximate parameters distributions, POM studies intend to investigate the implications of potential parameters ranges. It would indeed not be possible to confidently estimate conductances from ranges of AP biomarkers and additional constrains would be required, as shown in our study. Other studies such as [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and those reviewed by Muszkiewicz <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] have triggered important discussions and increased interest in an important area of research that requires diversity of techniques and approaches, as shown here. In this context, our study suggests a new method for PDF estimation that may indeed be very useful for new applications.</p><p>In Test Case 2, the OMM method is applied to synthetic measurements generated from the Courtemanche human atrial model. The distribution of six conductances were estimated from AP biomarkers obtained in control conditions. Interestingly, the variability observed in the biomarkers set is less informative than that of the AP traces themselves. This is highlighted by the fact that distributions of two conductances are poorly estimated compared to the first test case. Indeed, the biomarkers are features computed from the AP traces themselves and are therefore doomed to carry as much or less information about the underlying parameters. However, studying biomarkers instead of AP traces is justified by the fact that, in practice, certain experimental sets contain only biomarker values. To tackle this, a strategy was set up to extract more information from the AP biomarkers. This was done by changing the stimulation frequency which unveiled new dynamics and therefore new information about the parameters. Interestingly, such a strategy may easily be transposed to an actual experimental protocol. It is, in fact, commonly practised in cardiomyocyte experimental studies [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Combining the data obtained using two different frequencies improved the estimation of <italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>CaL</sub>. <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> was, however, still poorly estimated, mainly because its effect is very similar to that of <italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub>, with a lower amplitude. The investigation of richer stimulation protocols, such as in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], in order to improve the estimation of poorly identifiable parameters could be the focus of future investigations. It is, in certain cases, possible to successfully estimate <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> by conducting an adequate numerical experiment. In [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] for instance, the authors use the combined recordings of an AP in normal conditions and with <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub> set to zero.</p><p>In Test Case 3, the OMM method is applied to a set of experimental canine APs recorded from a single canine ventricular cardiomyocyte. This experimental set is an illustration of beat-to-beat variability which is mostly characterized by variations of the APD. It is, therefore, natural to make the hypothesis that these variations are in fact due to fluctuations in the magnitudes of delayed-rectifier potassium currents (<italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) which are the most responsible for APD variations. The APs also exhibit variations around the notch region which motivated the addition of <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub> as the third uncertain parameter. These conductances are known to be the ones that contribute most to beat-to-beat variability [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. All the other parameters were set to a fixed value using a calibration procedure. Many values of conductances deviate a lot from their reference values which suggests that this step is necessary prior to any variability study. The estimated PDF shows that the large variability observed in the APD is in fact caused by small variations of the underlying parameters. These findings were confirmed by carrying out two other independent parameter estimations which yielded similar distributions for the conductances of interest. For <italic>g</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, the distribution differs when all the conductances are allowed to vary. This may be explained by the fact that this parameter is less identifiable compared to <italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub>, so that its effect may be compensated or may interfere with other conductances. Some limitations pertaining to the experimental set must be considered. Indeed, the isolation of cardiomyocytes is known to affect the membrane ionic channels [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and therefore the distributions obtained for the conductances of interest may not reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> ones. Furthermore, the experimental traces considered are just a snapshot of the cell at a certain state. Therefore, extrinsic factors operating at a long time scale and contributing to variations of the AP features are neglected. For instance, monitoring the APD over the full experimental set reveals that there are long time scale increasing and decreasing trends in the APD (see the electronic supplementary materials in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p>In Test Case 4, the OMM method is applied to an experimental set containg AP biomarkers obtained from two different populations: SR and AF. To each group is associated a most representative individual whose values of biomarkers are the closest to the median ones of its group. The calibration step is very informative as it allows for a first comparison between the two groups, or more precisely between the two representatives of each group. The calibration leads to high differences for <italic>g</italic><sub>K1</sub> (+220%), <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub> (&#8722;100%), <italic>g</italic><sub>CaL</sub> (&#8722;63%) and <italic>g</italic><sub>Kur</sub> (&#8722;60%) which are qualitatively similar to those reported in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These differences between the two groups are also in agreement with the AF remodelling mechanisms documented in [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSIF20170238C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="RSIF20170238C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The role of <italic>I</italic><sub>Kur</sub> seems to be prominent in the onset of AF [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] along with perturbations of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which is coupled to the L-type calcium current <italic>I</italic><sub>CaL</sub>. Beyond these inter-group variations captured in the calibration step, the inter-group variability is revealed by the study of the estimated PDFs. The results highlight the distribution differences of <italic>g</italic><sub>to</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>Kr</sub> between the two groups. In the SR group, these two conductances feature a normal-like distribution that does not deviate much from the mean value, whereas in the AF group those distributions are skewed and much more spread. The distribution of <italic>g</italic><sub>Na</sub> is similar between the two groups, which suggests that it does not play an important role in the AF mechanisms. <italic>g</italic><sub>K1</sub> also features a much higher mean value and higher variance in the AF group. A posteriori distributions of the biomarkers of interest may be computed from the estimated PDF. When compared with the actual distributions (approximated by histograms of the experimental biomarkers), it shows that the OMM method succeeded in matching the variability in the measurements. In the future, studying other biomarkers or other types of measurements may lead to a better understanding of the AF mechanisms and of the sources of variability within each group.</p><p>We now discuss limitations concerning inverse problems in electrophysiology in general and the OMM method in particular. Akin to many inverse problem studies in electrophysiology, we make the assumption that all variability observed in the experimental dataset can be explained by the variation of only a few conductances. Not only are there a large number of different conductances but there are also other parameters such as the parameters governing the dynamics of the channel gates. However, such a simplification is supported by two main considerations. First, the proposed approach is limited by its computational cost. Considering a large number of free parameters means that more samples are required to span the high-dimensional parameter space, which may be intractable in practice. Second, the information available in the AP traces is not enough to constrain all the model parameters. Adding other sources of information such as intracellular calcium concentrations revealed by fluorescence [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] or cell impedence [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] may allow the estimation of more than six parameters. Considering that, choosing the right set of varying conductances is still paramount.</p><p>The rationale for choosing the six conductances investigated in this work was based on their known importance in determining the cardiac AP, and key properties including upstroke velocity, plateau duration, resting potential and AP duration. Among them, we included gKs knowing that due to the redundancy of currents during repolarization it would be expected to be poorly identifiable. Our method can, however, be extended to include variability in additional parameters if needed.</p><p>Another limitation comes from the experimental sets themselves. Cells coming from different regions of the heart exhibit different variability patterns in their APs. In the context of assessing the effect of a drug or investigating the causes of a heart disease, this approach should be repeated with a wider variety of cell locations. Furthermore, the electrical behaviour of an isolated cell differs from one that is embedded in a tissue. Therefore, using measurements at the tissue scale [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (for example using MEA measurements [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) may yield results that are closer to the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p><p>Another point to be discussed is the use of biomarkers versus time traces. This is often imposed by the type of experimental data available. Ranges of biomarkers using standard protocols are easily accessed by experimentalists, and raw AP data are not always available. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the use of both biomarker ranges and AP traces. The set of available biomarkers is often dictated by experimental constraints. It is, however, possible, when there are many available biomarkers, to conduct a preliminary study to determine which biomarkers should be taken into account in order to recover certain parameters of interest. Such a study would consist in applying the proposed method several times with different underlying variations of parameters. Then, for a given set of experimental constraints, it would be possible to assess whether the proposed method would be able to recover the underlying distributions of parameters. Finally, the choice of numerical settings pertaining to the OMM method is discussed. The OMM method relies on the matching of the statistical moments of some observable quantities. The number of moments <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> to be matched is therefore important. In most applications, choosing <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> = 2 or 3 is sufficient to capture the distribution of parameters. A common heuristics is to increase <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> until no siginificant change in the estimated PDF is observed. Note that using high <italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> often leads to numerical instability, all the more so if the noise level in the measurements is high.</p><p>In summary, we have presented a new method for estimating the PDF of parameters of AP models from various sets of AP measurements. The AP measurements may come in the form of waveforms (time series) or biomarkers. The method has been illustrated with both synthetic and experimental sets which exhibit both inter-subject and intra-subject variability. The approach we describe has potentially important implications in drug safety pharmacology and more generally in the understanding of variability in ionic properties of cardiomyocytes. It intends to be in line with recent works, suggesting that computational models are a powerful tool to evaluate drug toxicity [<xref rid="RSIF20170238C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. More generally, the proposed approach may be a new way to investigate the sources of variability observed in electrophysiology that are experimentally difficult to assess.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsif20170238supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e2012" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Endnotes</title><fn id="EN0001"><label>1</label><p>Data are available here <uri xlink:href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0002"><label>2</label><p>Data are available here <uri xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105897">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105897</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0003"><label>3</label><p><uri xlink:href="https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html#python">https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html#python</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0004"><label>4</label><p><uri xlink:href="https://github.com/eltix/omm_jrsi">https://github.com/eltix/omm_jrsi</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0005"><label>5</label><p><uri xlink:href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0006"><label>6</label><p><uri xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105897">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105897</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="EN0007"><label>7</label><p><uri xlink:href="https://github.com/eltix/omm_jrsi">https://github.com/eltix/omm_jrsi</uri>.</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="s5"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>An online repository in open access<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="EN0007">7</xref></sup> has been created to make available data and codes used in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author's contributions</title><p>All authors equally contributed to this work.</p></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>We declare we have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Funding</title><p>B.R. is funded by a Welcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science (100246/Z/ 12/Z), the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence in Oxford (RE/13/1/30181), an NC3R Infrastructure for Impact award (NC/P001076/1), an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Award (EP/K503769/1), the ComBioMed project funded by the European Commission (grant agreement no. 675451).
