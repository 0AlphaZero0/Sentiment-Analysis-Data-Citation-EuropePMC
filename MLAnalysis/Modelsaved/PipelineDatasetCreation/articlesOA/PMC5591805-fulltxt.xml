Injectable formulations of CdA have been approved in many countries for the treatment of hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was hypothesized that CdA may have beneficial effects in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) due to its selective lymphocyte-reducing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This led to the development of an oral formulation of CdA, cladribine tablets, for investigation in relapsing&#8211;remitting MS. Cladribine tablets demonstrated significant efficacy compared with placebo on clinical and neuroimaging measures in the large, phase III, 96-week CLARITY (CLAdRIbine Tablets Treating MS OrallY) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The development program for cladribine tablets, as well as long-term follow-up of patients exposed to cladribine tablets, is ongoing.</p><p id="Par8">The population pharmacokinetics (PK) of CdA have been previously studied in patients with malignancies after administration of parenteral, intravenous and oral solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We studied the population PK in patients with MS because physiological differences related to disease pathology in patients with malignancies and those with MS could lead to different kinetic and metabolic behavior for CdA. In addition, the dosing level and schedule and drug formulation that were proposed for use in MS are different from those routinely used in the oncology setting. Data from the main metabolite of CdA, 2-chloroadenine (CAde), were also available for this analysis; it has been documented that metabolite data can provide additional information about the kinetics of the parent drug itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The overall objective of our analysis was to assess the population PK of CdA and its main metabolite, CAde, after oral tablet administration in patients with relapsing&#8211;remitting MS. The specific aims of the analysis included quantifying different routes of CdA elimination (renal and non-renal); assessing the effect of food on CdA absorption and bioavailability; and assessing potential drug&#8211;drug interactions of CdA with interferon (IFN)&#160;&#946;-1a.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical Trials</title><p id="Par10">This population PK analysis evaluated data obtained from four clinical studies of CdA (studies 25803, 26127, 26486 and 25643 [CLARITY; trial registration number: NCT00213135]).</p><p id="Par11">Study 25803 was a phase I, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study investigating the PK of CdA and its metabolites following the administration of a single oral tablet and a single intravenous dose in patients with MS.

Patients received CdA 3&#160;mg intravenously as a single 1-h infusion or as a single 10&#160;mg tablet, with a minimum 10-day washout between each treatment.

Model selection was based on the comparison of full versus reduced models using the log-likelihood criterion (the difference in the minimum OFV between hierarchical models was assumed to be Chi-square distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between models), goodness-of-fit plots (e.g. relevant residuals against time randomly distributed around zero), and scientific plausibility of the model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Model Evaluation</title><p id="Par28">To evaluate whether the estimated fixed- and random-effect parameters adequately describe data, 1000 Monte Carlo simulation replicates of the original dataset were generated using each of the five key population PK models (Model I through Model V).

<italic>Model I</italic> A three-compartment model best described the PK of CdA after intravenous administration, and a one-compartment model best described the PK of the main CdA metabolite, CAde. Available urine data enabled estimation of renal clearance (CL<sub>R</sub>) for both CdA and CAde. For CdA, CL<sub>R</sub> was implemented as a linear function of CL<sub>CR</sub>, while renal elimination of the metabolite was best described with a saturable model. Separate non-CL<sub>R</sub> (CL<sub>NR</sub>) and CL<sub>R</sub> for both the parent drug and metabolite could be estimated. The fraction of metabolized drug could be assessed as CL<sub>NR</sub>/total clearance&#160;=&#160;0.536. Renal elimination of CdA accounted for approximately 50% of total elimination, while renal elimination of the metabolite was minor. Metabolite profiles were well described, as indicated by the low residual variability (13.4%), even though no separate interindividual variability was estimated in the metabolite disposition parameters.</p><p id="Par32">
<italic>Model II</italic> A first-order absorption model was sufficient to describe the absorption of CdA in the fasted state. The introduction of absorption delay models, such as a lag-time model and a transit-compartment model, offered some improvement in the fit. However, the observed delay could be assigned to only a few individuals and therefore it was not kept in the model. Bioavailability was estimated to be 45.5%.</p><p id="Par33">
<italic>Model III</italic> Inclusion of the data from the fed state, with the aim of assessing the effect of food on absorption parameters, required elaboration of the absorption model to describe the effect of food on the absorption delay. The transit-compartment model best described the absorption delay in the data from the fed state. This model offered an improvement compared with first-order absorption with a lag time. Mean transit time was estimated to be 1.04&#160;h, and the number of transit compartments was estimated to be 2.44. Bioavailability decreased with food by approximately 14%.</p><p id="Par34">
<italic>Model IV</italic> Data from the multiple-dosing schedule (study 26486) did not contain information on food state and therefore absorption parameters were modeled separately. A potential effect of IFN&#946;-1a coadministration on CdA bioavailability and CL<sub>NR</sub> was tested. The bioavailability of CdA in study 26486 was generally lower compared with other studies; however, no significant differences in bioavailability were found between CdA administered alone and CdA administered with IFN&#946;-1a. IFN&#946;-1a coadministration led to an increase in CL<sub>NR</sub> of CdA of approximately 22%, which was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) and associated with a slight improvement in predictive checks.</p><p id="Par35">
<italic>Model V</italic> The addition of phase III data only required the addition of a lag time, which improved the fit during the absorption phase. Overall, with the addition of phase III data, parameters changed very little compared with the parameters from the final phase I model. Due to sparse sampling at late time points, the phase III data were lacking information relating to CL<sub>R</sub>; however, due to the presence of metabolite data, they supported good estimation of CL<sub>NR</sub> and bioavailability. Good correspondence between phases I and III was observed for almost all parameters, although some changes in the rate of absorption were observed.

The final population PK model provided a good description of the PK data of CdA in patients with MS. Goodness-of-fit criteria revealed that the final model was consistent with the observed data and no systematic bias remained. The model evaluation results provided evidence that both the fixed and random effect components of the final model were reflective of the observed data.</p><p id="Par40">The PK data were described reasonably well using a three-compartment PK model, which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Availability of the urine data enabled separation of the CL<sub>R</sub> and CL<sub>NR</sub>, and the typical population parameter estimates from the final model for these two elimination routes were CL<sub>R</sub>&#160;=&#160;22.2&#160;L/h and CL<sub>NR</sub>&#160;=&#160;23.4&#160;L/h, indicating that both elimination pathways are equally represented. The previous population PK analysis of CdA reported a value for total clearance of 39.3&#160;L/h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, that analysis was carried out in terminally ill cancer patients, who are likely to have decreased function of vital organs and therefore lower clearance values. Once the differences in the mean CL<sub>CR</sub> between two populations are taken into account (4.86&#160;L/h in oncology patients compared with 6.31&#160;L/h in the MS population), the estimates of clearance become comparable (39.3 vs. 40.5&#160;L/h). Moreover, the previous analysis was a retrospective analysis where the data were collected over long time periods and using different bioanalytical methods, which may not provide fully comparable results. CL<sub>R</sub> appeared to be higher than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that other mechanisms, such as active secretion, are involved in CdA renal elimination, which is also consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Bioavailability of CdA after oral administration was 45.6%, which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Coadministration of CdA with food appeared to decrease bioavailability to 40.5%, which is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact. In addition, food also appeared to delay absorption.</p><p id="Par42">Coadministration of CdA with IFN&#946;-1a appeared to have an effect on CdA clearance, which increased CL<sub>NR</sub> by 21%, resulting in an increase of total clearance by approximately 11.1%. However, although the modeling pointed to this effect on CL<sub>NR</sub>, it could also have been modeled on its bioavailability. Given the data available, it was not really possible to discriminate between the two. Furthermore, the observed effect could also be due to a period effect or interoccasion variability; however, these effects were confounded (owing to the study design) and further elaboration could not be supported with the available data. PK profiles of patients receiving CdA alone or coadministered with pantoprazole were also evaluated and no clinically relevant drug&#8211;drug interaction was found.</p><p id="Par43">Covariates included in the model were fasted/fed state on absorption parameters, IFN&#946;-1a effect on CL<sub>NR</sub>, and CL<sub>CR</sub> on CL<sub>R</sub> of CdA. Sex, age and body weight have also been investigated and were not associated with the PK of CdA (except for their impact on renal function mediated though CL<sub>CR</sub>). A graphical investigation of individual predicted CL<sub>NR</sub> against AST, ALT and bilirubin did not show any association between liver function markers and CL<sub>NR</sub>, and the previous population analysis of CdA in cancer patients also revealed no significant covariate effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The PK of the main CdA metabolite, CAde, were well described by a one-compartment model. Apparent CL<sub>NR</sub> and volume of distribution for CAde were found to be 653&#160;L/h and 365&#160;L, respectively. The availability of urine data for CAde enabled separation of the renal and non-renal elimination pathways for CAde. Renal elimination appeared to be saturable and to represent a minor elimination pathway. The visual predictive check of Model II indicated a possible second compartment for CAde; however, this further extension of the metabolite model was not supported by the limited data. Furthermore, the indication of a second compartment could be spurious, driven by sporadic visible observations above the quantification limit (most of the metabolite observations were below the LLOQ at these late time points).</p><p id="Par45">The estimated variability in most CdA PK parameters was modest. Moreover, the rather low variability in bioavailability demonstrated the consistent performance of the tablet formulation with regard to drug release and dissolution. Residual variability of urinary data was rather high (close to 90%). Urinary data are often more erratic than plasma, and, in these profiles, some inconsistent patterns were observed, which may have made it difficult to separate the variability sources. The estimated variability in CL<sub>R</sub> is low, and, in the final model, almost all variability in the urinary output is attributed to residual error.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par46">The PK of CdA and its main metabolite, CAde, in patients with MS were described after both intravenous and oral administration of CdA, with estimation of CL<sub>R</sub> and CL<sub>NR</sub> for both compounds. Food appeared to delay CdA absorption and to slightly decrease the extent of absorption. Coadministration of IFN&#946;-1a slightly increased the CL<sub>NR</sub> of CdA, without a significant impact on CdA exposure, owing to the evenly split clearance between non-renal and renal components. The proposed model explained the PK of CdA in great detail thanks to the informative design of several clinical studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
