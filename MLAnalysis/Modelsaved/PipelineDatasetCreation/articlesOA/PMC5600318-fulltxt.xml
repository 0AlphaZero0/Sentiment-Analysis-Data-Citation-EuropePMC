Extensive or ineffective use of antibiotics and antimicrobials in both the medical and food industry has led to increases in antibiotic resistance <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In nature, microorganisms do not always live in their planktonic forms, rather, they are found in dynamic complex structures called biofilms <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The adaptability of pathogenic bacterial biofilms to different physiological conditions and treatments enables them to emerge as resistant strains <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, there is a need to develop new antimicrobial agents and antibiotics that could effectively destroy pathogenic biofilms. Bioactive antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a new class of bio-pharmaceuticals released from proteins that exhibit unique antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antihypertensive properties <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These are specific protein fragments encrypted in the amino acid sequences, which have a positive impact on health and bodily functions <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. By binding to specific receptors on target cells, they can regulate functional properties. For example, <italic>lactoferricin</italic> possesses antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-regulatory properties, while <italic>caseniate</italic> possesses antioxidant, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial properties <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. AMPs have some common features, including short chain sequences (generally 12&#8211;50 amino acid sequences), strong cationic characters (net charge ranging from +2 to +9), heat stability, and amphipathic natures, while they can be derived from plants, animals, insects, and engineered microorganisms, or could be synthesized <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although peptides are diverse in the amino acid sequences that make up their structure, they can be classified into four main categories: (a) &#945;-helices, (b) &#946;-sheets, (c) extended helices, and (d) loop-forming structures <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Currently, numerous efforts are focussed towards understanding the antimicrobial efficacy and mode of action of AMPs on bacterial cells.</p><p>AMPs interact with bacterial cell membranes and penetrate cells changing the pH gradient, membrane potential, and osmotic regulation, thereby affecting respiration <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Influencing intra-cellular mechanisms, such as immuno-modulatory relationships, disrupting the cell membrane and forming pores are other possible modes of action of AMPs <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Pore formation is an important mechanism by which peptides cause cell death. Four models have been used to explain this phenomenon: <italic>(i) the toroidal model</italic> where the peptides that attach to cell membranes aggregate, and the lipid monolayers bend continuously acquiring positive curvature. Through this pore, the peptides enter and destroy the cell's contents. In <italic>(ii) the carpet model</italic>, AMPs cover the surface of the cell like a carpet until a threshold is reached to form membrane patches in which the lipids aggregate. This weakens the bilayer and forms pores. Therefore, membrane disruption occurs leading to lysis. In <italic>(iii) the barrel-stave model,</italic> bundles of peptides oligomerize and form membrane pores on the microbe, thus enabling them to interact with the hydrophobic core. Therefore microbes die either by membrane disruption, cell leakage, or loss of polarization. In the final <italic>(iv) aggregate channel model</italic>, peptides penetrate bacterial cells and form clusters and aggregates. The water molecules then facilitate the leakage of ions from the cell <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. AMPs are also implicated in the inhibition of DNA, protein, and RNA synthesis, interference with cytokinesis, alteration of cytoplasmic membrane formation, and the inhibition of enzymatic activities <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Peptides usually occur as &#945;-helix or &#946;-sheets or as a combination of both. There are two common characteristics shared by most AMPs, a net positive charge and amphipathic structure. These two factors help peptides bind the cell membrane, increasing permeability <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It is generally accepted that long chain peptides insert themselves into bacterial cells forming pores that lead to cell death. When the net positive charge of a peptide is high, it has the ability to interact effectively with the negatively charged bacterial outer membrane <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The length and composition of amino acid sequences affect the formation of aggregates and dissociation during the interaction <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, peptides may hold promise as antimicrobial agents, although screening methodologies for testing new antimicrobials are lacking.</p><p>Conventional assays are widely used in testing and screening the effects of antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. These protocols are of use in the fields of food safety, pharmacology, environmental, and water quality monitoring, although there are some disadvantages, such as time consumption, intensive labor, the requirement of large amounts of sample or reagents, and the exposure to contamination <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In addition, conventional assays cannot be used for intermediate testing, such as examining the kinetics of microbes, exploring topography, or characterizing the biochemical spectra. The other major issue with conventional assays is that the actual environment of microbial growth cannot be mimicked in flasks, test tubes, or microtitre wells <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Microfluidics technology is a fast-growing field that overcomes the disadvantages of these conventional assays by being able to provide high throughput screening, real-time examination of samples, usage of very low amounts of reagents, rapid screening, parallel testing of multiple drugs, all while saving space <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. High throughput screening (HTS) platforms have improved drug delivery processes and are playing a vital role in the discovery of anti-cancer drugs and the characterization of drug metabolism and cytotoxicity <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of soy based antimicrobial peptides (PGTAVFK and IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA) against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was examined initially using conventional microbiological assays.

The molecular weight of the first short chain peptide PGTAVFK was 718.4&#160;g/mol, and the other long chain peptide IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA was 2146.4&#160;g/mol. They were synthesized by 9-fluorenylmethoxicarbonyl (fmoc) solid-phase synthesis and purified to 98.62% and 97.59%, respectively using a C-18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) reverse column <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Upon receiving the peptides, they were stored at 4&#160;&#176;C.

Mueller Hinton broth is the commonly used media for performing susceptibility tests for fast growing clinically isolated bacteria. While performing preliminary experiments, it was found that L. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> did not grow in Mueller Hinton broth. BHI is rich in nutrients and is suitable for fastidious organisms like L. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>. Both bacteria were grown at 37&#160;&#176;C in the respective broth until the cell density was above the 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate standard, while the cells are in the logarithmic growth phase. This inoculum was then diluted 1:140 times in the respective media. 100&#160;&#181;l of media was added to each well tested in a 96-wells microtitre plate. Then, 200&#160;&#181;l of 5&#160;mM PGTAVFK and 2.3&#160;mM IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA soy peptide solutions were added to the first well (column 1), and each row was serially diluted two-fold to column 11 of the 96-well microtitre plate. Column 12 was reserved for the control and did not contain any peptide solution. Tests were separately carried out with the two peptides. Lactoferricin was used as positive control, as it is a better-characterized peptide that has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against L. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Concentrations of lactoferricin ranging from 8&#160;&#181;g/ml to 0.1&#160;mg/ml have been shown to be effective against these organisms; our results were consistent with these observations (data not shown). Using a pipette, 100&#160;&#181;l of the diluted inoculum was added to all wells in the plate. A final inoculum of 4&#8211;8&#215;10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml was achieved for each bacterial species. The final soy peptide concentrations ranged from 2.5&#160;mM in column 1&#8211;2.44&#160;&#181;M in column 11. Plates were then covered and incubated at 37&#160;&#176;C at 24&#160;h, the plates were taken out, and the optical density was read using a Biotrak II plate reader (Amersham Biosciences, Canada). All assays were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Microfluidic platform</title><p>The microfluidic device was designed using AutoCAD 2015 (Autodesk Inc, USA). The vision behind designing this device was to fabricate a 3D high throughput drug screening device consisting of a glass bottom layer, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) second layer with a bacterial dispenser, loading channels, and 24 incubation chambers, and a final top PDMS layer with 4 concentration generating gradients and connective channels. The glass base was 70&#160;mm&#215;70&#160;mm; the central reservoir for dispensing bacteria was designed to have a diameter of 2.5&#160;mm. The 24 incubating chambers were 2&#160;mm in diameter, and the loading channels were 12.75&#160;mm long and 60&#160;&#181;m wide. The 4 concentration gradient generators (width=100&#160;&#181;m) consisted of 8 inlets (each was 0.75&#160;mm in diameter) to flow different concentrations of soy peptide with PBS buffer. The gradient generators were uniformly designed to ensure that they use laminar flow and diffusive mixing to form a steady mixture of PBS and peptide solution. The inlets were only present on the top layer to allow for proper mixing and the flow of peptide solution. The connecting channels were about 10&#8211;15&#160;mm in length, while the width was varied from 100 to 30&#160;&#181;m to avoid the backflow of bacteria into these channels. Once the device was designed, the mask was custom made from Fine Line Imaging (Colorado, USA). From the mask, master moulds were fabricated using photo-lithographic technique. The design of this 3D high throughput microfluidic platform is shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Design of the 3D microfluidic high-throughput drug screening platform: (i) three layers of the microfluidic device and a magnified view of the serpentine-like channels in the concentration gradient generator (CGG) and bacterial dispenser with incubation chambers.

The device was then removed from the wafer, cut, and holes were punched (Harris Uni-Core, Sigma Chemical Co., USA). The inlet holes on the top layer were 0.75&#160;mm in diameter, the bacterial dispensing chamber was 0.75&#160;mm in diameter, and the 24 incubating chambers were 2&#160;mm in diameter. Both the layers along with the glass base were plasma cleaned (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, USA) to remove debris and to enhance the bonding between various layers.

One ml of this culture was centrifuged (SciLogex D3024, USA) at 3000&#160;rpm for 3&#160;min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was suspended in sterile PBS. This was then diluted to a 0.5 McFarland Standard and used for further experimentation to ensure that cells would be poised to grow once inoculated. The cells were injected into the bacterial dispensing chamber at the center of the device.

The flow rate (20&#160;&#181;l/h) was controlled using syringe pumps (Chemyx Fusion Touch 200 and 400, USA; Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Elite, USA). The temperature of the device was maintained at 37&#160;&#176;C using a temperature controller stage.

As discussed previously, long chain peptides are generally associated with high antibacterial activity. The difference in the net positive charges of the two peptides could also have contributed to differences in their antibacterial activity. The activity of AMPs could be affected by the concentrations of cations and anions present in their environment <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the combination of amino acids in the sequences of peptides could have affected their antibacterial efficacy.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that some cations neutralize repulsive forces of adjacent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to a tight and cross-linked outer membrane that protects itself from hydrophobic surfaces and AMPs <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. LPS moieties differ in composition and length among bacterial species, which could possibly be a reason why the long chain peptide was able to act effectively on <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> while the short chain peptide was largely inactive <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This could also be the reason why PGTAVFK was not able to significantly inhibit <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> but was able to inhibit L. <italic>monocytogenes,</italic> a Gram-positive bacterium. Once AMPs pass through the LPS in outer membrane, there is an inner membrane comprised of phospholipids on both sides of the bilayer. Therefore, a peptide that could enter the outer membrane need not necessarily interact efficiently with the inner membrane. It has been reported that peptides form aggregates in solution, which makes it difficult for them to enter the outer membrane and reach the target, which is the cytoplasmic membrane <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, no aggregates were visually observed in either prepared peptide solution used in our experiments. LPS forms aggregates in solution that are biologically active and toxic. Therefore, dissociation of these aggregates is required to neutralize and inactivate LPS. These could be some plausible reasons for the observed differential sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3.3</label><title>Characterization of our high throughput 3D microfluidic platform</title><p>Characterization of the 3D microfluidic device was performed to show that this device could be used for multiplexing, parallel concentration gradient generation, and drug screening applying various concentrations simultaneously.

Formation of air bubbles in the serpentine-like pathways of the microfluidic platform may block fluid flow causing non-linearity, which can be avoided by prober bonding of the PDMS with the glass slide and an accurate device design chip. It is quite important that the thickness of PDMS layers is uniform for a proper concentration gradient generation.

Owing to the microliter volume size of the peptide solutions in each well of the microfluidic incubation chamber and the enhanced surface to volume ratio, there is a rapid kinetic reaction between the peptide and the individual bacterial cells, leading to a decreased incubation time in comparison with the milliliter volumes of the conventional assays.

The SERS substrate enhances the RAMAN intensity of samples due to the surface roughness caused by the presence of metal nanoparticles (gold).

By using a SERS substrate, the spectral intensity improved, but the RAMAN shifts were still weak. It was speculated that the incubation time and bacterial cell density have a direct correlation. If the bacterial cell density is less, the incubation time could also be reduced and so forth. In these experiments, a 0.5 McFarland standard cell density was used (OD at 600&#160;nm was between 0.08 and 0.1). Therefore the amount of incubation time required to elicit visible strong changes in biochemical signatures at this cell density could be longer than 4&#160;h.</p><p>Sockalingum et al. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> used different ways of mixing metal colloids with bacteria and observed SERS spectra using 632&#160;nm excitation.
