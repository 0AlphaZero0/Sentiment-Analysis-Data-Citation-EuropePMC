Therefore, MELK is a promising therapeutic target for a wide range of cancers. Although p21 is a well-known p53-downstream gene, we found that treatment with a potent MELK inhibitor, OTS167, could induce p21 protein expression in cancer cell lines harboring loss-of-function <italic>TP53</italic> mutations. We also confirmed that MELK knockdown by siRNA induced the p21 expression in p53-deficient cancer cell lines and caused the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Further analysis indicated that FOXO1 and FOXO3, two known transcriptional regulators of p21, were phosphorylated by MELK and thus be involved in the induction of p21 after MELK inhibition. Collectively, our herein findings suggest that MELK inhibition may be effective for human cancers even if <italic>TP53</italic> is mutated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase</kwd><kwd>molecular target</kwd><kwd>p21</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>FoxO family</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase) is a cell-cycle dependent protein kinase and over expressed in various types of human cancer, but its expression in normal human organs is limited to testis and embryonic tissues [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We previously reported MELK as a promising therapeutic target and developed a potent MELK kinase inhibitor, OTS167, which showed strong antitumor effects in mice xenograft models of several cancer types [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At present, therapeutic potential of OTS167 is evaluated in clinical trials (NCT01910545, NCT02795520, NCT02926690). MELK is shown to influence on several signaling pathways in cancer cell proliferation and survival, including the p53-p21 pathway [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, Kig C et al. showed that siRNA-mediated MELK knockdown could activate the p53-p21 pathway and induced cell cycle arrest in glioblastoma cells [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We have characterized a part of the p53-signaling pathways in human cancer cells through identification of novel p53-target genes [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When the DNA damage occurs, the p53 is activated and causes cell cycle arrest at G1 phase by induction of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although p53 is a major transcriptional factor of p21 and its mutation is associated with decreased p21 expression [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the p53-independent induction of p21 has also been investigated by many groups [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For examples, BRCA1 was shown to activate p21 through both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and Forkhead box O (FoxO) families could bind to a promoter region of the p21 gene (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>) and increase its transcriptional level [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In concordant with these previous reports, our previous study also showed a dose-dependent induction of p21 after treatment with OTS167, in the <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type cancer cells as well as <italic>TP53</italic>-mutated cancer cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated molecular mechanism of the p53-independent induction of p21 by MELK inhibition. Our findings revealed that siRNA-mediated MELK knockdown increased protein levels of FOXO1 and FOXO3, which might increase p21 transcriptional level in a p53-independent manner. Since MELK could directly phosphorylate FOXO1 and FOXO3, our results further implied that effective restoration of these transcriptional factors by OTS167 treatment may be one of the important pathways to suppress proliferation of the p53-deficient cancer cells by MELK inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>SiRNA-mediated MELK knockdown induces p21 in HCT116 p53 wild-type (p53 (+/+)) and null (p53 (-/-)) cell lines</title><p>To investigate whether MELK inhibition can induce p21 in a p53-independent manner, we transfected siRNA targeting MELK in HCT116 colon cancer cells with p53 wild-type, HCT116-p53(+/+), and its derivative p53-nulll cells HCT116-p53(-/-). Two days after transfection with siRNA, MELK was successfully depleted at transcriptional level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and also protein level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) in both HCT116-p53(+/+) and -p53(-/-) cells.

We further examined two additional cancer cell lines harboring loss-of-function <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, NCI-H23 (lung adenocarcinoma) and TE4 (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma), and observed increased protein level of p21 in these cell lines after MELK knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These results indicated that MELK could have an important role in transcriptional regulation of the p21 gene in a p53-independent pathway, in addition to transactivation of p21 through the p53 pathway.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Knockdown effects of MELK in HCT116-p53 (+/+) and-p53 (-/-) cells</title><p><bold>A</bold>.Depletion of MELK and induction of p21 at transcriptional levels were observed in both cell lines by siRNA-mediated MELK knockdown.

Through this analysis eight proteins (SRF, p53, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXD1, FOXC1, FOXF2 and FOXJ2) were predicted as candidate transcriptional factors to bind to the promotor region in the p21 gene: among them, FOXO1 and FOXO3 were previously reported to bind to the p21 promoter region and induce the cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, we firstly examined whether MELK knockdown affect the FOXO1 and FOXO3 protein levels in HCT116-p53(+/+) and -p53(-/-) cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, MELK knockdown drastically increased both FOXO1 and FOXO3 protein levels in both of the HCT116 cells. Since their transcriptional levels were moderately increased by MELK knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), we hypothesized that MELK knockdown might directly or indirectly influence on the stability of these proteins through post-transcriptional modifications. The p21 induction by MELK inhibition was abrogated by knockdown of either FOXO1 or FOXO3 in HCT116-p53(-/-) cell (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Particularly, knockdown of FOXO3 completely abrogated the p21 induction, indicating that FOXO3 is a much critical transcription factor to induce p21 when MELK was inhibited. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that MELK inhibition increased the amount of FOXO1 and FOXO3 proteins bound to the promoter region of the p21 gene in HCT116-p53(-/-) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition to HCT116-p53(-/-) cells, we observed a similar effect (increased protein levels of FOXO1 and FOXO3) after MELK knockdown in another p53-deficient cancer cell lines, NCI-H23 and TE4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). We also observed that treatment of MELK inhibitor (OTS167) increased FOXO1 and FOXO3 proteins, which led to induction of p21 in TE4 cell line (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), but not clearly in NCI-H23 cell line. Since OTS167 inhibits multiple protein kinases in addition to MELK as reported previously [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], inhibition of other kinases by this inhibitor may affect the induction levels of p21.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>MELK knockdown increases FOXO1 and FOXO3 proteins</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

Induction of p21 is well known to cause the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, thus we analyzed the proportion of cells at each cell-cycle phase after siRNA-mediated MELK knockdown in the both HCT116-p53(+/+) and -p53(-/-) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). At day 2 when MELK knockdown effect was observed, we performed bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) incorporation assay and found the increase of the proportion of the cells at G0/G1 phase in both HCT116 cells (siControl vs siMELK; 58.9% vs 80.1% in p53(+/+) cells and 62.5% vs 79.3% in p53(-/-) cells, respectively). Concordantly, both HCT116 cells revealed the decrease in the proportion of the cells at S phase by MELK knockdown (siControl vs siMELK; 24.4% vs 8.4% in p53(+/+) cells and 22.8% vs 9.2% in p53(-/-) cells, respectively). To further validate these results, we performed cell-cycle analysis at 0, 3 and 6 hours after the release of cell-cycle arrest caused by aphidicolin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Six hours after the cell cycle release, both HCT116-p53(+/+) and -p53(-/-) cells that were transfected with siMELK revealed higher proportions of the cells at G0/G1 phase compared to those with siControl (siControl vs siMELK; 20.2% vs 41.2% in p53(+/+) cells and 9.95% vs 22.3% in p53(-/-) cells, respectively).

We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using recombinant proteins, and found that co-incubation of FOXO1 and FOXO3 with MELK increased the phosphorylation levels of these proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) (Histone H3 protein was used as a positive control [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Because we observed a much stronger signal on FOXO3 protein than Histone H3 or FOXO1 protein, we assumed that MELK might phosphorylate multiple sites of the FOXO3 protein. FOXO3 showed phosphorylation signals without MELK recombinant protein (lane 3 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) when the X-ray film was exposed for longer period, probably due to contamination of unknown protein kinase(s) during purification of recombinant FOXO3 protein.

Many groups including us have investigated critical roles of MELK in various processes of human carcinogenesis, such as proliferation, invasion, anti-apoptosis and stemness of cancer cells [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since MELK was considered as an ideal therapeutic target for cancer treatments, we developed potent MELK inhibitors [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among several signaling pathways affected by MELK inhibition, the p53-dependent induction of p21 was already reported. For example, Kig et al. reported that loss of MELK increased the p21 expression in glioblastoma cells and this p21 induction was mediated by the activated ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-Chk2-p53 pathway [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to our group, Beke et al. developed another MELK inhibitor (MELK T1) that could induce a phosphorylation of p53 and then upregulate p21 [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We also showed that our MELK inhibitor (OTS167) activated p53 and p21 in the cancer cell line with wild-type p53, but unexpectedly we observed activation of p21 in the cancer cell lines even with p53 mutation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], indicating a possibility of p53-independent p21 activation mechanism regulated by MELK in cancer cells.</p><p>In this study, we compared HCT116-p53(+/+) and -(-/-) cell lines and found that siRNA-mediated MELK knockdown could increase p21 proteins, regardless of the p53 status. This p21 induction was explainable for the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in the p53 null HCT116 cell line under the MELK depletion condition by siMELK. We subsequently attempted to clarify the mechanism of p53-independent p21 induction and found two possible transcriptional factors, which might be responsible to activate the p21 transcription.</p><p>FoxO family members play tumor suppressive roles by activating multiple target genes [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Phosphorylation is known as one of important protein modifications on FoxO proteins since it affects the protein stability of FoxO through the ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib) activated FOXO1 and FOXO3 by blocking the PI3K-AKT pathway, and in turn induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, our results in this study indicated that FOXO1 and FOXO3 might be novel substrates of MELK and that restoration of FOXO1 and FOXO3 might be another mechanism to cause growth suppressive effects through MELK inhibition.</p><p>Our findings further implied that MELK is an ideal therapeutic target for treatment of cancer cells, regardless of the p53 status. Even in the p53-mutated cancer cells, we found that MELK inhibition induced p21 and suppressed the cell proliferation by causing G1 arrest. p21 is known to have a function to interact with PCNA and inhibit the DNA repair by modulating various DNA repair processes [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, p21 overexpression sensitizes ovarian cancer cell lines to cisplatin [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, MELK inhibitor in combination with the DNA-damaging therapies may effectively kill cancer cells, particularly be useful for those harboring <italic>TP53</italic> mutations.</p><p>In conclusion, MELK inhibition can induce p21 expression and cause G1 arrest in the p53-independent pathway, which is mediated probably by stabilization of FOXO1 and FOXO3. Our findings suggest that MELK inhibitor may be applicable to treatment of cancers regardless of the <italic>TP53</italic> status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HCT116 p53 wild-type (p53 (+/+)) and null (p53 (-/-)) isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD).
