Disruption of signaling pathways that govern tumor vascularity provide a potential avenue to thwart cancer progression. Through phage display-based functional proteomics, immunohistochemical analysis of human pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) specimens, and in vitro validation, we reveal that hornerin, an S100 fused-type protein, is highly expressed on pancreatic tumor endothelium in a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-independent manner. Murine-specific hornerin knockdown in PDAC xenografts results in tumor vessels with decreased radii and tortuosity. Hornerin knockdown tumors have significantly reduced leakiness, increased oxygenation, and greater apoptosis. Additionally, these tumors show a significant reduction in growth, a response that is further heightened when therapeutic inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is utilized in combination with hornerin knockdown. These results indicate that hornerin is highly expressed in pancreatic tumor endothelium and alters tumor vessel parameters through a VEGF-independent mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Angiogenesis is essential for solid tumor progression.

In their seminal paper, Hanahan and Weinberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> listed sustained angiogenesis as one of the original hallmarks of cancer. Research in the intervening years has bolstered the significance of this process and necessitated its inclusion in their follow-up paper a decade later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As vessels provide the fuel for a growing tumor, anti-angiogenic therapies designed to impede the rapid, dysregulated propagation of vessels or enhance endothelial cell death have been proposed and at times implemented in clinic. These are commonly combined with anti-cancer cell therapies, resulting in an overall strategy that targets critical signaling pathways in different cell types that comprise the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The discovery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), originally called vascular permeability factor, in 1983<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> dramatically increased the knowledge of angiogenesis in many fields, including tumor angiogenesis. Since it is extensively studied and highly overexpressed in cancer as well as other pathologies, the VEGF pathway was a natural initial target when developing anti-angiogenesis therapies. Anti-VEGF therapies include small molecule inhibitors, VEGF receptor blocking antibodies, and VEGF traps, which mimic the receptor-binding site and sequester VEGF from its receptor. In a review of anti-angiogenic therapies in pancreatic cancer, Whipple et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> listed 12 anti-angiogenic therapies that are in use for this type of cancer alone. When browsing the list, it is striking that 10 of those 12 therapies target the VEGF pathway. Anti-angiogenic (mostly anti-VEGF) therapies have achieved success pre-clinically and clinically, however, as is common with monotherapies, tumor resistance and recurrence is a major problem.</p><p id="Par5">One hypothesis for the lack of success could be the presence of compensatory or redundant pathways. Compensatory pathways are well established in tumor therapy research; consequently clinical trials devoted to synergistic combinations of drugs have proliferated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Combinatorial approaches involving non-redundant signaling pathways show great promise, as they have the ability to overcome acquired resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A synergistic/additive approach, one involving both the VEGF pathway and another important pathway, could provide the positive results that anti-angiogenic therapies should theoretically produce.</p><p id="Par6">Therefore, to identify non-VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenic factors, we used a phage display functional proteomics approach that combined an in vivo phage screen in tumor-bearing animals with an in vitro screen to exclude clones that bound to VEGF-treated cells. Binding partner identification from this screen revealed the protein hornerin, which to this point had been studied predominantly in the skin epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Hornerin was further validated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a non-VEGF regulated protein. While confirming hornerin expression in tumor-associated endothelial cells in resected human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples, it was discovered that hornerin is also expressed in PDAC. Further exploration identified several other tumor types that express hornerin, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and prostate adenocarcinoma. A functional role of hornerin was affirmed, as in vivo-specific knockdown of hornerin in tumor-associated endothelial cells resulted in decreased tumor burden along with alterations in vessel parameters as measured by vessel radius, vessel volume fraction, and fractal dimension. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tumors with vessels with decreased hornerin expression revealed a decrease in vascular leakiness. Finally, hornerin knockdown combined with VEGF inhibition produced additive tumor volume and angiogenesis abatement, providing further evidence that compensatory pathways exist in tumor-associated endothelial cells. The discovery of elevated hornerin expression in tumor vasculature, the functional consequences of hornerin targeted knockdown on tumor vascularity and growth, and the additive effect of hornerin depletion with VEGFR signaling inhibition directs the potential creation of a novel anti-angiogenesis strategy that targets multiple signaling pathways in tumor endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>VEGF-independent vascular binding peptides</title><p id="Par7">To elucidate peptides that bind specifically to tumor endothelium, an in vivo phage display screen was performed in mice bearing orthotopically implanted human PDAC cells. After three rounds of selection, 30 phage clones that we termed pancreatic tumor endothelial markers (PTEM) were sequenced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Before continuing with the in vitro screen, we wanted to assess the specificity of a few of the selected clones for blood vessels in vivo through injection of fluorescently labeled phage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> into animals bearing orthotopic tumors. Specificity of the phage for tumor vessels was assessed by immunofluorescence (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We used three clones with similar homology, PRH, in our analysis. The &#8220;PRH&#8221; pool (PTEM 12/17, 16) bound 73.4% (4.1-fold over normal pancreas vessels) of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule1-positive tumor vessels (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The immunofluorescent images indicate that the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phage remained bound to the luminal surface of the blood vessels even after vigorous perfusion.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of tumor endothelial cell-specific phage clones and hornerin as a non-VEGF but TCM-induced protein. <bold>a</bold> The amino-acid sequences of 30 selected phage clones that displayed selective binding to pancreatic tumor endothelium. <bold>b</bold> Orthotopic pancreatic tumor section showing co-localization of FITC-labeled &#8220;PRH&#8221; motif phage clones (<italic>green</italic>) with PCAM1-positive vessels (<italic>red</italic>).

</p><p id="Par8">As VEGF is highly abundant in the pancreatic tumor milieu, we decided to further segregate clones based on their ability to bind to VEGF-treated HUVECs vs. tumor conditioned media (TCM)-treated HUVECs. HUVECs were utilized as we were interested in the ability of the peptides to bind to both human and mouse antigens. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find clones that consistently bound to HUVECs treated with TCM, but not vehicle control (VC) or VEGF-supplemented control media (VEGFCM) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). After analysis, the clones were grouped and organized in a Venn diagram (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Although the PRH family demonstrated specificity and selectivity for tumor blood vessels in vivo, it failed to meet these criteria in subsequent in vitro screens, suggesting that it does not cross-react with a human target or the target is not present on human cells. Of the clones that bound selectively to TCM-treated HUVECs, PTEM 9 demonstrated the highest average specificity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These data were further validated in a subsequent ELISA using both M13KE phage (no displayed peptide; control) and PTEM 9 phage (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hornerin identified as the binding partner of PTEM 9</title><p id="Par9">We next employed phage display-based functional proteomics to determine the binding partner of PTEM 9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Tandem mass spectroscopy sequencing of lysates resulting from the functional proteomics process revealed hornerin as the candidate protein; six unique tryptic digest fragments were identified resulting in a percent coverage of 3.5%, coverage similar to what has been previously published utilizing this method (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>; Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To confirm that hornerin was the identified protein, we performed anti-hornerin immunoblotting on the PTEM 9 phage and control M13KE phage lysates. A unique band in the PTEM 9 lane that was not present in the control sample corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of hornerin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Non-VEGF soluble factors increase hornerin expression</title><p id="Par10">Based on the strategy utilized to segregate the peptides presented in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, we hypothesized that expression of hornerin in HUVECs would increase upon treatment with TCM but not in response to VEGF. To test this, cell lysates from HUVECs treated with TCM, VEGFCM, and VC media were analyzed by immunoblot for the expression of hornerin. In TCM-treated HUVECs, hornerin expression was 19.3-fold higher when compared with VC, while treatment of HUVECs with VEGFCM resulted in no significant change of hornerin expression over VC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, g</xref>). Immunofluorescent detection of hornerin in non-permeabilized HUVECs suggests hornerin co-localization with the plasma membrane following treatment with TCM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). These data strongly indicate that hornerin is upregulated in response to factor(s) in the TCM and that hornerin accumulates at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Hornerin is expressed in human PDAC vessels</title><p id="Par11">We next sought to determine if hornerin is expressed in human tumor specimens. Hornerin expression in specimens from 10 PDAC patients (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was revealed by immunohistochemistry and scored by a certified pathologist at the University of Virginia. Normal pancreas endothelial cells (NPE) (<italic>arrows</italic>) were negative for hornerin expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), however tumor endothelial cells (TE) (<italic>arrows</italic>) near PDAC (<italic>arrowheads</italic>) stained positively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Importantly, 5 of the 10 resected PDAC samples had areas of non-affected pancreas where NPE staining could be quantified. Analysis of the samples in each scoring component (intensity and percent positively stained cells; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a, b</xref>) revealed a large disparity between NPE and TE, with TE having a 7.1-fold higher score than NPE (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparative hornerin expression in normal pancreas and resected human PDAC tumors.

</p><p id="Par12">We observed that PDAC cells and normal pancreas cells also stain positive for hornerin, indicating that hornerin may not be a good immunohistochemical biomarker for PDAC. However, the increased vessel expression suggested a tumor-specific phenotype and prompted the studies presented in this report. To expand our analysis of hornerin expression in human tumor specimens, a pathologist scored several types of solid tumors in addition to PDAC. Notably, RCC (chromophobe, clear cell, and papillary) displayed the highest relative expression of hornerin in the panel we evaluated (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Hornerin knockdown leads to decreased tumor burden</title><p id="Par13">As hornerin is present in tumor vessels but not normal vessels, we hypothesized that hornerin may play an important role in tumor vessel function and consequently regulate tumor progression. To address this, we decreased endothelial hornerin expression using intratumoral injections of mouse-specific hornerin siRNA (<italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA) in a subcutaneous xenograft PDAC model (L3.6pl; PDAC of human origin). We chose this model system carefully such that epithelial tumor tissue would be unaffected by <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA knockdown. To confirm that the <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA does not target human <italic>HRNR</italic>, we conducted in vitro siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse epidermal keratinocytes (COCA) and human keratinocytes. These cell lines were selected based on previous studies showing elevated hornerin expression in the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our results indicated a 60% reduction in hornerin expression in COCA cells treated with <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA relative to control scrambled siRNA (Scr siRNA)-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). Loss of hornerin was not observed to a significant degree (~10%) in the human keratinocytes under similar conditions, thus providing support that the <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA utilized in our studies is mouse-specific (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). Remarkably, intratumoral injections of <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA resulted in tumors that were 2.5-fold smaller compared to tumors that were injected with Scr siRNA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). To confirm hornerin knockdown in the tumor endothelium, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) sorted tumor CD31<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells and observed a marked 78% reduction in hornerin transcript in the <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA-treated cohort (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Analysis of qPCR end-point samples revealed an intense band at the predicted amplicon size (149 base pairs), indicating that our primers were specific for the intended target (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). To provide further support for endothelial cell-hornerin knockdown and targeted siRNA specificity for murine and not human hornerin, we analyzed tumor sections for hornerin protein expression by immunofluorescent microscopy. Tumor vessels treated with Scr siRNA maintained high expression of hornerin, while hornerin expression in <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA-treated vessels was greatly reduced (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Quantitation of sections revealed no difference between the expression of hornerin in epithelial cells from tumors treated with either Scr siRNA or <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA. In contrast, there was a 30% decrease in hornerin expression in the endothelial cells between the two treatments (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

To address this, expression of Ki67, a proliferation marker, and cleaved caspase 3, a marker of cellular apoptosis, were analyzed in tumor sections by immunofluorescent microscopy. Our results indicate that neither hornerin knockdown nor VEGFR inhibition altered overall tumor proliferation in either of the three treatment groups compared to control (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a, b</xref>). Interestingly, we did observe a two-fold increase relative to control in cleaved caspase 3 levels in tumors that had been treated with <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA or AV-951 alone, suggesting that enhanced apoptosis in the tumor may be responsible for the decreased tumor burden we observed in these two groups (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c, d</xref>). No significant difference from control was observed in tumors with combination treatment. Further analysis of the tumor cellularity indicated that the proportion of leukocytes (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells) was not altered with hornerin knockdown, suggesting that immune cell infiltration into the tumor was not hornerin dependent (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a, c</xref>).

As previously published at this concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, vessels from AV-951 alone treated tumor-bearing animals were morphologically similar to control vessels; however, fewer vessels were observed. The combination therapy of <italic>Hrnr</italic> siRNA and AV-951 resulted in fewer vessels in addition to morphologic differences in the vessels. Quantitation with RAVE revealed the presence of an overall shift to smaller radii and VVF in the combo group compared to control, and a trend toward increased pericyte coverage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">We further evaluated hornerin regulation of tumor vasculature through photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), which permitted non-invasive analysis of critical vessel parameters such as blood flow rate, hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation in the same tumor over the course of treatment.

We hypothesized that redundant signaling pathways exist in the tumor vasculature that circumvent monotherapies, and that the identification of VEGF-independent regulatory proteins may provide targets for dual anti-angiogenic treatment modalities. To identify these potential targets, we utilized phage display screening and functional proteomics methods, primarily because of its enormous potential to find unbiased targets with no a priori knowledge. Functionalizing the phage for use as a proteomics tool has so far identified novel proteins in PDAC such as pyruvate kinase M2 and plectin&#8212;both of which are normally cytoplasmic but are secreted and cell surface associated in cancer, similar to our findings with hornerin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Of the identified proteins, plectin is the most studied and developed biomarker for PDAC and its importance in tumor biology was recently illuminated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Since the original discovery as a PDAC biomarker, plectin has been published as being expressed in other diseases such as bladder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and esophageal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, indicating that our phage-based functional proteomics methods are robust and can lead to the identification of proteins of importance. After three rounds of in vivo phage screening, validation in vitro, and phage-based functional proteomics, we identified hornerin as a non-VEGF upregulated protein differentially expressed in tumor vessels. From this screen, we also identified other potentially interesting peptides and are working to identify their binding partners.</p><p id="Par23">The identification of elevated hornerin expression in this setting is novel and contributes significantly to the relatively small volume of literature on hornerin regulation and function.

Subsequent, but limited, investigation has addressed the intersection of hornerin with cancer, as highlighted in a recent report by Fleming et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> that showed increased hornerin expression in the development of murine mammary glands and in breast tumor cells associated with high tumorigenicity. Hornerin had not been evaluated in endothelial cells prior to this study, and our identification of hornerin specifically on the endothelium adjacent to pancreatic tumor outgrowth directed us to investigate its function under conditions found in a growing tumor.</p><p id="Par24">The in vivo reduction of endothelial hornerin expression by intratumoral siRNA injection resulted in tumors with vessels that were morphologically distinct&#8212;characterized by smaller radii and reduced tortuosity.

Our results show decreased Gd-DTPA uptake and decreased <italic>K</italic>

Further, tumors with decreased hornerin expression had higher oxygen saturation levels.

Anti-vascular therapies, which are almost always synonymous with VEGF inhibitors, have achieved success pre-clinically and clinically and have opened new avenues for anti-tumor therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the durable patient response and efficacy have been marginal, measuring increased patient survival in months. Of the tumors that respond, most recur and are no longer responsive to anti-VEGF therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. One hypothesis could be the presence of compensatory or redundant pathways, which are well established in tumor therapy research. Consequently, clinical trials devoted to synergistic combinations of drugs have proliferated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, although most are aimed at pathways present in the cancer cells. Compensatory pathways involving the VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways have been described in tumor vessel studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. An approach involving both the VEGF pathway and another important pathway could provide increased positive therapeutic outcomes. The existence of VEGF-independent compensatory pathways is an emerging concept that has been investigated by, among others, the Hanahan group. Recent evidence suggests that activation of the FGF2 pathway could constitute a potential resistance mechanism to anti-VEGF therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. When FGF2 signaling was blocked by FGF2 trap, resistance to the anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101 was eliminated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In further studies by the same group, brivanib, a dual VEGF/FGF inhibitor, suppressed anti-VEGF (DC101 and sorafenib) -acquired resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">To expand on this concept, we asked whether decreasing hornerin protein levels in combination with VEGFR2 inhibition would produce synergistic or additive reductions in tumor volume. Each monotherapy, hornerin knockdown and VEGFR inhibition, produced a two-fold reduction in tumor volume. When the therapies were combined, the resulting decrease in tumor volume was four-fold. Interestingly, tumor-cleaved caspase three levels were elevated with either treatment alone but not in mice subjected to combination therapy, suggesting that perhaps hornerin knockdown and VEGFR inhibition synergize through a yet unidentified mechanism to induce stasis of tumor growth during the early stages of progression. The identification of hornerin and its additive effects in combination with VEGF inhibition represents a promising avenue for development of targeted therapeutics against hornerin.</p><p id="Par27">The implication of hornerin in a VEGF-independent signaling cascade that modulates tumor vessel parameters prompts a need to discover the factors present in the L3.6pl secretome that were responsible for hornerin upregulation.

Knowledge of expression modulators could direct further studies into the signaling and mechanism of hornerin in tumor angiogenesis. To assess the potential for growth factor-mediated hornerin upregulation, we first determined the highest expressed non-VEGF growth factors in the TCM and treated HUVECs with these factors at published B-max concentrations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a, b</xref>). Our preliminary results suggest that interleukin 12 (IL-12) and basic FGF (bFGF) may stimulate hornerin expression. It is also established that the L3.6pl cell line produces relatively high levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and that in tumor models signaling through the EGF receptor potentiates endothelial cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We also observed that hornerin expression increases in HUVECs in response to EGF stimulation, suggesting that one potential mechanism of elevated hornerin in the tumor endothelium is due to tumor cell-derived EGF, however these results remain to be explored in the tumor setting (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11c</xref>). Interestingly, it appears that the response to EGF stimulation may be wide ranging, as we observed a concentration-dependent increase in expression to EGF treatment in L3.6pl cells and a more modest response in keratinocytes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11d, e</xref>). Elucidation of the factors, those that regulate hornerin and others that function downstream of hornerin, could have substantial clinical relevance by opening additional avenues of therapeutic intervention targeting the tumor vasculature.</p><p id="Par28">While our study does reveal a critical role for endothelial cell-hornerin in regulating vessel parameters that are characteristic of the tumor vasculature, it does not address the function of hornerin in other cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Future work utilizing conditional knockdown models of hornerin in different cell lineages could provide additional clarity. Preliminary evidence presented in this study suggests that hornerin knockdown does not alter accumulation of leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment. It should not be overlooked that our current understanding attached to hornerin expression, regulation, and function has developed on a foundation laid by other closely related S100 fused-type protein family members, however very little experimental data exist to validate these assumptions. The fact that hornerin is expressed and functional in the novel biological context revealed in our study suggests that much remains to be learned about hornerin at the fundamental level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par29">All experiments were performed on male 9&#8211;10-week-old athymic nude (nu/nu) mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA).
