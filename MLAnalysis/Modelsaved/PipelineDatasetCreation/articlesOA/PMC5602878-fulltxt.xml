Migration was increased in the presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins osteopontin and fibronectin and the basement membrane proteins collagen IV and laminin I. TRAP-induced properties were reverted upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRAP or treatment with the small molecule TRAP inhibitor 5-PNA. Global phosphoproteomics and proteomics analyses identified possible substrates of TRAP phosphatase activity or signaling intermediates and outlined a TRAP-dependent regulation of proteins involved in cell adhesion and ECM organization. Upregulation of TGF&#946; isoform 2 (TGF&#946;2), TGF&#946; receptor type 1 (T&#946;R1) and Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2), as well as increased intracellular phosphorylation of CD44 were identified upon TRAP perturbation.

A disulfide linked heterodimer (TRAP 5b) with an N-terminal fragment of 20&#8211;23&#160;kDa joined to the 16 to 17&#160;kDa C-terminal part originates from post-translational cleavage of the monomeric form, which significantly increases phosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. TRAP derived from different mammalian sources reveals almost identical homology at the amino acid sequence level and identical biochemical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. During bone resorption, TRAP is secreted into the resorption lacuna of active osteoclasts, where it dephosphorylates the bone matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), thereby promoting osteoclast detachment and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, TRAP has been suggested to regulate OPN bioactivity in autoimmune conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The isoform TRAP 5b was proposed as a serum marker for bone metastases in various types of primary cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, TRAP has also been detected in several cancer cells and tissues (breast, ovarian, cervical cancer and malignant melanoma) and its expression level correlates with the severity of the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, high TRAP expression correlates with reduced tumor- and metastasis-free survival in malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and with decreased overall survival and increased incidence of metastasis in hepatocellular cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In gastric cancer, elevated TRAP expression is an independent risk factor for peritoneal dissemination and is associated with shorter patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In lung cancer, patients with high TRAP expression had a significantly lower overall survival than the patients with low TRAP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Altogether, previous studies underscore the potential clinical relevance of TRAP to monitor cancer development and progression; nevertheless, underlying cellular and molecular processes remain unclear.</p><p id="Par13">TRAP was shown to interact intracellularly with the Transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;) receptor interacting protein-1 (TRIP-1), thereby activating TGF&#946; receptor type II (T&#946;R2) and osteoblast differentiation through the Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3) pathway at sites of prior bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, TRIP-1 knock-down abrogates osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. TRAP 5a interaction with TRIP-1 has also been demonstrated in mouse pre-adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">TGF&#946; ligands exist in three highly homologous isoforms, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946;2 and TGF&#946;3 and are part of a large family of structurally related secreted cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Upon ligand binding to the constitutively active serine/threonine kinase T&#946;R2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the latter forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with the type I receptor (T&#946;R1). T&#946;R2 then trans-phosphorylates T&#946;R1, ultimately leading to the transcription of various target genes via both SMAD- and non-SMAD mediated pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). TGF&#946; acts as tumor repressor in early stages of tumorigenesis and as an oncogene in late stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For instance, in breast cancer patients expression of TGF&#946; was increased in tumor tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and was associated with disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. TGF&#946;2 has been proposed as a predictive marker for breast cancer, as high levels of TGF&#946;2 correlate with advanced tumor stage and shortened survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Additionally, TGF&#946;2 was reported as a catalyzer of TGF&#946; signaling through an autocrine loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Finally, T&#946;R1 contain a single cytoplasmic binding site for Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], suggesting a potential interaction between the TGF&#946; pathway and CD44, a cancer-associated glycoprotein previously reported as an OPN receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Activated CD44 stimulates the serine/threonine kinase activity of T&#946;R1, which in turns increases SMAD2/3 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Aim of this study was to delineate by proof-of-concept, how TRAP promotes cellular properties related to metastasis in breast cancer cells at advanced state. As there is only limited knowledge about the molecular perturbations and possible substrates of TRAP, global phosphoproteomic and proteomic analysis was applied to connect possible signaling mechanisms to the TRAP-dependent phenotypic changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents</title><p id="Par16">

</p><p id="Par45">Since TRAP possesses phosphatase activity, phosphoproteomics analysis upon TRAP overexpression was employed to identify putative TRAP targets. For phosphoproteomics analysis, HiRIEF fractionation using &#8220;ultra-acidic&#8221; pH range (2.5&#8211;3.7) IPG strips was employed to enrich for phosphorylated peptides, as the addition of phosphate groups decreases the peptide pI. This approach led to the identification of 6266 and 5771 unique peptides in replicate 1 and replicate 2, respectively, of which 3325 and 3892 were phosphorylated (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This approach is particularly suitable to identify multiply phosphorylated peptides, as about 50% of the identified phospho-peptides carry two or more phosphorylations. Multiply phosphorylated peptides are enriched in the first 30 fractions (acidic end) of the IPG 2.5&#8211;3.7 strip, while singly phosphorylated peptides are identified mostly in the more basic strip fractions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>; Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par47">Phospho-site ratios (normalized to the total protein levels) and protein ratios have Pearson coefficients of correlation between replicates of 0.60 and 0.84 respectively (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2).

These three sites located in the intracellular portion of CD44 do not have any previously reported function. The 116 phosphorylation sites downregulated in response to TRAP overexpression represent putative targets of TRAP phosphatase activity. Among the significantly downregulated phosphorylation sites, 11 sites were previously annotated to be functional, including S183 of protein phosphatase 1G (PPM1G); S131 and S137 of lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A); S957 and S966 of structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 1A (SMC1A); S27 of isoform 2 of X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 6 (XRCC6); and S453 and T455 of isoform 3 of Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1).

We demonstrate that TRAP regulates metastasis-related features such as anchorage-independent and &#8211;dependent cell growth, proliferation, migration and invasion. Global proteomics and phosphoproteomic analyses showed that regulated events upon TRAP perturbation are mainly proteins and phosphorylation sites involved with cellular adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization.
