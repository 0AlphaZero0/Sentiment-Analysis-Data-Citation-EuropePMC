Mutations in POR cause metabolic disorders of steroid hormone biosynthesis and affect certain drug metabolizing P450 activities. We studied mutations A115V, T142A, Q153R identified in the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding domain of POR that interacts with partner proteins and P284L located in the hinge region that is required for flexibility and domain movements in POR. Human wild-type (WT) and mutant POR as well as CYP3A4 and CYP19A1 proteins in recombinant form were expressed in bacteria, and purified proteins were reconstituted in liposomes for enzyme kinetic assays. Quality of POR protein was checked by cytochrome c reduction assay as well as flavin content measurements. We found that proteins carrying mutations A115V, T142A located close to the FMN binding site had reduced flavin content compared to WT POR and lost almost all activity to metabolize androstenedione via CYP19A1 and showed reduced CYP3A4 activity. The variant P284L identified from apparently normal subjects also had severe loss of both CYP19A1 and CYP3A4 activities, indicating this to be a potentially disease causing mutation. The mutation Q153R initially identified in a patient with disordered steroidogenesis showed remarkably increased activities of both CYP19A1 and CYP3A4 without any significant change in flavin content, indicating improved protein&#8211;protein interactions between POR Q153R and some P450 proteins. These results indicate that effects of mutations on activities of individual cytochromes P450 can be variable and a detailed analysis of each variant with different partner proteins is necessary to accurately determine the genotype-phenotype correlations of POR variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>POR</kwd><kwd>P450 oxidoreductase</kwd><kwd>CYP19A1</kwd><kwd>CYP3A4</kwd><kwd>polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>protein&#8211;protein interaction</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#246;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001711</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31003A_134926</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">UniBern Forschungsstiftung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100007282</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytochrome P450 proteins metabolize a wide range of drugs, steroids and xenobiotics (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Schuster and Bernhardt, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Omura, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zanger and Schwab, 2013</xref>). There are two distinct types of cytochrome P450 proteins in humans (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Omura, 2010</xref>). Type 1 P450s, that are located in the mitochondria, are primarily involved in the metabolism of steroids and use adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin reductase proteins as redox partners (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Omura, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zalewski et al., 2016</xref>). The type 2 P450s, located in the endoplasmic reticulum, rely on a single redox partner, the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR, NCBI# NP_000932, UniProt# P16435), for supply of electrons (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 1969</xref>). POR is a flavoprotein that contains both the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and supplies electrons to cytochromes P450 and other proteins (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Matsubara et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nagao et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Guengerich, 2005</xref>). The structure of the FMN binding domain of human POR has been determined by x-ray crystallography (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>) and a more recent open conformation structure of POR shows potential interaction possibilities for redox partners (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aigrain et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD, OMIM: 613537 and 201750) is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, initially described in patients with altered steroidogenesis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck et al., 2004</xref>) followed by several reports with a broad spectrum of disorders (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Arlt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Fl&#252;ck, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck and Pandey, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Sproll, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burkhard et al., 2017</xref>). Sequencing of the POR gene revealed mutations in patients with disorders of steroid biosynthesis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2004</xref>). Afterward, many other laboratories reported mutations in POR in patients with steroidogenic disorders and/or bone malformation syndromes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Arlt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fukami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Fl&#252;ck, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Riddick et al., 2013</xref>). While initial studies on POR mutations focused on steroid metabolism, effects on other partner proteins like heme oxygenase and drug metabolizing P450s have also been studied (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicolo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2010</xref>). Large scale sequencing projects have identified many variations in the POR gene, in several different human sub-populations, and multiple variants have been implicated in altered drug metabolism (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicolo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2010</xref>). Since POR is involved in multiple steroid biosynthesis reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 proteins, a complex disorder of steroidogenesis is expected from mutations in POR (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Many POR variants found in patients as well as normal population have been tested for enzymatic activities (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adachi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Arlt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fukami et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Homma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pandey, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Sim et al., 2009</xref>). While mutations in POR can be found in all regions of the protein, based on analysis of previously identified mutations, some general observations can be made. Mutations found in the co-factor binding sites (FMN, FAD and NADPH) generally result in a severe form of the disease with the mutations causing loss of FMN or FAD showing most severe effects on activities of all supported redox partners. We have previously shown that aromatase (CYP19A1) activity responsible for conversion of androgens to estrogens (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) is more susceptible to changes in NADPH binding site mutations in POR (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck and Pandey, 2017</xref>). The studies described in this report were conducted by embedding POR and P450 proteins in liposomes followed by removal of detergents. In the current study, we have investigated effects of some mutations in the FMN binding domain and the hinge region of POR that facilitate interactions with redox partner proteins, including P450s, to transfer electrons from NADPH.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Role of POR in the steroid hormone biosynthesis. In the first steps of steroid biosynthesis, cholesterol is transported to mitochondrion by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Then, inside the mitochondria, the cholesterol is metabolized by CYP11A1 to pregnenolone, and adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase act as the redox mediators in this reaction. The pregnenolone produced in the mitochondria is further metabolized in the endoplasmic reticulum to downstream products 17OHPreg, DHEA, androstenedione or androstenediol; and then this process continues toward the production of testosterone in the Leydig cells of the testes. Testosterone is further metabolized to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the genital skin. In the placenta, DHEA is converted to androstenedione and then to testosterone, which is further metabolized to estrogens. In fetal liver, inactive precursor DHEAS is converted to 16&#945;DHEAS, which gets converted to 16&#945;DHEA in placenta to produce estrogens. The estrogen biosynthesis process requires CYP19A1 activity that is dependent on POR. The deficiency in POR can alter the enzymatic reactions of many cytochrome P450 enzymes and these changes can be variable based on structural properties of the mutation and nature of the redox partner.

Afterward, further conformation changes cause a closing of the POR structure and brings FAD and FMN closer for electron transfer from FAD to FMN. The FMN binding domain of POR interacts with P450s and other partner proteins through charge pair interactions involving arginine and lysine residues on P450s and aspartate and glutamate residues on POR. Considering the importance of FMN binding domain of POR in protein&#8211;protein interactions we investigated the effects of mutations in this region of POR for enzymatic activities on partner proteins. The mutations studied in this report are either located close to the FMN binding site of POR (A115V, T142A and Q153R) or in the putative hinge region (P284L) required for flexibility of POR to interact with redox partners. Using WT and variant POR and P450 proteins expressed in bacteria, we determined the enzymatic activities for metabolism of androstenedione by CYP19A1 and compared them with CYP3A4 activities which can bind and metabolize testosterone. Some very interesting and surprising findings were made from this study, including the severe effect of POR variant A115V which was previously suspected as a polymorphism (rs 199634961, <italic>POR<sup>&#8727;</sup>11</italic>) and shows variable activities (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Fl&#252;ck, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burkhard et al., 2017</xref>). The POR variants P284L was found to result in severe loss of activities while mutation Q153R showed an activating effect. These results provide further insights into the interactions of POR with its redox partner proteins and help in establishing the genotype-phenotype correlations of POR variants and their metabolic effects. Loss of flavins could explain differences in activities for some mutations. Since the A115 and T142 residues are near the FMN binding site, a loss of FMN binding could be expected. However, both these mutants also showed loss of FAD binding indicating that binding of FMN may influence FAD binding. A similar relationship of FAD binding to FMN binding has been observed by <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. (1989)</xref> in experiments with rat POR. Several different proposals could be made to explain this observation. It is likely that binding of FMN is required for recognition of FAD by POR. An FMN dependent change if affinity of POR for FAD is possible (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 1989</xref>). The observation of <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kurzban and Strobel (1986)</xref> that FAD comes of more readily from POR compared to FMN seems to support the hypothesis that affinity of POR for FMN is higher. Mutations in the FAD binding domain of POR result in complete loss of activities (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fl&#252;ck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Fl&#252;ck, 2013</xref>). For some POR mutations a rescue of activities may be possible by flavin supplementation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Marohnic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nicolo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to estrone (E1), testosterone to estradiol (E2) and 16-hydroxytestosterone to estriol (E3) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 1994</xref>) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The CYP19A1 reaction requires multiple interactions with POR, and therefore, changes in redox partner binding sites on either CYP19A1 or POR may alter enzymatic activities. To test this hypothesis, we selected several mutations located in the FMN binding domain and the hinge region of POR, which facilitate interactions with partner proteins. One of the variants studied here, the A115V was first identified in a patient (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). The patient harboring A115V mutation was from Caucasian background and had Beare&#8211;Stevenson syndrome, which results in skeletal as well as genital abnormalities (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Przylepa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). A rugated labia majora and anteriorly placed anus had been reported but no steroid or biochemical analysis were available (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Structure analysis of A115V mutation revealed hydrogen bonding interaction between A115 and V85 and Y87 residues located on the neighboring beta sheet, implicating its role in structural stability (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). Previously <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al.

Our results indicate the severe loss of CYP19A1 aromatization activity could lead to abnormal steroid metabolism in patients with A115V mutation in POR gene. A detailed steroid analysis of such patients would be necessary to confirm this linkage.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Location of amino acid changes in POR described in current study.

In previous reports a 97% loss of CYP1A2 activity and complete loss of CYP2C19 activity has been reported by <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al. (2008)</xref> for the T142A mutation, while a 40&#8211;50% loss of CYP17A1 activity was observed by <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2005)</xref>. The patient with T142A mutation of POR had low serum levels of testosterone; and androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were low (but present) and did not improve upon ACTH stimulation, consistent with loss of CYP17A1 activities (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Augarten et al., 1992</xref>). This is consistent with crucial physiological role of androgen regulating enzyme CYP17A1, where complete loss of activities is lethal. The mutation T142A (<italic>POR<sup>&#8727;</sup>12</italic>) is located next to the Y143 residue which is crucial for the FMN binding to POR, and its mutation may affect FMN binding (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>). Consistent with this we found a severe loss of flavins in the T142A variant of POR (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). Loss of flavins could also make subtle conformation changes in POR and as these changes would be in the FMN binding domain of POR which interacts with redox partners via shape as well as charge-based protein&#8211;protein interactions, a change in activities of redox partners is expected. Severe loss of both CYP19A1 as well as CYP3A4 activities due to T142A mutation indicates a major impact on both steroid and drug metabolism in the patients carrying this mutation.</p><p>The mutation Q153R was first described from an Algerian family and was the product of an abortion carried out at 22 weeks of gestation due to information from an ultrasonographic examination which showed craniosynostosis with bilateral radiohumeral synostosis, bowing of long bones, and arachnodactyly (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). The karyotype of the fetus was 46,XY, and no abnormalities in external genitalia were detected. Steroids were not measured, but, since ABS was suspected, a GC-MS analysis of liver tissue was performed which indicated &#8220;substantially increased&#8221; lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol. In previous studies, the Q153R (<italic>POR<sup>&#8727;</sup>13</italic>) variant of POR was found to retain only 25&#8211;30% of WT activity in assays with CYP17A1 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) but has shown higher activities in other assays (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2008</xref>). A higher level of activity with CYP19A1 observed with this mutation would not indicate any damaging effect on a 46,XY fetus, but GC-MS analysis indicates this mutation may affect CYP51A1 activity. The Q153 residue is located at the surface of POR and may have a direct role in the interactions with the redox partners (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>). However, higher levels of activities observed in both the CYP19A1, as well as the CYP3A4 assays indicate that the impact of Q153R variant may be selective for individual P450 enzymes with some being adversely affected while others would be activated due to potentially better protein&#8211;protein interactions. The activating effect of Q153R variant of POR can be useful for potential biotechnological applications where commercial production of expensive chemicals through P450 mediated biotransformation is the preferred method of manufacturing.</p><p>The last mutation studied in this report, the P284L (rs 72557938), is located in the hinge region of POR, that is important for domain movements and efficient interactions between FMN and FAD binding regions and for the transfer of electrons from FAD to FMN (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref></bold>). In the sequencing study by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2008)</xref> the P284L mutation was present at an allele frequency of 0.003 in Chinese American population and in the currently available ExAc dataset containing 121000 samples it is present at an allele frequency of 0.00004132. A 54% loss of 17-hydroxylase activity was reported by Huang et al but the 17,20 lyase activity of CYP17A1 was 82% of the WT POR (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). No loss of flavin content was observed in the P284L variant which indicates altered inter as well as intra molecular protein&#8211;protein interactions may be responsible for the loss of activities in both the CYP19A1 as well as the CYP3A4 assays. Since the hinge region of POR is important for the domain motions to bring the FMN closer to the FAD for the transfer of electrons, a change in this region may affect the efficiency of electron transport process in POR, and therefore, affect the activities of partner proteins. It is possible that some redox partners of POR may experience greater impact on their catalytic activities while others may retain close to WT activities depending on their mode of interaction with POR.</p><p>In these studies, we have used POR and P450 proteins embedded in liposomes and removed the detergents used for solubilization of POR and P450s by treatment with biobeads (Bio-Rad Corp., Hercules, CA, United States) which provided a robust assay system. These results also emphasize the need for assay of POR variants with different partner proteins and substrates to accurately determine the impact of individual variations. The major polymorphism observed in POR is A503V (rs 1057868, <italic>POR<sup>&#8727;</sup>28</italic>), which is present in about 27% of all alleles and shows wide variability across different populations (Caucasian and Hispanic populations: 31%; Pacific Islanders: 48%; Asian populations 35%; Japanese, 40%; African Americans 16%) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burkhard et al., 2017</xref>). There is some evidence of <italic>POR<sup>&#8727;</sup>28</italic> allele influencing the activities of drug metabolizing enzymes but more direct evidence is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Fl&#252;ck, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Sproll, 2014</xref>). As seen with the P284L mutation, there may be variations of POR in apparently normal populations with potentially disease causing effects. Since POR variations have now been linked to the metabolism of several drugs and steroids, it may be prudent to include the sequencing of POR gene while looking for genetic causes of altered drug or steroid metabolism. A detailed examination of the polymorphic variants of POR would be required to estimate their damaging effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Participated in research design: SU, SP, and AP.
