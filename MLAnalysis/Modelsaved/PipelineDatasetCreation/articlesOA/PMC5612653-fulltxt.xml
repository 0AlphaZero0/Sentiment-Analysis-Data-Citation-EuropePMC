Quinone reductase inducing bioactivity, an estimate of anti-cancer chemopreventive potential, of the extracts was measured using a hepa1c1c7 murine cell line. Extracts from root tissues were significantly different from other tissues and contained high levels of gluconasturtiin and glucoerucin. Targeted gene expression analysis on glucosinolate biosynthesis revealed that broccoli root tissue has elevated gene expression of <italic>AOP2</italic> and low expression of <italic>FMOGS-OX</italic> homologs, essentially the opposite of what was observed in broccoli florets, which accumulated high levels of glucoraphanin. Broccoli floret tissue has significantly higher nitrile formation (%) and epithionitrile specifier protein gene expression than other tissues.

Therefore, only a portion of <italic>Brassica</italic> crop biomass is harvested and utilized for food and feed. For example, broccoli florets represent less than 10% of total aerial biomass of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Can residual biomass after harvest of <italic>Brassica</italic> vegetables be utilized to yield value-added co-products?</p><p>Broccoli and cauliflower production values in United States of America (USA) during 2015 were $1.035 billion and $371 million, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Broccoli production in 2015 was 17.6 million tons [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Assuming only 10% of broccoli is used for food, then about 158 million tons of by-product of broccoli was produced at 2015 in USA. Like broccoli, cauliflower and other <italic>Brassica</italic> crops also have considerable amounts of unused by-products after harvest. Despite the potential economic value of these by-products, there is little information available on the nutritional value and other potentially beneficial bioactivities of unharvested tissues of broccoli (leaves and roots) and collards (roots) due to limited interest in these non-edible tissues. However, these tissues can potentially be utilized as anti-bacterial, anti-nematodal, allelopathic (weed management) agents, or feedstocks for extraction of pharmaceutical products [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Glucosinolates are sulfur and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites found primarily in the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>. Glucosinolate biosynthesis occurs from amino acid precursors through chain elongation, core structure formation, and side-chain modifications [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among these glucosinolates, biosynthesis of side-chain groups and subsequent modification is attributed to differences in bioactivity among the glucosinolates, and more specifically, their hydrolysis products. Sulforaphane (SF) is one of the most potent chemopreventive agents in broccoli, hydrolyzed from its precursor, glucoraphanin, by myrosinase [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The biosynthesis of glucoraphanin is derived from methionine and goes through multiple steps to generate the methylthioalkyl glucosinolates. A subclade of flavin-monooxygenases (<italic>FMOGS-OX</italic><sub><italic>1-5</italic></sub>) catalyze the conversion of methylthioalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoerucin) into methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoraphanin) [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase called <italic>AOP2</italic> has been demonstrated to control the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoraphanin) to alkenyl glucosinolates (e.g. gluconapin) [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, in order to accumulate glucoraphanin, the precursor to SF, the gene expression level of <italic>FMOGS-OX</italic><sub><italic>1-5</italic></sub> and <italic>AOP2</italic> should theoretically be high and low, respectively.</p><p>Glucosinolates themselves are not bioactive compounds. It is their hydrolysis products, formed by the removal of the glucose moiety by the endogenous enzyme, myrosinase, that have been reported to possess many bioactivities, including cancer-prevention, biofumigation, and anti-microbial activities [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185112.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The chemical structure of these hydrolysis products depends on the structure of the glucosinolate side-chain and reaction conditions such as pH, concentration of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and presence/absence of specifier proteins, such as epithiospecifier protein (ESP) [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are a number of potential specifier proteins, including the <italic>epithiospecifier modifier 1</italic> (<italic>ESM1</italic>) gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which encodes a protein shown to inhibit function of ESP, leading to increased isothiocyanate production from glucosinolate hydrolysis [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the absence of specifier proteins, the addition of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions also promotes nitrile formation [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nitriles are weak chemopreventive compounds compared to the isothiocyanates like sulforaphane (SF) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC).</p><p>In the past few decades, research on glucosinolates in crop plants has increased following the discovery of their putative role as cancer-prevention agents, primarily due to their induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, among other beneficial bioactivities [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Quinone reductase (QR), a phase II enzyme, is present in mammalian tissues and has been used as a biomarker of anticarcinogenic activity from <italic>Brassica</italic> crops [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. QR acts as a catalyst in the conversion of reactive and toxic quinones into stable and non-toxic hydroquinones, reducing oxidative cycling [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The health benefits of <italic>Brassica</italic> vegetables are strongly associated with hydrolysis products created from glucosinolates by endogenous myrosinase. Isothiocyanate hydrolysis products in particular, including SF, PEITC, erucin, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), have been reported as quinone reductase enzyme inducers [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185112.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we hypothesize that the differences in glucosinolate composition between <italic>B</italic>. <italic>oleracea</italic> subspecies, as well as between the various tissues in a given subspecies, would correlate with changes in expression of genes associated with side-chain modifications. If we understand how this critical step of glucosinolate biosynthesis differs among various glucosinolate-containing plant species/subspecies and plant tissues, we may be able to manipulate glucosinolate composition for the benefit of the grower (reduced pest damage) or for human/animal health.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to determine the composition of glucosinolates, their hydrolysis products, and health promoting bioactivity among different tissues from various broccoli and collards cultivars. In addition, comparison of the gene expression and glucosinolate profiles was performed in an effort to provide important information about the genetic regulatory mechanism that may be used to manipulate glucosinolate concentration for the improvement of human health promoting bioactivity or other agronomic purposes. In order to address these objectives, we used microfluidic high-throughput reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis using the Fluidigm system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Broccoli and collard cultivation</title><p>For this experiment, commercially available broccoli cultivars in the USA, &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; and &#8216;Sultan&#8217;, were chosen (Sakata Seed America, Salinas, CA). Two broccoli accessions originating from Italy were obtained using the USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) database: &#8216;Broccoli Neri (PI662531)&#8217;, and &#8216;Broccoli Grande Precoce (PI662712). We also included a doubled haploid line called &#8216;VI-158&#8217;, originally procured from Dr. Mark Farnham at the USDA-ARS U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina. Five collard accessions were obtained from the USDA GRIN: PI143351 (originating from Iran), PI171531 (from Turkey), PI181720 (from Syria), PI204563 (Commonly cultivated in the USA), and PI662840 (from Portugal).

After three weeks, the flats were moved to raised beds outside to allow for acclimation to the outdoor environment before being transplanted into the field at the University of Illinois Vegetable Research Farm (40&#176; 04&#8242;38.89&#8243; N, 88&#176; 14&#8242; 26.18&#8243; W). Transplanting took place between July 6 and July 20 in 2012. Varieties were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. All plants were supplied with supplemental water via aerial irrigation as needed in the first 30 days after transplanting. Mechanical and hand weeding was done as needed. Various broccoli and collards tissues harvested as bulked samples from five whole plants were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported on dry ice from the field to -20&#176;C storage until those samples could be lyophilized. For sampling of broccoli florets, one quarter of the florets from each head were harvested from five plants for each biological replication. For sampling of the broccoli and collard leaves, three different leaf positions (one each from upper, middle, and bottom) were harvested from five plants for each biological replication. For sampling of broccoli and collard roots, whole taproots were harvested from five plants for each biological replication. After freeze-drying, samples were ground to a fine powder with coffee grinders and stored at -20&#176;C until analyses were conducted.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Analysis of glucosinolates</title><p>Glucosinolate contents were quantified according to Ku et al.

Freeze-dried floret, leaf, and root powder samples (200 mg) were placed in a 15 mL centrifuge tube and mixed with 2 mL of 70% methanol. After heating at 95&#176;C for 10 min in a heating block followed by cooling on ice, 0.5 mL of internal standard were added. For the internal standard, 1 mM sinigrin was used in the case of broccoli samples, while 1 mM glucosinalbin was used for collards samples. The absence of those internal standards in each corresponding crop was confirmed by preliminary experiments. After adding internal standards to the tubes, the tubes were vortexed, followed with centrifugation at 8,000 &#215; g for 5 min at 4&#176;C and the supernatants were collected. The pellets were re-extracted with 2 mL 70% methanol at 95&#176;C for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with the previously collected supernatant. One mL of pooled extract was transferred into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and proteins were precipitated by adding 0.15 mL of a 1:1 mixture of 1 M lead acetate and 1 M barium acetate. After centrifuging at 12,000 &#215; g for 1 min, all supernatants were loaded onto a column containing 1 M NaOH and 1 M pyridine acetate-charged DEAE Sephadex A-25 resin (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Desulfation was conducted by adding arylsulfatase (<italic>Helix pomatia</italic> Type-1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 18 h at room temperature, and the desulfo-glucosinolates were eluted with 3 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O and filtered by 0.45 &#956;m nylon syringe filter. The filtered sample (100 &#956;L) was injected into an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Freeze dried and powdered sample (50 mg) was placed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and 1 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added. After 24 h of hydrolysis at room temperature in darkness followed by adding 150 &#956;L of phenyl isothiocyanate (1 mg/mL, to check consistency of GC analysis), vortexing, and centrifugation at 12,000 &#215; g for 5 min, 500 &#956;L of the aqueous layer was taken and mixed with 500 &#956;L of dichloromethane in a Teflon centrifuge tube. After vigorous vortexing for 30 s and centrifugation at 12,000 &#215; g for 3 min, the dichloromethane layer containing glucosinolate hydrolysis products was transferred into a vial and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890N, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with flame ionization detector and HP-5 capillary column (30 m &#215; 0.32 mm &#215; 0.25 &#956;m thickness). The injector and detector temperatures were 200&#176;C and 280&#176;C, respectively, and nitrogen was used for the carrier gas at a flow rate 6 mL/min in splitless mode. The oven temperature was initiated at 40&#176;C, held for 5 min, increased up to 260&#176;C at a rate of 10&#176;C/min, and maintained for 10 min.

Freeze-dried sample powder (50 mg) was hydrolyzed in a 4 mL amber vial with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) liner by adding 3.0 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 24 h at room temperature in darkness. In order to capture and carry volatile and water-insoluble hydrolysis products, 1 mL dimethysulfoxide (DMSO) was added and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. An aliquot (1.5 mL) was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube, and after centrifugation at 12,000 &#215; g for 5 min, the supernatant plant extract was used for the QR assay.

This discrepancy is probably due to its lower solubility in water compared to other compounds, which has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185112.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

For by-product utilization, lack of water solubility of PEITC should be considered as an important factor. The primary glucosinolate HPs in broccoli and collard roots were erucin and PEITC. These volatile hydrolysis products in broccoli and collard roots may be associated with plant-pathogen soil interactions. A recent publication has reported that AITC altered soil microbial community composition [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This suggests that non-synthetic anti-microbial agents can be developed from broccoli and collards root materials.</p><p>For SF, conversion rate from glucoraphanin averaged 108% from floret and leaf tissues in broccoli and collard (n = 13, two very high outlying conversion rates were excluded due to very low glucoraphanin concentrations). Surprisingly conversion of glucoraphanin to SF was 213% from broccoli and collard roots. This is likely due to to the reported conversion of erucin to SF following hydrolysis [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The conversion rate of glucoraphanin to SF (SF concentration / glucoraphanin concentration) was significantly correlated with glucoerucin concentration in root tissues from both broccoli and collard (r = 0.691, p = 0.027, n = 10).

Relatively low QR inducing activity of root samples despite of high glucosinolate and HP concentration could be explained by volatility of HPs in root samples.

The Fluidigm system allows us to measure gene expression for a selected gene set (up to 96) and samples (up to 96) with far greater ease and speed compared to conventional RT-qPCR with 384 well microtiter plates.

Therefore, this system could be an excellent tool for scientists to conduct targeted transcriptomics research.</p><p>Given our results, broccoli and collard roots can be good sources for glucosinolates with favorable molecular conditions for isothiocyanate production during hydrolysis by endogenous myrosinase, if desired (very low ESP activity and high <italic>ESM1</italic> expression). There has been some research aimed at producing glucosinolates using a hairy root culture system with broccoli and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185112.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

These methods may be a more feasible practice to utilize root tissue for bioactive glucosinolate production. However, research using the broccoli hairy root culture system has focused on indole glucosinolate production, although we have shown broccoli roots to have high concentrations of gluconasturtiin and glucoerucin. Modifying the broccoli hairy root culture system to include production of these aromatic and aliphatic glucosinolates requires more research. Harvesting broccoli or collard roots for bioactive compound extraction may not be feasible due to harvest and labor costs. Broccoli and collard roots have many small or hairy roots, meaning only a portion of the root biomass is available for harvesting in the form of the taproot. Considering the harvesting and transporting of these by-products also requires labor and efforts, by-product utilization for on-site control of soil-born disease may be feasible utilization. In a previous study, broccoli residue incorporation into the soil effectively reduced Verticillium wilt incidence on cauliflower and eggplant [<xref rid="pone.0185112.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185112.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
