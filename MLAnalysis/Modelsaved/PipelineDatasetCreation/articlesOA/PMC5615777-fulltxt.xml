<bold>Background:</bold> Aniridia is a disorder predominately caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the
<italic>PAX6</italic> gene, which is a transcriptional regulator necessary for normal eye and brain development. &#160;The ocular abnormalities of aniridia have been well characterized, but mounting evidence has implicated brain-related phenotypes as a prominent feature of this disorder as well.&#160; Investigations using neuroimaging in aniridia patients have shown reductions in discrete brain structures and changes in global grey and white matter.&#160; However, limited sample sizes and substantive heterogeneity of structural phenotypes in the brain remain a challenge.&#160;
<bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we examined brain structure in a new population sample in an effort to add to the collective understanding of anatomical abnormalities in aniridia.&#160; The current study used 3T magnetic resonance imaging to acquire high-resolution structural data in 12 persons with aniridia and 12 healthy demographically matched comparison subjects.&#160;
<bold>Results:</bold> We examined five major structures: the anterior commissure, the posterior commissure, the pineal gland, the corpus callosum, and the optic chiasm.&#160; The most consistent reductions were found in the anterior commissure and the pineal gland; however, abnormalities in all of the other structures examined were present in at least one individual.&#160;
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that the anatomical abnormalities in aniridia are variable and largely individual-specific.&#160; These findings suggest that future studies investigate this heterogeneity further, and that normal population variation should be considered when evaluating structural abnormalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>PAX6</kwd><kwd>neuroanatomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Sharon Stewart Aniridia Research Trust</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the Sharon Stewart Aniridia Research Trust to AMB and JDL.</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p>We would like to thank our reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions that contributed towards an improvement of the manuscript.

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Aniridia is best characterized by the lack of or hypoplasia of the iris (for which it is named), in addition to several other ocular abnormalities, which culminate in reduced visual acuity
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, individuals usually develop multiple ocular abnormalities, such as keratopathy, corneal vascularization and opacification, glaucoma, anterior chamber fibrosis, and cataracts
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Although aniridia is most well known for its ocular phenotypes, the condition has a number of other abnormalities, including sensory, neural, cognitive, and auditory processing abnormalities
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>The development of aniridia in humans is linked to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations to the
<italic>PAX6</italic> gene, which encodes a highly conserved transcription factor critical for normal eye and neural development
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The vast majority of aniridia cases (80%) are associated with mutations in
<italic>PAX6</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Functional mutations in this gene can be either sporadic or familial, and causal mutations in aniridia encompass a large number of variants. The majority of these variants are nonsense mutations, which lead to a premature termination codon, and are found across the
<italic>PAX6</italic> locus
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.
<italic>PAX6</italic> is expressed in the developing eye, brain, and spinal cord, and is required for aspects of anatomical and functional development of the central nervous system (CNS) and visual system
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Within the CNS,
<italic>PAX6</italic> is involved in patterning, regionalization, and the formation of neural circuits
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Previous studies of patients with aniridia using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown abnormalities in major fiber tracts and subcortical structures of the brain, including the anterior commissure
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, posterior commissure
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, corpus callosum
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, pineal gland
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, optic chiasm
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and olfactory bulb
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The most consistently reported abnormalities are found in the anterior commissure, pineal gland, and optic chiasm; abnormalities in the posterior commissure, corpus callosum, and olfactory bulb are found in fewer than 35% of patients examined. Additionally, studies have shown conflicting results regarding grey matter volume differences in aniridia, with reports of both increases and decreases in whole brain grey matter
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Most recently, it has been shown that there is an accelerated age-related increase in cortical thinning of the inferior parietal lobe and prefrontal/premotor areas in both brain hemispheres in aniridia compared to healthy patients
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>While several previous studies have investigated structural brain abnormalities in patients with aniridia, the variance in brain structures affected and extent of anatomical abnormalities is high. The variance observed in the published literature may be interpreted as a result of genetic differences in patient samples, either directly related to disease-causing mutations or modifier effects caused by genomic differences across subjects. Most of the previous studies examining structural changes in the brain of aniridia patients have focused on a subset of the structures we examined, but only one other study has looked at all five together
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, we used a 3T magnet instead of a 1.5T, which allows for higher resolution structural images of small structures such as interhemispheric commissures, allowing us to more reliably identify subtle difference. The current study sought to investigate gross anatomical correlates of aniridia in a new population sample with varied
<italic>PAX6</italic> mutations. Results from this study will serve as a comparison for previous studies, as well as contribute to what is known about the distribution of neuroanatomical phenotypes in the aniridia population as a whole. Overall, this will serve to clarify the extent of abnormalities in five brain structures in persons with aniridia with varied mutations to the
<italic>PAX6</italic> gene and contribute to our global understanding of the neuroanatomical characteristics of the disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 14 individuals with aniridia and 15 healthy comparison individuals participated in the current study. Data from two participants with aniridia were excluded from analyses (due to a significant artifact and missing data). One healthy subject was excluded due to an anatomical abnormality, and two others were excluded because they did not match the demographic profile of an individual in the aniridia group included in the analysis. The remaining 12 individuals with aniridia (7 females; 3 left handed; mean age=36 years, SD=15) and 12 age- and gender-matched comparisons (7 females; 4 left handed; mean age=35 years, SD=14) were included in the analyses (

Participants with aniridia were recruited through the Aniridia Foundation International Conference held in 2011 in Athens, Georgia and had been clinically diagnosed with aniridia. Exonic sequencing of the
<italic>PAX6</italic> gene (11p13) (OMIM: 607108) was conducted at the University of Georgia, as previously described

<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Three of the participants with aniridia belonged to the same family, and all other participants included in the analyses were unrelated. After written informed consent was obtained and MRI safety screening was conducted, all participants completed an MRI session in which a high-resolution structural scan was obtained.

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>) run on a MATLAB software platform (MATLAB Release 2015b; The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). SPM software was used to compare aniridia subjects to their demographically matched comparison subjects. DICOM files were additionally analyzed using Osirix Lite DICOM viewer (OsiriX v5.6,;Pixmeo SARL, Bernex, Switzerland) and all images generated using this software. All 24 individual subjects&#8217; data were visually inspected for gross anatomical abnormalities in two independent sessions by the first author (MG) and a radiologist (JDW). Regions of interest were determined by literature review to include the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, pineal gland, corpus callosum, and optic chiasm. The only structure that has been examined in the literature that we did not examine in our population was the olfactory bulb. This structure was excluded because both evaluators independently determined that the olfactory bulb could not be reliably assessed in the current data set. The radiologist was blinded to patient status and genotype during visual examination of scans. No new regions of interest were determined during both the first and second examination of the scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Corpus callosum quantitative analysis</title><p>Following the approach of Free and colleagues (2003), the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum was quantified at the mid-sagittal plane
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In order to align all MR images to the mid-sagittal plane, individual T1 images were reconstructed in AFNI software
<sup><xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and aligned manually using the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, and interhemispheric landmarks. On the mid-sagittal image, the corpus callosum was manually traced and the number of voxels within this delineation was counted. Additionally, the structural volumes were automatically segmented with FreeSurfer software (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</ext-link>) to obtain estimates of total grey and white matter volume
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The ratio of corpus callosum area to total cerebral volume was calculated to control for differences in overall brain size (see

All neuroanatomical results are reported in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, which includes subject demographics and mutations. We analyzed five major brain structures that demonstrate clear anatomical abnormalities in aniridia patients. Our study showed that all 12 aniridia patients had a reduced anterior commissure when compared to their demographically matched healthy comparisons, as shown in

We saw a reduced anterior commissure in two of the healthy comparisons and a reduced posterior commissure in one healthy comparison. The pineal gland showed the most variance within the healthy comparison group with one subject with no visible pineal gland, three healthy comparisons with slightly reduced to reduced pineal glands, and eight healthy comparisons with normal pineal glands. All healthy comparisons had normal corpus callosums and optic chiasms. A full description of which structures showed abnormalities in both the aniridia and healthy comparison groups are reported in

Grey matter volume and total brain volume averages are indistinguishable between aniridia and healthy comparison subjects. There is a slight reduction in the aniridia patients compared to healthy individuals in average corpus callosum area as well as white matter volume and ratio of corpus callosum area to whole brain volume. However, these are just trends and no measurement was statistically significant, which can also be explained by a high degree of variability within the aniridia population.

Previous studies have reported changes in the anterior commissure with some cases described as reductions and others reported as complete absence of the structure
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Consistent with these reports, our study identified a reduction in the anterior commissure in all 12 aniridia patients, but none of the patients lacked the structure. The posterior commissure has also been evaluated in previous studies: one study reports that it is present in all subjects while the other study presented evidence that one patient had an absent structure while the others had normal posterior commissures
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We found no individuals lacking the posterior commissure, and fewer than half of our aniridia patients seemed to have an abnormal structure. Interestingly though, it seems as if one patient exhibited a reduction of the posterior commissure at the midline with thickened bundles adjacent to the midline suggesting that commissure formation was incomplete. PAX6 has a known role in formation of the posterior commissure in rodents, so it is likely that this phenotype in humans is a direct consequence of PAX6 deficiency
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In agreement with previous findings, we also see abnormal or absent pineal glands in our entire patient population. This finding is consistent with sleep regulation deficits in persons with aniridia reported in other studies
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The corpus callosum has also been a structure commonly evaluated in aniridia MRI studies, with many reporting reductions in corpus callosum thickness and severe agenesis

<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, we found very few patients present with a reduced or abnormal corpus callosum, and propose that the slight reduction we see in three of our patients falls within normal population variation. Unlike most previous studies, we examined the optic chiasm, and found a reduction in the structure in more than half of our patients. This reduction could be a developmental consequence of the disorder or a progressive phenotype associated with reduced levels of PAX6. Anatomical abnormality findings seem to be highly dependent on population sample, and a larger collective sample in the literature will help us get closer to understanding common disease traits and variation. </p><p>As described above, we observed a reduction in the anterior commissure in every patient we evaluated and a reduction of the posterior commissure in five patients, but no individuals completely lacked either structure. Our study utilized a high resolution 3T MRI for data acquisition, while most other studies used a 1.5T MRI. Signal to noise ratio from 3T MRIs are almost double that of 1.5T MRIs, which will lead to an improved image quality and resolution from the 3T magnet
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We propose that the difference in observing a reduced versus absent anterior/posterior commissure may be due to a difference in scan resolution between images captured from a 3T versus 1.5T magnet. We see multiple patients in our group who have a severely reduced anterior commissure, and identifying this abnormality using a 1.5T magnet may be more difficult than when using a 3T. Additionally, the posterior commissure is smaller than the anterior commissure naturally, making it more difficult to distinguish between presence and absence in a scan. Lower scan resolution may not capture small structures such as these commissures, especially if they are reduced in size, leading to a false judgment of their absence. </p><p>A recent study has found an age component to cortical thickness in aniridia patients when compared to healthy individuals. The study found that in patients with aniridia there is an accelerated reduction in cortical thickness of the inferior parietal lobe and prefrontal/premotor areas in both brain hemispheres
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Adding to this age component seen in the Yogarajah (2016) study, there are also population differences in brain anatomy, even within healthy groups, between younger subjects and older subjects
<sup><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Additionally, as we show in our study, there are anatomical abnormalities even within healthy, unaffected participants. This makes it vitally important for careful selection of comparison subjects, and presents a caveat for interpreting differences we see in this and other clinical populations. </p><p>In addition to abnormal structural findings in patient populations with aniridia, multiple studies have assessed volumetric differences in grey and white matter in the brains of aniridia versus healthy comparisons. Similar to the findings in gross structural differences, much variation exists between reports. Some studies show an increase in grey matter volume in aniridia patients compared to healthy control groups, while others find both increases and decreases depending on brain region
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Changes in white matter findings follow the same suit with some reports of reductions in white matter and others finding both reductions and increases
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Even more interestingly, structures, such as the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, and pineal gland, show no deviation from healthy in these group-wise comparisons. This suggests that either the abnormalities seen in these structures are not as common among aniridia patients as previously thought, or that the characteristics of anatomical changes observed in aniridia patients have a high degree of variability within the population. Due to the consistency of abnormalities in structures like the anterior commissure in our study, as well as others, we predict the latter explains this discrepancy. This explanation is supported by the consistency of our results from volumetric and visual inspection of the corpus callosum in the current dataset. It is also possible that the differences observed across and within studies of these structures are a result of scan resolution and inconsistency of structure localization or plane of imaging to capture them given their small size and overall individual anatomical variation. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study investigated anatomical brain abnormalities correlated to aniridia in a new population sample in an effort to serve as a comparison to previous studies. Our aim was to contribute to what is known about the distribution of neuroanatomical phenotypes in the aniridia population as a whole. Although we found similar neuroanatomical abnormalities as previous studies, we find the severity is not as great as previously reported. The anterior commissure and pineal gland seem to be the structures most affected in the aniridia patients we examined, and we do see abnormalities in the posterior commissure, corpus callosum and the optic chiasm, albeit at lower frequency than previously reported. We believe the neuroanatomical abnormalities seen in aniridia populations have a high level of variability, and future studies should be aimed at collecting more patient MRI scans so that the breadth of abnormalities can be assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval and consent</title><p>MRI sessions were completed after written informed consent was obtained and MRI safety screening was completed.

<underline>Introduction</underline>
</p><p> The introduction is fine and discusses the current literature. However, I would suggest to improve a bit the study question. The study question as it is used in the current version is very broad and does not come to the point (e.g.,"The current study sought to investigate gross anatomical correlates of aniridia in a new population sample. Results from this study will serve as a comparison for previous studies, as well as contribute to what is known about the distribution of neuroanatomical phenotypes in the aniridia population as a whole."). I would suggest to include a few statements what this new study will add to the literature and what the "problems" of the older studies are? In addition, it could be helpful for the reader to learn the very new and maybe innovative aspects of this study.</p><p>
<underline>Methods</underline>

Did they compare the patients only on a visual-descriptive basis or did they perform a statistical analysis (which I would suggest).

<italic>Introduction</italic>&#8221; section, that our study examined five structures shown to be abnormal in the aniridia population. Previous studies focused on only a subset of structures in each patient rather than all five.&#160; By examining all five structures in a new population of aniridia patients, we have added to the collective knowledge on structural brain abnormalities present within the disorder.&#160;&#160;</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>For this study, the structural changes in Table 1 were concluded by two independent reviews of the MRI scans using a visual-descriptive basis.&#160; The methods have been updated to clarify the visual-descriptive assessment.&#160;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Volumetric analysis was conducted for the corpus callosum using Freesurfer software and results have been added to the manuscript (see supplementary Table 1 and supplementary Figure 1). Findings from this volumetric analysis confirmed our structural examination of the corpus callosum for all subjects.&#160; We did not conduct quantitative volumetric analyses on the anterior and posterior commissures as these are relatively small structures and the plane of view was not consistent within all subjects. This is due to variation in slice location within each brain. Because of this we decided to rely on our visual-descriptive assessment of these two structures for our dataset. While not ideal, a visual-descriptive assessment of the anterior and posterior commissures is consistent with previous reports comparing these structures between PAX6 normal individuals and individuals with PAX6 mutations (e.g. Sisodiya et al. 2001; Abouzeid et al., 2009) and captures relative changes between these two groups.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Yes, our Methods section (MRI data analysis) has been revised to state how we determined regions of interest.&#160; We used literature review to define which structures would be examined, and had ourthe radiologist (JD) examined the MRI scans &#160;for identification of additional regions of interest.</p></list-item></list>

The title and abstract convey details appropriately.</p><p> I should say at the outset that I have no expertise in MRI methodology and cannot compare the techniques used here with those used elsewhere, including our own papers.</p><p> It is clear, however, that MRI has advanced technically to a significant extent since the first set of papers was published in 2001-3. We need to know how directly comparable the results are. Certainly Sisodiya et al. in 2001 (ref 17) Mitchell et al. and 2003 (ref 18) used voxel-based morphometry and less powerful MRI measurements but showed similar findings with observed reduction or absence of the anterior commissure and olfactory bulb (ref 17) and of the pineal (ref 18). The current study does not mention study of the olfactory bulb. Interestingly olfactory function was also shown to be reduced and very occasionally absent in the first study (ref 17). Reduced interhemispheric transfer is thought to underlie the observed auditory processing problems reported in children with aniridia in ref 19. The current study reported in this paper does not undertake functional smell or auditory tests. Although what seems to be the same cohort, judging by the reported mutations, has been studied by functional fMRI by Pierce et al (ref 24). Surprisingly this overlapping author group (with the current paper) reports an apparently increased functional connectivity in the patients studied in the current paper. The earlier studies by other groups do not look at these functional connectivity changes. It is regrettable that the later studies, including Yogarajah et al (ref 23) did not follow this up.</p><p> Otherwise the major findings are remarkably similar for this study and the previous studies to explore 12 or more cases. The controls in ref 17 and 18 are larger numbers (100) and not directly paired controls. The study in Ref 20 where the posterior commissure reduction was observed, only looked at the index case from three families with aniridia and PAX6 mutations. Reference 23 re-examines many of the same cases as Ref 17 and 18, but about a decade later and with more powerful MRI using surface-based morphometry. The reduced cortical measurements are more obvious in these older cases. The observed reduction of the optic chiasm reported here&#160; in 7/12 cases is an interesting new finding, first suggested in the one of the three families studied by Abouzeid et al, ref 20.</p><p> Minor comments
