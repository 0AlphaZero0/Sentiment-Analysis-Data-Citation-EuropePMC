To reduce potential study bias stemming from variability in factors such as sex, age, environment, and underlying disease, we recruited 18 to 29-year-old Chinese Han female students with similar lifestyles and levels of education from Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The inclusion criteria for volunteers were the absence of underlying diseases, chronic pain, and tobacco and alcohol abuse. Those who had taken painkillers within 1 month from the start of the study, had dermatitis, or were pregnant or lactating, and were excluded. Initially, 319 volunteers were included in the study. However, 10 dropped out of the study due to discomfort during blood collection, resulting in 309 volunteers in the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The flow diagram of the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e8149-g001"/></fig><p>To explore the influence of positive <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs on postoperative pain sensitivity, we recruited 578 Chinese Han female patients, with American Society of Anesthesiologists statuses of I or II, and aged 18 to 65 years, who were scheduled for elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. Patients with a history of chronic pain; severe cardiovascular diseases; diabetes mellitus; kidney or liver diseases; mental disorders; drug or alcohol addiction; communicating deficits; use of painkillers within 4 weeks before the start of the study; dermatitis, pregnancy, or lactation; or who refused participation in the study were excluded.

The day before the operation, the APS team visited the patients, conducted a simulation of PCA use, and instructed the patients in the use of the NRS. The patients were able to control analgesic consumption via a PCA pump according to their pain sensitivity. Parecoxib sodium (40&#8202;mg) was administered transvenously 15&#8202;minutes before starting the operation, and PCA (sufentanil [0.5&#8202;&#956;g/mL] and tramadol [5&#8202;mg/mL]) was initiated as soon as the operation had been completed. NRS (at rest and moving) was recorded 30&#8202;minutes, 9 to 12&#8202;hours, and 21 to 24&#8202;hours after surgery. The maximum NRS during the postoperative follow-up period was used in the final analysis. The 24-hour postoperative PCA consumption was also recorded.

This suggests that these 5 positive <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs may be associated with basic pain sensitivity. Furthermore, we confirmed that, among these 5 positive <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs, rs33985936 and rs13080116 are significantly associated with PCA consumption in patients after gynecological laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>To reduce the potential effect of several factors, such as disease, demographics, and the environment, which may influence pain,<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> we recruited healthy female college students, as they have a similar living environment and educational backgrounds, to identify positive SNPs. We also minimized potential bias by recruiting female patients undergoing the same type of surgery when assessing the association between these 5 positive SNPs and postoperative pain sensitivity.</p><p>The data obtained in the volunteers indicated that the 5 positive <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs were associated with basal pain sensitivity. Furthermore, the minor alleles of rs33985936 and rs13080116 (T and C, respectively) were associated with reduced D-PPT threshold. This indicated that subjects who carrying the minor allele of rs33985936 or rs13080116 might be more sensitive to pain. The minor alleles of rs11720988, rs11709492, and rs11720013 were associated with increased S-PPT threshold, indicating that subjects carrying minor alleles of these 3 SNPs might have lower pain sensitivity.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess possible association between <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs and postoperative pain sensitivity. In this study, the patients were provided with adequate postoperative pain control through flexible PCA; therefore, the 5 positive <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs were not significantly associated with NRS score of patients. However, there were differences in PCA requirements in patients with different genotypes of rs33985936 and rs13080116. The minor allele in rs33985936 was associated with an increase of postoperative PCA consumption of about 13.2%. As PCA opioid consumption represents the actual demand for relief of postoperative pain in surgical patients, and thus can be considered to reflect the postoperative pain in patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> we speculated that rs33985936 and rs13080116 might affect postoperative pain sensitivity in female patients after gynecological laparoscopic surgery. We found that the minor alleles of these <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs were indeed associated with increased postoperative pain sensitivity. We also observed that the minor allele of rs33985936 was associated with changes in pain sensitivity in patients, in the same as the direction as the changes in bias basic pain sensitivity observed in the volunteers.</p><p>Although linkage disequilibrium between rs33985936 and rs13080116 has been reported in the United States, Europe, and Australia,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> there have been no reports regarding these SNPs in the Chinese Han population. We demonstrated linkage disequilibrium between rs33985936 and rs13080116 in the Chinese Han female population (<italic>D</italic>&#8217;&#8202;=&#8202;0.886 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8202;=&#8202;0.721 in volunteers; and <italic>D</italic>&#8217;&#8202;=&#8202;0.969, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8202;=&#8202;0.760 in patients). Because rs13080116 is located in an intronic area, whereas rs33985936 is located in an exon and induces an amino acid substitution (Val909Ile), we will only consider the rs33985936 SNP in the following discussion.</p><p>Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9, encoded by <italic>SCN11A</italic>, is highly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons and is considered to be a key regulator of nociceptor excitability.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Recent studies in humans have indicated that Nav1.9 dysfunction caused by certain <italic>SCN11A</italic> variants associated with a series of pain disorders (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Previous studies have shown that gain-of-function mutations in <italic>SCN11A</italic> are been linked to painful peripheral neuropathy<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> and familial episodic pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> In fact, Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> have identified gain-of-function mutations in <italic>SCN11A</italic> (Arg225Cys and Ala808Gly) that increased electrical activity and promoted action potential firing in dorsal root ganglion neurons in 2 Chinese families with episodic pain. On the contrary, other studies have found that gain-of-function mutations (Leu811Pro and Leu1302Phe) in <italic>SCN11A</italic> lead to an inability to feel pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> These studies have demonstrated a role for Nav1.9 in human pain. However, in contrast to the rare variants that cause the pain disorders, other studies have suggested that more common SNPs in some genes can lead to quantitative rather than qualitative changes in pain sensitivity.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>SCN11A</italic> SNPs may also be involved in the regulation of pain sensitivity.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Variants of Nav1.9 that are associated with pain disorders: familial episodic pain, painful peripheral neuropathy, and congenital insensitivity to pain.

This variant was first reported in a Japanese family with childhood episodic pain syndrome, wherein the affected patients carried the Arg222His and Val909Ile mutations.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> However, functional analysis was not performed previously. The amino acid residue Val909 lies in the cytoplasmic loop between domain II and III of Nav1.9, and Val909Ile results in the changes in intermolecular force; in addition, this region becomes more closely structurally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which might affect the function of sodium channel Nav1.9. Furthermore, although the role of the cytoplasmic loop between domains II and III of the sodium channel is not clear, the dysfunctions in this region of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8, 2 other important sodium channels regulating pain, have been linked to human pain sensitivity. Specifically, Ala1073Val in Nav1.8 is associated with biased human pain sensitivity,<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> and gain-of-function changes in this region of Nav1.7 have been associated with painful diseases, such as inherited erythromelalgia (Del-Leu955, Arg1150Trp),<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (Arg996Cys and Val1298Asp),<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> and small fiber neuropathy (Met932Leu and Val991Ile).<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Based on these studies, we speculate that the amino acid substitution Val909Ile in Nav1.9 may increase postoperative pain sensitivity, potentially by increasing the excitability of nociceptive neurons resulting from structural and functional changes in the loop between domains II and III in Nav1.9.</p><p>Our study has some limitations.

Second, while rs33985936 (2725C &gt;T) leads to the amino acids change Val909Ile, the influence of rs33985936 on the electrophysiology of sodium channel Nav1.9 is yet unclear.
