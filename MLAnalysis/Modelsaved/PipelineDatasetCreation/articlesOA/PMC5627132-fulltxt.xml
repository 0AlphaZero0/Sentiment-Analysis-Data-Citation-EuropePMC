Setal discoid terminals occur only in males, and they have been previously associated with a long-term attachment to the female's back (elytra) during copulation and mate guarding. For the first time, we studied living males and females holding to female's elytra. Pull-off force measurements with a custom-made tribometer featuring a self-aligning sample holder confirmed stronger attachment to female elytra compared with glass in both males and females; corresponding to 45 and 30 times the body weight, respectively. In line with previous studies, males generated significantly higher forces than females on convex elytra and flat glass, 1.2 times and 6.8 times, respectively. Convex substrates like elytra seem to improve the attachment ability of rosemary beetles, because they can hold more strongly due to favourable shear angles of legs, tarsi and adhesive setae. A self-aligning sample holder is found to be suitable for running force measurement tests with living biological samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adhesive setae</kwd><kwd>attachment</kwd><kwd>copulation</kwd><kwd>discoid</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>sexual selection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Technion Gesellschaft e.V.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DTG Life Science Network fellowship</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Cooperation in Science and Technology</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000921</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECOST-STSM-TD0906-171113-036395</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>September, 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual selection is one of the agents that drive evolution, influencing biodiversity and survival of species [<xref rid="RSOS171108C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Female choice often favours conspicuous secondary sex traits in males [<xref rid="RSOS171108C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Size dimorphism, coloration, visual, acoustic and chemical signals are well-known features facilitating sexual selection in the animal kingdom [<xref rid="RSOS171108C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In leaf beetles (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), numerous species exhibit a distinct sexual dimorphism in tarsal adhesive setae [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Typical &#8216;mushroom-shaped&#8217; setae with discoid terminal elements are commonly found only in males, which are known to attach more strongly than females to smooth surfaces [<xref rid="RSOS171108C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These setae have been assumed to be adapted to hold onto the surface of the female's covering wing (elytra) during copulation and long-term mate guarding [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Male setae inspired the development of effective biomimetic mushroom-shaped adhesive microstructures [<xref rid="RSOS171108C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which were reported to adhere passively to flat, smooth substrates [<xref rid="RSOS171108C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the assumed adaptation of the male-specific adhesive setae to the attachment to female's elytra is not yet experimentally confirmed. This is caused by challenging execution and interpretation of experiments under nearly natural conditions. Furthermore, beetle attachment is highly complex, because six legs act in concert at four hierarchical levels (axially symmetric legs, tarsi, tarsomeres and adhesive setae). When natural counterparts like female elytra and male tarsal adhesive setae meet each other, two irregular surfaces having different physical and chemical properties form a contact. Numerous studies have been carried out during the past decades in order to understand the mechanisms of insect attachment. These studies considered single leg, tarsus and seta, as well as living beetles on artificial flat and fixed, natural plant leaf surfaces [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As previously suggested, the performance of single adhesive pads and legs is less efficient in isolated state, when compared with the contribution of all legs acting in concert [<xref rid="RSOS171108C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One may conjecture a differing performance of free-acting beetles under the field conditions compared with those in delimited laboratory studies.</p><p>The focused attachment mechanism that remains not fully understood is associated with the beetle interaction during mating and maintaining the copulation posture. The smooth or structured surface of female elytra has been thought to be selective for male-specific setae. Strongly adhering male beetles are expected to be more successful competitors and mates. A first approach to this problem was made with water beetles (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae) by using a balance [<xref rid="RSOS171108C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During copulation the male water beetle attached to the female's plane back surface by specific, sucker-shaped organs on three tarsomeres of each leg, resulting in species-specific pull-off forces between 24.0&#8201;mN in <italic>Hydaticus transversalis</italic> Pontoppidanto and 288.2&#8201;mN in <italic>Dytiscus marginalis</italic> L. [<xref rid="RSOS171108C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A hundred years later, force measurements in natural conditions at the organism level are still challenging.</p><p>In the light of the above, our study focused on the forces required to separate a male leaf beetle from the female elytra. To allow for proper measurements, we used a custom-made tribometer featuring a self-aligning sample holder, which has been successfully applied in the past for studies of synthetic surfaces, including beetle-inspired adhesives [<xref rid="RSOS171108C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This self-aligning holder allowed males to act freely, without influencing the alignment of their legs and tarsomeres. Thus, they could be studied for the first time in operation on the female's back. For comparison, females were pulled off from female's elytra, and both sexes were tested on glass. We were interested to answer the following questions. (1) Is the measurement device applicable to living biological samples? (2) Do males generate higher forces than females on female elytra, while excluding the interlocking of claws? Subsequently, can the present data confirm the assumed adaptation of the male-specific adhesive setae to the female's elytra? (3) Do relatively free-acting organisms in contact with natural, curved counterparts produce different forces than organisms in contact with artificial flat counterparts (e.g. on force platforms or in centrifugal force tests)?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Beetles</title><p>Shiny metallic green&#8211;red striped rosemary beetles <italic>Chrysolina americana</italic> L. were used as model organisms.

Mid legs were commonly pulled in the transverse direction to the longitudinal body axis, though they were also observed pushing and pulling laterally. Hind legs displayed repeated pushes and pulls in all directions, including the tarsus rotation at angles of up to 180&#176; (spot check). A single shear event started with the detachment of tarsus and extension of the leg away from the body axis. Then, the tarsus was brought in contact with the substrate, first with the basal tarsomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F6">figure 6</xref><italic>g</italic>). Owing to this procedure a single male hind tarsus could pull on the elytra at a distance of up to about 2.4&#8201;mm (spot check). This value is roughly estimated, because the three-dimensional character of motion made it rather challenging to measure. However, the duration of single shear movements of different legs on elytra and glass as well as a rough number of total shear events per individual during the 90&#8201;s of contact in a run could be defined (electronic supplementary material, figures S9, S10). The number of shear events did not influence the pull-off force significantly, as confirmed by linear regressions and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values close to 0 (electronic supplementary material, figure S9). Shear movements in males took longer than those in females (on elytra 5 and 4&#8201;s, on glass 7 and 3&#8201;s, respectively). Male mid and fore legs on glass pulled the longest period of time (9&#8201;s) compared with other runs.

Thus, rosemary beetles <italic>C. americana</italic> are well comparable with leaf beetles investigated in previous studies. The male mounts the female's dorsum, first grasping it with the fore legs, followed by mid and hind legs to get a firm hold. Behavioural observations have elucidated that Colorado potato beetle males may adhere to smooth female elytra during multiple and repeated matings as well as during the long-term mate guarding [<xref rid="RSOS171108C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We suggest a similar performance of rosemary beetles because of the analogue morphology and forces generated on smooth substrates. Differences in the attachment ability between males and females of chrysomelid beetles on smooth substrates have been previously reported [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In Colorado potato beetle males, the strong attachment on smooth glass and plastic surfaces was explained by the action of specialized tarsal setae with discoid terminals, presumably adapted to adhere to smooth female elytra during copulation [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, spatulate and discoid terminals in rosemary beetles, exhibit a similar width of 8.7 and 9.0&#8201;&#181;m, respectively, resulting in a similar resistance to detachment [<xref rid="RSOS171108C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Terminal parts of setae are responsible for the generation of friction and adhesion by forming intimate contact with the surface [<xref rid="RSOS171108C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The authors found a correlation between the friction force, generated by insects on various substrates, and the mean distance between the substrate and setal tips, assuming van der Waals forces to be the only interaction between the surfaces. Besides, the shape of setal tips is differently adapted to different surface roughness [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In dock leaf beetles, discoid setae were stiffer in the normal direction (0.7&#8201;Nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) than spatulate (0.4&#8201;Nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) or pointed ones (0.2&#8201;Nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) [<xref rid="RSOS171108C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This may imply that setal geometry and material property provide different adaptability to smooth and rough surfaces. In fact, softer terminals adjust better to surface irregularities [<xref rid="RSOS171108C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and dock leaf beetle's discoid setae adhered with the highest forces (919&#8201;nN), followed by spatulate (582&#8201;nN) and pointed ones (127&#8201;nN) on glass [<xref rid="RSOS171108C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The same behaviour is expected for rosemary beetles.</p><p>The self-aligning sample holder used in force measurements is found to be well suited to study such living biological samples as mating leaf beetles. Male rosemary beetles generated 1.2 and 6.8 times higher attachment forces as well as 1.5 and 7.9 times higher safety factors on female elytra and glass, respectively. Safety factors obtained with rosemary beetles on glass in the present pull-off experiment are 6.1&#8211;38 times lower than those previously generated by Colorado potato beetles and dock leaf beetles on a horizontal, flat smooth resin surface in centrifugal force tests [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, male rosemary beetles performed 6.8 and 7.9 times (force and safety factor, respectively) better than females on glass. This sexual difference is much higher than in Colorado potato beetles (1.1 and 1.3 times) and dock leaf beetles (0.8 and 2.0 times) on flat smooth resin in centrifugal force tests [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The body weight of females is significantly higher than that of males, partly because of the eggs' load. The attachment force of both males and females of <italic>C. americana</italic> is many times higher than the body weight corresponding to previously reported data for many species with hairy attachment systems, e.g. leaf beetles <italic>Chrysolina polita</italic> L., Chrysomelidae [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Pull-off of rosemary beetles from the female elytra resulted in a much better performance (compared with glass) with 2.3 times higher force and 2.9 times higher safety factor in males compared with females. Interestingly, females reliably attached to the female elytra as well, holding up to 34.3 times their own body weight, while lacking male-specific discoid setae presumably adapted for copulation and long-term mate guarding [<xref rid="RSOS171108C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The question arises as to how strongly a male must hold to the female elytra in order to keep attached despite intraspecific competition and female's movements. In this context, safety factors of up to 76.6 in males appear to be more advantageous than in females.</p><p>The better attachment performance on elytra could not be explained by the surface free energy of the substrates (18.5&#8201;mN&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on elytra, 55.7&#8201;mN&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on glass) resulting in generally better wettability of glass.

On the flat glass, the legs tend to be peeled off the surface (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F5">5</xref><italic>a</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F6">6</xref><italic>h</italic>), so only one tarsomere on each leg can actively resist separation, while on the convex female wings, all tarsomeres can act in concert when pulled in parallel to the elytra surface [<xref rid="RSOS171108C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This is in accord with previous findings that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, i.e. single adhesive pads and legs attach less efficiently when compared with the contribution of all legs acting in concert [<xref rid="RSOS171108C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this case, the friction forces, which can be quite high when governed by thin-film-based contact elements [<xref rid="RSOS171108C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], can dominate the process. The attachment improves on convex surfaces when the substrate is held between legs, applying higher pressure, as it was recently assumed for climbing frogs and longhorn beetles [<xref rid="RSOS171108C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, convex elytra aligned at an angle of about 127&#176; promote favourable shear angles of legs, tarsi and adhesive setae, and thus, larger friction and higher pull-off forces compared with those on flat glass.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><label>4.2.</label><title>Shear-induced attachment</title><p>In contrast to a previous statement that, in Colorado potato beetles, setae with discoid terminal plates do not require shearing for contact formation [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we observed that, in rosemary beetles, both males and females used shear movements of tarsomeres to get a hold. This supports the model of shear-induced attachment proposed recently [<xref rid="RSOS171108C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], as well as observations made with other animals [<xref rid="RSOS171108C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="RSOS171108C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The model demonstrates that an applied shear force results in a better alignment of the tarsal spatulae and in an increase of their contact area. On the other hand, shear movements occurred also in male discoid terminals, which is expected to be detrimental for their attachment ability based on previous reports on fibrillar adhesives with mushroom-shaped geometry of terminal tips [<xref rid="RSOS171108C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The contradiction is made even more pronounced because in our experiments the male beetles generated distinctly lower pull-off forces when they did not shear their feet. One possible reason for this discrepancy may be related to the fact that natural discoid terminals are slanted, with the disc being connected to the seta stem not in the centre, while artificial mushroom-shaped structures are axisymmetric, which presumably makes the biomimetic structures less resistant to shear load. Because males adhered more strongly than females on both flat glass and convex elytra while having less setae on their attachment pads (electronic supplementary material, table S2), we conclude that higher adhesion is generated in discoid than in spatulate terminals. Similarly, dock leaf beetle spatulate setae adhere less than discoid ones, as mentioned above [<xref rid="RSOS171108C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The proximal (first) tarsomere is set first in contact with the substrate and lifted first for detachment. Interestingly, the highest number of discoid setae occurs on the first tarsomere in males, while only tapered-lanceolate setae are covering it in females. That may be an explanation of the sexual differences in attachment to glass and elytra, assuming the first tarsomere mainly in contact on smooth, flat surfaces like glass. Here, the third tarsomeres and spatulae probably do not attach firmly and thus, do not contribute much to the attachment forces. On the convex substrate (elytra), tarsomeres align to the substrate while sheared due to their morphology and kinematics. As a consequence, the third tarsomere also contacts the surfaces, and pull-off forces increase. Because spatulate terminals are less favourable in attachment to smooth surfaces, pull-off forces in females on elytra are lower than those in males.</p><p>Interestingly, males produced the longest tarsal shear movements (on glass), while females' shear movements were shorter. One may conjecture that a proper hold leads to an increase in duration and a decrease in the number of single shear events. However, this consideration is not confirmed by the present study, because there was no significant correlation between the number of shear events and the measured pull-off force.</p><p>Since the leg positions greatly vary and continuously change during attachment, we assume that beetle attachment is dynamic rather than static in males and females. Forces measured in natural conditions of copulation posture are lower than those measured previously in other leaf beetles on artificial test substrates by using different test methods, e.g. in centrifugal force tests [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or in experiments with separate tarsal setae and pads [<xref rid="RSOS171108C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS171108C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Living beetles, walking and holding on natural substrates, probably do not apply their full attachment force. They may tune forces, depending on the situation, by the application of different portions of available setae (shearing) and single tarsomeres (rotation and twisting) (electronic supplementary material, Movie S11).</p><p>Shearing, twisting, rotation and lifting movements enable the distinct application of different terminal structures of setae on a single tarsus and tarsomere. Unlike previous statements that distal rather than proximal setae seem to play a more important role in the initiation of adhesion [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the present study revealed that the proximal setae in tarsomere are brought first in contact with the substrate. Additionally, our observations do not confirm that the tarsus easily buckles or bends by distal or lateral pushing, as it has been previously shown in dock leaf beetles, albeit in a more &#8216;artificial&#8217; situation than in this study [<xref rid="RSOS171108C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Rosemary beetles repeatedly pushed their feet, in particular those of the hind and mid legs. While shearing, the tarsi were not always held straight, but frequently at a curved and transverse position, or even rotated at 180&#176;.</p><p>Given that the diameter of setal shafts does not vary much (3.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.7&#8201;&#181;m, mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;s.d., <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;20), shorter setae are stiffer than longer ones. To this end, the distal setae, which are longer than proximal ones, deform easier when brought in contact. This helps in attachment, detachment and shearing that start and finish at proximal tarsomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><label>4.3.</label><title>Assortative mating</title><p>The present results exclude the effect of claw interlocking. However, it was repeatedly detected in several runs, in particular when a female attached to a female. Because females are larger than males, their legs span a wider distance, easily touching the wing's edge. Claw interlocking led to a tremendous increase of pull-off force. Such values were not considered in our present evaluations. However, it is worth mentioning that during long-term mating and mate guarding, claws add to a proper hold on female's back. Fore legs are shorter than other legs and grasp the edge of the pronotum, while hind legs are the longest ones and hook to the backmost elytra edge. The circle fitting the claw curvature (diameter of 122&#8201;&#181;m) corresponds very well to the circle that fits the elytra edge (diameter of 119&#8201;mm). Mid legs usually do not interlock with claws. The male's reliable contact and interlocking with female elytra first depends on the grasping ability of the legs, which is predominantly defined by the leg length. Trochanters and femuri of opposite legs are aligned to span over the elytra width, while tibae and tarsi are held in parallel to clamp the elytra in between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F5">figure 5</xref><italic>c</italic>&#8211;<italic>f</italic>). The total length of male trochanter and femur of 5.2&#8201;mm in fore, 4.8&#8201;mm in mid and 5.4&#8201;mm in hind legs (left and right leg pooled together) matches well the diameter of elytra cross section (6.2&#8201;mm). This allows deducing a size-assortative mating as previously reported for Colorado potato beetles [<xref rid="RSOS171108C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], whose females have been recorded to choose males according to their size and could show clear preference for individual males [<xref rid="RSOS171108C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this context, the surface of the elytra may also provide assortative properties [<xref rid="RSOS171108C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In rosemary beetles, the female elytra surface appeared smooth despite the presence of a few scratches, pores and nano-cones, which do not provide interlocking sites for claws, considering the claw dimension (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F2">2</xref><italic>i</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS171108F3">3</xref><italic>c</italic>). Moreover, we assume a coverage with epicuticular grease, because pores appear to be filled by a substance which may act as a coupling agent [<xref rid="RSOS171108C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, physico&#8211;chemical interactions between the layer covering the elytra and the adhesive tarsal secretion of the males can be expected. These interactions may be responsible for the formation and maintenance of proper adhesive contact of setae during copulation and mate guarding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion and outlook</title><p>The self-aligning sample holder used previously in measuring attachment forces in synthetic samples, allowed representative pull-off measurements with living adult rosemary beetles. Thus, the device is found to be suitable for future studies of biological samples. The strong attachment of males supports previous hypotheses on the adaptation of discoid terminals of tarsal adhesive setae to flat surfaces and long-term attachment during copulation and mate guarding. However, females also generated considerable pull-off forces on elytra, suggesting the ability of spatulate setae to operate well in attachment on convex substrates, including stems and leaves of the rosemary host plant. Beetle attachment is found to be dynamic rather than static. Shear movements of tarsomeres are necessary to get reliable hold in both sexes, i.e. in spatulate and discoid contact elements.</p><p>Knowing that mating success often depends on a number of traits [<xref rid="RSOS171108C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], several research questions remain open. The future work will focus on the role of claw interlocking, physiological and behavioural influences, physico&#8211;chemical interactions at the interface between fluid layers on tarsi and on elytra, different substrate roughness, various natural substrates, external forces generated under such natural conditions as female walking, male competition, etc. and environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsos171108supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1393" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplementary Data_originals</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="rsos171108supp2.xls" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1401" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s6"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>The dataset supporting this article has been uploaded as part of the electronic supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>D.V., A.T. and M.V. designed the research; D.V. and A.T. performed the research; D.V. analysed the data and wrote the paper.
