We sequenced the coding regions of the <italic>PAX9</italic> and <italic>MSX1</italic> genes from nine patients with non-syndromic tooth agenesis, and identified a missense mutation, P20L, of <italic>PAX9</italic> in a single familial case involving three patients in two generations. Identical mutation was previously reported by other authors, but has not been characterized in detail. The mutation was located in a highly conserved N-terminal subdomain of the paired domain and co-segregated as a heterozygote with tooth agenesis. The patients showed defects primarily in the first and second molars, which is typical for cases attributable to PAX9 mutation. Luciferase reporter assay using the 2.3-kb promoter region of <italic>BMP4</italic> and electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the CD19-2(A-ins) sequence revealed that P20L substitution eliminated most of the transactivation activity and specific DNA binding activity of PAX9 under the experimental conditions we employed, while some residual activity of the mutant was evident in the former assay. The hypomorphic nature of the variant may explain the relatively mild phenotype in this case, as compared with other PAX9 pathogenic variants such as R26W.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tooth agenesis is a very common congenital abnormality in humans, with a reported prevalence in the permanent dentition ranging from 1.6% to 9.6% depending on severity and the types of missing teeth [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the development of teeth, as well as that of other organs in the body, is controlled by coordinated action of numerous gene products, defects in any single component may potentially result in tooth absence or malformation. These mechanistic developmental networks or their components are often shared by multiple organs. Accordingly, congenital tooth agenesis may be associated with other phenotypic features in some cases (syndromic), whereas it may be isolated in others (non-syndromic). Genetic alterations responsible for syndromic or non-syndromic tooth agenesis have been described for several loci since they were first reported twenty years ago [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most of the proteins encoded at these loci have a role in reciprocal interaction between dental epithelium and mesenchyme during tooth development [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among them are transcription factors PAX9 and MSX1, which function in mesenchymal cells predominantly at the bud-to-cap stage and may regulate the expression of secreted signal molecules such as BMP4 [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tooth agenesis due to loss-of-function variants of PAX9 or MSX1, which is usually non-syndromic, shows a dominant inheritance pattern in most cases, and this is ascribed to haploinsufficiency of these transcription factors. Notably, hypomorphic alleles of <italic>PAX9</italic> such as G6R have been reported to have a phenotype that is markedly milder than that of other pathogenic alleles [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although mice with heterozygous deletion of either <italic>Pax9</italic> or <italic>Msx1</italic> do not recapitulate the phenotype observed in man, a study using homozygotes or compound heterozygotes of a series of hypomorphic <italic>Pax9</italic> alleles has shown that decreasing the dosage of PAX9 to a level lower than heterozygous deletion results in tooth defect, and that the phenotypic severity increases as the gene dosage decreases further [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These observations suggest that tooth development has a quantitative trait-like property. In humans, the dosage of PAX9 may be fine-tuned, and even slight deviation from the wild-type level may have a visible outcome, whereas in mice the minimal activity of PAX9 required for normal development may be much lower, at least for tooth phenotype. Differences in the patterns of tooth absence between PAX9 and MSX1 variants indicate the distinct functions of the gene products, whereas the phenotype of double-heterozygous mice also argues for a partially overlapping or compensatory relationship [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we screened patients with moderately severe tooth agenesis for possible causative mutations in the coding region of <italic>PAX9</italic> and <italic>MSX1</italic>. We identified a missense variant, P20L, located in the paired domain of PAX9 in a single familial case. An <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment confirmed the detrimental effect of the mutation on PAX9 activity as a transcription factor. Thimmegowda et al. recently reported a haplotype containing both c.59C&gt;T and c.75C&gt;T mutations in the <italic>PAX9</italic> coding region in an Indian family with tooth agenesis, which would result in P20L and silent mutation at Ile25 [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, they did not refer to the resulting amino acid change, co-segregation of the variant within the family, or the functional implications of the variant. Our study provides compelling genetic, experimental and theoretical evidence for the causal link between P20L and tooth agenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials &amp; methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine patients with tooth agenesis (three from two generations of a single family and six from sporadic cases) diagnosed at Iwate Medical University were chosen for initial mutation analysis.

The variant allele was shared exclusively by the three familial patients as heterozygotes, and not by an unaffected member of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186260.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). All of the familial patients possessed another missense mutation, A240P, in <italic>PAX9</italic> as homozygotes. This allele, however, was also observed in the unaffected member and found to be a common variant (rs4904210, allele frequency is 0.4653 in Integrative Japanese Genome Variation Database), therefore it was considered unlikely to be responsible for tooth agenesis. In the six sporadic cases, no non-synonymous variants other than PAX9 A240P and MSX1 A40G (rs36059701, allele frequency 0.0760) were identified in the coding regions of <italic>PAX9</italic> and <italic>MSX1</italic>.</p><p>The Pro<sup>20</sup> resides in the loop between the &#946; hairpin and the &#945;1 helix within the N-terminal subdomain (NSD) of the paired domain, and is invariant among nine PAX family proteins in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186260.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

AnalyseComplex against R26W variants for comparison resulted in a 1.3 kcal/mol decrease of interaction energy and an additional 4.9 kcal/mol Van der Waals clash.

In addition to the higher degree of NSD conservation among PAX proteins, the ratio of missense variants to synonymous variants is significantly lower in NSD of PAX9 (4 to 14) than in CSD (16 to 6, <italic>P</italic> = 0.00364 by Fisher&#8217;s exact test) in the ExAC database. This suggests that NSD may be under stronger purifying selection in the human population, and therefore functionally and/or structurally more crucial. A similar pattern of pathogenic mutation distribution is more clearly represented in another PAX family member, PAX3 [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. How this reconciles with the proposed role of CSD in specific DNA binding is currently unclear [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A further search for pathogenic variants or large-scale mutagenesis experiments using an appropriate assay system will be required to address this question.</p><p>Since highly conserved Pro<sup>20</sup> is located at the protein-DNA interface, its substitution would be naturally implicated in any possible defect of DNA interaction. Our present study showed that DNA binding activity as well as transactivation activity of the variant PAX9 was severely compromised. On the other hand, homology modeling of PAX9 P20L did not pick up large structural anomalies in the DNA interface other than slight displacement of a few nearby amino acid residues. Whereas this may likely be due to modeling limitation, it also might be connected to the relatively mild clinical phenotype of P20L (in the present study, the mean number of missing teeth was 5.7) compared with other pathogenic variants such as R26W (11.3) [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, foldX analysis predicted that R26W might impose a markedly higher cost of intramolecular Van der Waals clashes than P20L. The apparent residual activity of P20L variants in the reporter assay supports this notion.</p><p>Intriguingly, when ectopically expressed in cultured COS-7 cells, P20L protein reproducibly attained a higher expression level than its wild-type counterpart. Our preliminary study did not detect clear difference in stability between the wild-type and the P20L mutant proteins. Although we have no evidence that this takes place <italic>in vivo</italic>, higher expression of the mutant protein might have some effect on the resulting phenotype besides the defect in biochemical activity. This possibility needs to be explored in a future study.</p><p>We were not successful in identifying candidate mutations in <italic>PAX9</italic> and <italic>MSX1</italic> in the six sporadic cases in the present study. Since previous studies involving large numbers of subjects have found that the incidence of phenotypes attributable to PAX9 or MSX1 mutation is in the range of several percent [<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0186260.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], this was not unexpected.
