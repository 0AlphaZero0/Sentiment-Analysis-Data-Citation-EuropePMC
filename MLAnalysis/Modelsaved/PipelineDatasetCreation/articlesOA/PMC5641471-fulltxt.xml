However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus Rspo ligands to <italic>in vivo</italic> canonical Wnt signaling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here, we deconstructed functional roles of Wnt versus Rspo ligands in the intestinal crypt stem cell niche. We demonstrate that the default fate of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs is lineage commitment, escape from which requires both Rspo and Wnt ligands. However, gain-of-function studies using Rspo versus a novel non-lipidated Wnt analog reveal qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles for these ligands in ISCs. Wnts are insufficient to induce Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC self-renewal, but rather confer a basal competency by maintaining Rspo receptor expression that enables Rspo to actively drive and specify the extent of stem cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interplay between Wnt and Rspo ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precision control of tissue regeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">We investigated the relative contributions of extracellular Wnt and Rspo ligands to homeostatic Wnt signaling in the ISC niche using highly specific, ligand-level pharmacologic perturbation.

Multi-lineage differentiation with all three ECDs was preserved except for LGR5 ECD-induced ballooning intermediate cell-like degeneration of Paneth cells at day 3 that only occurred after Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC loss at day 2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, concomitant Rspo1 overexpression completely reversed LGR5, Znrf3 or Rnf43 ECD repression of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs, underscoring specificity (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P4">RSPO2 simultaneously bound both Znrf3 and LGR5 ECDs by yeast surface display (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1h&#8211;n</xref>), consistent with RSPO proteins engaging LGR4&#8211;6 and RNF43/ZNRF3 via spatially distinct interfaces<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Accordingly, dual blockade of both the Rspo:Lgr and Rspo:Znrf3/Rnf43 interactions by Ad Rnf43 ECD + Ad LGR5 ECD or Ad Znrf3 ECD + Ad LGR5 ECD synergistically induced 100% lethal loss of crypts, villi, Lgr5-eGFP, proliferation and Axin2-LacZ Wnt reporter signal within 7 days (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,d</xref>).

We thus performed tamoxifen-mediated lineage tracing of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs in <italic>Lgr5-eGFP-IRES-CreER; Rosa26-tdTomato</italic> mice. By day 2, Ad Fc controls harbored crypt-base tdTomato-marked Lgr5-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells (yellow) with limited non-Lgr5 crypt-confined progeny (red) (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, Ad LGR5, Rnf43 or Znrf3 ECD each dramatically accelerated Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC lineage tracing kinetics by day 2 with strongly induced differentiated red villus progeny versus Fc control, consistent with Rspo inhibition inducing rapid Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC flux through the TA and terminally differentiated fates; this was phenocopied by Ad Dkk1 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a&#8211;b</xref>; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). RNA-seq of FACS-sorted Lgr5-eGFP<sup>+</sup> ISCs at 1.5 days following Ad LGR5 ECD treatment, just prior to complete loss of Lgr5-eGFP fluorescence, revealed nascent multi-lineage differentiation (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Thus, endogenous Rspo ligands obligately maintain Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs, with Rspo inhibition via LGR5, Rnf43 or Znrf3 ECDs uniformly shunting Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs toward default passive lineage commitment.</p><p id="P6">We also lineage traced Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs under Rspo gain-of-function (GOF) conditions (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).

In control Ad Fc small intestine, tamoxifen-labeled GFP<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> (yellow) Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells generated scattered red crypt Lgr5<sup>&#8722;</sup> progeny at day 2 and red differentiated villus lineage stripes by days 4&#8211;7. In contrast, Ad Rspo1 or Ad RSPO2 expanded yellow Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs within the enlarged crypts at days 2&#8211;7, but crucially the Rspo1 and RSPO2 Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC lineage traces were overwhelmingly yellow, profoundly crypt-confined and lacked red lineage-committed progeny (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). Rspo-induced crypt &#8220;trapping&#8221; of tdTomato-marked Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells occurred concurrently with Rspo-induced proliferation of non-Lgr5<sup>+</sup> TA cells (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d,e</xref>).

Accordingly, Rspo-expanded Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs are confined to the ISC fate and do not differentiate, indicating that Rspo quantitatively induces Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC self-renewal, for instance by symmetric cell division mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Direct exploration of Wnt ligand function has been confounded by genetic redundancy and hydrophobicity due to post-translational palmitoylation, complicating large-scale purification and <italic>in vivo</italic> study<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. We thus generated scFv-DKK1c, a non-lipidated, water-soluble, artificial Wnt analog acting by Fzd-Lrp heterodimerization with broad Fzd specificity that exhibited robust serum expression for &gt; 21 days upon adenoviral expression<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, Ad scFv-DKK1c-treated small intestines were histologically normal, versus Ad Rspo1-induced crypt hyperplasia (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). However, scFv-DKK1c + Rspo1 synergistically induced marked villus hyperproliferation and lengthening with Ki67 and Wnt targets CD44<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and cyclin D1 contiguously extending from crypts to peri-villus tip regions (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a&#8211;c</xref>). While single scFv-DKK1c or Rspo1 treatment was well tolerated, the combination elicited cachexia and intestinal obstruction with lethality within 7&#8211;9 days. However, 100-fold lower doses of Ad scFv-DKK1c still elicited synergistic villus proliferation and Wnt target gene upregulation while averting lethality at those time points (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a&#8211;c</xref>).

The striking concordance of single-cell RNA-seq profiles and lineage commitment phenotypes upon either selective Wnt or Rspo blockade strongly indicates that these two ligand families cooperate within the same molecular pathway to maintain Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs. This powerfully illustrates the utility of single-cell RNA-seq to monitor discrete stem cell states and their dynamic perturbation. The synergistic crypt loss after simultaneous blockade of both Rspo:Lgr and Rspo:Rnf43/Znrf3 binding further suggests that maximal Rspo activity requires concordant engagement of both receptor classes, as predicted by structural studies<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, while supporting an essential role for Lgr receptors and Rspo proteins during crypt and Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC maintenance<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. However, Wnt and Rspo ligands are functionally non-equivalent since Wnt ligand overexpression, using the novel non-lipidated scFv-DKK1c as a proxy, cannot induce crypt expansion or Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs, in marked contrast to Rspo. Furthermore, these ligand families cannot mutually substitute during Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC maintenance. Rather, Wnts and Rspos intimately cooperate, with Wnts conferring a basal priming/competency unto the Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs by inducing Rspo receptor expression (<italic>Lgr5</italic>, <italic>Rnf43</italic> and <italic>Znrf3</italic>) that enables Rspo-driven Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC self-renewal (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). This parallels proposed models of Rspo action where Rspo does not itself induce canonical Wnt signaling but dramatically amplifies the basal activity of Wnt ligands<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Other genetic phenotypes from Wnt signaling intermediates such as Axin, Apc or &#946;-catenin, been previously attributed to Wnt ligands, may arise from analogous Wnt/Rspo cooperativity.</p><p id="P16">Both <italic>in vivo</italic> lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis of Wnt or Rspo inhibition concordantly reveal that the default fate of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs is passive lineage commitment. In contrast, Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC self-renewal is an active process requiring both Wnt and Rspo as priming and self-renewal factors, respectively. However, Rspo, not Wnt, dominantly dictates the size of the Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC pool irrespective of overexpressed Wnt ligand amplitude. The reciprocal Rspo GOF self-renewal versus LOF lineage commitment phenotypes reveal Rspos as master regulators of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISC fate determination and associated neutral drift kinetics<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Overall, the parsing of ISC regulation into distinct Wnt priming and Rspo self-renewal stages has significant regulatory implications for precision control and fine-tuning of tissue homeostasis, as potentially facilitated by the evolutionary appearance of Rspo genes in vertebrates. Analogous multi-tiered regulation by priming and self-renewal factors may be a generalized property of stem cells across diverse organ systems, either through Wnt and Rspo or functionally equivalent niche components.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Recombinant adenoviruses and proteins</title><p id="P17">Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed with the following inserts.
