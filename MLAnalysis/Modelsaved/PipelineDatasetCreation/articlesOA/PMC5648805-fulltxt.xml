Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is the major extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx process in excitable and, particularly, in non-excitable cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Previous studies have identified the molecular constituents of SOCE: an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, the stromal interaction molecule (STIM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and a plasma membrane (PM) pore-forming subunit, Orai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. By sensing Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion within the ER, STIM undergoes oligomerization and translocates to ER&#8211;PM junctions, where it activates highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective Orai channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through Orai channels provides precise Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are essential for regulating long-term responses such as gene expression and cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai channels modulates their activity through a process called Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI), which is an important negative feedback mechanism that maintains intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. CDI consists of fast CDI (FCDI) and slow CDI (SCDI), which have distinct kinetics and sites of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. FCDI occurs within tens of milliseconds after channel activation and is controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to a site located several nanometers from the pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The FCDI process was regulated by various factors, including the STIM1-to-Orai1 expression ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the intracellular loop of Orai1 and the conserved negatively charged cluster in the STIM1 COOH terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. SCDI occurs within tens of seconds of channel activation and is driven by a global rather than local Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF) has been reported to facilitate SCDI of SOCE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> through interaction with the STIM1 C-terminal inhibitory domain (448&#8211;530)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, SARAF was not able to regulate SCDI after Orai1 channel activation by the constitutively active STIM1 mutant D76A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, SARAF-dependent SCDI appears to be regulated by multiple factors, such as Caveolin, E-Syt1, Septin4 and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Calmodulin (CaM) consists of an N-lobe and a C-lobe, each of which contains two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. CaM adopts a closed conformation in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state (apo-CaM) and an open conformation in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state (holo-CaM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Both states are able to bind various target proteins and consequently transduce different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Ion channels are major targets of CaM regulation. For example, the CDI of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels regulated by CaM is well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Apo-CaM is pre-associated with the IQ domain, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induces subtle conformational rearrangements between CaM and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inactivation region, which facilitates CDI. For Orai channels, one previous study has shown that CaM might be the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for FCDI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> but the results of a more recent report have contradicted this argument<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">After more than 30 years of intensive studies, the activation mechanism of SOCE has been well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, the deactivation mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CaM associates with the core region of STIM1 in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Consequently, calcium-bound CaM disrupts the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex and disassembles STIM1 oligomers, thereby inducing deactivation of the SOCE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM interacts with STIM1</title><p id="Par7">Human STIM1 is a type I membrane protein that contains 685 amino acids.

The titration of CaM-4EF into SOAR in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> showed no detectable binding signal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Our results showed that including purified CaM in the pipette solution increased the extent of the SCDI of Orai1 current that was induced by SOAR and the extent of inactivation in a CaM concentration-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Including purified CaM-4EF mutant in the pipette solution had no effect on the Orai1 current (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). In the control experiment, 10&#8201;mM EGTA abolished the CaM-regulated SCDI of Orai1 current (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Next, we tested whether CaM regulated the SCDI of Orai1 current that was induced by full-length STIM1. We found that CaM but not the CaM-4EF mutant facilitated the Orai1 SCDI (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c, d</xref>). We further tested whether CaM regulated the SCDI of Orai1 current that was induced by the constitutively active STIM1 mutant D76A. Our results showed that CaM, but not a CaM-4EF mutant, produced substantial increases in the SCDI of the Orai1 current (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). As CaM is notoriously difficult to knock down in cells, we instead used CaM inhibitors. W-7, a canonical chemical CaM inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, was included in the pipette solution.

We then used another type of CaM inhibitor to further verify this result. The Trp peptide (RRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRL), a CaM peptide inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, was synthesized and included in the pipette solution.

Multiple human STIM1 constructs were screened, and one (STIM1 363&#8211;416) produced well-resolved peaks in the NMR <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum. Each residue was assigned unambiguously (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Titration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM into the solution of <sup>15</sup>N-STIM1 significantly attenuated the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC cross-peaks for residues 382&#8211;398, thus indicating that these residues may be involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). This region contains several basic residues and several hydrophobic residues, which have been reported to regulate STIM1&#8211;Orai1 binding and Orai1 channel activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC experiment indicated that the interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM with the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled WT STIM1 (363&#8211;416) construct occurred with a slow-to-intermediate exchange rate, and that many cross-peaks were broadened with the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>), thus indicating that these two proteins bind each other strongly (<italic>K</italic>

In contrast, titrating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM into an <sup>15</sup>N-labeled STIM1 (363&#8211;416) mutant, L390S-F391S, resulted in a faster exchange rate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), thus indicating that mutation of L390 and F391 significantly reduced the binding affinity of the proteins. Using the cross-peak shifts of three residues (A369, G379 and I383) as a reference, we determined the binding affinity of the STIM1 (363&#8211;416) mutant L390S-F391S with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM to be 97&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10&#8201;&#956;M, at least 10-fold lower than that of the WT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>).

Therefore, CaM seems to bind with STIM1 in an unconventional way.</p><p id="Par27">SOAR is the basic unit of STIM1 that binds and activates the Orai1 channel. It has been demonstrated that the polybasic SOAR residues 384&#8211;387 are crucial for SOAR binding to Orai1. Interestingly, we identified residues L390 and F391 as necessary for SOAR binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM. These residues are adjacent to the Orai1-binding site of SOAR, thus suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding to SOAR will interfere with the SOAR&#8211;Orai1 complex or the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex. Furthermore, the affinity value that we measured between SOAR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM was ~0.2&#8201;&#956;M, ~1,000-fold higher than the affinity (~200&#8201;&#956;M) of SOAR for the Orai1 channel, according to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. This large difference in affinity allows Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM to compete with Orai1 for association with SOAR, thus leading to the breakdown of the SOAR&#8211;Orai1 complex or the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex.</p><p id="Par28">Puncta formation represents STIM1 aggregation and activation. Our results showed that the mutation of residues Leu390 and Phe391, which are part of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding site of SOAR or STIM1, leads to the failure of puncta formation and activation. Thus, we infer that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding to the activated STIM1 oligomer may lead to a shift in equilibrium from an STIM1 oligomer to a less aggregated form. In our system that uses purified CaM, we indeed observed that the STIM1 oligomer became less aggregated after the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM. This result was further confirmed by FRET measurements in cells.</p><p id="Par29">The Orai1 channel is characteristic of both FCDI and SCDI. FCDI occurs within milliseconds, whereas SCDI occurs within minutes. Our results showed that after CaM responds to elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM disrupts the SOAR&#8211;Orai1 complex or the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex, resulting in the inactivation of the Orai1 channel. This process was consistent with the SCDI of the Orai1 channel. Indeed, including purified CaM in the pipette facilitated Orai1 SCDI. More importantly, when the Orai1 channel was activated by the constitutively active STIM1 mutant D76A, CaM was also able to facilitate SCDI. When inhibitors were used to inhibit endogenous CaM, the SCDI of the Orai1 current was reduced. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM induced SCDI appears to differ from SARAF-induced SCDI. It has been reported that SARAF-induced SCDI may be mediated by the interaction of SARAF with residues 448&#8211;530 of STIM1, which are located after SOAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, STIM1 and SARAF are localized in the ER and interact in the basal state with filled Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that SARAF functions by holding STIM1 in a resting state. This statement is consistent with data that SARAF does not inactivate the Orai1 channel if the constitutively active STIM1 mutant D76A or 4E-4A is used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM has a dominant role in disrupting the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex and disaggregating the STIM1 oligomer. The inactive STIM1 conformation is presumably maintained by SARAF to avoid the spontaneous activation of STIM1. More evidence is required to test this possibility in the near future.</p><p id="Par30">In summary, we propose a molecular mechanism of STIM1&#8211;Orai1 deactivation that is induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). After Orai1 is activated by STIM1 and forms the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Orai1 channel leads to the elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to a certain level, CaM is charged with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and moves closer to the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex. Owing to the high affinity between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM and the exposed SOAR, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM pulls STIM1 from Orai1 and disrupts the STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex. The Orai1 channel is then closed. Furthermore, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM to STIM1 induces a change in the STIM1 oligomer that results in a less-aggregated form. By the action of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and PM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is decreased, and the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store is refilled. Decreased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations lead to CaM dissociation from STIM1, whereas increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations load the N-terminal STIM1 region with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consequently, the N-terminal STIM1 returns to its monomeric form and presumably drives STIM1 back to the resting state. Of course, this process can be further regulated by many other factors, such as SARAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the orosomucoid-like 3 protein ORMDL3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and Golli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Model of STIM1&#8211;Orai1 deactivation induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM.

CaM undergoes a conformational change and binds to the exposed SOAR region of STIM1. The STIM1&#8211;Orai1 complex dissociates, the Orai1 channel is inactivated and the STIM1 oligomer is disassembled.

It is likely to be that increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels activate CaM and facilitate the SCDI of the Orai1 channel.
