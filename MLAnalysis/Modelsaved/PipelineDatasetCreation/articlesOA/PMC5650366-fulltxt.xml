However, it remains unclear how global genes changes in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study investigated global gene expression in the hippocampi of Wistar rats following transient cerebral IRI using an RNA-sequencing strategy. The results revealed &#8805;2-fold up-regulation of 156 genes and &#8805;2-fold down-regulation of 26 genes at 24 h post-reperfusion. Fifteen differentially expressed genes were selected to confirm the RNA-sequencing results. Gene expression levels were dynamic, with the peak expression level of each gene occurring at different time points post-reperfusion. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis classified the differentially expressed genes as mainly involved in inflammation, stress and immune response, glucose metabolism, proapoptosis, antiapoptosis, and biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that IRI activated different signaling pathways, including focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling, and Jak-STAT signaling. This study describes global gene expression profiles in the hippocampi of Wistar rats using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. These findings provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of IRI and potential drug targets for the prevention and treatment of IRI in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gene expression profile</kwd><kwd>ischemia-reperfusion injury</kwd><kwd>MCAO model</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, making its prevention and treatment urgent.

This model enables accurate control of ischemia-reperfusion time. Previous experiments in our lab confirmed other reports [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that transient cerebral ischemic injury for 2 h followed by post-reperfusion measurements at 24 h provides the most appropriate model of IRI. Accordingly, 2 h of ischemia followed by analysis of hippocampi sampled at 24 h post-reperfusion were the conditions under which abnormal expression of genes was evaluated.</p><p>It has been previously established that genes related to inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle, ER stress, and autophagy [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are involved in the cellular events observed in cerebral IRI. Our results obtained from RNA sequencing were similar to those of previous studies, and draw a consistent conclusion regarding the genes involved in IRI.</p><p>The expression of inflammatory factors was increased in the pathological process of cerebral IRI. The release of inflammatory molecules, including TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, NF-&#954;B, and TGF-&#946;, likely further aggravates cell injury during ischemia-reperfusion [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with previous studies in rat and cell models, IRI significantly induced the increased expression of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM1), indicating that the inflammatory response was actived by cerebral IRI. Specific molecules that bind neutrophils, including CAMs and selectins (ICAM2, ICAM4, ICAM5, VCAM, selectin E, and selectin L), exhibited abnormal expression in our experiment. These genes play an important role in leukocyte infiltration and transmigration [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Gfap is a strong marker of gliosis, and may also serve as a marker of neuroinflammation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the current study, the expression of Gfap was up-regulated 2.286-fold (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This suggests that the over-activation of glia may be induced during IRI.</p><p>Cellular apoptosis may accompany cerebral IRI due to the expression of apoptosis-related genes [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Bcl-2, a key antiapoptotic factor, could inhibit the release of cytochrome c. Bax, as a proapoptotic factor, may increase the release of cytochrome c. Various reports suggest that Bcl-2 expression is decreased and Bax expression is increased at different reperfusion times [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consistent with these results, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 expression was decreased and Bax expression was increased in the hippocampus at 24 h post-reperfusion, as measured by RNA sequencing and RT-PCR. The differential expression of other genes related to apoptosis, including Bad, Bcl-6, Bak, Bcl2-like 1-15 (apoptosis facilitator), Bcl2-associated factors, and Bag (BCL2-associated athanogene), was detected through RNA sequencing. The expression of Caspase family members was also altered. Caspase-4, Caspase-7, and Caspase-8 exhibited 4.19-, 2.19-, and 1.57-fold increases, respectively, indicating that these genes may involve in IRI.</p><p>Hsps are ubiquitous and highly conserved proteins that are induced in response to stressors including high temperature, ischemia, hypoxia, and pathological state [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hsps may be induced after cerebral ischemia, and their expression may protect against cellular damage via anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic mechanisms, or the repair of damaged molecules [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the present study, Hspb1, Hspa1a, and Hspa1b were significantly increased at 24 h post-reperfusion in cellular and rat models. It is essential to further research the function of these genes to fully understand the mechanism of IRI.</p><p>Wolfram syndrome 1 (Wfs1) and activating transcription factor 6&#945; (Atf6&#945;) are transmembrane proteins localized to the ER [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Wfs1 negatively regulates Atf6&#945; through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Wfs1 stabilizes the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, leading to the suppression of ER stress signaling. In the current study, we further verified the inverse relationship between Wfs1 and Atf6. The expression level of Wfs1 was significantly decreased, but Atf6 and Chop2 expression levels were significantly increased. This indicates that cerebral IRI induces a decrease in Wfs1 expression, which in turn activates the Atf-Chop pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Previous reports [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated that extended periods of ER stress activate Caspase-12, leading to cell death. Our results confirm these reports. Expression of Caspase-12 increased 3.59-fold based on RNA-sequencing analysis, and 2.85-fold based on RT-PCR analysis. These results suggest that ER stress is involved in cerebral IRI.</p><p>Previous reports established a connection between cerebral IRI and the activation of autophagy [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Autophagy is a conserved homeostatic process that maintains cellular balance through the lysosomal system [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In normal physiological processes, misfolded molecules or damaged organelles are eliminated through autophagy. However, non-apoptotic programmed cell death is initiated through excessive self-digestion and degradation of cellular components if autophagy is activated inappropriately [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Both cerebral ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion can activate autophagy by inducing high expression of certain genes, including Becn1, LC3-II, and Atg5 [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To assess the level of autophagy after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, we carried out global gene profiling using RNA sequencing. We found abnormal levels of calreticulin, Atg3, Atg12, Becn1, Atg5, and Ukl1. Calreticulin, Atg3, and Atg12 were selected for amplification using RT-PCR. Consistent with the results obtained from RNA sequencing, these genes were dramatically elevated 24 h post-reperfusion. These results suggest that autophagy was over-activated by cerebral IRI.</p><p>Reperfusion after ischemic injury may give rise to two openings of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during the refractory period [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The initial opening phase occurs several hours post-reperfusion and is transient. An irreversible second phase opening occurs 24 h to 72 h post-reperfusion. Consistent with this pathological phenomenon, a therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke should be carried out as early as possible. In the present study, Canx, Cacna1e, Slc24a2, and Ttr were selected, and their expression levels were examined at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after reperfusion. The expression of these genes was dynamic during the 48 h following reperfusion, and the peak expression time of each gene was not identical. This suggests that these genes play different role in IRI at different times following ischemia-reperfusion, underscoring the idea that the pathological processes of IRI are complex and diverse.</p><p>In summary, a global gene expression profile for the hippocampus after cerebral IRI was obtained using RNA sequencing. 156 genes were up-regulated and 26 genes were down-regulated. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that differentially expressed genes were involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and metabolism. This study provides new insights into understanding the complicated molecular mechanisms of cerebral IRI. Further elaboration of the differentially expressed genes and relevant pathways will be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of cerebral IRI.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats, aged 6&#8211;8 weeks, weighing 230&#8211;280 g, were purchased from Pengyue Experimental Animal Breeding Institute of Jinan, China (license no. SCXK (Lu) 2014-0007). The rats were housed in a controlled environment of 22&#8211;26&#176;C, 50&#8211;60% humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jining Medical University and performed in accordance with the international Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model</title><p>The rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established as follows: Rats were anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/100 g) through intraperitoneal injection, and fixed in the supine position. The right common carotid artery was isolated, and a 0.26 mm diameter fishing line was inserted along the right common carotid arteries into the internal carotid artery until it blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The depth of penetration was approximately 18 mm. The incision was sutured. According to the experimental protocol of our lab [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], rats were subjected to focal ischemia for 2 h, and the fishing lines were pulled out post-reperfusion at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. In the sham group, the right carotid artery was isolated without occlusion of the common carotid arteries. The surgery was performed at 22 &#177; 2&#176;C. A neurological score was used to evaluate the success of the model. After the neurological score was obtained, the qualifying rats in each group were decapitated, and their hippocampi were isolated and stored on ice for use in the experiments described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>2, 3, 5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining</title><p>Brains were isolated from the 24 h post-reperfusion (IRI/24 h) group and the sham group.
