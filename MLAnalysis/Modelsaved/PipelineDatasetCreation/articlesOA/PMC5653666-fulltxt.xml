Acute KRAS knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased cell proliferation and/or induced apoptosis in a series of human PDAC (hPDAC) cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Variability in apoptotic response to KRAS knockdown led to the classification of some cells as &#8220;KRAS-dependent&#8221; and others as &#8220;KRAS-independent&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Based on these studies, it was unclear whether the &#8220;KRAS-independent&#8221; phenotype was a consequence of the incomplete inhibitory effects of RNAi such that residual KRAS protein was sufficient to sustain cell survival and proliferation. Recent evidence for PDAC cell survival in the absence of oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> expression derived from a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> transgenic mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this model, DOX treatment led to oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> expression in the pancreas to initiate tumorigenesis, while DOX withdrawal halted transgene expression and induced tumor regression. Interestingly, a subset of PDAC tumors recurred lacking <italic>KRAS</italic> transgene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Despite these findings, the absolute dependence of PDAC cells on endogenous KRAS, a prerequisite for the successful clinical development of novel KRAS inhibitors, remains unknown.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we examine the consequence of <italic>KRAS</italic> knockout in PDAC cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system. The bacterial CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system, modified for genome editing in mammalian cells, utilizes a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to cleave matching double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences, resulting in insertions and deletions via error-prone non-homologous end joining repair mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

An unbiased chemical screen identifies sensitivity to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition in <italic>KRAS</italic> deficient cells, offering a pharmacologically tractable method to subvert resistance to KRAS blockade. Furthermore, we gain mechanistic insight into how PI3K inhibition simultaneously blocks the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways to impair cap-dependent translation and cell viability in the context of <italic>KRAS</italic> ablation. Finally, gene expression profiling defines KRAS-regulated pathways in PDAC cells and reveals KRAS-relevant gene signatures that strongly predict survival in PDAC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CRISPR/Cas-mediated <italic>KRAS</italic> knockout in PDAC cells</title><p id="Par8">To evaluate the dependence of PDAC cells on endogenous <italic>KRAS</italic>, we employed CRISPR/Cas technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to completely eliminate KRAS function.

</p><p id="Par19">Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that simultaneous MAPK and AKT inhibition by GDC-0941 underlie its therapeutic effect in the absence of oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>.

While we did not observe a difference in MYC protein levels (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>), baseline phospho-4EBP1 levels were reduced in 8988T <italic>KRAS</italic> deficient cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>), permitting enhanced 4EBP1 sequestration of EIF4E to restrain cap-dependent translation.

Sequencing libraries were prepared from 50&#8201;ng of PCR product using the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads (150&#8201;bp paired-end) were trimmed to 120&#8201;bp after reviewing base quality profiles, in order to drop lower quality 3&#8242; ends. Traces of Nextera adapters were clipped using the FASTX toolkit (Hannon Lab, CSHL) and pairs with each read greater than 15&#8201;bp in length were retained. Additionally, read pairs where either read had 50% or more bases below a base quality threshold of Q30 (Sanger) were dropped from subsequent analyses. The reference sequence of the target locus was supplemented with 10&#8201;bp genomic flanks and was indexed using an enhanced suffix array. Read ends were anchored in the reference sequence using 10&#8201;bp terminal segments for a suffix array index lookup to search for exact matches. A sliding window of unit step size and a maximal soft-clip limit of 10&#8201;bp was used to search for possible anchors at either end of each read. For each read, optimal Smith-Waterman dynamic programming alignment was performed between the reduced state space of the read sequence and the corresponding reference sequence spanning the maximally distanced anchor locations. Scoring parameters were selected to allow for sensitive detection of short and long insertions and deletions while allowing for up to four mismatches, and the highest scoring alignment was selected. Read pairs with both reads aligned in the proper orientation were processed to summarize the number of wild-type reads and the location and size of each insertion and deletion event. Overlapping reads within pairs were both required to support the event if they overlapped across the event location. Additionally, mutation events and wild-type reads were summarized within the extents of the sgRNA sequence and PAM site by considering read alignments that had a minimum of 20&#8201;bp overlap with this region.

Only samples identified as tumor or classical CTC were retained for downstream analyses. Read counts for the remaining samples were normalized using quartile normalization with the upper quartile set to 1000. In the resulting expression data set, genes with an upper quartile of expression count less than 1000 across all samples were tagged as lowly expressed genes and dropped. Normalized expression values were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and used as input for signature analysis using ICA.</p><p id="Par54">GSEA were carried out using the pre-ranked mode using log<sub>2</sub> fold-change values (for pairwise analyses) or standardized signature correlation scores (for ICA signatures) with default settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Network representations of GSEA results were generated using EnrichmentMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap">http://www.baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap</ext-link>) for Cytoscape v3.3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cytoscape.org">http://www.cytoscape.org</ext-link>) with <italic>p</italic> value and FDR cutoffs as described in figure legends. Each circle represents a gene set with circle size corresponding to gene set size and intensity corresponding to enrichment significance. Red is upregulated and blue is downregulated. Each line corresponds to minimum 50% mutual overlap with line thickness corresponding to degree of overlap. Cellular processes for gene set clusters were manually curated.</p><p id="Par55">Candidate point mutations in RNA-Seq data sets were called using a pipeline based on the GATK Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/</ext-link>). Transcriptomic reads were mapped (to mm9, hg19) using the Tophat (v2.0.4) spliced aligner and subjected to local realignment and score recalibration using the GATK Toolkit. Mutations were called in KO samples (individual and pooled) against WT samples (individual and pooled) with a minimum base quality threshold of 30. Genomic annotations were performed using ANNOVAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/">http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par56">

All replicates were included in these analyses. The log-rank test was used for Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival analyses. The Cox regression model (in univariate and multivariable settings) was used to estimate hazard ratios in survival analyses.
