Since conflict over resources can be extremely costly in terms of time, energy, and reproductive success, investigating how individuals resolve conflict is crucial to understanding the evolution of social behaviors. In the Seychelles warbler, we demonstrate two mechanisms by which individuals minimize costs of conflict and show the benefits individuals gain from doing so. Birds that live near relatives or familiar individuals invest less energy in defending and maintaining territory borders and also show less aging-related signs of physiological damage. Our results suggest that conflict between neighbors can be mitigated by kin-selected benefits of sharing resources with relatives but also through direct mutual benefits of cooperation.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Because virtually all organisms compete with others in their social environment, mechanisms that reduce conflict between interacting individuals are crucial for the evolution of stable families, groups, and societies. Here, we tested whether costs of social conflict over territorial space between Seychelles warblers (<italic>Acrocephalus sechellensis</italic>) are mitigated by kin-selected (genetic relatedness) or mutualistic (social familiarity) mechanisms. By measuring longitudinal changes in individuals&#8217; body mass and telomere length, we demonstrated that the fitness costs of territoriality are driven by a complex interplay between relatedness, familiarity, local density, and sex. Physical fights were less common at territory boundaries shared between related or familiar males. In line with this, male territory owners gained mass when living next to related or familiar males and also showed less telomere attrition when living next to male kin. Importantly, these relationships were strongest in high-density areas of the population. Males also had more rapid telomere attrition when living next to unfamiliar male neighbors, but mainly when relatedness to those neighbors was also low. In contrast, neither kinship nor familiarity was linked to body mass or telomere loss in female territory owners. Our results indicate that resolving conflict over territorial space through kin-selected or mutualistic pathways can reduce both immediate energetic costs and permanent somatic damage, thus providing an important mechanism to explain fine-scale population structure and cooperation between different social units across a broad range of taxa.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>kin selection</kwd><kwd>mutualism</kwd><kwd>territoriality</kwd><kwd>telomeres</kwd><kwd>social conflict</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">RCUK | Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000270</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">NE/H006818/1</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">RCUK | Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000270</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">NE/F02083X/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">In nature, conflict between individuals occurs because organisms are selected to pursue selfish interests that rarely align with those of the individuals with whom they interact. Conflict can be mitigated by kinship if there are indirect genetic benefits of promoting genes shared with a relative (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, conflict resolution can also be achieved if interacting individuals gain direct benefits (either mutualistic or reciprocal) from cooperating with each other (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Understanding whether and how conflict is resolved within families, groups, and societies is important for understanding a wide range of behavioral phenomena (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), but it is often unclear if and when kin-selected or mutualistic pathways to conflict resolution are important in animal societies. The respective influences of kinship and mutualistic benefits on conflict resolution could be simultaneous or even interactive (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>); both could also be dependent on other aspects of the social environment (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Furthermore, the degree to which these processes mitigate the observed costs of conflict may depend on the timescale over which those costs are measured. The benefits of reduced conflict between individuals may be observable only after repeated interactions over a long period of time (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>One area where both kin-selected and mutualistic processes might play important interacting roles is in the resolution of conflict over territorial space. Territoriality is widespread throughout the animal kingdom (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and is not specific to a particular social system or population structure. Territory boundary defense is costly (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), so cooperative maintenance of a boundary should be beneficial, as it reduces the need for costly policing. Kin selection could help prevent escalated conflict over territory boundaries, but there is also a well-established mechanism by which mutualistic benefits between interacting individuals could resolve conflict. The &#8220;dear enemy&#8221; phenomenon predicts that conflict is lower between familiar neighbors (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This is because it is less costly to maintain territory boundaries with existing neighbors, with whom agreements about territory boundaries have already been reached, than to renegotiate territory boundaries with new neighbors (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thus, familiarity between neighbors can be used as a proxy for mutualism-based conflict resolution.</p><p>The costs of territoriality do indeed appear to be moderated to some extent by both kinship and familiarity. Individuals living in close proximity to kin in &#8220;kin neighborhoods&#8221; (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) often have higher reproductive success, which has largely been attributed to reduced aggression toward the offspring of related neighbors (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; reviewed in ref. <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). There is also evidence that familiarity between neighbors decreases territorial aggression (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and improves reproductive success (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, several unanswered questions hinder our understanding of conflict resolution in this widespread social phenomenon. First, the respective influences of kinship and familiarity are rarely studied simultaneously in the same system, so conclusions about their relative importance in minimizing territorial conflict and the degree to which they interact are missing. Second, it is unclear whether the influences of kinship and familiarity depend on other aspects of the social environment, such as the intensity of conflicts and level of local competition. Third, while there is some evidence that the degree of territorial conflict is linked to reproductive success (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), remarkably little is known about the mechanisms behind these patterns or the actual physiological cost of territoriality more generally. Fitness-linked markers of individual physiological condition give researchers the opportunity to link levels of territorial conflict with energy expenditure and somatic indicators of cost, thus shedding light on the overall benefit that conflict resolution between neighbors has for individual fitness.</p><p>Here, we investigate how kinship and familiarity act and interact with each other as well as with the broader social environment to influence the immediate and long-term physiological costs of territorial conflict in the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler <italic>Acrocephalus sechellensis</italic>. In this species, dominant breeding pairs (accompanied by up to five subordinate individuals) occupy stable year-round territories that the pair vigorously defends against conspecific intruders (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Both males and female breeders contribute to, and are equally likely to initiate, territorial defense (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), while subordinates usually do not chase intruders or monitor territory borders (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Breeding pairs are socially monogamous and tend to remain together on the same territory for life but also engage in extrapair copulations resulting in high levels (<italic>ca</italic>. 40%) of extrapair paternity (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the majority of which is gained by breeding males living in nearby territories (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The relatively long lifespan of this species (mean, 5 y) (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and the stability of territories in space and time (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) mean that dominant territory owners usually occupy a territory for several consecutive years and hence repeatedly interact with the same neighbors. However, breeder displacement (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) or death and the occasional appearance and disappearance of territories also create temporal variation in the social neighborhood. This variation allows us to examine longitudinal changes in individual physiological condition in response to changing levels of conflict over territory boundaries.</p><p>We first quantify variation in conflict at territory boundaries by investigating the occurrence of physical fights between focal individuals and their neighbors in relation to kinship and familiarity. Previous work has shown intraspecific aggression at boundaries to be an important component of territorial behavior in this species (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We then test whether and how properties of the social neighborhood (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), including neighbor density, genetic relatedness, and social familiarity, interact to influence three fitness-related components of physiological cost in focal individuals. (<italic>i</italic>) We measure the change in body mass between two sampling points (&#8710;Mass) as a function of change in the social neighborhood between the same two points. The use of body mass as a linear measure of physiological condition can be problematic in species where flight maneuverability is linked to predation risk (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, but see also ref. <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, adult Seychelles warblers have no predators (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and body mass has been linked to various other components of physiological condition (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), suggesting that this measure is a useful indicator of current territorial costs. (<italic>ii</italic>) We measure the change in telomere length (&#8710;RTL) in focal individuals as a function of mean social neighborhood properties over the sampling period. Telomere length is a widely used bioindicator of somatic stress (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) that predicts survival in the Seychelles warbler (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and has also been shown to reflect the accumulation of somatic damage (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) arising through heightened metabolic costs and oxidative stress (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). (<italic>iii</italic>) We evaluated short-term survival prospects in relation to mean neighborhood properties over the sampling period. We determined whether each focal bird was still alive in the year following the final time it was caught and sampled.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Example of a spatial territory map of the Seychelles warbler population on Cousin Island during the 2006 main season, showing the distribution of territories across the island and the method by which a social neighborhood was defined.

In the Seychelles warbler, male territory owners are more often observed fighting at borders shared with unrelated and/or unfamiliar male neighbors. In line with this, males appear to gain an immediate benefit (in terms of increased body mass) from becoming more related to or familiar with male neighbors, but only when the total number of neighbors increases. Males also gain long-term benefits (in terms of reduced telomere loss) from having related male neighbors when living at high densities. Additionally, males lose more telomere repeats when living next to unfamiliar male neighbors, but only if these neighbors are not relatives. In contrast, focal females do not appear to respond to neighbor relatedness or familiarity with respect to territorial conflict or the associated physiological costs, suggesting that the social neighborhood is less important for females than for males. Our findings provide evidence for a complex interplay between kinship, familiarity, sex, and other aspects of the social environment that determines the cost of territorial conflict in wild animals. We discuss these results and their implications below.</p><sec id="s6"><title>Physical Aggression Between Neighbors.</title><p>Males were more likely to be observed fighting male neighbors that they were less related to or that were new in the social neighborhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The frequency of observed fights was very low: out of a total 1,333 focal&#8211;neighbor dyads (in which each dyad consists of a focal individual and one of its neighbors), we recorded fights in 32 (2.5%) of them. This suggests that, rather than providing a direct mechanism by which kinship and familiarity affect body mass and telomere loss, fighting is a relatively rare manifestation of ongoing, less visible conflict between unrelated and unfamiliar neighbors. Although this analysis consisted of fairly small sample sizes and should therefore be interpreted with caution, our results support those found in other species. For example, in willow ptarmigans (<italic>Lagopus lagopus</italic>) males were more likely to fight unfamiliar neighbors (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and were less aggressive toward related neighbors (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), while several studies in salmonid fish demonstrate reduced aggression in kin shoals (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It would be extremely interesting to investigate the exact function of kinship and familiarity in this context: Are fights less common between cooperating neighbors because each individual is less willing to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by crossing the agreed boundary or because cooperating neighbors do not enforce the boundary so strictly, leading to more territory overlap? Evidence from a handful of studies points to the latter, at least with respect to kinship between neighbors (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, reviewed in ref. <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but it is currently unclear whether territory overlap (accepted cheating) or reduced incentive to trespass (assured cooperation) also occurs between familiar neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Immediate Benefits of Neighbor Kinship and Familiarity.</title><p>Given that body mass reflects an individual&#8217;s physiological state in the Seychelles warbler (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), as is broadly assumed across many species (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, but see ref. <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> for limitations of this metric), individuals who spend more time finding food and/or less energy on territorial defense should have greater mass. In high-density areas, we found that males who were more related to or familiar with their male neighbors in the later of two sampling points were also heavier at the second sampling point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Although drawn from small sample sizes (only nine focal males experienced an increase in neighbor density in this analysis), these patterns suggest a within-individual response to changes in levels of territory boundary conflict. Somewhat similar results have been reported in zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, in which juveniles grew to a greater size when shoaling with familiar kin than with unfamiliar nonkin (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In the current study, both familiarity and relatedness appear to play independent roles in mitigating territorial costs. However, both these relationships were present only when focal males had a high number of neighbors; this result is intuitive under the assumption that territorial costs, and hence the degree to which kinship and familiarity can be influential, accumulate with the number of boundaries to maintain.</p><p>Since body mass changes on a very short temporal timescale (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), one assumption of using &#8710;Mass to measure changing territorial conflict is that the level of social conflict with neighbors remains relatively equal across the season in which an individual is sampled. If conflict between neighbors reduces within a season, the relationship between body mass and territorial conflict (i.e., relatedness to and familiarity with neighbors) will become weaker over the season. We have two reasons to suspect that this is not the case in the Seychelles warbler. First, observations in the field suggest that territorial interactions, such as those arising when a new territory is established, continue throughout the season and often into the following season. Second, our analyses of neighbor familiarity show that new neighbors are more costly (in terms of mass and telomere loss) than neighbors that were familiar from the previous season. If conflict between neighbors diminishes within the course of a single season, we would be unlikely to detect this difference. Nonetheless, the temporal component of conflict resolution is likely to be very important in understanding social interactions more generally (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>); it would be extremely interesting to test for fine-scale variation in the duration of conflict resolution between social partners of different relatedness and familiarity.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Long-Term Benefits of Neighbor Kinship and Familiarity.</title><p>Telomere shortening is exacerbated by the damaging effect of oxidants that arise in the body as a result of metabolic processes and other factors (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In wild animals, more rapid telomere shortening can arise through poor internal state (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) or suboptimal environmental conditions (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and is known to predict survival in the Seychelles warbler (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and other species (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). We found that focal males experienced less telomere attrition when they were more related to their male neighbors, but only when they had many neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). We suggest that exacerbated telomere shortening results from the physiological stress of continued conflict with neighbors, which reduces the amount of time and resources that can be spent creating antioxidant defenses and maintaining somatic condition more generally. Males who are in greater conflict with neighbors over territory boundaries must spend more time patrolling borders, singing, and engaging in physical competition; it seems logical that the degree to which these costly activities hinder somatic maintenance depends on the number of borders to maintain. In the same way that body mass appears to reflect variation in territorial conflict in the immediate term, telomere dynamics appear to reflect longer-term somatic damage. Perhaps more intriguing is the finding that neighbor familiarity had different influences on telomere dynamics according to the focal male&#8217;s relatedness to his neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). High numbers of new male neighbors were associated with greater telomere shortening, but high neighbor relatedness appeared to mitigate that relationship. This complex interaction between relatedness and familiarity illustrates the difficulty in separating kin-selected and non&#8211;kin-selected pathways to cooperation: Depending on the relative strength of each mechanism, one may obscure the other.</p><p>Each new neighbor has a unique set of spatial demands depending on its resource requirements, competitive ability, and personality traits, and these require potentially costly renegotiation of the territory boundary (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). If the new neighbor is a relative, negotiation costs may be less severe, as the neighbor&#8217;s interests are likely to be more aligned with those of the focal individual. If not, the focal individual will benefit most by keeping that neighbor for as long as possible to avoid constant renegotiation (which is potentially harmful and costly) with new neighbors. Selection for maintenance of relationships with familiar competitors is known more formally as the dear enemy phenomenon (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). With regard to the current study, we suggest that dear enemy-type interactions are responsible for the observed relationships between neighbor familiarity and both body mass and telomere dynamics.</p><p>Despite evidence that properties of the social neighborhood are related to both body mass and telomere dynamics, we found no relationship between any neighborhood properties and the short-term survival of either focal males or focal females. This is perhaps not surprising, given the stochasticity and potential confounds inherent in survival measures (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and the fact that our relatively small sample size may be sufficient to detect only very strong survival differences. It is also possible that a relationship between territorial cooperation and survival would manifest over longer timespans. In this study we considered the effect of the social neighborhood on survival over a specific period of an individual&#8217;s life, but survival-based consequences of heightened territorial conflict may manifest over entire lifetimes. Given the established association between telomere length and survival in the Seychelles warbler (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), it can nonetheless be reasonably concluded that the observed physiological stress associated with heightened territorial conflict detrimentally impacts individual fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Genetic and Social Relatedness Measures.</title><p>Evidence to date suggests that kin discrimination in birds is based on indirect cues of relatedness, such as matching phenotype (e.g., recognizing similarity in song) or spatial location (e.g., assuming individuals in a natal territory are kin) (<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Unfortunately, we were unable to accurately assess social relatedness in the current dataset; we therefore used genetic pairwise relatedness to infer kinship between focal individuals and their neighbors. However, high levels of extrapair paternity in this species (<italic>ca</italic>. 40%) (<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) lessen the extent to which genetic relatedness matches social relatedness. This raises the question of why we found that genetic relatedness between neighbors affects not only their propensity to fight but also the degree to which they benefit from each other. We envisage two possible reasons: (<italic>i</italic>) Seychelles warblers use indirect phenotypic and spatial cues to discriminate kin, but the effect of perceived (social) relatedness on territorial costs is so strong that we were still able to detect it using genetic relatedness; or (<italic>ii</italic>) Seychelles warblers use genetic cues to determine kinship and are responding directly to genetic relatedness. Previous work in the Seychelles warbler suggests that relatedness is estimated using association cues (<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), suggesting that the former possibility is more likely. However, there is some evidence in other bird species for direct use of allelic similarities to discriminate kin, especially in regard to odor recognition (<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It would be extremely interesting to repeat the analyses we describe here with measures of social relatedness in both this and other social species.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Sex Differences in Costs of Territoriality.</title><p>In all components of our investigation, we found evidence that territorial costs are mediated by kinship and familiarity for males but not for females. Focal female body mass and telomere length did not vary with any properties of the social environment, and females did not appear to fight more with certain types of neighbor (although the small sample size admittedly limits our interpretation of this result). In addition, focal male territoriality costs appear to be much less dictated by the identity of female neighbors than that of male neighbors. Interestingly, our finding that only males seem to respond to the social environment fits with the pattern of female-biased dispersal distance previously reported in the Seychelles warbler (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>); perhaps selection favors reduced dispersal distance in males to promote kinship and familiarity with neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Spatial Confounds in Social Neighborhoods.</title><p>Because kin- and, to some extent, familiarity-based neighborhoods form as a result of short-distance dispersal (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), an alternative explanation for our results is that individual differences in dispersal strategy drive both the formation of social neighborhoods and variation in physiological costs. One such confound could manifest through variation in territory quality: If individuals from high-quality territories are selected to disperse shorter distances (and remain in a high-quality area of the population), high neighbor relatedness may be linked to measurements of physiological cost in the absence of a causal relationship. While important to consider, we suspect that this is not the case in our population for three reasons. First, remaining in a high-quality area should be equally as important for females as for males, but our results show that only focal males benefit from living in areas of high neighbor relatedness and familiarity. Second, our analysis of longitudinal &#8710;Mass shows that focal males gain mass when they become more related to male neighbors, suggesting that changes in relatedness, rather than initial individual quality, drive this relationship. Last, if high territory quality drives short-distance dispersal, we would expect a consistent presence of strong kin neighborhoods in high-quality areas of the island, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01">Fig. S1</xref> suggests that the occurrence of high neighbor relatedness actually varied spatially across the years of our study. Taken together, these arguments suggest that differences in territorial costs as a result of relatedness and familiarity between neighbors, rather than viscosity among high-quality individuals, explain the results we present here.</p><fig id="sfig01" fig-type="supplementary-material" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. S1.</label><caption><p>Heat maps showing the distribution of (left to right) variation in relatedness to male neighbors, number of new male neighbors, and neighbor density across the population of Seychelles warblers on Cousin Island, 2006&#8211;2010.</p></caption><graphic id="gra6" xlink:href="pnas.1704350114sfig01"/></fig><p>However, spatial confounds could also manifest through other pathways, such as inbreeding depression. Inbreeding influences the evolution of dispersal strategies in many species (<xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and has been shown to reduce the telomere length (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and reproductive success (<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) of Seychelles warblers. However, there is no evidence of inbreeding avoidance with respect to partner choice in this species (<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), and recent work demonstrated that dispersal distance is not driven by inbreeding avoidance (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); together, these suggest that individuals with more-related neighbors may actually be more inbred (and hence lower in quality). Since the potential confound of inbreeding is predicted to drive a relationship in the opposite way to our hypothesis (specifically, individuals in strong kin-based neighborhoods may be more inbred and hence lower, rather than higher, in quality), we find it unlikely to explain our results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s12"><title>Conclusions</title><p content-type="flushleft">The degree to which kin selection and mutualistic benefits can resolve conflicts between interacting animals remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in evolutionary biology. In Seychelles warblers, we show that not only it is possible for both these pathways to reduce the costs of conflict over space but also that they can interact with each other and with the social environment to differentially affect costs of territoriality. We also provide evidence that the benefits of peaceful boundaries are related to the rate at which an individual accumulates physiological damage (as measured through telomere attrition), suggesting that interactions between neighbors have the potential to significantly affect fitness and population structure. Our results also highlight the importance of sex differences in determining how mitigating conflict can be beneficial and suggest a complex interplay between kinship and familiarity that can help explain the causes and consequences of behavioral conflict more generally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s14"><title>Field Data.</title><p>We collected data from the population of <italic>ca</italic>. 250 adult Seychelles warblers living on <italic>ca</italic>. 110 territories on Cousin Island, Seychelles, which has been subject to intensive individual-level monitoring since 1997 (<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In this period the population has been the source of two conservation-based translocations to other islands [in 2004 (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and 2011 (<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>)]. To exclude potential disruption of the population density and resource availability after these translocations, here we focus exclusively on the period between 2006 and 2010, during which time there was no translocation-related disturbance to the population. Across the 5 y of the study, fieldwork was conducted during the main breeding season (June&#8211;September) and, in some years, during the minor breeding season (January&#8211;March). Each season, as many birds as possible were caught using mist nets and, if not already ringed, were given a unique British Trust for Ornithology metal ring and three-color rings for individual identification. A <italic>ca</italic>. 25-&#181;L blood sample was taken at each catch. Body mass (to 0.1 g), tarsus length (to 0.1 mm), and time of catch (early: 06:30&#8211;11:00 h; midday: 11:00&#8211;15:00 h; or late: 15:00&#8211;18:00 h) were also recorded and used to calculate residual body mass, which we used in analyses of immediate physiological condition (see below). This sampling regime is identical to that used in previous years, meaning that <italic>ca</italic>. 96% of birds in the population were already ringed and genotyped at the start of this study (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Our dataset contained longitudinal samples from 58 focal breeding males and 38 focal breeding females (herein, &#8220;focal males&#8221; and &#8220;focal females,&#8221; respectively) that were initially caught (within this study period) between 2006 and 2008, with at least one repeat catch by 2010. We monitored the presence of each focal individual in the population after their final catch. Since dispersal from the island is virtually absent (<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and resighting probability is extremely high, focal individuals could be confidently assumed to be dead if they were not seen for two successive main breeding seasons after their final catch (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>In every main breeding season, each territory was surveyed to determine the identity of the dominant breeding pair (easily recognized through courtship and pair behavior) and the presence of any subordinate birds living in the territory (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We distinguished between males and females based on molecular sexing (see below). Groups forage exclusively within their own territory and defend territory boundaries from conspecifics, so we could accurately identify these boundaries based on behavioral observations (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). During surveys of territory boundaries and group composition, we also opportunistically observed physical fights at boundaries. Fights are extremely fast and hard to follow, but, where possible, we recorded the identity of the birds involved in the fight and the boundary at which the fight occurred. This yielded a total of 35 observations of fighting between a focal individual and identified neighbors. Under this sampling regime, the likelihood of observing a fight increases with the amount of time spent surveying a territory, but surveying effort was relatively equal across territories, so we do not expect this to bias our analysis. Seychelles warblers are insectivorous, and territory quality in each main breeding season was measured as insect density per unit of foliage in each territory, following Brouwer et al. (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). In each main season, we produced a map specifying each territory&#8217;s location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), drawn based on a grid system of static poles that cover the island at 50-m intervals (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) and georeferenced in ArcMap 10.3 (ESRI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://esri.com">https://esri.com</ext-link>).

We included interactions between neighbor density and each of the other social neighborhood properties and also tested whether the number of new neighbors had a differential effect on &#8710;RTL and survival depending on mean neighbor relatedness (mean relatedness &#215; number of new neighbors, separately for male and female neighbors). We included three covariates: (<italic>i</italic>) the focal individual&#8217;s mean territory quality [accounting for environmentally induced differences in physiological costs (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)], (<italic>ii</italic>) mean group size [the number of independent resident birds in the territory, accounting for variation in per-capita territorial resources (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>)] across the sampling period, and (<italic>iii</italic>) age at first sampling to account for age-related differences in telomere dynamics (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the analysis of &#8710;RTL we also included the time (in years) between first and last sampling.</p><p>The spatial nature of our data posed a risk of nonindependence: If two focal individuals lived in adjacent territories, they would be included in each other&#8217;s neighborhood and hence have the potential to influence each other. The correlation between neighborhood properties of neighboring focal individuals was consistently low (<italic>ca</italic>. 0.2) and therefore was unlikely to influence our results. However, there is also the potential for spatial autocorrelation between the social neighborhood and undetected environmental factors. We therefore tested whether similarity in individual body mass and telomere dynamics was related to the spatial proximity of two individuals. Using ArcMap 10.3, we calculated the center point of each territory using the spatial map of 2006 as a template and calculated the distance in meters between each of these center points. Using the ncf package in R, we calculated Moran&#8217;s I (<xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and the significance values of the residuals of regression models of each response variable on all neighborhood properties. Moran&#8217;s I was not significantly different from zero for the residuals of any of the predictor variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig04">Fig. S4</xref>), and a visual inspection of the distribution of neighborhood properties across the island did not reveal any spatial grouping of neighborhood relatedness, familiarity, or neighbor density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01">Fig. S1</xref>), so we conclude that spatial structure is unlikely to have influenced the results of our analyses.</p><fig id="sfig04" fig-type="supplementary-material" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. S4.</label><caption><p>Correlograms showing the pairwise similarity in model residuals between focal Seychelles warblers as a function of the distance between their respective territories.
