At present, PCa treatments are primarily made on the basis of tumor stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, histological grading, Gleason score, and lymph node metastasis [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the relatively small tumor size and complex structure that requires careful pathologist-guided dissection, novel biomarkers are needed to evaluate disease progression and prognosis to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p><p>Significant efforts have been focused on genomics analysis, including copy number, methylation, and sequence classification. In recent years, there has been a rapid increase of information about prostate cancer genomics. Genomic instability, such as losses or gains of copy number, are a hallmark of PCa cells and are speculated to reflect the potential of malignancy of PCa and to influence patient outcome. Previous studies have shown the gain of MYC and the losses of PTEN and TP53 to be of prognostic value in prostate cancer [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hieronymus [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that DNA copy number alteration (CNA) burden in prostate cancer genomes, defined as the percentage of the tumor genome affected by CNA, was associated with recurrence and metastasis. There has been little progress in discovering the other prognostic genomic markers targeted by various common amplifications and deletions in recent years, in part due to limited prostate cancer cohorts with complete genomic and clinical outcome data.</p><p>C10orf116 is overexpressed in obese individuals and in human adipose tissues. There are few reports on the functional study of this gene in the literature. C10orf116 has been shown to differ in different pathological grades of ovarian carcinoma and nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, germline polymorphisms at rs4934282 (C10orf116) are associated with ovarian cancer survival [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In prostate cancer, only 1 study showed that C10orf116 is a potential prostate cancer biomarker in urinary exosomes [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to explore the biological significance of C10orf116 (mRNA expression and CNA) in PCa.</p><p>In this study, we identified differently expressed genes and investigated the potential correlation between C10orf116 CNA and clinical features in PCa by using the public databases Oncomine, cBioPortal, and TCGA. We found that C10orf116 loss was associated with high pathological stage, high clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis in PCa, and that the C10orf116 copy number was highly correlated with PTEN copy number and mRNA expression. Our study shows that the copy number loss of C10orf116 is a promising biomarker for assessing prostate cancer progression and recurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, and C42B were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

The 4 microarrays were: Liu Prostate Statistics covering 44 cases of prostate carcinoma and 13 cases of prostate gland tissues, Vanaja Prostate Statistics covering 27 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma and 8 prostate gland tissues, Varambally Prostate Statistics covering 7 cases of prostate carcinoma and 6 prostate gland tissues, and Wallace Prostate Statistics covering 69 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma and 20 prostate gland tissues. According to the ranked P value, the top 20 genes that were significantly downregulated (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1.09E-4) and the top 20 genes were significantly upregulated (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1.26E-4) were retrieved from the Oncomine database by analyzing these 4 independent microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 1</xref>). Among the 40 identified dysregulated genes in PCa, 3 genes (C10orf116, AMACR, and TPM4) showed a consistent change of over 2-fold in the 4 microarrays. AMACR and TPM4 genes have been studied extensively as potential cancer drivers in PCa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-medscimonit-23-5176">Table 1</xref>).

A total of 273 PCa patient samples with complete clinical data in a cohort of TCGA were analyzed. Among these, we found that more than 23% of cases had C10orf116 deletion (including homozygous deletion and hemizygous deletion), which suggests the important roles of C10orf116 loss in PCa (data no shown). We therefore assessed C10orf116 copy number status in PCa by checking data in cBioPortal.</p><p>We first evaluated their prognostic value in PCa patients from TCGA data using a Kaplan-Meier plotter. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on copy number status. We found that C10orf116 loss was associated with shorter distant relapse-free survival than C10orf116 Not-loss [HR=1.912 (1.03&#8211;3.549), <italic>P</italic>=0.0039, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 3</xref>]. Because there were fewer deaths in cBioPortal, we did not analyze the relationship between C10orf116 copy number status and overall survival. We also analyzed the association between C10orf116 copy number status and clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer. C10orf116 copy number status was significantly associated with pathological stage, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-medscimonit-23-5176">Table 2</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.009, <italic>P</italic>=0.011, and <italic>P</italic>=0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in C10orf116 copy number change based on age or Gleason score. In multivariable analysis, Gleason score and neoplasm status were significantly associated with DFS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-medscimonit-23-5176">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, C10orf116 loss is not an independent predictor for higher risk of recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>C10orf116 copy number is correlated with PTEN copy number and mRNA in PCa</title><p>We then compared mRNA levels by C10orf116 copy number alteration in cBioPortal to elucidate the underlying mechanism of C10orf116 loss. Surprisingly, C10orf116 copy number alteration was not correlated with C10orf116 mRNA expression levels (<italic>P</italic>=0.0985, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that C10orf116 mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with DNA methylation (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 4B</xref>). In cBioPortal, to determine whether DNA methylation influences the association between DNA copy number and mRNA expression, the patients were divided into high-methylation and low-methylation groups using the median of DNA methylation values as a cutoff. When the Pearson correlation coefficients between the copy number and mRNA expression of C10orf116 were calculated in the high- and low-methylation groups, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the copy number and the gene expression in the low-methylation groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.0003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 4C</xref>), but there were no significant differences in the high-methylation groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.0658, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings suggest that methylation has a greater effect on gene expression of C10orf116.</p><p>PTEN is the most common tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer (PCa) [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and its loss is correlated with poor pathologic and clinical outcomes [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the potential correlation between C10orf116 copy number and PTEN loss. We found that C10orf116 copy number was highly correlated with PTEN copy number and mRNA expression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-23-5176">Figure 4E, 4F</xref>). Then, we downloaded the copy number data of C10orf116 and PTEN based on the study of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. A total of 7 prostate cancer cell lines were included, and they had the same copy number of alternations in C10orf116 and PTEN. Furthermore, the copy number loss of C10orf116 and PTEN was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer cells. Results in different prostate cancer cell lines are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-medscimonit-23-5176">Table 4</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PCa is a very heterogeneous disease and has different clinical manifestations, from indolent to aggressive tumors with poor progression-free survival. Therefore, early diagnosis and identification of PCa aggressiveness are important prerequisites for efficient treatment of patients [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. PSA, as a serum marker, is the only biomarker that is widely used for diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. However, PSA is organ-specific but not cancer-specific, and it is not able to differentiate between indolent and aggressive PCa. Many research groups are committed to investigating new molecular biomarkers of PCa to improve risk assessment and treatment strategies. Recently, biomarker research has shifted to use of &#8220;-omics&#8221; methods, including DNA, RNA, and DNA methylation. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-ERG fusion gene is absent in approximately 50% of prostate cancer patients. Clinically, PTEN loss and MYC gain are associated with prostate cancer recurrence [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we found a potential PCa biomarker-C10orf116 gene by searching the Oncomine database. It was deregulated in PCa tissues and cells compared with adjacent tissues or prostate gland cells. In the TCGA prostate cancer dataset, we found that the mRNA of C10orf116 was not significantly associated with pathological stage, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, or recurrence (data no shown). Thus, we focused on C10orf116 copy number alteration in further research. Firstly, we found C10orf116 loss was associated with poor DFS by analyzing data of 273 PCa patients, but it was not identified as an independent risk prognostic factor for DFS. Secondly, we found that C10orf116 loss was associated with higher pathological stage, higher clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis in PCa. In lymph node metastasis prostate cancer cell lines, such as NCI-H660 and LNCaP clone FGC, we also found the copy number is lost between C10orf116 and PTEN. These findings all demonstrate that the copy number loss of C10orf116 and PTEN was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer. Moreover, we found that C10orf116 copy number was normal in 22Rv1 cells with relatively lower clinical stage. These findings suggest that C10orf116 copy number alteration has a role in evaluating PCa progression and risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of C10orf116 loss in PCa.</p><p>Studies confirmed that promoter region CPG island methylation-induced gene inactivation in the tumor suppressor gene is an important mechanism of tumorigenesis [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Intriguingly, the results of DNA methylation showed that C10orf116 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with C10orf116 methylation in PCa. However, there were no significant correlations between the copy number and the gene expression in the high-methylation groups. We speculated that the expression of C10orf116 might be regulated by both copy number loss and promoter methylation.</p><p>C10orf116, located at 10q23.2, is highly expressed in adipose tissue and is localized primarily within the nucleus. Scientists earlier found that there may be several deletions in the 10q23-26 chromosomal region [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] because of the frequent loss of PTEN and its neighboring genes in prostate cancer [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-23-5176" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Due to sharing the same location at 10q23.2 with PTEN, it is possible that C10orf116 loss is critical in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. We also found that C10orf116 copy number was highly correlated with PTEN copy number and mRNA expression. However, our study is limited by insufficient sample information to perform survival analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified a PCa risk-associated gene based on copy number loss and expression of C10orf116 by analyzing a cohort of 273 PCa cases. As a predictive indicator, C10orf116 loss contributes to understating of the biology of aggressive changes in PCa and aids in evaluating patient prognosis. However, more samples need to be investigated before practical clinical use of the signature.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Xiaolin Zhou and Xin Huang
