The Scoring Algorithm for Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was used to classify patients into low or high risk groups based on a 52-gene signature.

Adding 52-gene risk profiles to the Gender, Age and Physiology (GAP) index significantly improved its mortality predictive accuracy. Temporal changes in SAMS scores were associated with changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) in two cohorts. Untreated patients did not shift their risk profile over time. A simultaneous increase in up score and decrease in down score was predictive of transplant-free survival (HR:3&#183;18&#183; 95%CI 1&#183;16, 8&#183;76, P=0&#183;025) in the Pittsburgh cohort.

The following steps summarize the calculation of SAMS Up and Down scores: Step 1: Geometric mean normalization - We subtract the log<sub>2</sub> value of the gene from the geometric mean of the same gene in all the samples in the cohort. A gene with a positive value is considered increased, and a gene with a negative value is considered decreased. Step 2: Determination of increased and decreased ratios &#8211; This ratio is calculated by dividing the number of genes changed in a certain direction (increased or decreased) in a sample divided by the number of genes expected to change in the same direction. The 52-gene signature contains 7 increased and 45 decreased genes. Thus the increased ratio is calculated by dividing the number of actually increased genes by 7 and the decreased ratio is the number of actually decreased genes divided by 45 (see example in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplement</xref>). Step 3: Sums of the values of increased or decreased genes are calculated per sample. Step 4: Calculation of the scores - the up score is derived by multiplying the sum of the values of the increased genes by the increased ratio and the down score by multiplying the sum of the decreased genes by the decreased ratio. Because the gene expression values are log<sub>2</sub> &#8211; the up score will be positive and the down score will be negative</p><p id="P14">To determine 52-gene risk profiles in each independent cohort, patients with up scores above the median value and down scores below the median value in each cohort were classified as &#8220;high risk&#8221;. Patients without this pattern of expression were classified as &#8220;low risk&#8221;. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify significant differences in SAMS scores between cohorts.

Because two cohorts (Yale and Imperial college) did not contain transplants, we used different outcome definitions, transplant-free survival (TFS) in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Freiburg and BWH-HMS and mortality in Yale and Imperial College. The association between genomic risk profiles and outcomes was determined by univariate Cox Proportional-Hazard models. For TFS, both transplants and deaths were considered events. To determine whether genomic risk profiles were predictive of the predetermined clinical outcomes, we pooled the data from all cohorts and adjusted for age, gender, percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) and immunosuppressive therapy, defined as the use of prednisone, azathioprine, or a combination of both at the time of blood draw. Multivariate competing risk<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Cox proportional-hazard<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> models were applied to the pooled data to determine association with mortality or TFS respectively. For mortality analyses in the pooled data, transplants were considered a competing risk (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Differences in mortality and TFS between patients with high and low risk genomic profiles were evaluated using cumulative incidence and Kaplan Meier curves, respectively. To test whether 52-gene risk profiles could improve outcome prediction when used in combination with the GAP index<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, we fit competing risk<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Cox proportional-hazard<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> models as follows: GAP only, genomic only, GAP and genomic or the G-GAP index. The G-GAP index was calculated by adding three points (the maximum score in the GAP index) to the GAP index if a patient had a high risk genomic profile and no points if they had a low risk profile. To determine the prediction accuracy of these models and to compare their predictive performance, we used time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for censored data<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and Area Under the Curve (AUC) using a 10-fold cross validation procedure. Pooled data analysis results were adjusted by patient&#8217;s age, gender, immunosuppression use and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%). MMP7 and 52-gene risk profiles where compared head-to-head using the Concordance index (C-index), an equivalent of the area under the curve (AUC) in a receiver operator curve (ROC), a well-accepted measure of the probability that predicting the outcome is better than chance. <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

Trends in SAMS scores and forced vital capacity volumes (FVC) were plotted to identify shifts in genomic risk profiles over time. To identify statistically significant differences in up and down scores, and FVC across time between high and low risk patients, we used a linear mixed-effect (LME) model<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> with random intercepts. A linear mixed-effect model with random intercepts was also used to study the associations between changes in up and down scores and changes in FVC in patients with simultaneous measurements. LME models were adjusted by patient&#8217;s age, gender and therapy (immunosuppression therapy in the Pittsburgh cohort and anti-fibrotic therapy in Yale). Anti-fibrotic therapy was initiated after baseline sample was collected and defined as the use of Pirfenidone or Nintedanib. To determine the association between changes in SAMS scores and survival, we calculated the relative changes in up and down scores for each IPF patient based on their first two visits, adjusting to the duration of time intervals. Thus, for each one of the Pittsburgh cohort patients with at least two visits (N=66), we calculated the relative changes in both scores per month, from one to six months (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary methods</xref>). Patients were classified as high risk if relative changes in up and down scores between two subsequent visits occurred simultaneously and were &#8805;10% (bidirectional changes). A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine the association between bidirectional changes in SAMS scores and TFS. Results were adjusted by patient&#8217;s age, gender, FVC and immunosuppressive therapy. Finally, we used a LME model to compare the rate of FVC decline per year in IPF patients from the Yale cohort who had a simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in up score (N=6) from those with other time course changes in SAMS scores (N=16), after initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy.

A high risk, 52-gene profile was independently predictive of mortality (HR 2&#183;18, 95% CI 1&#183;53, 3&#183;09, P&lt;0&#183;0001) or TFS (HR 2&#183;04, 95%CI 1&#183;52, 2&#183;74, P&lt;0&#183;0001) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b and c</xref>) after adjusting for age, gender FVC% and immunosuppressive therapy in the pooled dataset. To account for possible cohort heterogeneity, we also performed multivariate competing risk and Cox PH models stratified by cohort in the pooled data and the results did not differ significantly (HR 2&#183;36, 95% CI 1&#183;67, 3&#183;35, P= 1.3e-6 for mortality and HR 2&#183;08, 95% CI 1&#183;54, 2&#183;80, P= 1.6e-6 for TFS). Because of the known adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy on survival of patients with IPF<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we repeated the analysis only on patients that did not receive immunosuppression. A 52-gene, high risk genomic profile was also independently predictive of mortality (HR 2&#183;27, 95% CI 1&#183;54, 3&#183;35, P&lt;0&#183;0001) or TFS (HR 2&#183;13, 95%CI 1&#183;54, 2&#183;96 P&lt;0&#183;0001) in this dataset, after excluding patients under immunosuppressants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). A prediction model based on the calculated G-GAP index outperformed all other prediction models studied (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>) and significantly improved accuracy prediction of mortality or TFS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d and e</xref>).

Here, we analyzed the 52-gene signature in the peripheral blood from 425 IPF patients from six independent cohorts. Using the novel Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS), we derived risk profiles from the 52-gene signature that identified two classes of IPF patients with significant differences in outcome in all six cohorts. The prediction accuracy of 52-gene risk profiles was better than serum concentrations of MMP7 and adding 52-gene risk profile information to the clinical GAP index significantly increased its prediction accuracy. Temporal analysis revealed that untreated patients generally did not change their risk profiles; however, simultaneous increase in up score and decrease in down scores was predictive of subsequent transplant-free survival. In patients initiated on anti-fibrotic therapy, a simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in down score was associated with stabilization of FVC.</p><p id="P26">The recognition of the variable clinical course in IPF led to a substantial effort to identify clinical tools and reliable peripheral blood biomarkers for risk stratification. Changes in peripheral blood proteins such as MMP7<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, ICAM and IL8<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, SP-A and SP-D<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, KL-6<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, CCL-18<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, YKL40<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, CXCL13<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, POSTN<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, anti-hsp70 IgG antibodies<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and protease degradation products<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, have been found to be predictive of poor IPF outcomes. Changes in circulating cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, fibrocytes<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and Semaphorin 7a<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>), gene polymorphisms (TOLLIP<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, TLR3<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and MUC5B<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>) and aging biomarkers (Telomere length<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, free mitochondrial DNA<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>) have also been associated with mortality in IPF. While these studies strongly suggested the value of peripheral blood biomarkers for risk stratification in IPF, no marker is currently used in clinical practice. This is, in part, because the majority of the studies did not have truly independent replication cohorts, nor did they demonstrate added value over clinical staging tools. In contrast to previous studies, our study provides validation of our 52-gene expression signature in six independent IPF cohorts and demonstrates a substantial improved accuracy when incorporated with currently used clinical tools. This is important, because accurate outcome prediction has very practical implications for IPF patients. Based on the current lung allocation score, and on their clinical characteristics, nearly all of the patients in our study would be referred for transplant evaluation, and many would be eligible for lung transplantation. However, our data suggests that only patients with a high risk genomic profile could require this evaluation urgently, and many may not require lung transplantation even three to five years after diagnosis. Thus, incorporating 52-gene risk profiles in the evaluation of IPF patients, may enhance the precision of lung transplantation referral &#8211; avoiding delays in transplants to those who need it early, and delaying those who may not need it. Similarly, when lung transplantation is not an option, this test could also help physicians deciding when to refer IPF patients to palliative care, a currently significant unmet need<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> or distinguish patients who respond to drug therapy from those who do not. Similarly, the majority of previous studies did not assess the change of markers over time. This is important, as it is unknown whether IPF patients shift their risk profiles. We demonstrate that a patient&#8217;s 52-gene, genomic risk profile rarely changes in the absence of anti-fibrotic therapy. However, when the profile does change it is important. In untreated patients, a simultaneous increase in up score and decrease in down score reflects subsequent increased mortality.</p><p id="P27">In patients treated with anti-fibrotic agents, a simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in down score, reflects stabilization or even increase in FVC. Thus, our study demonstrates that 52-gene risk profiles at presentation are predictive of outcome and changes in a patient&#8217;s genomic risk profile are informative of clinical deterioration as well as potential response to anti-fibrotic therapies.</p><p id="P28">While our study focuses on the biomarker applications of the 52-gene signature for risk stratification in IPF, it could also serve to generate hypotheses for follow up studies. We have previously shown that four genes of this signature (<italic>CD28</italic>, <italic>ICOS</italic>, <italic>LCK</italic> and <italic>ITK</italic>), that belong to the T-cell co-stimulatory signaling pathway, were correlated with the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T cells in the circulation of these patients<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that changes in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with CD28 down-regulation<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> of IPF patients are also associated with poor disease outcomes. These reports suggest a potential link between changes in the expression of genes in the 52-gene signature with phenotypic shifts in circulating immune cells. Similarly, a recent report suggested that down-regulation of T cell co-stimulation markers is associated with T cell exhaustion and poor outcomes in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. While IPF is not generally considered an autoimmune disease, T cell exhaustion is a mechanism that should be explored as a potential explanation of our findings. Additionally, other members of the 52-gene expression signature may have also some clues about the role of immune aberrations in IPF. As an example, MCEMP1 (mast cell-expressed membrane protein 1) one of the outcome predictive genes when overexpressed, encodes a transmembrane protein isolated from human mast cells<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, known to work in concert with fibroblasts to aggravate pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> or FLT3 (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) a strong Nintedanib-responsive tyrosine kinase with unknown roles in pulmonary fibrosis. While such studies were beyond the scope of this paper, they could potentially shed light on the role of immune aberrations in IPF.</p><p id="P29">Despite the impressive reproducibility of our findings, we need to recognize some of the limitations of our study. First, SAMS scores were calculated for each individual after normalization within each cohort. The normalization within cohort was required because the data was obtained by different technologies using RNA extracted from whole blood or PBMC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This of course limits the clinical applicability of our results because the expressions of the 52 genes of an entire IPF cohort need to be available for the calculation of the genomic risk profile of an individual patient. For our results to be implemented in the clinic, we would need to generate a set of reference values for the 52 genes in IPF patients. Such reference values could be used to calculate SAMS up and down scores for every new sample and determine the 52-gene risk profile of patients, independently of a specific cohort. The significant reproducible performance of the 52-gene signature, should encourage the development of this reference set and the standardization as an essay for clinical use. Second, we did not determine the specificity of the 52-gene signature to IPF. To assess the effect of aging, we analyzed the 52-gene signature in control individuals older than 90 years of age<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>), and found that it was not predictive of mortality in the aged, but we did not study other chronic lung disease. Third, treatment guidelines have changed in IPF in some cohorts, patients were at least initially on immunosuppressive therapy, which it is well known, affect outcome. However, the 52-gene signature was originally discovered in a cohort (Chicago cohort) where only two out of 45 patients were on immunosuppressive therapy at study entry. Such small number of patients under immunosuppression should not account for the transplant-free survival and mortality prediction accuracy of the signature. To further address this, we performed a separate analysis in which we excluded all patients on immunosuppressive therapy at the time of blood draw. The 52-gene signature was predictive of outcome in this population indicating that immunosuppression did not confound our results. Fourth, our initial predictive model was not adjusted to DLCO because we had missing data especially among high risk patients who did not have DLCO measurements performed at the time of blood draw. However, we did address the effect of DLCO indirectly, through the comparison to the GAP index. DLCO is a component of the GAP index, and adding the 52-gene risk profile to the GAP index significantly improved its outcome predictive accuracy. Finally, our longitudinal analysis was limited by the size of cohorts and the difference between them, however we have demonstrated significant reproducibility on two observations, that untreated IPF patients do not generally shift their genomic risk profile and that 52-gene SAMS scores are significantly associated with FVC. The observation that in treated high risk patients, a simultaneous decrease in up score and increase in down score is associated with a significant stabilization of FVC is intriguing, but will require replication, as it is based on a very small number of patients.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the 52-gene risk profiles are reproducible predictors of outcome in IPF patients. The enhanced outcome prediction accuracy when 52-gene risk profiles are added to the GAP index (G-GAP index) and the association of changes in genomic risk profiles with changes in FVC, survival and potential response to anti-fibrotic therapy, indicate the potential value of the 52-gene signature as a blood test to risk stratify and monitor disease in IPF. To develop this blood test, we would need prospective studies that specifically address some of the limitations of our study including, the establishment of universal reference values for the 52 genes, a prospective comparison to other molecular markers, and determination whether the 52 gene signature is predictive or associates with acute exacerbations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S26"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplement</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS908286-supplement.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e965" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><p><bold>Funding:</bold></p><p>Jose D.

We used the search terms &#8220;Pulmonary Fibrosis&#8221;, &#8220;biomarkers&#8221;, &#8220;outcome prediction&#8221;, and &#8220;blood&#8221; and did not use language or date restrictions. We identified multiple studies that assessed the value of proteins carried in the blood stream to predict outcome in IPF. When we added the term gene expression we identified two relevant studies, one that assessed the correlation of the peripheral blood transcriptome with extent of fibrosis, and our own previous study that discovered the 52 gene signature, but did not include a complete validation of the signature or assessment of its change over time and in response to novel therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P32">In this study, we developed a genomic risk scoring system (SAMS) based on the 52-gene signature, and tested it on 425 patients from six independent cohorts from Academic Centers in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. We identified two groups of IPF patients (low and high risk) with significant differences in mortality or transplant-free survival in each of the six cohorts (HR 2&#183;03&#8211;4&#183;37). Pooled data revealed similar results for mortality (HR 2&#183;18, 95%CI:1&#183;53&#8211;3&#183;09, P&lt;0&#183;0001) or transplant-free survival (HR: 2&#183;04, 95%CI: 1&#183;52&#8211;2&#183;74, P&lt;0&#183;0001). Adding 52-gene risk profiles to the Gender, Age and Physiology (GAP) index significantly improved its outcome predictive accuracy. Temporal changes in SAMS were associated with changes in forced vital capacity in two cohorts. Untreated patients tended not to change their risk profiles, but some high risk patients started on antifibrotic therapy experienced a reversal of their high risk profile. Change in 52-gene risk profiles after initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy was associated with a significant (P=0&#183;005) improvement in Forced Vital Capacity.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P33">The 52-gene signature is a reproducible predictor of mortality and transplant-free survival in patients with IPF that can improve the performance of the GAP index. The signature correlates with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and without therapy, patients do not shift their risk profile. Limited data suggest that a reversal of a high-risk genomic profile is associated with stabilization of FVC. Prospective studies are required to establish the value of the 52-gene signature as a marker for response to antifibrotic therapy in IPF.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
