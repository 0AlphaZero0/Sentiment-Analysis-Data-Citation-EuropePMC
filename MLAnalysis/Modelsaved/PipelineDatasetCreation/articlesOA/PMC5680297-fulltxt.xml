The p32/ C1qbp gene functions as an essential RNA and protein chaperone in mitochondrial translation, and is indispensable for embryonic development. However, little is known about the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction of p32 deletion in the brain development. Here, we found that mice lacking p32 in the central nervous system (p32cKO mice) showed white matter degeneration accompanied by progressive oligodendrocyte loss, axon degeneration and vacuolation in the mid brain and brain stem regions. Furthermore, p32cKO mice died within 8 weeks of birth. We also found that p32-deficient oligodendrocytes and neurons showed reduced oligodendrocyte differentiation and axon degeneration in primary culture. We show that mitochondrial disruption activates an adaptive program known as the integrated stress response (ISR). Mitochondrial respiratory chain function in oligodendrocytes and neurons is, therefore, essential for myelination and axon maintenance, respectively, suggesting that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in the central nervous system contributes to leukoencephalopathy.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mitochondria are responsible for the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and also play vital roles in &#946; oxidation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, and in the production of pro-apoptotic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Brain development and neural migration were examined by H&amp;E staining and were observed to be intact and the cell bodies of the neurons appeared normal in p32cKO mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Brain sections from p32cKO mice showed moderate bilateral and symmetrical vacuolation (spongiform degeneration) within the pons, medulla and midbrain, but not in the cerebral or cerebellar cortices (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These small vacuoles were first observed in the pons at 2 weeks of age and, thereafter, vacuoles number and size were greatly increased compared with control mice (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). These vacuoles were negative for lipids by staining with Oil red O (data not shown). p32cKO brain sections stained with Kluver&#8211;Barrera (KB) showed severe demyelination (myelin breakdown) or hypo-myelination throughout the white matter (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Similar but smaller vacuoles were also present in the spinal cord (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that deletion of p32 by nestin-Cre leads to reduced development of white matter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>p32 deficiency results in astrogliosis and reduced synaptogenesis</title><p id="Par10">The brain is made up of many cells, including neurons and glial cells.

The neuronal cell marker &#946;III-tubulin was expressed and localized in p32cKO somata and well-developed neurites, similar to wild-type mice, suggesting that neural cell bodies were intact in p32-deficient neurons. A significant decrease in synaptophysin immunoreactivity found in the cerebellar nucleus of p32cKO mice suggested synaptic loss. Neurofilament immunohistochemistry showed many small bundles of disrupted axons throughout the white matter in p32cKO mice, suggesting that axon degeneration occurred in white matter regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Astrogliosis is among the most common features of neurodegeneration. GFAP immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the vacuolated areas of the white matter, especially in the pons, medulla and midbrain regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that degeneration of axons and dendrites is likely to be responsible for the loss of normal neuronal functions in p32cKO mice. Microglia can have both positive and detrimental roles in inflammatory processes. We found that Iba1- or CD11b-positive cell numbers were not increased in 6-week-old p32cKO mice, suggesting no inflammation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Oligodendrocyte degeneration</title><p id="Par12">Oligodendrocytes are essential for myelination and metabolic support of motor axons.

Similar to H&amp;E staining of the white matter, we detected significant oligodendrocyte pathology of spongiosis, demyelination and hypomyelination (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Interestingly, the vacuoles appeared to be embedded in the circle of CNPase staining, suggesting that these vacuoles may be generated by degeneration of oligodendrocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Furthermore, a small number of Olig2-staining cells (a marker for oligodendrocyte precursor cells) observed in the demyelinated areas of p32cKO mice was attributed to either a myelination or a remyelination failure because of the absence of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).

The main finding is that p32 knockout leads to neurological dysfunction and to development of symmetrical and bilateral encephalopathy characterized by spongiosis, demyelination and astrogliosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The lesions are restricted to white matter regions that contain oligodendrocytes and neural axons. In primary cultures, p32cKO oligodendrocytes showed reduced differentiation and differentiation of wild-type oligodendrocytes was inhibited by rotenone, suggesting that oligodendrocyte differentiation might depend on respiratory chain activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Wild-type and p32cKO primary neurons showed similar neurite outgrowth, which depends on glycolytic activity; however, axonal generation was reduced in p32cKO primary neurons because of respiratory chain dependency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These result suggested that forebrain sections from p32cKO mice showed spongiform degeneration within the pons, medulla and midbrain, but not in the cerebral or cerebellar cortices (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, p32-deficient and wild-type astrocytes showed similar degrees of growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), because maintenance in these cells is less dependent on respiratory chain dysfunction or glycolysis activity.

This shift results in depletion of important myelin components, which initially disrupts axon-glial interactions and is a probable driver of subsequent hypo-myelination or demyelination in respiratory chain-deficient-related leukoencephalopathy. Finally, we propose a mechanism by which the mTOR pathway is impaired in p32cKO mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Taken together, activation of a maladaptive ISR, mTOR pathway and disruption of lipid metabolism homeostasis secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction might be critical pathological mechanisms in p32-related leukoencephalopathy.</p><p id="Par32">Three weeks after birth, we observed decrease in food intake and movement of p32cKO mice.
