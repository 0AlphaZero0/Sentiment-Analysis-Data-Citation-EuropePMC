Development of anti-GvHD therapies that do not adversely affect susceptibility to infection or graft-vs.-tumor immunity are hampered by the lack of a physiologically relevant, preclinical model of allogeneic HSCT. Here we show a spectrum of diverse clinical HSCT outcomes including primary and secondary graft failure, lethal GvHD, and stable, disease-free full donor engraftment using reduced intensity conditioning and mobilized peripheral blood HSCT in unrelated, fully MHC-matched Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques. Anti-GvHD prophylaxis of tacrolimus, post-transplant cyclophosphamide, and CD28 blockade induces multi-lineage, full donor chimerism and recipient-specific tolerance while maintaining pathogen-specific immunity. These results establish a new preclinical allogeneic HSCT model for evaluation of GvHD prophylaxis and next-generation HSCT-mediated therapies for solid organ tolerance, cure of non-malignant hematological disease, and HIV reservoir clearance.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Rhesus macaques are not ideal for studying response to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) owing to complex MHC genetics that prevent full MHC-matching.

Despite high-resolution MHC-matching and aggressive immunosuppressive regimens, GvHD is the leading cause of post-allogeneic HSCT non-relapse morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 60% of allogeneic HSCT recipients are estimated to develop GvHD, with survival rates as low as 5% in patients with advanced grade steroid-refractory acute GvHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, new immunomodulatory modalities are needed that selectively limit GvHD while retaining infectious disease immunity and the protective graft-vs.-tumor effect of allogeneic HSCT.</p><p id="Par4">The development of GvHD treatments requires a reproducible and accurate animal model capable of recapitulating human physiology and pathology. Large animal HSCT models utilizing dogs, pigs, or sheep are limited by the availability of species-specific reagents such as immunophenotyping antibodies. Murine GvHD models have provided important mechanistic insight into the development and pathology of the GvHD immune response, yet direct clinical translation of findings from the mouse model is often hindered by species-specific differences between murine and human immune systems, homogenous genetics of inbred mouse strains, divergent anatomical sources of human and murine donor cells, and the dysregulated microbiome of mice raised in pathogen-free housing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. By contrast, given their close phylogenetic proximity to humans, nonhuman primates (NHP), such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, provide physiologically relevant models for a range of degenerative, genetic, age-associated, and infectious human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, immunotherapeutics can directly cross-react with both the human and macaque targets, allowing rapid translation of new laboratory discoveries into clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Rhesus macaques are an outbred NHP population with remarkably complex MHC genetics. Each animal expresses up to twenty MHC-I molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, thereby precluding their use as a preclinical model of fully MHC-matched allogeneic HSCT. By contrast, Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques (MCM), an insular population that underwent a population bottleneck ~400 years ago, have only seven fully characterized MHC haplotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here we show that fully MHC-matched MCMs can be used for an ideal preclinical model of allogeneic HSCT, mirroring a range of clinical outcomes including graft rejection, lethal GvHD, CMV reactivation, and recipient-specific tolerance during full donor T&#160;cell chimerism. These results establish a new, physiologically relevant model of fully MHC-matched allogeneic HSCT for addressing critical challenges in HSCT treatment, such as the development of novel GvHD prophylactic regimens to disentangle graft-vs.-host and graft-vs.-tumor immunity, and provide a platform for testing experimental HSCT applications, such as HSCT-mediated clearance of the latent HIV reservoir.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Engraftment failure in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques</title><p id="Par6">Due to the complex immunogenetics of rhesus macaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, previous NHP allogeneic HSCT experiments have primarily utilized single MHC haplotype-matched donor-recipient pairs, which invariably results in either host-mediated graft rejection or donor-mediated acute lethal GvHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Even HSCT between fully MHC-matched sibling rhesus macaques generated only transient mixed donor chimerism with minimal T&#160;cell engraftment ending with either graft rejection or lethal infectious disease complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To overcome the limitation posed by rhesus macaque MHC genetic complexity, we set out to establish an allogeneic HSCT model based on MCM, a geographically isolated NHP population with highly limited immunogenetic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Indeed, unrelated fully MHC-matched donor-recipient MCM pairs for allogeneic HSCT could readily be identified (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To ensure the clinical relevance of the model, we adopted protocols utilized in patients at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Bone Marrow Transplant Department including a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen of busulfan, fludarabine, and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), peripheral blood stem cell mobilization of donors, and GvHD prophylaxis of tacrolimus plus methotrexate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Following RIC and fully MHC-matched HSCT, the first recipient, animal 32851, experienced primary engraftment failure characterized by extended leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia eventually necessitating euthanasia (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). No donor chimerism was detected in whole blood as measured by a DNA surveyor nuclease assay targeting a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differing between donor and recipient (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This primary engraftment failure was likely a consequence of the sub-optimal CD34+ stem cell dose (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Leukapheresis procedures on NHP weighing &lt;10&#8201;kg remains a technical challenge, precluding the routine use of peripheral blood mobilized stem cells in NHP experiments. To overcome this obstacle, we optimized the leukapheresis collection parameters specifically for donor MCM as small as 3.5&#8201;kg and performed multiple procedures per donor, resulting in the ability to consistently achieve more optimal CD34+ stem cell doses for all subsequent HSCT (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of hematopoietic stem cell transplants in MHC-matched Mauritian cynomolgus macaques</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>N.D. not determined</p><p>Table summarizes the eight HSCTs performed in this study, listed in chronological order.

</p><p id="Par7">The next two recipients, 32846 and 32849, underwent the same RIC regimen described above, but received HSCT containing higher CD34+ stem cell doses (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Donor chimerism was initially detected in the whole blood of both recipients, as measured by the DNA surveyor nuclease assay, but in both recipients the donor signal was rapidly lost despite immunosuppression with tacrolimus and methotrexate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In 32846, the appearance of whole blood donor chimerism was accompanied by a rebound in the white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts at day 11 post-transplant, but donor signal disappeared along with a sharp decline in WBC at day 14, indicating graft rejection. Indeed, the WBC and platelets rebounding at day 21 were recipient-derived. In contrast, the transient donor chimerism in 32849 was not accompanied by a change in WBC and the recipient immune system did not rebound, resulting in euthanasia. Because the DNA surveyor assay is only qualitative, we also utilized quantitative deep sequencing across SNPs, which confirmed the transient donor chimerism in blood measured by the DNA surveyor assay (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) from 32846 revealed induction of potent donor-specific T&#160;cell immunity post-HSCT, suggesting active host T&#160;cell immune-mediated rejection of the graft (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Based on these results, and the observation that fludarabine incompletely depletes CD3+ T cells in MCM (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), we replaced fludarabine in the conditioning regimen with a CD3-specific immunotoxin (CD3-IT) previously shown in NHP to mimic the lymphocyte depleting activities of anti-thymocyte globulin in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Despite the ability of CD3-IT to potently reduce CD3 counts in NHP, the variability of NHP CD3 sequences has precluded wide usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, every MCM examined to date expresses the highly susceptible CD3 sequence, suggesting CD3-IT will be universally effective in MCM (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We utilized this new conditioning regimen to perform a second HSCT in 32846 using the same donor (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Despite significant depletion of peripheral CD3+ T cells by CD3-IT, we observed no donor chimerism and the graft was again rejected, likely due to strong anti-donor immunity in residual, tissue-resident recipient T cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>). Thus, sufficient minor histocompatibility antigens exist between fully MHC-matched MCMs to lead to immune-mediated rejection of allogeneic cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development of lethal GvHD post-HSCT in MCM</title><p id="Par8">Given the ability of CD3-IT to effectively deplete recipient T cells, we next explored if the improved CD3-IT-containing RIC regimen might facilitate full engraftment in MCM lacking donor-specific immunity. Two HSCT-naive MCMs, 33450 and 33455, received the CD3-IT, busulfan, and low-dose TBI RIC regimen followed by fully MHC-matched HSCT (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In contrast to previous transplants, whole blood donor chimerism was present as early as day 1 post-HSCT and detected at every subsequent time point (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Both recipients experienced a massive expansion of WBC and CD3+ T&#160;cell counts, and concomitantly reached full donor chimerism in whole blood (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). At day 12 post-HSCT, 33450 was reported for extensive hand rubbing and itchy palms, a clinical harbinger of GvHD. Indeed, despite immunosuppression with methotrexate and tacrolimus (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>), both animals progressed rapidly with clinical symptoms of GvHD involving the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract necessitating euthanasia (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Most striking was the emergence of erythematous rash and exfoliative dermatitis, which upon microscopic analysis exhibited the GvHD hallmarks of vacuolar interface dermatitis and necrotic keratinocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Importantly, these changes were observed in hair follicles, excluding interface drug eruption as a potential cause. Both animals also developed anorexia, weight loss, and diarrhea, indicating gastrointestinal GvHD. Indeed, histologic features of GvHD were present throughout gastrointestinal tract tissues, including partial to complete destruction of crypts characterized by high numbers of apoptotic crypt epithelial cells and near-complete loss of intestinal villi (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Independent, blinded quantification of the histopathological changes confirmed extensive GvHD in skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, mirroring the clinical symptoms observed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Given the high level of GvHD pathology, we next measured the level of donor T&#160;cell chimerism and T&#160;cell activation within affected organs such as the liver, colon, and jejunum, as well as in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Consistent with the GvHD-mediated destruction of recipient tissue, the majority of T cells within affected organs and lymphoid tissues were donor-derived (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).

</p><p id="Par10">Quantitative assessment of donor chimerism in peripheral blood granulocytes and CD3+ T cells revealed that 34666 was 100% donor chimeric in both cellular compartments by day 32 post-HSCT, although a transient decrease in T&#160;cell chimerism occurred before again returning to full donor T&#160;cell chimerism at day 151 post-HSCT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Full donor engraftment in both granulocytes and T cells was subsequently maintained throughout the remainder of the study. In contrast, 33454 initially achieved only mixed chimerism, with 100% granulocyte chimerism and 51% T&#160;cell donor chimerism in peripheral blood at day 28 post-HSCT. Because recipients with mixed donor chimerism are at increased risk of graft rejection and malignant disease relapse, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are commonly performed to achieve 100% donor chimerism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed a series of DLIs with escalating doses in 33454. Although an immediate increase in T&#160;cell chimerism followed the first DLI, a total of three DLI procedures spread over nearly 1 year were required to reach full T&#160;cell donor chimerism (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">12</xref>). The DLI procedures were well tolerated and we observed no clinical signs of GvHD due to the infusion of donor lymphocytes in the absence of immune suppression. The extent of donor chimerism across immune cell subsets in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue mirrored that of the whole blood values with 100% of all immune cells in 34666 being of donor origin in both anatomical locations while 33454 exhibited split donor chimerism with 100% CD8+ T&#160;cell chimerism, yet only 80% donor chimerism in the B-cell compartment in lymph node (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Both post-transplant cyclophosphamide and CD28 co-stimulation blockade can eliminate the development of alloreactive T cells and induce T&#160;cell anergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Given the durability and extent of donor engraftment without GvHD, we performed in vitro MLR to assess recipient-specific alloreactive cellular immune responses. In both 33454 and 34666, the engrafted T cells exhibited complete tolerance to recipient antigens (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). However, this immune tolerance towards recipient cells was not simply the result of a defective immune system. Following HSCT, CMV reactivation occurred in both recipients, one of which was treated with short-term valganciclovir. CMV viremia was subsequently controlled to undetectable levels in both recipients in the absence of treatment, and we detected strong CMV-specific immune responses (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In particular, 33454 developed anti-CMV T&#160;cell responses directed against epitopes not recognized pre-HSCT or in the stem cell donor. Therefore, post-transplant cyclophosphamide and CD28 costimulation blockade GvHD prophylaxis is able to induce recipient-specific tolerance while maintaining infectious disease immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par12">Together, these data demonstrate that fully MHC-matched MCM represent an ideal model of allogeneic HSCT, recapitulating many clinical outcomes of RIC allogeneic HSCT such as primary and secondary graft failure, GvHD, mixed donor chimerism with responsiveness to DLI, CMV reactivation and subsequent control, and durable full donor multi-lineage chimerism. The establishment of this robust, pre-clinical model will facilitate experiments across a range of regenerative medicine applications to help translate new therapies into the clinic. Our studies have revealed conditions that generate rapid onset graft rejection and GvHD between fully MHC-matched MCM undergoing allogeneic HSCT, which can be exploited for subsequent studies. Overall, this minor antigen alloreactivity mirrors the immune response in patients receiving HSCT grafts from MHC-matched unrelated and related donors and thus augurs well for the clinical relevance of this model. Indeed, a direct extension of the research presented here is the exploration of novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens such as the post-transplant cyclophosphamide, belatacept, and tacrolimus regimen that induced full donor chimerism and recipient-specific tolerance in fully MHC-matched MCM. Experimental approaches to limit GvHD through modulation of the T&#160;cell content in stem cell grafts such as depletion of naive cells can also be tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Further, because many human reagents cross-react with macaque targets, novel investigative GvHD prophylaxis therapeutics can be directly tested. For example, the Tim-3/Gal-9 and TIGIT negative checkpoint receptor pathways are implicated in GvHD severity, and we have previously shown macaque cross-reactivity for human-specific reagents targeting these pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The limited, defined MHC genetics of MCM allows for straightforward selection of donor-recipient pairs exhibiting any degree of MHC matching desired without the need for specialized macaque breeding programs. This is especially advantageous for modeling HSCT-induced tolerance across MHC barriers for solid organ transplantation. In addition to the ability to select fully MHC-matched donor-recipient pairs as demonstrated here, MHC haplotype-mismatched MCM can be used to investigate approaches such as HLA-haploidentical HSCT treatments being proposed for patients with aplastic or sickle cell anemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising therapeutic tool for regeneration of damaged tissue and the first clinical iPSC transplants were recently completed successfully<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, rejection of fully MHC-matched allogeneic iPSCs has been documented, and avoiding rejection is a major clinical goal as banks of human iPSCs are currently being established for use in allogeneic transplants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The model described here facilitates testing strategies to avoid rejection of transplanted allogeneic iPSC without inducing tumors in the recipient.</p><p id="Par14">The use of fully MHC-matched MCMs for allogeneic HSCT also represents a powerful new tool for identifying mechanisms leading to HIV reservoir clearance following HSCT.

Inherent difficulties in studying HIV cure in patients undergoing HSCT for cancer such as lack of standardization of ART, immune conditioning, HSCT source and dose, immune suppression regimens, ethical considerations of ART interruption, and limitations on tissue sampling of patients hamper research into the mechanisms involved in purging the latent reservoir. Therefore, the allogeneic HSCT NHP model described here will accelerate HIV cure research by facilitating a rigorous and controlled investigation of the mechanisms of post-HSCT HIV reservoir clearance.

MCM were sedated with 10&#8201;mg/kg ketamine intramuscularly then anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane throughout the procedure. Following a surgical cut-down to the femoral artery, femoral arterial catheters (16 gauge, 8-inch intracath) were placed at the femoral triangle. One intravenous catheter was used as the blood return line from the leukapheresis machine and the other was used as a blood sampling port. Peripheral blood cells were then collected via leukapheresis using a Spectra Optia apheresis system. The Spectra Optia is designed for human donors with no less than 300&#8201;ml total blood volume (TBV). Due to the small size of MCM donors (~3&#8211;5&#8201;kg with TBV ~180&#8211;300&#8201;ml), 120&#8201;ml of ABO-matched, leukocyte-reduced priming blood was first primed through the Spectra Optia to ensure a safe donor hematocrit throughout the procedure.

Red blood cells were removed from the leukapheresis product by ficoll density gradient and mononuclear cells subsequently washed twice in 50&#8201;ml PBS. Stem cells were isolated by staining with CD34-PE (Biolegend, Inc. &#8211; clone 561) and magnetic separation with anti-PE beads (Miltenyi, Inc.). CD34+&#160;stem cell and CD3+T cell (BD Bioscience &#8211; clone SP34-2) frequencies in the positive and negative sorted fractions were assessed on a Becton Dickinson LSRII. Based on this data, CD34+ stem cell and CD3+ T&#160;cell doses were calculated and final infusion product was resuspended in 50&#8201;ml sterile PBS. Donor grafts were infused at a rate of 2&#8201;ml/min during which time recipient animals were monitored for immunological reactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Donor chimerism measurement</title><p id="Par21">SNP loci distinguishing donor and recipient genomes were identified using a custom 128 SNP array designed to genotype polymorphic loci distributed across the macaque genome adapted from Kanthaswamy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. DNA (6.25&#8201;ng) from each macaque was enriched for target regions using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix in conjunction with a custom TaqMan PreAMP pool, following manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations (Life Technologies). Enriched DNAs were diluted 1:10 in 1&#215; TE buffer before being loaded onto OpenArray chips using the QuantStudio 12K Accufil System and assayed on a QuantStudio 12k Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Techonologies). The resulting amplification and allele discrimination plots were visualized with TaqMan Genotyper v1.3 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to determine SNP genotypes. Donor engraftment was measured via two separate donor chimerism assays, a qualitative DNA surveyor assay performed in real time to inform clinical decisions (shown in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and a post hoc quantitative deep sequencing assay (shown in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In some cases, tissue mononuclear cells were sorted for CD45+, CD3+, or CD33+ cells by Miltenyi sorting prior to extracting genomic DNA for chimerism assays using APC-conjugated antibodies and anti-APC microbeads. For each animal, a panel of regions containing SNPs was amplified from genomic DNA, Sanger sequenced, and analyzed in Geneious (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). SNPs were chosen for donor-recipient pairs if heterozygous for the donor and homozygous for the recipient, or vice versa. To assess early chimerism in real time, gDNA was isolated from whole blood as stated previously. The appropriate SNP was amplified from the donor and recipient pre- and post-HSCT using the PCR conditions listed above. The amplicon was PCR purified and quantified by NanoDrop. The Surveyor Mutation Detection kit (IDT, cat. no. 706020) protocol was followed. Briefly, 400&#8201;ng of amplicon DNA from each time point in a total of 20&#8201;&#956;l dH<sub>2</sub>O containing 2&#8201;ul 10&#215; PCR buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific cat. no. 18067017) was hybridized by annealing slowly from 95&#8201;&#176;C to 25&#8201;&#176;C in a thermocycler to allow formation of a heteroduplex/homoduplex mixture at the SNP site. The mixture was treated with 2.5&#8201;&#956;l MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#8201;&#956;l dH<sub>2</sub>O, 1&#8201;&#956;l Surveyor Nuclease S, and 1&#8201;&#956;l Surveyor Enhancer S and incubated at 42&#8201;&#176;C for 35&#8201;min. A no-nuclease control was included. Samples were run on a 2% agarose gel, stained with SybrGold (Life Technologies), and photographed with a UV imager. Lanes containing SNP-heterozygous DNA have both a ~220&#8201;bp band (homoduplex) and a lower (~110&#8201;bp) band, comprising both halves of the heteroduplex amplicons cleaved by Surveyor Nuclease S. Lanes containing SNP-homozygous DNA have a single, uncleaved 220&#8201;bp band. Post-HSCT, the Surveyor assay can detect chimerism as low as 5%, though the assay is qualitative. To assess donor chimerism quantitatively post hoc, the SNP of interest from the recipient was amplified from gDNA from either whole blood or sorted cells (flow cytometric sorting described below) and prepared for deep sequencing with NEXTflex Rapid DNA Sequencing Bundle kit as described above, with the following modifications: 50&#8211;75&#8201;ng of each amplicon is used per reaction, in an equimolar ratio to any different SNPs occupying the same barcode. All reagents were used at one-third the volume and the final PCR (conditions in step C1) was eight cycles. The samples were run on an Illumina Miseq with a 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;250 kit and analyzed in Geneious. To determine percent chimerism, the calculations used were (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;percentage of sequences containing the donor nucleotide) for a heterozygous donor/homozygous recipient, or 100&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;(2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;percentage of sequences containing the recipient nucleotide) for a homozygous donor/heterozygous recipient, or the percentage of sequences containing the donor nucleotide for homozygous different donor and recipient. Initially, two or three SNPs were utilized and averaged to determine donor chimerism, but given the consistent accuracy of the assay, subsequent experiments utilized only one SNP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>CMV monitoring and treatment</title><p id="Par22">Cynomolgus macaque cytomegalovirus (CyCMV) levels in plasma were monitored via quantitative PCR. Plasma was concentrated by centrifugation at &gt;20,000&#8201;rcf at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8201;h, after which supernatant was removed to leave 200&#8201;&#956;l volume. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from plasma using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Quantitative PCR targeting a 121-bp region of CyCMV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> was carried out in 20&#8201;&#956;l reactions by combining 5&#8201;&#956;l of extracted viral nucleic acid, 10&#8201;&#956;l TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life Technologies), 1.5&#8201;&#956;l of each 6&#8201;&#956;M primer (forward: 5&#8242;-GGGCATTCTCAGGATCACAG-3&#8242;; reverse: 5&#8242;-TGACACCAAGAGGGTATGGG-3&#8242;), and 2&#8201;&#956;l probe (5&#8242;-FAM-ACTCTGAAGACCACAAGGACCCACG-BHQ-3'). Sample reactions were run in duplicate in MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) alongside no template control reactions and standard reactions containing ten-fold serial dilutions of standard (10 copies to 10<sup>7</sup> copies per reaction, in duplicate). Plasmid (pCEP4) containing the 121-bp CyCMV target region served as the standard. Plates were run on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: 95&#8201;&#176;C 00:20, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#8201;&#176;C 00:01, 60&#8201;&#176;C 00:20. CyCMV genome copy number in each sample reaction was calculated according to the standard curve, and then adjusted for the proportion of viral nucleic acid added to the reaction (typically 1/6) and initial plasma volume (typically 1&#8201;ml) to obtain CyCMV genome copies per ml plasma. Sample reactions undetectable for CyCMV by quantitative PCR are reported as 0. When CyCMV levels &gt;500 copies/ml were identified in plasma, treatment was initiated with 10&#8201;mg/kg oral valganciclovir SID, and subsequently escalated to 10&#8201;mg/kg oral valganciclovir BID until levels reached undetectable levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>CMV immunity</title><p id="Par23">CMV-specific T&#160;cell responses were assessed by interferon-&#947; enzyme-linked immunospot assay (IFN-&#947; ELISPOT) using Monkey IFN-&#947; ELISPOT Plus ALP kit (Mabtech), following manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.

After staining, whole blood was resuspended in 1&#8201;ml FACS Lysing Solution (BD) to lyse red blood cells and fix remaining cells, incubated at room temperature for 8&#8201;min, washed three times with FACS buffer, and collected on a BD LSRII instrument. All flow cytometric analysis was performed using Flow Jo (Tree Star, Inc.). T&#160;cell frequency was defined as the percentage of CD20-CD3+ cells within the live CD45+ singlet population. Mobilized HSCT donor macaques were monitored for stem cells in peripheral blood by whole blood staining, conducted as described above, staining for CD45, CD34, and viability (Live/dead Yellow Fixable, Invitrogen). Stem cell frequency was defined as the percentage of CD34+ cells within the live CD45+ singlet population.
