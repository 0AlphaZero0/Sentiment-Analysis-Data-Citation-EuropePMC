Two genes, <italic>EXT1</italic> and <italic>EXT2</italic>, located at 8q24.11 and 11p11.2, respectively, have been identified as causing HME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

According to this protocol, patients were initially diagnosed on the basis of radiology. Subsequently, a geneticist performed a genetic analysis of the patients. All patients&#8217; parents and guardians gave written informed consent, and the ethics committee of our hospital approved the study protocols.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical phenotype study</title><p id="Par12">Patients&#8217; characteristics, including sex, age of onset, and height, were recorded. Because deformities of the spine, hands, and feet were not obvious, the radiological assessment consisted of only a bilateral upper-extremity anteroposterior view with the elbow extended and the forearm supinated, a lateral view of the elbow flexed at 90&#176;, and long standing anteroposterior radiographs of the lower extremities, including the pelvis. On these plain films, exostoses at the proximal and distal ends of the long bones were recorded at 24 anatomic locations (12 on each side of the body). Stature percentiles were determined according to national growth charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Forearm deformities and lower-extremity malalignments were the most common and obvious deformities of appearance. When assessing forearm deformities, we noted that forearms with exostoses at both the distal radius and ulna without obvious deformities or proportional shortening of the radius and ulna cannot be classified according to the Masada classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, we defined these deformities as type 0 and established the following ordinal grading system for forearm deformities: Grade 1, no exostoses of the distal forearm; Grade 2, exostoses of the distal radius or ulna without shortening of either bone or proportionate shortening; Grade 3, exostoses of the distal ulna or radius resulting in a relatively shortened ulna and a bowing radius or a relatively shortened radius, including Masada type I and type III; and Grade 4, exostoses of the distal ulna, a relatively shortened ulna, and a dislocated radial head, described as Masada type IIa and type IIb (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). On standing plain films, the normal coronal plane alignment of the lower extremities is determined by the mechanical axis passing from the centre of the femoral head to the ankle; mechanical axis deviation (knee varus or valgus) occurs if the axis is not past the centre of the knee joint.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

Mutations in <italic>EXT1</italic> and <italic>EXT2</italic> were responsible for 60 and 32% of the cases in this study, respectively. These mutation frequencies are similar to those in Western populations but are quite different from those in a mainland China population in a previous study (14% <italic>EXT1</italic> and 33% <italic>EXT2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These findings suggest that regional differences in <italic>EXT1</italic> and <italic>EXT2</italic> mutation frequencies occur in China.

The prevalence of forearm deformities is as high as 30&#8211;60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our data are in accord with this prevalence; we found that 53% (49 of 92) of forearms showed obvious deformities. Taniguchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that increasing forearm involvement was associated with HME diagnosis at an earlier age, a greater number of generalized exostoses, a shorter stature, a greater number of exostoses affecting the knee, and increased valgus deformity of the ankle. By contrast, we found no correlations between the grade of forearm deformity and the age of onset or stature. However, strong associations with the number of involved anatomical sites and lower limb malalignment were observed; the more severe the forearm deformity, the higher the number of anatomical sites involved and the greater the lower limb malalignment. Meanwhile, we found no predominant side when comparing the forearm deformities; the degree of forearm deformity on both sides was similar, which is in contrast to J&#228;ger et al. who reported more exostoses affecting the right side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In this study, we used a scoring system to assess the severity of the clinical phenotype. Forearm deformity and lower extremity malalignment were selected to represent limb deformities, and the age of onset, stature, and number of involved anatomical sites represented the general aspect of exostoses. After the grade of the deformities was defined, it was easier to evaluate the severity of the clinical phenotype according to the total score: the higher the score, the more severe the phenotype. Although there were no significant differences between the two genotypes regarding these parameters except for height, the total score of patients with <italic>EXT1</italic> mutations was higher than that of patients with <italic>EXT2</italic> mutations. This result is consistent with previous investigations indicating the more severe clinical phenotype of <italic>EXT1</italic> mutations.</p><p id="Par29">Some authors have reported sex-dependent differences in HME; the prevalence seems to be higher in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and male patients usually present with more exostoses and shorter stature than females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our data corroborate these reports; 72% (33 of 46) of our patients were male, and we observed more lesion sites in male patients. However, there were no gender-related differences in any other parameters.</p><p id="Par30">Our results demonstrated the age-related phenotypic penetrance of HME. As the exostoses continue to enlarge until epiphyseal fusion occurs, the number of involved anatomical sites increased with age; forearm deformities and lower extremity malalignments became more severe in older children; and the total score showed a strong association with age (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We did not observe the most severe complication, malignant transformation, in this study because this complication is also age-related; it is usually diagnosed at an average age of 31&#160;years and seldom occurs in the first decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, Schmale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported two cases of skeletally immature patients who presented with malignant transformation. Therefore, adolescent patients should be followed carefully to detect signs of early malignant transformation.</p><p id="Par31">We note several limitations of this study. First, this was a cross-sectional study; as most clinical manifestations are age-related, a longitudinal observational study would decrease the risk of confounding factors. Second, the sample size limitation may have led to some bias. Third, the study was based on radiographic measurements and did not include an evaluation of functional impairment. Finally, the scoring system used in this study may be arbitrary; however, there are still no universally accepted criteria to categorize phenotype severity, although several methods have been mentioned to grade severity. The five factors used to evaluate severity in this study are characteristic traits of HME, but they need to be further verified by statistics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">In this study, we have confirmed that several clinical features of HME in Chinese patients are similar to those in most Western populations. Patients with HME are frequently of short stature; in this study, patients with <italic>EXT1</italic> mutations were shorter in stature compared with <italic>EXT2</italic> patients, but we did not observe any significant differences between other parameters including age of onset, number of involved anatomical sites, forearm deformities and lower limb malalignment. However, it would seem that patients with <italic>EXT1</italic> mutations have a more severe clinical phenotype compared with those with <italic>EXT2</italic> mutations, which we demonstrated in terms of the total score by our scoring system. Although this study has some limitations, it may be helpful for further research on HME.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HME</term><def><p id="Par5">Hereditary multiple exostoses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HS</term><def><p id="Par6">Heparan sulfate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MLPA</term><def><p id="Par7">Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p id="Par8">Polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Yuchan Li, Jian Wang and Zhigang Wang contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p>Yuchan Li, Jian Wang and Zhigang Wang are co-first authors.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Haiou Yang for her technical assistance and are grateful to clinical colleagues at Shanghai Children&#8217;s Medical Center.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par33">This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81201370 and 81201353).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par34">All data are available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#8217; contributions</title><p>Study design: YL, JT.
