</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important cause of visual loss and the progressively increasing global prevalence of diabetes suggests that there will be increasing numbers of persons affected by this complication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In terms of the global epidemiology of DR, a recent pooled data analysis, including an excess of 22,000 subjects from 35 different studies, reported that the age-standardized prevalence of any DR in subjects aged 20–79 years is 34.6%, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) 6.96% and diabetic macular edema (DMO) 6.81% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This analysis did not include any studies from Africa and data on DR in African populations are sparse [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa between 1999 and 2011 reported that the prevalence of DR varied from 7% to 63% [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A previous study of African and Indian subjects with long-duration diabetes in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, showed that of 179 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 64.5% had DR, 47.9% non-proliferative DR only, 20.8% PDR and 26% had undergone laser photocoagulation therapy [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this study, the subjects with DR had higher systolic blood pressure and longer diabetes duration than those without DR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The major risk factors for the development of DR include disease duration, degree of hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and genetic factors [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A number of candidate genes have been shown to be associated with DR, including polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene, the aldose reductase (AKR1B1) gene and the angiotensin converting enzyme gene [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some studies have shown the intron 4a allele of the eNOS gene may be associated with a reduced risk of DR [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of risk factors on the development of DR has not been studied in detail in populations in Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to examine the association between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and the development of DR in a group of subjects with type 2 diabetes attending a referral diabetes clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The current study has shown that subjects with DR were older, had longer duration diagnosed diabetes, higher HbA1c, higher serum creatinine and prevalence of proteinuria, more often treated with anti-hypertensive therapy and lipid-lowering therapy and more were smokers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The study failed to show an association with polymorphisms in NOS3 or VEGF genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the prevalence and risk factors for DR has shown that the overall global prevalence of any DR in subjects aged 20–79 years is 34.6% and that of PDR is 6.96% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This report, however, did not include any studies from Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of any DR in the current study (39%) is similar to the global estimate, although more subjects with PDR were identified in the current study (15.8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Another study in an African population, conducted in Malawi, reported a similar overall prevalence of any DR to the current study (32.5%) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of retinopathy in the Diabcare Africa Study was lower than that recorded both in the current study and the Malawian study although the incomplete ascertainment of data (51% of subjects had an eye examination in the preceding 12 months), suggests that the prevalence may have been under-estimated [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The findings in the current study concur with the global meta-analysis that major risk factors for DR include diabetes duration and HbA1c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>However, although HbA1c was significant in bivariate analysis, it failed to achieve significance in multivariate analysis when controlled for other risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This may be partly accounted for by the cross-sectional nature of this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The current study failed to confirm an association between DR and blood pressure and this is possibly explained by the higher proportion of those with DR receiving anti-hypertensive therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The measured blood pressures therefore, reflect the efficacy of drug therapy, thereby mitigating the influence of recorded blood pressure on DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In addition, although data on the specific type of anti-hypertensive therapy were not collected, differences in the use of ACE-inhibitors and other anti-hypertensive agents may also partly account for this observation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis of DR is multi-factorial, hyperglycemia is a major driver of the process, leading to alteration in capillary permeability and density [11], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The current study has shown a relationship between DR and hyperglycemia in that those with DR had longer duration of disease, higher HbA1c and more subjects with DR were treated with insulin than those without DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The latter observation is probably a reflection of longer diabetes duration with greater reduction in beta-cell function necessitating treatment advancement to insulin therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>This is, however, speculative, as data on indices of beta-cell function were not collected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported nephropathy to be associated with DR [11] and the current study found proteinuria to be more frequent in subjects with DR, whereas microalbuminuria was more frequent in those without DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The association between proteinuria and DR is substantiated by the finding of higher serum creatinine in subjects with DR, suggesting perhaps more renal involvement (nephropathy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>By contrast, some studies have found an association between microalbuminuria and DR [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>A recent Chinese study found microalbuminuria to be associated with an increased risk of severe or proliferative retinopathy [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The reason for a higher frequency of microalbuminuria in subjects without DR in the current study is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>It is possible that subjects with DR had longer duration of disease and more often had established nephropathy (shown by a greater frequency of proteinuria), whereas those without DR and shorter duration of disease, had markers of incipient nephropathy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The Hoorn study found a positive relationship between cholesterol and triglyceride levels and DR in older subjects with type 2 diabetes [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The global meta-analysis also found an association between serum cholesterol and DMO [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The current study failed to show an association between total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or HDL cholesterol and DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>However, lipid-lowering therapy was used more frequently in those with DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Whether the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy altered the relationship between serum cholesterol and DR is speculative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The finding that subjects with DR had higher triglyceride levels than those without DR is possibly a reflection of poorer metabolic control in those with DR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Several inflammatory mediators have been shown to play a role in the development of DR, including VEGF, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The importance of the role of VEGF in the development of DR is underscored by the efficacy of anti-VEGF intra-ocular therapy in the management of DR and particularly in the management of DMO [12], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genetic factors have been shown to have an independent effect on the development of DR and polymorphisms in a number of candidate genes, including VEGF, NOS3 and aldose reductase (AKR1B1) have been studied [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis showed that the rs2010963 (-634 G to C) VEGF polymorphism was associated with DR in subjects with type 2 diabetes [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In a separate study, no significant association was found between the rs25648, rs1570360, rs3095039, rs35569394 and rs699947 VEGF polymorphisms and DR [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown a relation between NOS3 polymorphisms and DR, although meta-analysis has excluded most of the polymorphisms studied in this gene [7], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the generally negative studies of candidate genes in DR, the current study failed to show a relationship between three NOS3 polymorphisms and two VEGF gene polymorphisms and DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Although an independent genetic risk for the development of DR may exist, the effect size is likely to be small and require large study numbers to demonstrate positive associations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Strengths of the current study include a multi-ethnic population, allowing comparison between groups and the inclusion of gene polymorphisms in the determination of factors associated with DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Limitations include the relatively small numbers of subjects as well as the method of determination of DR; retinal photography may have improved the diagnostic assessment of DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In addition the findings, in this clinic-based study, may not be able to be extrapolated to the general population in view of the possibility of referral bias. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the current study has shown that in subjects with type 2 diabetes in KwaZulu-Natal, the well-established risk factors for DR are affirmed and a number of candidate genes failed to show an association with DR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that focus on control of hyperglycemia, blood pressure and serum lipids should remain the cornerstone of therapy, aiming at preventing the development of DR and other diabetes complications. </plain></SENT>
