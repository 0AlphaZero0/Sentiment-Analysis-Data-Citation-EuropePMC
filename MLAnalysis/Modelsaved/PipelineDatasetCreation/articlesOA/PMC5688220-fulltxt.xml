In hexaploid wheat, the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus has a major effect on the control of these processes. Studying a wheat mutant lacking <italic>Ph1</italic> provides an opportunity to explore the underlying mechanisms. Recently, it was proposed that <italic>Ph1</italic> stabilises wheat during meiosis, both by promoting homologue synapsis during early meiosis and preventing MLH1 sites on synapsed homoeologues from becoming COs later in meiosis. Here, we explore these two effects and demonstrate firstly that whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present, synapsis between homoeologues does not take place during the telomere bouquet stage, with only homologous synapsis taking place during this stage. Furthermore, in wheat lacking <italic>Ph1</italic>, overall synapsis is delayed with respect to the telomere bouquet, with more synapsis occurring after the bouquet stage, when homoeologous synapsis is also possible. Secondly, we show that in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, we can increase the number of MLH1 sites progressing to COs by altering environmental growing conditions; we show that higher nutrient levels in the soil or lower temperatures increase the level of both homologue and homoeologue COs. These observations suggest opportunities to improve the exploitation of the <italic>Ph1</italic> wheat mutant in breeding programmes.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00412-017-0630-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bouquet</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd><kwd>Meiosis</kwd><kwd>Pairing</kwd><kwd>Telomeres</kwd><kwd>Wheat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant BB/J004588/1</award-id><award-id>Grant BB/M009599/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant BB/J007188/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2015-703117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rey</surname><given-names>Mar&#237;a-Dolores</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">More than 70% of flowering plants are polyploids, most being allopolyploids. Allopolyploids such as wheat, canola, oats and cotton represent some of the world&#8217;s most important crops. Allopolyploids possess more than two complete sets of chromosomes, as a result of chromosome doubling (polyploidisation) following sexual hybridisation between related species possessing similar genomes. Production of viable gametes and subsequent fertility depends on the allopolyploid behaving as a diploid during meiosis, so that pairing, synapsis and recombination only take place between identical chromosomes (homologues) rather than between related chromosomes (homoeologues). The formation of at least one crossover (CO) link between homologous pairs (the obligate CO) is necessary for accurate segregation and balanced gametes (Zickler and Kleckner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1999</xref>). The high levels of allopolyploidy suggest that upon polyploidisation, plants may already have had mechanisms in place for meiotic sorting of homologues from homoeologues, providing the new allopolyploid with some fertility until improved by modification and stabilisation of the meiotic process.</p><p id="Par3">Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is a hexaploid species possessing three related (homoeologous) ancestral genomes (termed AABBDD), derived from three different diploid species. Each genome set consists of seven chromosomes (1A&#8211;7A, 1B&#8211;7B and 1D&#8211;7D; 6<italic>x</italic>&#160;=&#160;2<italic>n</italic>&#160;=&#160;42), possessing highly similar gene order and content. Despite similarity between homoeologues, wheat behaves as a diploid during meiosis, with every chromosome synapsing and recombining only with its true homologue. This phenotypic behaviour is predominantly controlled by <italic>Ph1</italic>, a dominant locus on chromosome 5B (Riley and Chapman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1958</xref>; Sears and Okomoto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1958</xref>). The <italic>Ph1</italic> locus most likely arose during wheat polyploidisation, rather than being already present in one of the original wheat ancestral diploids (Chapman and Riley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1970</xref>). The <italic>Ph1</italic> locus was originally discovered through scoring the metaphase I phenotype of hexaploid wheat hybrids lacking the whole 5B chromosome (Riley and Chapman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1958</xref>; Sears and Okomoto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1958</xref>) and is therefore defined as a deletion mutant phenotype in wheat and its hybrids, controlling correct pairing (Holm and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1988</xref>; Prieto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>) and suppressing homoeologous recombination (Dhaliwal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1977</xref>). However, the detailed mode of action of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus on these processes remains unclear.</p><p id="Par4">Sexual hybridisation between wheat and rye produces an interspecific hybrid containing haploid sets of wheat and rye chromosomes, which can be exploited in breeding to introgress rye chromosome segments carrying agronomic traits into wheat. However, introgression is prevented by the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, which suppresses COs between homoeologues (mean&#160;&lt;&#160;1 CO per meiocyte at metaphase I (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>)). In <italic>Ph1</italic> deleted wheat-rye hybrids, COs are increased (mean 7.8) (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), reflecting the loss of the suppressing effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> on CO formation between homoeologues. A single <italic>Ph1</italic> deletion mutant, developed in hexaploid wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) (CS <italic>ph1b</italic>, generated by Sears in 1977 (Sears <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1977</xref>)), has been used worldwide in breeding programmes to introgress wild relative chromosome segments into wheat. Further deletion mutants of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus have also been subsequently developed and exploited (Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>; Al-Kaff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">It has recently been proposed that <italic>Ph1</italic> has a dual effect during meiosis (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). The first effect takes place early in meiosis, where <italic>Ph1</italic> promotes homologous synapsis, rather than suppress homoeologous synapsis. In hexaploid wheat, ring bivalents, with occasional rod bivalents, are observed at metaphase I in all meiocytes when <italic>Ph1</italic> is present, consistent with regular homologue pairing (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). In the CS <italic>ph1b</italic> (<italic>Ph1</italic> lacking) mutant, ring bivalents, with a few more rod bivalents, are still observed at metaphase I in close to 50% of meiocytes, reflecting regular homologous pairing. In the remaining meiocytes however, a variable level of multivalents and univalents is observed, involving up to 8 of the 42 chromosomes (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). Other <italic>Ph1</italic> deletion mutants have also shown a lack of multivalents at metaphase I in variable numbers of meiocytes (Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>). Thus, although the loss of <italic>Ph1</italic> allows some homoeologues to crossover in hexaploid wheat, the fact that there are no multivalents in every single meiocyte suggests that homoeologous synapsis is not the main effect of <italic>Ph1</italic>. Consistent with this, in the wheat-rye hybrid, a similar level of overall homoeologous synapsis is achieved by pachytene whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present, indicating that homoeologous synapsis is independent of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). This led to the suggestion that <italic>Ph1</italic> may promote homologous synapsis rather than prevent homoeologous synapsis. However, it remained uncertain how homoeologous synapsis was suppressed in hexaploid wheat.</p><p id="Par6">The second effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> occurs later in meiosis, where it affects the level of CO formation.</p><p id="Par7">Immunolocalisation analysis, using the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1, revealed that <italic>Ph1</italic> affects progression of MLH1 sites to COs (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). MLH1 is part of the main class I interfering CO pathway in plants (Mezard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>) and is required for the resolution of double Holliday junctions as COs. In most species, all MLH1 sites on synapsed chromosomes become COs (Ashley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; Lhuissier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). In wheat-rye hybrids, similar numbers of MLH1 sites are detected whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). However, the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic> prevents progression of virtually all MLH1 sites to COs, preventing recombination. Conversely, the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> allows progression of one third of MLH1 sites to COs (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), suggesting a role for <italic>Ph1</italic> in the regulation of homoeologue MLH1 site resolution. In hexaploid wheat itself, independent of <italic>Ph1</italic>, similar numbers of MLH1 sites are also observed on synapsed chromosomes at diplotene (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>); however, the level of COs is only consistent with the number of MLH1 sites when <italic>Ph1</italic> is present. Thus, in <italic>Ph1-</italic>deficient wheat and its hybrids, CO level is lower than predicted<italic>.</italic> It is unclear which other factors are involved in the regulation of homoeologous COs in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, but it would be important to assess whether the level of COs can be increased further to correspond to the number of MLH1 sites observed.</p><p id="Par8">In the present study, we aim to elucidate the two effects of <italic>Ph1</italic> during meiosis. Firstly, we investigate how homoeologous synapsis is suppressed in hexaploid wheat, facilitating homologous synapsis. We also explore the timing of homoeologous synapsis in relation to the telomere bouquet and the progression of homologous and homoeologous synapsis in wheat lacking <italic>Ph1</italic>. Secondly, we assess whether it is possible to increase the number of MLH1 sites becoming COs. To do that, we investigate the effect of selected environmental factors on the progression of MLH1 into COs in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, in both wheat and wheat-rye hybrids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par9">Anthers were harvested from hexaploid wheat <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv.

However, the mechanism through which this is achieved is unknown. In most species, including hexaploid wheat, homologues gradually align and synapse during meiosis, while telomeres cluster forming a bouquet at one pole of the nucleus (Zickler and Kleckner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1999</xref>; Prieto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>; Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>; Klutstein and Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). In yeast, it has been proposed that the telomere bouquet can restrict ectopic pairing between homologous sites in non-homologous chromosomes and so promotes homologous synapsis (Niwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>; Davis and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). If homoeologous pairing is also restricted in hexaploid wheat during the telomere bouquet, this would provide an explanation of how regular bivalent formation between homologues at metaphase I is achieved in wild-type wheat. Given the number and size of wheat chromosomes in hexaploid wheat, it would be very difficult to follow the relative proportion of overall homologous versus homoeologous synapsis during the telomere bouquet stage. However, the use of wheat-rye hybrids facilitates this study. Wheat-rye hybrids possess only homoeologous chromosomes; no homologues are present. Therefore, only homoeologous synapsis can occur. We have previously shown that in these hybrids, homoeologous synapsis is observed at late zygotene and pachytene, after dispersal of the telomere bouquet (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). However, it was unclear whether this homoeologous synapsis occurred at the telomere bouquet stage or only later.</p><p id="Par26">Here, we used wheat-rye hybrids to investigate the timing of homoeologous synapsis in relation to the telomere bouquet. We combined FISH, to label the telomeres, with immunolocalisation of the meiotic proteins ASY1 and ZYP1. ASY1 is part of the lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex and is loaded before synapsis. ZYP1 is part of the central element of the synaptonemal complex and is present only where chromosomes are synapsed. For the purpose of this study, we classified the hybrid meiocytes into three groups, based on the number of telomeres detected: 1 to 5 telomere groups, defining the telomere bouquet stage (group 1); 6 to 14 telomere groups, identifying early bouquet dispersal (group 2); and more than 14 telomere groups, identifying when the telomere bouquet has dispersed (group 3). FISH and immunolocalisation analysis show that there are no long tracks of ZYP1 in wheat-rye hybrid meiocytes during the telomere bouquet, whether <italic>Ph1</italic> is present or absent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The little ZYP1 that is present in some of the cells during the telomere bouquet stage is shown by very short tracks of ZYP1 (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which may indicate an attempt to start the synapsis process, although the polymerisation process fails to progress further. In the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, 87% of meiocytes show these short tracks of ZYP1, with no ZYP1 present in the remaining meiocytes (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Conversely, when <italic>Ph1</italic> is absent<italic>,</italic> only 17% of meiocytes show short tracks of ZYP1 (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting slight delay compared to when <italic>Ph1</italic> is present. In any case, long tracks of ZYP1 are only observed after the telomere bouquet stage, whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present. Homoeologous synapsis thus mostly occurs after the telomere bouquet has dispersed (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and not during the telomere bouquet stage as happens with homologous synapsis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Homoeologous synapsis in wheat-rye meiocytes in the presence (WR+) and absence (WR&#8722;) of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus during the telomere bouquet.

However, some multivalents are observed in wheat in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), implying that there is at least some degree of synapsis between homoeologues. Even so, in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, there are multivalents in less than 50% of meiocytes; and even when multivalents are present, only up to 8 of the 42 chromosomes are involved (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). More than half of the meiocytes show regular bivalent configurations, indicating that homoeologous synapsis is mainly prevented in wheat even in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, consistent with suppression of homoeologous synapsis at the telomere bouquet stage. This suggests, as reported, that <italic>Ph1</italic> may promote homologous synapsis rather than preventing homoeologous synapsis, and in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, disruption of this process may allow a degree of homoeologous synapsis to occur.</p><p id="Par28">In order to assess the dynamics of overall chromosome synapsis in wheat and to identify any difference in the timing of synapsis in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, we combined telomere labelling and immunolocalisation of ASY1 and ZYP1 proteins. Meiocytes from wheat, in the presence and absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, were analysed from the beginning of telomere bouquet formation until the telomeres had completely dispersed. For the purpose of this study, we again divided the meiocytes into three groups, based on the number of telomere groups detected: 1 to 5, defining the telomere bouquet stage (group 1); 6 to 19, identifying early bouquet dispersal (group 2); and 20 or more telomere groups with no ASY1-ZYP1 colocalisation, identifying when the telomere bouquet is dispersed but total synapsis is not yet completed (group 3). Meiocytes with colocalisation of ASY1 and ZYP1 (occurring in wheat after pachytene) were not considered further in the analysis. Analysis suggests that the presence or absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> had no effect on the level of synapsis at the telomere bouquet stage (group 1) or during early bouquet dispersal (group 2) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, when telomeres were dispersed (group 3), the level of ASY1 labelling was higher in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, indicating a lower level of synapsis at that stage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). By the end of pachytene, most chromosomes were synapsed in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), indicating eventual completion of synapsis in most meiocytes even when <italic>Ph1</italic> was absent. These observations suggest that even if synapsis completes whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present, progression of synapsis is slower in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (as shown in group 3) with respect to the telomere dynamics.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Progression of pairing and synapsis in wheat in the presence (W+) and absence (W&#8722;) of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Immunolocalisation of meiotic proteins ASY1 (<italic>green</italic>) and ZYP1 (<italic>magenta</italic>) combined with telomeres (<italic>magenta</italic>) labelled by FISH in W+ and W&#8722; meiocytes. <bold>a</bold> During early telomere bouquet dispersal (group 2), levels of synapsis were similar in both W+ and W&#8722;. <bold>c</bold> When the telomere bouquet is dispersed but ASY1 and ZYP1 do not colocalise yet (group 3), levels of synapsis were higher in W+ revealing a delay in synapsis in W&#8722;. <bold>b</bold> FISH using Spelt 52 (<italic>green</italic>) and a telomere (<italic>magenta</italic>) probe during the telomere bouquet (group 1).

</p><p id="Par29">In order to assess whether pairing was actually delayed in groups 1 and 2, FISH analysis was performed with specific probes to distal sites close to the telomere regions and to more proximal sites (see &#8220;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>&#8221; section). Probe Spelt52 produces a single signal in the distal region of 4BS chromosomes. One signal was observed at the telomere bouquet stage (group 1), whether <italic>Ph1</italic> was present or absent, indicating that only homologues associate at the telomere bouquet stage, independent of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To study the pairing of more proximal chromosome sites, we used the specific probe 4P6, which labels seven interstitial sites on the D genome (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>) and which can be used to follow the dynamics of more interstitial sites undergoing later pairing. Meiocytes in which pairing has not occurred will exhibit 14 signals, 7 from each homologue, while meiocytes that have undergone complete regular pairing will exhibit only 7 signals. Therefore, meiocytes with either unpaired or incorrectly paired sites will exhibit between 8 and 14 signals (the probe cannot distinguish between unpaired and incorrectly paired sites). Here, meiocytes in the presence and absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> were collected at the stage of telomere bouquet dispersal (group 2, with 6 to 19 telomere groups detected), to identify any delay in pairing. In the presence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, most of the seven pairs of sites were associated, with 85.7% of them displaying 7 to 10 signals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, only 25% of the meiocytes displayed 7 to 10 signals, the remainder still showing more than 10 signals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This difference is consistent with a delay in pairing. It has been previously reported that the length of meiotic prophase I is similar whether or not <italic>Ph1</italic> is present (Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1974</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the differences in pairing or synapsis related to the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> are due to a gross difference in the timing of meiotic stages.</p><p id="Par30">Thus, both synapsis and FISH analysis suggest that in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, homologous chromosomes recognise each other during the telomere bouquet, but synapsis progresses more slowly. Since synapsis between homoeologues only occurs after the telomere bouquet, the delay of homologous synapsis in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> provides an opportunity for homoeologues to synapse after telomere bouquet dispersal. Previous yeast meiotic studies show that delayed pre-meiotic replication can subsequently delay chromosome pairing (Borde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>; Murakami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>). We have also previously reported altered pre-meiotic replication and chromatin in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> (Greer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>), proposing a possible subsequent effect on chromosome pairing and synapsis. Thus, this may explain the delayed synapsis found in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The level of CO formation in wheat and wheat-rye hybrids in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> is affected by the nutrient composition in the soil</title><p id="Par31">The above data provide an explanation for how homoeologous pairing and synapsis might occur in hexaploid wheat in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>. However, it does not tell us anything about the effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> on CO formation. Fortuitously, our wheat-rye hybrids were grown recently, with and without <italic>Ph1</italic>, for chromosome doubling experiments at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture (CSIC), C&#243;rdoba, Spain. Plants were grown outdoors in pots and treated with a modified Hoagland solution during their growth, in order to produce healthier plants for chromosome doubling. Surprisingly, when analysing the metaphase I configurations, we observed a higher level of chiasmata in plants lacking <italic>Ph1</italic> than had been previously observed in plants grown in a glasshouse or under controlled environmental conditions in Norwich UK. Some C&#243;rdoba meiocytes exhibited up to 21 chiasmata at metaphase I in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, close to that expected from the number of MLH1 sites observed on synapsed homoeologues at diplotene (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). We, therefore, tried to replicate this observation in Norwich, in order to determine which of the different C&#243;rdoba growth conditions were responsible for the increased level of chiasmata in wheat-rye hybrids lacking <italic>Ph1</italic>. It is widely accepted in wheat studies that each chiasma represents a CO (Fu and Sears <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1973</xref>); therefore, we use both terms synonymously. We first investigated whether the modified Hoagland solution or different temperature could be responsible for the increased CO number. We performed the experiments both in a glasshouse and under controlled environmental conditions, with similar results; however, only data generated under controlled environmental conditions are presented here.</p><p id="Par32">To assess the effect of nutrient concentration in the soil on homologous and homoeologous CO frequency in meiotic metaphase I, we added a modified Hoagland solution to the soil in which wheat and wheat-rye hybrids, both lacking <italic>Ph1</italic>, were growing at 20&#160;&#176;C. Under these controlled environmental conditions, the modified Hoagland solution had little effect on vegetative growth. However, the treatment significantly increased the number of ring bivalents per meiocyte in wheat lacking <italic>Ph1</italic> (a mean of 16.45 against the 15.71 without Hoagland), with a corresponding reduction in rod bivalents (3.26 with Hoagland and 4.27 without Hoagland) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). GISH labelling of the different wheat genomes (A, B and D) revealed that most ring bivalents were formed between homologues (Online Resource <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), suggesting an increase in homologous CO frequency. The treatment also increased homoeologue CO frequency in the wheat-rye hybrids lacking <italic>Ph1</italic>, shown by an increased number of ring bivalents (2.35 with Hoagland and 1.40 without Hoagland) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The number of COs increased from a mean of 8.71 (without Hoagland) to 12.09 (with Hoagland) COs per meiocyte, with up to 21 COs scored in some meiocytes. As described previously (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>), this is close in number to the 21 MLH1 sites observed on the synapsed homoeologues. Thus, both homoeologous and homologous COs can be increased in wheat lacking <italic>Ph1</italic> by altering the nutrient composition of the soil in which they are grown. Previous studies have suggested that soil nutrient composition in which plants are grown can affect CO formation (Grant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1952</xref>; Law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1963</xref>; Bennett and Rees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1970</xref>; Fedak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1973</xref>; Deniz and Tufan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>).

These results are consistent with previous studies in wheat, maize, Arabidopsis and barley, reporting that growth temperature can influence the formation of COs during meiosis (Bayliss and Riley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1972</xref>; Verde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>; Francis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Higgins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>). In contrast, wheat-rye hybrids carrying <italic>Ph1</italic> grown at either 20 or 13&#160;&#176;C exhibited 0.59 and 0.77 COs at metaphase I respectively. This level of CO is not significantly great to exploit practically. We did not study the effect of high temperatures on CO frequency in wheat (or wheat-rye hybrids) carrying <italic>Ph1</italic>, as it has already been reported that such temperatures reduce CO frequency (Bayliss and Riley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1972</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Overall, these results suggest that, in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, temperature and soil nutrient composition can affect the level of homologous and homoeologous COs in wheat and wheat hybrids. In the wheat-rye hybrids, both treatments lead to an increase in conversion of rod bivalents to ring bivalents at metaphase I. This suggests an increase in COs between synapsed homoeologues, rather than an increased association of ectopic sites. Genetic map analysis of wheat in the presence and absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> showed a similar distribution of COs along chromosomes (Dubcovsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1995</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus affects the level of MLH1-dependent class I interfering COs, but not their distribution. Thus, it is unlikely that nutrients and/or temperature treatments lead to an altered distribution of COs along synapsed chromosomes in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>. It is more likely that temperature and one or more components of the modified Hoagland solution affect the MLH1 complex activity on the double Holliday junction or affect the double Holliday junction conformation itself, allowing the junction to resolve as a CO rather than a non-CO. For instance, changes in magnesium concentration have been shown to affect the conformation of double Holliday junctions, which may then influence CO frequency (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2004</xref>; Ranjha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>The <italic>Ph1</italic> is a complex locus: proposal for the mode of action of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus</title><p id="Par37">
<italic>Ph1</italic> is a complex locus, and after almost 60&#160;years since its discovery, we still do not know its exact mode of action. Molecular characterisation of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus combined cereal synteny and wheat BAC contiging, with metaphase I analysis of mutants carrying deletions of chromosome 5B (Roberts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>; Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Al-Kaff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Finally, it was defined to a region containing a cluster of Cdk2-like and S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase (SAM-MTases) genes, with a duplicated segment of heterochromatin from 3B inserted into this cluster. This heterochromatin segment also contains a gene originally designated as hypothetical 3 (Hyp3) (Griffiths et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Al-Kaff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>), which has been now reannotated as ZIP4 (UniProtKB&#8212;Q2L3T5).</p><p id="Par38">In terms of the role of <italic>Ph1</italic> during meiosis, we now know that <italic>Ph1</italic> stabilises polyploidy in wheat through two different mechanisms: by controlling the accuracy of homologous synapsis during early meiosis and by regulating CO formation later in meiosis (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). We propose that the effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> on synapsis is probably a consequence of a change in chromatin structure produced by the Cdk-like and SAM-MTase cluster. The involvement of Cdk2 in H1 phosphorylation, replication, chromatin condensation and synapsis between non-homologous chromosomes has been widely reported (Krasinska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>; Viera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>). We have already shown that the levels of histone H1 phosphorylation, pre-meiotic replication and chromatin structure are all altered by <italic>Ph1</italic> (Greer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>), which may affect chromatin structure and hence the efficiency of synapsis. On the other hand, although ZIP4 has been reported to affect both synapsis and CO formation in yeast (Tsubouchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>), the effect in plants is mainly on CO formation (Chelysheva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2012</xref>). Thus, it seems more likely that ZIP4 is involved in the effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> on CO formation. However, there are still no data to elucidate how ZIP4 contributes to the effect of <italic>Ph1</italic> on the CO process. This question cannot be answered using ZIP4 RNAi-based approaches because this would result in overall ZIP4 activity suppression, leading to sterility (Chelysheva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2012</xref>). However, the question will most likely be answered in the near future, using other approaches such as analysis of the recently available tilling mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wheat-training.com/tilling-mutant-resources">www.wheat-training.com/tilling-mutant-resources</ext-link>) and other transformation approaches such as the CRISPR genome editing technique.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">The <italic>Ph1</italic> locus was assumed to prevent pairing and synapsis between homoeologues or related chromosomes; however, it has recently been reported that <italic>Ph1</italic> does not prevent homoeologous synapsis (Mart&#237;n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). In this study, we show that wheat possesses a basic mechanism for sorting homologues from homoeologues during the telomere bouquet stage, independent of <italic>Ph1</italic>. During this telomere bouquet stage, only homologous synapsis occurs, while homoeologous synapsis starts later during telomere bouquet dispersal. In hexaploid wheat, the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus promotes early homologous synapsis, thus avoiding homoeologous synapsis. In the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic>, homologous synapsis is delayed, allowing a degree of homoeologous synapsis to also take place in up to 8 of the 42 chromosomes.</p><p id="Par40">The <italic>Ph1</italic> locus has also been reported to have a major effect on homoeologous CO formation, by preventing MLH1 sites on synapsed homoeologues from becoming COs. Although the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> allows some of these MLH1 sites to become COs, still a significant proportion of these sites are processed into non-COs. In this study, we reveal that the level of MLH1 sites progressing to COs can be increased in the absence of <italic>Ph1</italic> by altering selected environmental factors, such as nutrient composition in the soil and temperature. We show that increased nutrients and lower temperature can increase the level of CO. These observations highlight the importance of growth conditions on wheat meiosis, which may allow improved exploitation of the <italic>Ph1</italic> locus in breeding programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
