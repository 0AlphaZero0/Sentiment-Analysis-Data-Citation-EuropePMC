They mature their properties, including their affinity for antigen, through hypermutation events; processes that involve, e.g., base substitution, codon insertion and deletion, often in association with an isotype switch. Investigations of antibody evolution define modes whereby particular antibody responses are able to form, and such studies provide insight important for instance for development of efficient vaccines. Antibody evolution is also used <italic>in vitro</italic> for the design of antibodies with improved properties. To better understand the basic concepts of antibody evolution, we analyzed the mutational paths, both in terms of amino acid substitution and insertions and deletions, taken by antibodies of the IgG isotype. The analysis focused on the evolution of the heavy chain variable domain of sets of antibodies, each with an origin in 1 of 11 different germline genes representing six human heavy chain germline gene subgroups. Investigated genes were isolated from cells of human bone marrow, a major site of antibody production, and characterized by next-generation sequencing and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. Apart from substitutions within the complementarity determining regions, multiple framework residues including those in protein cores were targets of extensive diversification. Diversity, both in terms of substitutions, and insertions and deletions, in antibodies is focused to different positions in the sequence in a germline gene-unique manner. Altogether, our findings create a framework for understanding patterns of evolution of antibodies from defined germline genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibody germline gene</kwd><kwd>antibody sequence</kwd><kwd>somatic hypermutation</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>insertion and deletion</kwd><kwd>substitution</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Vetenskapsr&#229;det<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004359</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">2016-01720</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Lunds Universitet<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003252</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">ALF</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="14"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="21"/><word-count count="9527"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies, central components of humoral immunity, are crucial to our survival. The immune system allows antibodies to evolve in efforts to enhance their ability to mediate protection against disease. The biochemistry and mechanism of this complex evolution process has been extensively studied at the molecular level (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Technological advances in sequencing and single cell analysis technology have recently allowed us to, at great depth, study antibody sequences as they develop <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Indeed, various sequencing strategies and bioinformatics pipelines have been generated to allow such analysis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Studies of the development of humoral immune responses require knowledge of the repertoire of genes that are available in the genome. Such information allows us to properly analyze germline gene rearrangement events and hypermutation, as exemplified by extensive studies of the response against the envelope protein of HIV-1 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Databases and associated analysis tools, like IMGT/IMGT V-QUEST/IMGT HighV-QUEST (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), have consequently been built to allow efficient analysis of antibody-encoding sequences, their genetic origin, and their evolution. Common concepts, like standardized framework and complementarity determining regions (FR and CDR, respectively), the latter of which is considered to represent the antigen-contacting part of the antibody, are commonly used in such analysis. However, numerous definitions of these regions exist in parallel (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), highlighting the difficulties associated with the establishment of a clear-cut definition of these regions. We hypothesized that a thorough understanding of the ways through which antibodies derived from different germline genes evolve as a consequence of somatic mutation processes will aid the establishment of such definitions. Such understanding will also aid a proper mutational analysis of clones that populate immune responses.</p><p>In this study, we have focused our attention to human IgG encoded by unsorted cells in bone marrow (BM) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), a major site of antibody production, to define how evolution proceeds in antibody heavy (H) chains derived from 11 commonly used germline genes. The advent of high throughput next-generation sequencing methodology, and its application to studies of antibody gene sequences (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), allowed us to decipher the mutability of antibodies of different origins in ways not possible in the recent past. The analysis was highly enhanced by germline gene inference technology (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) that defined the germline gene/allele repertoires of the donors under study, thereby minimizing errors originating from inappropriate gene assignment. We now demonstrate how antibodies of different germline gene origins evolve residues and introduce insertions and deletions into CDRs and FRs. This information has implications for our understanding and interpretation of human immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Antibody-Encoding Transcriptomes</title><p>Antibody-encoding transcripts were isolated from unsorted cells of BM of six subjects diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, examined out of season of most seasonal pollen allergens (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

Sequences (codons 27&#8211;104) were only retrieved from donors homozygous for a given allele to eliminate the risk of incorrect allele assignment that would contribute to perceived sequence diversification. The sequence with the highest number of counts was chosen so as to minimize the impact of random errors introduced by PCR and/or sequencing artifacts. Sequences showing evidence of insertion or deletion were not used, as the analysis pipeline is incompatible with such modes of antibody diversification.

This dataset was now reanalyzed to assess antibody diversification. In any such material, allelic diversity will contribute to antibody diversity and will compromise computational analysis of antibody evolution unless correct allele assignment is made. In particular, as differences between alleles often are small, incorrect allele assignment of hypermutated genes cannot be avoided. Prior analysis of these donors&#8217; IgM repertoires, repertoires that carry large numbers of unmutated sequences, can be used to ensure proper downstream analysis of IgG repertoires. Such analysis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was performed using IgDiscover (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) to define the lymphocyte donors&#8217; IGHV germline gene and allele makeup. We furthermore used a haplotype quality-control approach to define the validity of many of the allele calls (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This approach also allowed us to validate novel alleles not present in the IMGT reference directory used for gene assignments (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). By using donors with defined germlines, we minimized the risk of introducing artifacts in our analysis of the mutational paths taken by antibodies of different germline gene origins. Importantly, this approach identified allele IGHV1-2*p06 (IGHV1-2*02 T163C) in three of six individuals (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), an allele that is not identified by standard IMGT HighV-QUEST or V-QUEST analysis. A failure to identify this allele would incorrectly have enhanced the perceived substitution frequency in one position of this gene by the approach taken in this study. As a consequence of the substantial, but difficult to detect, allelic diversity of IGHV1-2, it was not included in this study. We also made sure that the investigated germline genes were not extensively similar to alleles of other germline genes in the donors&#8217; repertoires, as such similarity may, following hypermutation, incorrectly relate products of other genes to the genes under investigation. IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-23D are in this context treated as one gene as they are identical in sequence. Among the other genes, only one investigated allele of IGHV4-59 had a highly similar allele defined by IMGT (&gt;98% nucleotide identity) assigned to another gene location (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material), but this other allele (IGHV4-4*08) was not present in the repertoires of the investigated individuals.</p><p>Overall, several germline genes were highly diverse (different alleles used by different donors or presence of different alleles in a given individual), but others were not, some of which were used for this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In all, our analysis focused on a set of commonly used &#8220;core&#8221; genes (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) utilized in rearrangements obtained from individuals conceived to be homozygous for a given allele or heterozygous for alleles expected to encode identical protein sequences in their unmutated form. As the analysis focused on sequences (germline-encoded protein sequences are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) from CDRH1 up to the end of FR3, alleles that encode identical protein products in this part of the H chain variable domain could be included in the study. Thus, for the purpose of analysis of selection associated with hypermutation, only sequences derived from individuals homozygous for a given gene sequence encoding CDRH1 to FR3 (codons 27&#8211;104) were used.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Protein sequences (residues 27&#8211;104) encoded by germline genes primarily investigated in this study.

The average frequency of substitution of a residue from residues 27 to 104 ranged from 12.5% (IGHV2-5) to 18.4% (IGHV4-39). Different substitution patterns were seen with different residues being targeted by diversification depending on germline gene origin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Substitutions were, as expected, often located to some residues within CDRs, but they also occurred frequently in numerous residues in FRs. It was not uncommon for FR residues encoded by a particular germline gene to be substituted in &gt;25% of all transcripts. Diversification of FRs is thus an important aspect of antibodies produced from cells in BM that have undergone a somatic hypermutation processes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Frequency of substitutions <bold>(A)</bold> and degree of variability <bold>(B)</bold> of residues encoded by transcripts in bone marrow (BM) with an origin in the 11 investigated germline genes.

Only sequences showing no evidence of insertions and deletions were included in the analysis. Numerous residues differed substantially between germline genes in the degree of targeting by substitution. Note the substantial degree of substitution also in some residues of framework region (FR). Frequency of substitution and variability for individual genes are shown in Figure S2 in Supplementary Material.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-08-01433-g002"/></fig><p>The degree of targeting of CDR1 and CDR2 differed substantially between different germline genes both in terms of the frequency of substitution and the degree of variability introduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). For instance, substitutions were most frequently incorporated into CDRH2 of VH with an origin in IGHV3-11, while substitutions were incorporated more frequently into CDRH1 of VH with an origin in IGHV5-51 (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). The precise codons targeted by successful diversification differed between germline genes. For instance, while residue 29 (mostly S or T in germline sequences) was targeted by substantial diversification in proteins derived from some genes (e.g., investigated genes of subgroups 1, 3, and 5) it was not targeted in genes of other germline origins (IGHV2-5, IGHV4-39, IGHV4-59, and IGHV6-1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (additional examples are provided in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the case of S29-encoding germline genes, the extensive targeting of mutations to this residue in IGHV5-51 was associated with the presence of a mutational hotspot in the codon of this gene (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Similarly, residues in immediate proximity to CDR in the linear sequence were frequently diversified. The extent of diversification of some of these residues differed substantially depending on germline gene origin. For instance, while W55 of IGHV1-8 and IGHV1-18 and R55 of IGHV6-1 were rarely (&lt;10%) substituted, A55 of IGHV3-23 was substituted in products encoded by 76% of the transcripts with an origin in this germline gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

IGHV1-18 encodes a L at position 71, while other genes of the IGHV1 subgroup encode F in this position. Mutation of this codon in IGHV1-18 introduced F in this position at a high frequency (55%).

Among these, residues 50 and 52 were rarely mutated [each below 10% of transcripts, except in the case of residue 50 of IGHV1-18 (15%)] while, in particular residue 40 (G, N, or S) but also residues 42 (I or V) and 103 (Y) were frequently substituted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), although mostly in a restricted manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Figure S4 in Supplementary Material).

Several of the residues that constitute the upper core (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) are by definition part of the sequences that comprise CDR, although their side chains are not necessarily extensively exposed on the surface of the domain. The residues play different roles, depending on their biophysical nature (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Several residues in this core of VH, depending on its germline gene origin, are prone to accept mutations. Many germline genes encode large aromatic residues at position 28 that were rarely mutated (mostly &lt;10%) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, germline genes IGHV4-39 and IGHV4-59 encode a G in this position, a residue that was frequently (approximately 35%) substituted (mostly to A, D, and V) in products of IgG-encoding transcripts. Similarly, genes that encode an aromatic side chain in position 30 of VH rarely substituted it (&#8804;10%) while genes derived from germline genes like IGHV4-39, IGHV4-59, and IGHV6-1, which encode a hydrophobic amino acid in position 30, were more prone to substitute it, mostly for another hydrophobic residue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Residue 80 in the upper core is important for the positioning and conformation of CDR2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). IGHV3 germline genes incorporate R at this position, a side chain that was only very rarely (&#8804;2% of reads) substituted by other residues. In contrast, R80 in antibody-encoding genes derived from IGHV1-8 underwent substitution at a high frequency. This ability for diversification is not associated with the presence of a mutational hotspot (<italic>WA</italic>/<italic>TW</italic> or <italic>RGYW</italic>/<italic>WRCY</italic>) in this codon in IGHV1-8 (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Other germline genes encode other residues in position 80 and these may also be substituted to a substantial extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

Similarly, residue 101 in many VH carried a substantial level of diversification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).

The side chain of residue 101 is also exposed on the domain&#8217;s surface near the interface with VL far away from the binding site. Some residues, although not targeted to diversification in general, may be targeted extensively in antibodies derived from some germline genes. For instance, in similarity to residue 71 of IGHV1-18 (described above; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), residues 46 and 81 of IGHV1-8, and to some extent residue 75 of IGHV5-51 were frequently mutated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).

The advent of next-generation sequencing and the availability of much larger collections of antibody sequences allows for a very in-depth analysis of antibody diversity. We envisaged that such analysis would also define constraints on human repertoire development as a function of antibody germline gene origin and thus enhance the way we in the future analyze events involving somatic diversification. Such studies and concomitant studies of antigen-antibody complex structure have been used to understand in detail how human humoral immune repertoires develop, or fail to develop efficiently. Large-scale studies, as recently reviewed, have addressed the evolution of antibodies against highly functional epitopes on viral antigens like the envelope protein of HIV-1 with the intention to enable design of immunogens that more efficiently induce protective immunity in vaccinated subjects (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In the present study, the aim was to deconvolute antibody diversification paths, not from a global perspective but with a focus on products of individual germline genes, to enable enhanced quality of future analysis of antibody evolution. To do so, we employed sequences that encode IgG in BM (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), a major site of long-term, sustained antibody production. The sequences were derived from subjects diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinitis but they were obtained out-of season of most seasonal allergens. We consequently consider them not to be biased by an on-going allergic immune response. In any event, we do not consider that major features of evolution of the IgG response of such subjects would be dramatically different from that of non-allergic, immunocompetent, subjects.</p><p>The present study focuses on the diversity found from CDR1 until the end of FR3 of the human H chain V domain. By focusing our attention on diversification of well-defined germline genes and alleles, our analysis is minimally confounded by differences in germline gene allelic makeup between individuals or between haplotypes of an individual. In preparation of the present study, we consequently inferred the germline VH repertoires of the lymphocyte donors (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and analyzed genes of donors with well-established germline gene allele composition. The one exception to this rule is IGHV3-23 and its, in their mature peptide-coding sequences, exactly duplicated sequence IGHV3-23D, sequences that were treated as one entity in this study. Furthermore, as some germline genes are highly similar, confounding outcomes may occur as a consequence of mutational processes rendering sequences derived from one germline gene more similar to the nucleotide sequence of other germline genes. Such highly similar germline genes (&gt;98% nucleotide identity) were, to avoid erroneous interpretation, not investigated in the present study.</p><p>Antibodies of different germline gene origins differed substantially in terms of diversified residues, in agreement with recent findings (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). There is thus a solid basis for defined, preferred germline-centric paths of antibody evolution. Certainly, driving forces that promote higher substitution frequencies may relate to affinity maturation, stability enhancement etc. It is likely that part of the observed differences relate to the presence or absence of sequences acting as hot-spots for the mutational machinery (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, structural analysis have previously demonstrated that amino acids that are in mutational hot-spots are not more likely to actually undergo substitution during somatic hypermutation, suggesting that such hot-spots &#8220;are not a major driving force in determining which residues are mutated&#8221; (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In any event, IGHV2-5, IGHV4-39, IGHV4-59, IGHV5-51, and IGHV6-1 all encode S29, a residue capable of different interactions in different antibodies (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>A&#8211;D). It is, however, only in sequences derived from IGHV5-51 that this residue is targeted by extensive substitutions. This gene is also the only one among the five that carries a mutational hot-spot motif affecting this codon. If this is a selected, germline-encoded feature preventing extensive, non-functional substitution of products derived from the other four genes, or not, is currently not known. However, if this is not the case, there is a capacity for antibody evolution in antibodies derived from some genes that is not efficiently explored by the human immune system.</p><fig id="F14" position="float"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><p>Position 29 of rearranged sequences of different germline gene origins are to different extents targeted by mutagenesis resulting in amino acid substitution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Certainly, loops belonging to different canonical classes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), positioning side chains with identical residue numbers in entirely differently orientations and environments, may affect their ability to structurally accept substitutions. Importantly, some germline genes encode unusual residues in some positions, the side chain of which may be suboptimal for its environment. We envisage that such unusual residue may be more commonly mutated even if they reside in FR, often attaining the more common residue following substitution, as illustrated by residues 53 of IGHV3-11 and residue 71 or IGHV1-18. Furthermore, residue 80, a residue in the upper core of the variable domain, with particular importance for the conformation of CDRH2 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) provide interesting insight into germline-directed paths for antibody evolution. The common diversification of R80 in products with an origin in IGHV1-8 (in contrast to the lack of diversification of R80 in products derived from IGHV3 subgroup genes) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) is not associated with the presence of a mutational hotspot in IGHV1-8 affecting codon 80 (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Possibly R80 is less important for maintenance of the integrity of the domain or the general architecture of the binding site in antibodies derived from this germline gene. Interestingly, reorientation of R80 has been demonstrated in one antibody (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with a likely origin in IGHV1-8. This was also associated with a reorientation of CDRH2 as determined by X-ray crystallography (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>E-H). We hypothesize that substitution of R80 in products originating from genes like IGHV1-8 may be part of an efficient route to evolve antibody functionality while still being tolerated in terms of structural stability. We hypothesize that some germline genes may even have an inherent need, or, if one so-prefer, capacity, for evolution that is not present in other germline genes. In all, the reason for such high substitution frequency <italic>in vivo</italic> may differ between antibodies of different germline gene origins. Future studies will have to address the difficulties encountered by, or alternatively extended opportunity of, the cells producing antibodies derived from these germline genes to gain an advantage in the race for selection through the affinity maturation processes occurring in germinal centers.</p><p>Residues beyond CDR may interact with antigen or contribute indirectly to the architecture of the binding site.

Indeed, substantial diversity is apparently tolerated, or even selected for, in residues in immediate proximity to CDRs as defined by IMGT (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). For instance, codon 55 of different germline genes encodes very different side chains. Is the observed difference in mutability solely a result of the presence or absence of a mutational hotspot, or is it also directed by a difference in importance of this residue for establishment of a core antigen-interacting surface (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) in products encoded by the different germline genes? It is furthermore evident that many other residues in FRs, even those belonging to the cores of the antibody fold and to the VH/VL interface, may harbor extensive diversity. We envisage that such diversity, when structurally tolerated may contribute substantially to improved biophysical properties of the encoded antibody or even to affinity maturation, for instance through stabilization of the binding site during affinity maturation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In particular, an area with CDR-like potential, CDR4, that resides in a loop adjacent to the classical CDRs in the folded structure have been defined and exploited (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). It has been suggested to be able to accommodate extensive diversity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We have now identified that some, but not all, germline genes introduce diversity in this loop. Such diversity may contribute to functional evolution of antibodies of such germline gene origins. In all, the preferred paths of evolution of antibody V domains extend substantially beyond conventional CDRs in ways directed by an antibody&#8217;s germline gene origin.</p><p>Antibody variable domains, indeed, diversify not only by substitution but also through insertion and deletion of residues into the variable domain sequence (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In this study, we observed germline gene-inherited patterns that differently target genes with such insertions and deletions, not only in conventional CDRs but also in CDR4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>; Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). In the past, we hypothesized that the presence of repetitive codons might be one feature that targets such modifications to a particular part of a gene (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). It is also conceivable that parts of VH domains of different germline gene origins are able to structurally harbor such diversity to different extents, a factor that certainly needs further assessment. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that any immune response that relies on introduction of sequence insertion and/or deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> will only recruit members derived from those germline genes that introduce such diversification with ease in critical parts of the sequence. Important immune responses that require such modification have been reported (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and other responses relying on such evolution, such as those targeting occluded sites, will likely be described in the future. By understanding the ability of particular germline genes to diversify by insertion and deletion, it will be possible to develop our understanding of selection of germline genes made by the immune system in the generation of these particularly difficult immune responses.</p><p>Overall, the diverse pattern of diversification even beyond conventional CDR likely complicates computational efforts to assess the involvement of selection during antibody development. We employed one such analysis technology on highly expressed IgG H chain V domain sequences encoded in BM but found no evidence of a positive selection force in the mutational pattern targeting CDR. Our findings are in line with past studies demonstrating a failure to identify evidence of positive selection in CDR, while evidence of negative selection of modifications in FR is detected (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In agreement with a recent study (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and given the diversity of paths through which antibodies of different origins evolve, we suggest that any approach to assess selection ought to take germline gene-specific mutational patterns as found in selected and non-selected repertoires into account and not rely entirely on an analysis of mutations based on current global CDR definitions. Processes to facilitate analysis of selection in a germline gene origin-centric fashion have been initiated elsewhere (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We foresee that such a development will be required if computational approaches are to accurately address the impact of selection on antibody repertoire development. In some situations, such as IgE responses, this aspect is a matter of substantial biological controversy (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and certainly need further investigations, the outcomes of which will impact our understanding of fundamental biological processes associated with disease.</p><p>In summary, we identified germline gene-unique patterns of evolution that occur during hypermutation of antibodies of diverse IGHV germline gene origins. Our findings extend the findings of a recent study, published during preparation of the present manuscript, that identified gene-specific substitution profiles of antibodies of different germline gene origins (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Collectively, we have demonstrated a diversity of paths taken by antibodies of different germline gene origins to evolve by somatic hypermutation, including not only base substitution but also processes of codon insertion and deletion. Our study forms the basis for improved understanding of molecular evolution as it proceeds in immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic> and establishes a foundation for future germline gene origin-centered analysis approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Regionala etikpr&#246;vningsn&#228;mnden (Lund).
