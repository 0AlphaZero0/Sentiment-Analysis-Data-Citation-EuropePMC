One such approach, CAR-T cell therapy, involves the use of viral vectors to genetically modify autologous T cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against a tumor antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CD19 CAR-T, arguably the most successful CAR-T cell therapy to date in the clinic, involves genetically engineering autologous T cells ex vivo to express CARs against a B-lineage antigen CD19, which is expressed on tumor cells such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While striking results with a high rate of complete remission (67%&#8211;90%) have been observed in clinical trials in adults and children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], encouraging, yet variable, results have been reported with other B-cell malignancies treated by CD19 CAR-T therapy. An overall response rate of 57% (4 complete responders and 4 partial responders out of 14 patients) was reported in a small trial on relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a complete response rate of 57% (4 out of 7 patients) was reported in a phase I study with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These variable clinical responses across patients may result from many factors such as pre-conditioning regimen of patients, CAR-T cell administration procedure as well as T cell sources and manufacturing process. However, the key contributors to the variations are not fully identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High-resolution single-cell analysis of functional attributes of CAR-T pre-infusion products may provide new insights into the variability of clinical responses and open up new avenues for the development of more efficacious yet safe CAR-T cell therapy.</p><p id="Par17">In an in vitro system, the reorganization of tumor antigen by CAR, are followed by a wave of signals that comprise the secretion of cytolytic enzymes, stimulatory cytokines, and chemoattractive proteins. How these signals reflect CAR-T function in patient is minimally characterized and poorly understood. This is further compounded by the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines that reduce the efficacy of treatment or pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immunotoxic side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, this signal, which varies between patients and differs in individual CAR-T cells, is difficult to control or standardize, highlighting a pressing need to systematical evaluate the ability of engineered CAR-T cell product to release these signals following an antigen-specific challenge and to link this capability to clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par18">It is well accepted that T cells capable of co-producing multiple cytokines/chemokines at the single cell level, termed &#8220;polyfunctional&#8221; T cells, are the key effector cells contributing to the development of potent and durable cellular immunity against viral infection or cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The same principle is expected to apply to engineered CAR-T cells in autologous cellular immunotherapy. Porter et al. showed that CD19 CAR-T-cells collected from CLL patients following treatment are indeed polyfunctional measured by 6-color ICS-FC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Four patients exhibited complete remissions, and, for those patients, their CAR-T cells persist and retain polyfunctionality for up to 4&#160;years post infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This study highlighted the importance of polyfunctionality, for therapeutic efficacy of anti-tumor CAR-T cells. While most studies characterized single-cell cytokine production in CD19 CAR-T cells using intracellular staining flow cytometry (ICS-FC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the limited number of cytokine/chemokines measured per single cell undermines the capability to comprehensively assess CAR-T polyfunctionality.</p><p id="Par19">A comprehensive assessment of CAR-T polyfunctionality has become possible with the development of a single-cell barcode chip (SCBC) microdevice that demonstrated simultaneous measurement of up to 42 cytokines secreted from single cells and thousands of single cells analyzed in parallel per device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the current study, we apply this microdevice technology to CD19 CAR-T cells to delineate the landscape of effector function capability in response to antigen-specific stimulation. We were able to load small quantities of CAR+ T cells onto the device and distinguish CD4 and CD8 cells using high content imaging cytometry. We then simultaneously measured 16 cytokines/chemokines from thousands of single CAR-T cells. Elevated cytokine/chemokine levels in response to antigen specific stimulation at the single-cell level were observed for cells generated from all 4 donors, albeit with significant donor-to-donor variation. Significant subsets of stimulated CAR-T cells exhibit high polyfunctionality with a dominant anti-tumor effector cytokine profile. New bioinformatics tools were developed to visualize polyfunctional T cell subsets and compare across donors. The analysis revealed distinct functional clusters from each donor and provided a landscape of CD19 CAR-T cell effector functions upon antigen stimulation. The comprehensive single CAR-T cell analysis paves the way to understand the relationship between in vitro function profiles and therapeutic outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of antibody barcode slides</title><p id="Par20">The silicon master for antibody barcode manufacturing, polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) was etched with the deep-reactive-ion etching (DRIE) method. It was pretreated with trimethylchlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich) vapor in a vacuum desiccator for 30&#160;min. The master was then compressed into an acrylic base, to form the mold for PDMS chips. The PDMS pre-polymer elastomer base and curing agent, Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) was mixed completely (parts A and B in a 10:1 ratio) and placed in a vacuum desiccator for 30&#160;min to remove air bubbles.

The antibody barcode slide was put on top of the microchamber PDMS with the antibody side facing down. The whole system was clamped tightly in a custom clamping system. The system was imaged immediately as described in <bold>Microchamber array imaging.</bold> Post imaging, the microchamber assembly was placed in a standard 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, incubator at 37&#160;&#176;C for 16&#160;h. Following incubation, the microchamber system was dissembled in a 1% BSA/PBS bath and the antibody slide was removed and rinsed with 1% BSA/PBS.

The application was developed using C++ and the QT application framework, and used the open source OpenCV library for image processing. The microchamber array images and antibody barcode images were overlaid based on visual alignment markers embedded in the SCBC. Cell counts and phenotypes in each microchamber could therefore be mapped to the corresponding cytokine/chemokine levels. The software automatically located cell chambers using edge and contour detection. The software identified and counted cells in each microchamber based on fluorescence intensities in the fluorescence images and feature detection in the brightfield image. Cell subsets (CD4/CD8) were further determined based on immunofluorescence. User verification was performed on a small subset (normally around 2&#8211;3% of the whole array) to validate the automatic results. The software analyzed the antibody barcode image to determine the location of each antibody lane, using Hough transforms and subsequent interpolation. The raw intensity value of each cytokine readout from each single-cell was extracted from the image region where the single cell microchamber overlaps the cytokine&#8217;s corresponding antibody lane. Zero-cell microchambers and their associated protein signals were used to assess cytokine-specific background. A background threshold was computed per cytokine, defined as three standard deviations above the average zero-cell signal intensity. Signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 2 (relative to the background threshold) were considered as true protein signals. If at least 20 single cells or 2% of all single cells (whichever quantity was larger) showed true protein signal for one specific cytokine, this cytokine was labeled as significantly secreted by the sample. Knowing the secretion profile of each single-cell, the frequency of all polyfunctional groups present in the sample were identified. From these frequencies and the background-subtracted signal intensities, the polyfunctional strength of the sample, and the percent contribution from each cytokine group was found. PAT PCA transformations were performed as outlined in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3.

First, we computed the percentage of polyfunctional cells regardless of the combination of cytokines co-produced. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, under 5% of cells with IgG bead stimulation exhibited polyfunctionality. By contrast, the anti-CAR bead-stimulated CAR-T cells of donors 1&#8211;4 respectively showed a 6-, 2-, 47-, and 11-fold increase in polyfunctional cell counts for 4 donors, highlighting both the polyfunctionality and variability of CAR-T products across donors. In all 4 donors, we also noted that anti-CAR bead-stimulated CD8+ T cells were more polyfunctional than CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we used the polyfunctional strength index (PSI) described previously to quantify the collective impact of polyfunctional T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The PSI of a sample is defined as the percentage of polyfunctional cells multiplied by the average signal intensity of the cytokines secreted by these cells. We further broke down PSI by cytokine function (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) &#8211; effector, stimulatory, regulatory, and inflammatory &#8211; to highlight the contribution of each group to the overall polyfunctionality of the sample. The PSI breakdown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> further revealed inter-donor heterogeneity of polyfunctional CAR-T cells. While effector and stimulatory cytokines contribute the most to polyfunctionality across all 4 donors, a small portion of regulatory and inflammatory cytokines were observed in donor 1 and donor 4. Furthermore, the observed regulatory and inflammatory response was mainly from the CD4+ T cells, consistent with the notion that both regulatory and helper T cells are subsets of CD4+ T cells, further proving the specificity of the SCBC assay. The donor-to-donor variability in polyfunctionality could be caused by a population-level shift of cytokine profiles, or the alteration of specific polyfunctional subpopulations. To better understand this variation, we first sought to use a conventional heatmap to visualize cytokine production from all single cells across four donors. The heat map data visualization in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> gives a high-level indication that the analyzed single CAR-T cells exhibit significant differences in the combinations and intensities (red&#160;=&#160;low, green&#160;=&#160;high) of secreted proteins.

In this standard bar graph visualization of the functional groups secreted by the four donors&#8217; CD4+ CAR-T cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), the dimensionality of the data makes it cumbersome to see which are the major functional groups being secreted by each donor, as well as the largest fold differences across donors. An alternative approach to visualizing high-dimensional datasets is to first reduce the dimensionality of the data, while retaining as much of the original information as possible. PCA (principal component analysis) is a common dimensionality reduction technique which uses an orthogonal transformation to convert the original dataset of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated principal components, where the number of components is smaller than the number of original variables. The transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (accounting for as much variability as possible within the dataset), followed by the second component, and so on. While reducing the dimensionality to two principal components may still result in some loss of information, the benefit is that the transformed data points can then be visualized on a two-dimensional scatterplot. Additionally, key differences within the transformed data should be magnified through this transformation. Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b-c</xref> displays the results of applying PCA to the 4-donor CD4+ CAR-T secretion dataset. Each cell&#8217;s secretions (signal intensity of each cytokine) are log transformed prior to dimensionality reduction. Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows a scatterplot of the transformed data color-coded by donor, while Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows the same data color-coded by some of the individual cytokines. The combination of these graphs does reveal additional information about donor response differences and expressed polyfunctional subsets, such as the lower overall polyfunctionality of donor 2, or the higher Granzyme B&#160;+&#160;MIP-1&#945;&#160;+&#160;polyfunctionality of donor 1. A similar pattern of cytokine secretions was seen in the CD8+ CAR-T cells of all 4 donors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). However, two key issues still exist with this visualization: (1) it is difficult to infer which high-dimensional cytokine subsets are driving the polyfunctionality of each sample, and (2) it is unclear what are the more granular polyfunctional differences across the analyzed donor samples. Other methods such as viSNE (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) that map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data, improve the ability to distinguish cell subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the polyfunctional breakdown of the samples remains unclear when this visualization is used. In the context of polyfunctional T cell analysis, the routine practice has been to manually enumerate the major polyfunctional subsets by quantifying the cell count in each of the possible cytokine combinations, which serves well the ability to distinguish polyfunctional T cell subsets but loses the relationship between subsets or the hierarchical structure of the population. We hereby propose two alternative visualizations, polyfunctional heat map and polyfunctional activated topology principal component analysis (PAT PCA) which in tandem work to solve these problems.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Higher dimensional data is difficult to visualize concisely. <bold>a</bold> With highly-multiplexed single-cell data, displaying the breakdown of different functional groups being secreted by a sample can increase by up to a factor of 2&#215; with the addition of x cytokines.

The heat maps are color-coded from light to dark, depending on the frequency of the polyfunctional cell subsets. The four rows of squares correspond to the four donors; each column corresponds to a polyfunctional group of cytokines that was expressed in at least one of the four samples. To condense the large number of functional groups arising from the high dimensionality of the data set, we use agglomerative hierarchical (complete linkage) clustering to attain a condensed set of functional groups that still faithfully represent the overall secretion profile of the donors. Using a Euclidean distance to measure similarity between functional groups, each unique group is input into the clustering algorithm as a 16-dimensional vector of 1&#160;s and 0&#160;s, corresponding to the presence or absence, respectively, of each cytokine in the group. We define the minimum permitted similarity value to perform a clustering operation, to ensure that clusters do not contain functional groups that are too distinct from each other. The resulting clusters and their frequencies are displayed in the functional heat map, with the size of the cytokine dots below each column representing the frequency of the corresponding cytokine in the cluster. As seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, donor 1, closely followed by donor 4, has the highest frequencies of most expressed functional groups. Donor 3 is less polyfunctional, while donor 2 has the least polyfunctional groups.

Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> show PAT PCA visualizations of the same single-cell-resolution CD4+/CD8+ CAR results as the heat maps in Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, respectively. Similarly for the hierarchical clustering input, we apply PCA on a binarized dataset (0&#160;=&#160;no secretion, 1&#160;=&#160;secretion), to focus on visualizing combinatorial differences, rather than intensity differences. In the resulting scatterplot visualization, each color-coded dot represented a single-cell from one of the four donors, respectively, in which the larger color-coded circles represented a unique polyfunctional subset. The colors of the subsets identified the sample where this subset was most frequent (i.e., largest as a percentage of the sample). The functional groups (columns) in the heat map are represented by a circle in the corresponding PAT PCA graph. The size of the circles corresponds to the frequency of the group; the number of cells (dots) within each group indicates how frequently the sample of the corresponding color secreted the group. The makeup of the two principal components PC1 and PC2 is indicated by the listed cytokines, with the composition of PC1 indicating the main drivers of polyfunctionality. In both graphs, PC1 is a combination of the seven dominant secretors of the anti-CAR stimulated cells: effector cytokines Granzyme B, MIP-1&#945;, IFN-&#947;, and TNF-&#945;; stimulatory cytokines GM-CSF and IL-8; and the regulatory cytokine IL-13. As a result, the highly-polyfunctional groups are farther along (on the right-side of) this axis. PC2 differed between CD4 and CD8 cells. In the CD4 case, groups towards the top tend to have more Granzyme B, IL-8 and TNF-&#945;, while groups near the bottom more often contain IL-13, IFN-&#947; and MIP-1&#945;. In the CD8 case, groups near the top more commonly secreted IFN-&#947;, IL-13 and GM-CSF, while groups near the bottom more commonly secreted Granzyme B, IL-8 and MIP-1&#945;. Plotting the polyfunctional subsets in such a manner allows overall similarities and differences in the donor profiles to emerge. The lack of donor 2 (orange) subsets indicated the lower polyfunctionality of this sample, while the presence of numerous donor 1 (blue) and donor 4 (green) groups in the right area of the graph indicated the highly-polyfunctional makeup of these two samples. Donor 3&#160;has fewer polyfunctional subsets mostly comprised of combinations of Granzyme B, MIP-1&#945;, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; but lacking IFN-&#947;, IL-13, and in the case of CD4+ cells, GM-CSF. Donor 4 largely spans the polyfunctional profiles of both donors 1 and 3, which can also be seen in the heat maps. Capturing the full polyfunctional landscape of each sample is critical to effectively analyzing this data, as well as identifying the major subsets contributing to differences between samples/donors.

Secondly, the most commonly utilized assays to assess CAR-T functions in the context of CD19 CAR-T therapies are cytotoxicity assay and interferon gamma release assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In both cases, CAR-T cells are co-cultured at a population level with target cells, a cell line that expresses CAR specific tumor antigen. Measuring one averaged signal, both assays fail to take into account the full diversity of T cell functions and are not adequate to provide complete data for clinical correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As such, a highly multiplexed, single cell approach is needed for comprehensive pre-infusion assessment of CAR-T product protein secretion to enable biomarker development. We propose the SCBC platform, which measures a broad range of up to 45 secreted proteins at the single cell level, in combination with the newly developed polyfunctionality analysis software, is well suited to address this pressing need. In this study, we measured 16 immune functions including anti-tumor effector, stimulatory, inflammatory, and regulatory cytokines at the single-cell level on human CD19 CAR-T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An elevated cytokine production with dominant anti-tumor effector profile from CD19 CAR-T cells in response to antigen-specific stimulation was observed across all 4 donors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Polyfunctional subsets were further analyzed and visualized using newly developed bioinformatics tools, polyfunctional heat map and PAT PCA (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). All together, we demonstrated that the SCBC platform represents a new platform that enables a comprehensive profiling of CAR-T cell cytokine/chemokine production and supports correlative analysis for biomarker discovery in pre-infusion CAR-T products.</p><p id="Par38">Initial evidence suggests that polyfunctional CAR-T cells may serve as a useful biomarker for efficacy. Dynamic polyfunctionality analysis of adoptively transferred MART-1-specific TCR-engineered T cells showed that TNF-&#945;+IFN-&#947;+ polyfunctional T cell delayed tumor relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, a study comparing in vitro functions of CD19 CAR-T cells generated from different CAR structures showed that polyfunctionality rather than cytotoxicity of the CAR-T cells was a better predictor of therapy efficacy in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The observation that persisting CAR-T cells in CLL complete responders remain polyfunctional 4&#160;years after infusion suggests an association between polyfunctional CAR-T cells with persisting response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The significance of T cell polyfunctionality in product characterization as well as clinical biomarkers led us to bring this metric to the forefront of our data analysis and visualizations. We first quantitated the level of polyfunctionality using PSI analysis which results in a polyfunctionality score for each donor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a and b</xref>). Overall, an increase in polyfunctionality of CAR-T cells in response to anti-CAR bead stimulation was observed in all four donors, with significant donor-to-donor heterogeneity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). CAR-T cells from donors 1 and 4 have the highest polyfunctionality, whereas CAR-T cells from donor 2 have the least. The polyfunctionality was predominated by effector cytokine profiles, which is consistent with the high potency observed with CD19 CAR in previous clinical trials.</p><p id="Par39">We then sought to breakdown the unique combinations of cytokine subsets secreted by a sample. The further analysis requires bioinformatics tools as the number of possible subsets can increase by up to a factor of 2<sup>n</sup> with the addition of n cytokines. On top of this, when analyzing differences across a set of donors or stimulation conditions, effectively highlighting the key polyfunctional differences is challenging. Previously developed single cell analysis bioinformatics tools, however, do not fit the purpose of polyfunctional analysis, especially for the comparison between multiple donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For example, conventional heatmap can indicate heterogeneity among single cells within one donor at a high level, but it cannot map functional subsets of different samples in the same space, therefore making multi-donor comparison very difficult (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). While conventional PCA and viSNE can map multiple donors in the same space, neither can identify polyfunctional subsets that drive the differentiations between donors at a high level of granularity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). To address this need, we developed two informatics visualization tools, namely a polyfunctional heat map and a PAT PCA scatterplot visualization, which are able to capture the full landscape of complex polyfunctional subsets within each donor, and identify major subsets that are different between donors and the driving factors for these differences. For example, polyfunctional heatmap showed while all four donors have polyfunctional subsets secreting Granzyme B, MIP-1&#945; and IFN-&#947;, only donor 1 and donor 4 have a highly polyfunctional subsets secreting GM-CSF, Granzyme B, IFN-&#947;, IL-8, IL-13, MIP-1&#945; and TNF-&#945;. PAT PCA visualization further reveals that the polyfunctional subsets of donor 3 are driven mainly by IL-8, Granzyme B, TNF-&#945; (CD4) and MIP-1&#945; (CD8) whereas those of donor 1 typically include IFN-&#947; and IL-13. Overall, we saw a convincing increase in the clarity of polyfunctional heatmaps and PAT PCA over other state of the art visualizations, demonstrating the overarching importance of developing visualizations that highlight polyfunctionality in sample characterization and differentiation. As with all novel, high dimensional data, one key challenge is how to effectively use the data. Future studies will explore other extensions and optimizations to the presented polyfunctionality visualizations with larger datasets.</p><p id="Par40">The presented single cell analysis platform is spun out from previous academic prototype with rigid validations and significant upgrades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The current data acquisition and analysis platform features: (1) measurements of true protein secretion from single cells residing in a nanowell, representing a more physiological environment than any other available single cell technology. (2) an automated acquisition process with data integrity and minimal user interference, and (3) an integrated bioinformatics suite for understanding and highlighting key differences in donor response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The readout of the assay is fluoresce intensity of accumulated cytokines over the 16&#160;h incubation time. Protein concentrations may be inferred using recombinant protein standard curves that generated on a separate or same chip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Temporal protein secretions of single cells for time-point study can be measured by analyzing a serial of chips. So far, the platform has been applied on a broad range of studies, including cytokine paracrine signaling analysis, malignant cell characterization and vaccine evaluation in infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Here, we extended the application to CAR-T analysis, demonstrating its capability to comprehensively characterize CAR-T cell pre-infusion products. Future studies on patient sample analysis, in combination with correlative studies with clinical responses will likely provide meaningful data for biomarker identification.</p><p id="Par41">How a patient responds to CAR-T therapy is affected by multiple factors, the function of CAR-T cells, the phenotype of tumor cells, the engagement of other immune cells, etc. Although the current study provides in-depth functional analysis of CAR-T cells, other contributing factors may confound the correlation between CAR-T functions with clinical responses. To alleviate the confounding effect of tumor cell variations across patients, a future experiment is to include single CAR-T cells with autologous tumor cells in the same microchamber to evaluate patient-specific CAR-T response. In fact, the presented SCBC system has been previously applied to the study of cell-cell interactions by including multiple cells in one microchamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The fact that only a small number of cells (~ 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup> cells) are required for setting up one SCBC chip makes the presented technology especially suitable for CAR-T autologous tumor response studies. In addition, nanowell-based single cell technologies have been previously used to study cytotoxicity of single NK cell or CAR-T cell in response to target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. By incorporating cell viability staining and microscopy imaging, a single cell autologous cytotoxicity assay can be built into the SCBC system, enabling simultaneously measurement of cytotoxicity and cytokine/chemokine production from one single cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">We have demonstrated how single-cell multiplexed proteomics is able to comprehensively characterize CD19 CAR-T cell product cytokine/chemokine profiles. Our single-cell analysis has, for the first time, revealed the multifunctional heterogeneity of CD19 CAR-T cell products by antigen-specific stimulation. Through the SCBC, we measured CAR-T cell secretion profiles across a panel of 16 key immune functions, and noted clear distinctions in the range of single-cell responses across each of four donors. We additionally developed new polyfunctional heat map and PAT PCA visualizations to deconvolute single-cell-level differences across donor responses, and to provide an in-depth understanding of the polyfunctional subsets driving each donor&#8217;s responses. Although the result presented here are based on CAR-T cells from healthy donor materials, it illustrates the necessity and provide a possible blueprint for guiding CAR-T product pre-infusion assessment. The ability to precisely dissect single-cell, polyfunctional heterogeneity supports a road map for correlative discoveries on the role of polyfunctional CAR-T cells in clinical responses and has the potential to greatly impact CAR-T therapy optimization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
