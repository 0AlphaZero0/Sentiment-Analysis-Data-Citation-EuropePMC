The major challenge facing the widespread application of biorefineries is the high cost of enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze recalcitrant cellulose to sugars. <italic>Penicillium oxalicum</italic> produces large amounts of plant-cell-wall-degrading enzymes, but their production is tightly controlled by complex regulatory networks, resulting in low yields of the native enzymes. Regulatory genes have been the targets of genetic engineering to improve enzyme production in microorganisms. In this study, we used transcriptomic profiling and genetic analyses to screen for and identify novel key regulators of cellulase and xylanase gene expression in <italic>P. oxalicum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">A comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> HP7-1 on different carbon sources, including glucose, wheat bran, and wheat bran plus Avicel, identified 40 candidate genes regulating the expression of cellulolytic enzyme genes. Deletion mutants of 31 candidate genes were constructed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> &#8710;<italic>PoxKu70</italic> and 11 resultant mutants showed significant changes in their filter-paper cellulase production compared with the parental strain &#8710;<italic>PoxKu70</italic>. Among these 11 mutants, &#916;<italic>PoxCxrA</italic>, &#916;<italic>PoxCxrB</italic>, and &#916;<italic>PoxNsdD</italic> showed the most significant reduction in the enzyme production (96.8, 75.9, and 58.5%, respectively). Ten of these 11 genes are here reported to be involved in cellulase production for the first time. Further tests revealed that &#916;<italic>PoxCxrA</italic>, &#916;<italic>PoxCxrB</italic>, and &#916;<italic>PoxNsdD</italic> displayed significantly reduced xylanase production, whereas &#916;<italic>PoxCxrA</italic> produced negligible xylanase. Interestingly, &#916;<italic>PoxCxrB</italic> and &#916;<italic>PoxNsdD</italic> showed significantly increased &#946;-glucosidase production. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription&#8211;PCR and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that <italic>PoxCxrA</italic>, <italic>PoxCxrB</italic>, and <italic>PoxNsdD</italic> regulate the expression of one another, but the mode of regulation changes dynamically during the growth of fungal cells in the presence of cellulose.

Filamentous fungi, particularly <italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, and <italic>Neurospora</italic> species, produce a diverse array of enzymes in response to different ecological niches. These include plant-cell-wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) that depolymerize the main structural polysaccharide components of plant cell walls into single sugars (glucose or xylose), which can be further converted into liquid fuels and/or other useful chemicals. However, low CWDE production has seriously retarded the industrialization of lignocellulosic biorefineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">
<italic>Penicillium</italic> has already received serious attention as an alternative to <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> for the production of industrial cellulases for use in lignocellulose saccharification. It has two major advantages over <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic>: high &#946;-glucosidase (BGL) activity in extracellular cellulase systems and its superior hydrolytic performance, which is dependent on the high specific activity of cellobiohydrolase 1 (CBH1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the genus <italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>P. oxalicum</italic> HP7-1, isolated from a decayed subtropical forest soil system in China, produces high cellulase activity for alkaline-pretreated sugarcane bagasse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which is the major waste product in the Chinese sugar industry. The whole genomic sequence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> HP7-1 and its annotation were recently completed, and showed that it has an integrative lignocellulolytic enzyme system for the degradation of plant cell walls, with diverse components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The complexity of the signaling cascades involved and our incomplete knowledge of the relevant transcriptional regulatory networks have hindered the improvement of native CWDE production in filamentous fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The CWDE genes are coordinately but differentially regulated in their hosts. The further characterization and manipulation of regulatory networks of CWDE gene expression should allow CWDE yields to be improved via the rational genetic engineering of filamentous fungi.</p><p id="Par26">The transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic gene expression is vital for cellulase biosynthesis and secretion in filamentous fungi, and depends on a regulatory network of multiple positively and negatively acting transcription factors (TFs). This network controls cellulolytic and xylanolytic gene expression in response to multiple external inducers/repressors, such as low-molecular-weight monosaccharides or disaccharides produced by the degradation of polysaccharides, light signaling, and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">XlnR is the first-identified TF involved in xylan and cellulose degradation, and regulates the expression of xylanolytic and cellulolytic genes induced by <sc>d</sc>-xylose or cellobiose in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Several TFs have subsequently been identified as involved in the degradation of plant biomass. These predominantly include transcription activators, such as CLR-1/ClrA, CLR-2/ClrB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], VIB1/XprG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and Ace3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and carbon catabolite repressors, such as CreA/CRE1/CRE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The TF Ace3 is a master regulator of cellulase gene expression and a modulator of xylanase gene expression, which is mediated partly by the XlnR homologue Xyr1 in <italic>T. reesei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In <italic>N. crassa</italic>, CLR-2 functions as a primary transcriptional activator, directly regulating the transcription of cellulolytic enzyme genes. The transcriptional regulation of <italic>clr</italic>-<italic>2</italic> is controlled by activated CLR-1, and CLR-1 and CLR-2 together constitute the full responses to cellulase gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Another TF, VIB1, indirectly activates the CLR-1/CLR-2-triggered expression of cellulolytic enzyme genes by repressing both Cre1-mediated carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and COL-26/BglR-mediated glucose sensing and metabolism in the early phase of cellulolytic induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CCR is a global regulatory mechanism that ensures microorganisms, including filamentous fungi, preferentially utilize glucose or other rapidly metabolizable carbon sources over less-favorable carbohydrates. In filamentous fungi that can degrade lignocellulose, such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, and <italic>Neurospora</italic>, the C2H2-type TF CreA/CRE1/CRE-1 functions as the main repressor in CCR. It directly or indirectly represses the expression of almost all CWDE genes and their TFs involved in the degradation of plant biomass in the presence of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, the CreA function depends in part on de novo protein synthesis, and <italic>CreA</italic> expression is not only autoregulated, but is also regulated by CreB&#8211;CreC-mediated ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. COL-26 plays an important role in regulating glucose metabolism in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>, and functions synergistically with CRE-1 to regulate cellulase gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">TFs and their homologues in different fungi also play diverse roles in the regulation of CWDE gene expression, conferring specificity and diversity on the mechanisms regulating the expression of these genes. For example, Xyr1/XlnR activates the transcription of the cellulase and xylanase genes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>niger</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic>, whereas Xlr-1/XlnR only regulates the expression of xylanase genes in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>, CLR-1 promotes the transcription of a variety of genes encoding cellulases, hemicellulases, cellodextrin transporters, and proteins involved in protein secretion, whereas its homologue ClrA is less involved in the regulation of cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic>, many TFs regulating the expression of cellulase and hemicellulase genes have been identified, including POX02484, POX08522, Ace1, AmyR, Bgl2, CreA, ClrB, ClrB-2, ClrC, and XlnR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of these, ClrB, CreA, XlnR, and AmyR are important dose-dependent TFs in cellulase production. During the induction of cellulose or cellodextrins, CreA and AmyR repress the expression of cellulase genes, whereas ClrB and XlnR activate their expression. In the early stage of induction, ClrB represses <italic>amyR</italic> expression, which is activated by CreA. AmyR also plays a negative role in the regulation of <italic>clrB</italic> and <italic>xlnR</italic> expression. The transcriptional expression of <italic>amyR</italic>, <italic>clrB</italic>, and <italic>xlnR</italic> is also repressed by CreA in the presence of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The combined manipulation of TFs and their target genes recently enhanced the production of cellulolytic enzymes in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic>. The simultaneous deletion of the TF-encoding genes <italic>creA</italic> and <italic>bgl2</italic> and the overexpression of <italic>clrB</italic> improved the filter-paper cellulase (FPase) activity and its extracellular protein concentration over 20- and 10-fold, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. When the gene encoding the TF XlnR<sup>A871V</sup>, <italic>clrB</italic>, and two major cellulase genes, <italic>cbh1</italic> and <italic>eg1</italic>, were overexpressed and the carbon catabolite repressor gene <italic>creA</italic> was deleted, the engineered <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> strain showed approximately tenfold higher cellulase activity than the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These data suggest that genetically modifying TFs by overexpressing or deleting their genes can efficiently improve the production of cellulolytic enzymes. However, these improvements cannot meet the industrial demand for lignocellulosic biorefineries. Therefore, more-specific regulators of cellulase and xylanase gene expression in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> are still required. These should also will extend our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cellulase and xylanase gene expression and how <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> can be engineered to enhance its cellulase and xylanase production.</p><p id="Par31">In this study, the transcriptomes of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> HP7-1 when cultured on different carbon sources were profiled to identify candidate regulators of its cellulolytic and xylanolytic genes. Three novel key regulatory genes that simultaneously regulate the expression of major cellulase and xylanase genes were detected and identified. The three novel regulatory genes were also found to regulate the expression of one another.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Forty candidate regulators of cellulolytic gene expression were detected in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> with transcriptomic profiling</title><p id="Par32">To screen for candidate regulators of cellulolytic gene expression in <italic>P. oxalicum</italic>, deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the transcript profiles of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>oxalicum</italic> HP7-1.
