Skin exposure to UV wavelengths from sunlight is required for Vitamin D synthesis and pigmentation, although it is plausible that longer visible wavelengths that penetrate the skin may regulate scWAT function. In this regard, we discovered a novel blue light-sensitive current in human scWAT that is mediated by melanopsin coupled to transient receptor potential canonical cation channels. This pathway is activated at physiological intensities of light that penetrate the skin on a sunny day. Daily exposure of differentiated adipocytes to blue light resulted in decreased lipid droplet size, increased basal lipolytic rate and alterations in adiponectin and leptin secretion. Our results suggest that scWAT function may be directly under the influence of ambient sunlight exposure and may have important implications for our current understanding of adipocyte biology.

The negative outcomes associated with WAT are mainly attributable to intra-abdominal visceral WAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). However, subcutaneous WAT (scWAT), which comprises&#8201;&gt;&#8201;80% of the body&#8217;s WAT mass, also plays an active role in these diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, an improved understanding of the regulation of scWAT function is of importance. Due to the sub-dermal localization of scWAT adipocytes over a large surface area of the human body, these cells may be directly affected by ambient sunlight exposure.</p><p id="Par3">Humans are able to utilize ultraviolet light (&lt;400&#8201;nm) for pigmentation and the biosynthesis of vitamin D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, visible light (400&#8211;700&#8201;nm) has not garnered as much attention regarding extra-retinal effects, despite the fact that 38.9% of the sun&#8217;s energy reaching exposed skin is in the visible wavelength range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although the majority of sunlight in the visible spectrum does not pass through the skin, 1&#8211;5% of blue/green light is able to penetrate through human skin to varying depths proportional to increasing wavelength and intensity and reach the underlying scWAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Indeed, blue light has been recently shown to mediate subcutaneous vasorelaxation via activation of the blue light-sensitive <italic>OPN4</italic> gene product melanopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a non-visual opsin best characterized in intrinsically photo-sensitive retinal ganglion cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Interestingly, high <italic>OPN4</italic> mRNA levels are also reported in human scWAT, but not visceral WAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/OPN4">www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/OPN4</ext-link>). As a G<sub>q</sub>-protein-coupled receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, melanopsin acts via the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the production of inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent activation of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which mediate an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

Under these conditions, we observed a white light-induced inward current in cultured mouse 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). To determine the wavelength sensitivity of this current, 3T3-L1 differentiated&#160;adipocytes were exposed to a 400&#8211;600&#8201;nm spectral ramp and the maximal current was elicited at ~450&#8211;480&#8201;nm blue light (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Blue (470&#8201;nm) light-sensitive currents were observed in differentiated&#160;adipocytes from 1) primary human scWAT 2) SGBS cells (human pre-adipocyte cell strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>) 3) primary mouse inguinal scWAT, and mouse 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D,E</xref>). In all of these cell types, ~10&#8211;13% of cells tested yielded measurable currents ranging between 35&#8211;80 pA in magnitude (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Given the extensive previous validation of the 3T3-L1 cell line as a model of adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we used these cells as our model system for the majority of our biophysical and functional characterization of this pathway. To characterize the current properties in response to different intensities of blue light, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes were exposed to increasing light intensity: (1.6, 2.9, 5.1, 6.9, 8.2 and 9.6&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Current amplitude was proportional to light power with higher intensities inducing larger amplitude currents that exhibited more rapid inactivation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). To investigate this further, cells were subjected to an extended 150&#8201;s exposure of&#160; 470&#8201;nm light at two different light intensities. Our results indicate the light-sensitive currents exhibit greater stability with significantly slower inactivation at the lower intensity (time to 50% reduction from peak current&#8201;=&#8201;332&#8201;&#177;&#8201;69&#8201;s and 26&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3&#8201;s for 2.9 or 6.9&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> respectively, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Differentiated adipocytes express a light-sensitive inward current.

To further validate the existence and properties of this putative melanopsin/TRPC signaling axis in scWAT, we used pharmacological inhibitors of melanopsin (opsinamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>), phospholipase C (U73122) and TRPC channels (clemizole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>). In human scWAT differentiated adipocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), the blue light-sensitive current was reversibly inhibited by the application of opsinamide (3 &#956;M), U73122 (10 &#956;M) or clemizole (30 &#956;M) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B&#8211;E</xref>).

These results suggest that the currents were either too small, already inactivated or that there are possibly distinct sub-populations of adipocytes that express this light-sensitive pathway. To test this latter concept and to provide further evidence of melanopsin-mediated light-sensitivity of adipocytes, we used qPCR to screen 11 immortalized clonal adipocyte cell lines for <italic>OPN4</italic> message (cells derived from scWAT from the immortomouse<sup>TM</sup> model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>).

Visual inspection of cells stained for lipid with Oil Red-O suggested reduced lipid content in the light-treated group compared to the control (dark) group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C,D</xref>). This observation may be explained by an increase in lipolysis that can be measured by assaying release of glycerol into the supernatant. Indeed, a significant increase in glycerol release at day 11 and day 14 was observed in the light treated group when compared to the control (dark) group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). The presence of smaller lipid droplets would also indicate an increased basal rate of lipolysis. In this regard, quantification of lipid droplet size revealed that adipocytes in the light treated group contained significantly fewer lipid droplets compared to the control (dark) group (4758&#8201;&#177;&#8201;528 (light) vs 6558&#8201;&#177;&#8201;105 (dark), P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) that were also significantly smaller in size (median values&#8201;=&#8201;23.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.9 &#956;m<sup>2</sup> (light) vs 33.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.6 &#956;m<sup>2</sup> (dark), P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05), (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Differentiated adipocytes also secrete adipokine hormones such as leptin and adiponectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether chronic blue light exposure alters the secretory profile of leptin and adiponectin. Blue light-exposed adipocytes secreted significantly less leptin at days 11 and 14 when compared to the control (dark) group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Adipocytes exposed to blue light also secreted lower amounts of adiponectin, with significant changes apparent starting at exposure day 5 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). To test whether an acute exposure to blue light could elicit similar effects, adipocyte cultures were subjected to a 60&#8201;min blue light exposure. However, no significant changes in either adipokine release nor glycerol content in the media were observed (data not shown).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Chronic blue light treatment of 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes alters lipid storage and adipokine release.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par9">This paper reports a novel and entirely unexpected presence of a blue light-sensitive current in human scWAT that is mediated through a melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway. It is perhaps unsurprising that this pathway has not been previously discovered as the amplitudes of the light-sensitive currents are very small and may be readily inactivated under the broad spectrum white light conditions commonly used in electrophysiology. Our findings also indicate that this melanopsin/TRPC pathway is present at low density in adipocytes for the following reasons. The unitary single channel conductance of TRPC1 and 3 is between 17&#8211;60 pS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Assuming that a single TRPC channel is open 50% of the time when activated and generates a current of ~1&#8211;3 pA, a typical blue light-sensitive current of 50 pA indicates the presence of only ~30&#8211;100 TRPC channels being activated at the adipocyte cell surface. Although adipocytes are well documented as an endocrine cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, they do not behave like typical excitable endocrine cells such as pancreatic beta cells that generate action potentials to drive insulin secretion. Therefore, the small amplitude and stable nature of the light-induced current observed in adipocytes may generate a tonic basal influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cell that regulates downstream cellular processes over a period of hours to days. With respect to signaling pathways potentially involved, activation of the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled melanopsin may signal through DAG-mediated PKC activation that is known to regulate adipocyte lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and increase lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may occur through direct TRPC channel activation, G<sub>q</sub>-mediated IP<sub>3</sub> production, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This may lead to activation of calcium-sensitive PKC isoforms as well as modulation of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling axis that is known to regulate genes involved in adipocyte metabolism and lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. If the melanopsin/TRPC channel axis regulates adipocyte gene transcription, then this may account for the requirement of chronic rather than acute blue-light exposure we observed in our study.</p><p id="Par10">Our findings that blue light exposure of adipocytes causes increased glycerol release and reduced lipid droplet size imply a potential shift in lipid homeostasis toward increased rate of basal lipolysis or reduced fatty acid re-esterification. In this regard, human adipocyte size has been directly correlated with adipokine expression and secretion, whereby smaller adipocytes secrete lower levels of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed that chronic blue light-exposed adipocytes contain smaller lipid droplets and secrete less leptin and adiponectin compared to their control counterparts. Taken together, this suggests that the&#160;effects of chronic blue light exposure on adipokine secretion may be a downstream consequence of reduced adipocyte lipid content. Moreover, adipocyte size is known to be an integral factor determining WAT health with hypertrophied adipocytes being associated with insulin resistance and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The chronic light-induced activation of the melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway may therefore potentially serve as a protective mechanism.</p><p id="Par11">Interestingly, the melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway was observed in both human and murine scWAT. These findings in mice are potentially confounding as the nocturnal behavior, light impermeable fur, and scWAT depot localization do not suggest an obvious role for scWAT light-sensing. The presence of <italic>OPN4</italic> in scWAT in other species suggest a common ancestral origin that provided an evolutionary advantage that is conserved in many mammals with perhaps redundant, limited, or as of yet undetermined biological function. In contrast, scWAT in humans is predominately located just beneath the skin that has a total surface area of 1.5&#8211;2.0&#8201;m<sup>2</sup> in the average human that may be exposed to sunlight. Furthermore, 38.9% of the sun&#8217;s energy at sea level is in the visible range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> with skin being exposed to 200&#8211;400&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> of visible wavelength light on a sunny day. While UV light minimally penetrates the skin, longer visible wavelengths possess greater penetrance and may potentially regulate cellular function. Within the visible spectrum ~40% is in the blue/green wavelength range. Although the majority of this blue/green light is reflected, scattered or absorbed in the upper skin layers, 1&#8211;5% may reach the underlying scWAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, representing ~1&#8211;8&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> of light intensity that is much brighter than an artificially lit laboratory (0.2&#8211;0.4&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, unpublished observations). Therefore, it is important to note that we observed stable light-sensitive currents within this same range of ~1&#8211;8&#8201;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> suggesting that these currents are likely persistently activated by similar blue/green light intensities penetrating the skin on a sunny day.</p><p id="Par12">Our results also demonstrate that the light-sensitive currents were only observed in 10&#8211;13% of cells tested. While this could be explained by extremely low expression of melanopsin/TRPC channels in some cells, limitations of the recording technique or by inactivation prior to recording, it may also suggest the presence of distinct sub-populations. In this regard, the presence of heterogeneous sub-populations of adipocytes within scWAT is an area of active study, and has the potential to reveal adipocytes with specialized functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our observations in <italic>OPN4</italic>+ and <italic>OPN4</italic>- clonal cell lines partially supports this notion, as 22% (7 of 32) of <italic>OPN4</italic>+ cells exhibited current compared to 10&#8211;13% in the other cell types tested (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">In summary, we have identified a novel light-sensitive signaling pathway in human scWAT that is sensitive to ambient light levels that penetrate the skin on a sunny day. As such, these findings may shed new light on our current understanding of adipocyte biology. It is clear that centrally mediated circadian rhythms play an important role in human health and our results provide initial information about how appropriate sunlight exposure to scWAT might act as a peripheral circadian sensor that contributes to metabolic health. In contrast, a lack of sufficient bodily exposure to sunlight may contribute to long-term scWAT dysfunction and the current epidemics of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental models</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Human scWAT</title><p id="Par14">Tissue samples were obtained from subjects undergoing abdominoplasty surgery in accordance with institutional human ethics guidelines and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
