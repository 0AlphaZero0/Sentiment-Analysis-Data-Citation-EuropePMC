Therefore, great efforts have been made in order to best predict CLL evolution at the time of diagnosis, and for this, the most widely used markers are cytogenetic parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To this end, Dohner&#8217;s prognostic algorithm for clinical aggressiveness was proposed by combining conventional chromosome banding with the four main cytogenetic alterations detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) since these abnormalities are present in more than 80% of CLL cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, patients with deletion (del)17p, del(11q), and a complex karyotype (&#8805;&#8201;3 chromosomal abnormalities) most frequently have an unfavorable outcome (high risk) followed by patients with trisomy 12 or a normal karyotype (intermediate risk). In contrast, over 30% of the cases are represented by patients with an isolated del(13q) and exhibit a favorable evolution (low risk). The main limitation of this cytogenetic approach is related to the fact that cytogenetic abnormalities can evolve during the course of the disease with new subclones which can substitute for those previously established, by presenting either new deletions (e.g., del(17p) or del(11q)) or driver mutations (e.g., <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>SF3B1</italic>), and such an effect can be enhanced by chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In parallel, studies have investigated the outcome of CLL patients depending on epigenetic modifications as determined by epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps, and microRNA analysis showing that loss of epigenetic stability is associated with disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The link between DNA methylation loss in promoters and a higher probability of harboring a subclonal driver mutation was highlighted, the consequence being an adverse clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The list of tumor regulator genes and markers with high prognostic significance, like <italic>TCL1</italic>, <italic>CD20</italic>, and <italic>LPL</italic>, which display altered DNA methylation regulation, is continuously growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. DNA demethylation also occurs at repetitive elements, suggesting that global DNA demethylation reported in CLL largely accounts for repetitive elements that represent half of the chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying aberrant DNA methylation in CLL are complex and do not rely only on the control of DNA methylation by DNA methyl transferases (DNMT). DNA demethylation, catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, has also been shown to be altered in CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The goal of the present work was to ascertain the associations between the main cytogenetic risk factors of the disease and the two cytosine derivatives: 5-methylcytosine (5-mCyt) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmCyt). <italic>DNMT</italic> and <italic>TET</italic> transcript levels were also studied by real-time quantitative (RTq)-PCR. The main observation highlighted by this study is that combining a conventional cytogenetic approach with global 5-mCyt assessment drastically improves CLL outcome prediction in patients with del(13q).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population characteristics according to cytogenetic risk groups</title><p id="Par8">Conventional chromosome and FISH analyses were performed, prior to treatment initiation, on the 127 CLL patients retrospectively included in the study at Brest University Hospital. Among them, 110 (86.6%) exhibited del(13q) which was isolated in 64 (50%) patients, 8 (6.3%) presented a normal karyotype, 11 (8.7%) had trisomy 12, 13 (10.2%) had a del(11q), 12 (9.4%) had a del(17p), and 15 (11.8%) had a complex karyotype with 3 or more cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients were segregated into cytogenetic risk groups according to the following classification: 64 (50%) patients with isolated del(13q) were in the low-risk group, 19 (15%) with normal karyotype or trisomy 12 were in the intermediate-risk group, and 30 (23.6%) with del(11q), del(17p), or complex karyotype were in the high-risk group. To be consistent with the cytogenetic classification criteria, 14 patients (11%) presenting 1&#8211;2 cytogenetic abnormalities, other than those aforementioned, were excluded from further analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In order to validate the cohort, we next evaluated the CLL outcome from the time of diagnosis, and as anticipated, the low-risk group had the longest median time to progression (PFS) and treatment initiation (TFS) (both &gt;&#8201;120&#160;months), followed by the intermediate-risk group (72 and 77&#160;months, respectively) and the high-risk group (40 and 72&#160;months, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.003 and <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001, respectively) (Fig<italic>.</italic>&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). We further evaluated the association between the cytogenetic classification and prognostic factors such as age at diagnosis, sex, Binet stage, lymphocytosis, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (<italic>IGHV</italic>) mutational status, and CD38 positivity (&gt;&#8201;30%) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Among these factors, lymphocytosis significantly progressed from the low-risk group to the high-risk group, and the highest levels were observed in the intermediate-risk group (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.006). Additionally, median LDT was progressively shorter from the low-risk group to the high-risk group (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), confirming that LDT, rather than lymphocytosis, better predicted disease progression.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

Moreover, as previous studies have shown that CLL patients with isolated del(13q) have a more aggressive disease when presenting a high percentage of 13q deleted nuclei (&gt;&#8201;80%) or biallelic deletions in the 13q14 locus, we tested whether these factors were associated with the global DNA 5-mCyt and 5-hmCyt status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

However, such an approach poorly integrates clonal evolution, thus indicating that the well-established Dohner&#8217;s classification can be improved. Accordingly, we have hypothesized that coupling cytogenetic and epigenetic factors would help predict disease outcome, and in addition, we have confirmed the importance of epigenetic modifications in CLL outcome.</p><p id="Par17">Interplay exists between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms during CLL evolution, and two models were proposed for this co-evolution, one based on a stepwise acquisition model from early clonal mutations/cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g., del(13q)), while in the second model, a simultaneous acquisition was proposed (e.g., del(17p)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The simultaneous acquisition model is supported by the observation that del(17p) involving the tumor suppressor <italic>TP53</italic> is associated with global DNA demethylation in CLL B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and by our observation that CLL patients from the cytogenetic intermediate- and/or high-risk groups present a reduction in 5-mCyt and 5-hmCyt levels and in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> and <italic>TET1/2</italic> transcripts. In the second model, as observed in CLL patients with low-risk cytogenetic abnormalities such as del(13q), the global DNA methylation pattern is suspected to be relatively stable over time, and when disease progression occurs, selection of novel global DNA methylation patterns evolves independently of the genetic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Indeed, del(13q) is suspected to be an early event as confirmed by the detection of this cytogenetic abnormality in the CD34<sup>+</sup> cell population in CLL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our study further supports the stepwise dynamic model of clonal populations in CLL with the del(13q) as an early event which can be associated with epigenetic dysregulations as this clonal population expands. This is highlighted by the observation that CLL patients with a higher percentage (above 80%) of 13q deleted nuclei also have a defective DNA methylation process and a shorter PFS and TFS. Further on, this is also in agreement with the report that CLL patients with a higher percentage of 13q deleted nuclei have a transcriptome pattern similar to del(11p) and del(17q) patients, abnormal miRNA expression, and dysregulated pathways implicated in apoptosis and proliferation (BCR and NF-kappaB signaling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Altogether, our data and previously published data support a chronology of molecular events involving first the del(13q) and afterwards, as the clone expends, important epigenetic modifications. However, one question remains to be answered which concerns the possible contribution of suppressor genes from the deleted 13q locus to the regulation of the methylation process. Moreover, in this locus, differentially methylated regions have been identified in CLL B cells compared to controls, and they are located within tumor suppressor genes including the deleted in lymphocytic leukemia (<italic>DLEU</italic>)1 and the <italic>DLEU2</italic> variant <italic>ALT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Further experiments are required to test whether these suppressor genes are in turn involved in the global DNA methylation process and whether DNA demethylation leads to an adverse clinical outcome per se or through subclonal driver mutations.</p><p id="Par18">
<italic>DNMT3A</italic> is thought to be critical in the control of DNA methylation in CLL, and such an assertion is supported by the observation that <italic>DNMT3A</italic> knockdown in rodent hematopoietic stem cells results in CLL development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and that <italic>DNMT3A</italic> is present in the top 1% of the under-expressed genes in human CLL B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An interaction between the two CLL high-risk factors TCL1 and NOTCH1 with DNMT3A to inhibit its function is also reported in CLL B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Accordingly, we have investigated <italic>DNMT</italic>s in CLL B cells and observed that <italic>DNMT1</italic> and <italic>DNMT3B</italic> are downregulated in the cytogenetic low- and intermediate/high-risk groups while <italic>DNMT3A</italic> reduction was restricted to CLLs carrying cytogenetic intermediate/high-risk factors. This result differs from previous publications, which have compared CLL B cells with peripheral blood normal B cells to show, in one case, normal <italic>DNMT1</italic> expression, an upregulation of <italic>DNMT3A</italic>, and a reduction of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> in CLL B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and in the other case, researchers have reported a reduction in <italic>DNMT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These discrepancies could be most likely due to the selection of the control cells as important variations in DNMTs are reported during B cell ontogeny and to the reference gene used for correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Despite its stability, 5-mCyt can be reversed firstly during DNA replication in a passive way or, secondly, by TET proteins which can mediate 5-mCyt oxidation to 5-hmCyt, and in a less efficient fashion to 5-formylcytosine (5-fCyt), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-CaCyt). Next, transformation to an unmodified Cyt requires the coupled action of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and the base excision repair (BER) system. <italic>TET1</italic> and double <italic>TET1/TET2</italic> knockdown promote B cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. First reported in myeloid lineage malignant diseases, 5-hmCyt level reduction was related to mutations in <italic>TET</italic>s or their regulators (e.g., <italic>IDH1/2</italic>, <italic>WT1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In CLL, DNA demethylation is observed, but mutations in <italic>TET</italic>s and <italic>IDH</italic>s are rare events. However, a reduction in <italic>TET1/3</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> was shown to be associated with a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this report, we could confirm that patients with low mRNA expression of <italic>TET1</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic> were predominantly classified into the cytogenetic intermediate/high-risk group, which is in agreement with our observation that both 5-mCyt and 5-hmCyt levels were reduced in the intermediate- and/or high-risk groups. Van Damme et al. observed a decreased expression of <italic>TET1</italic> in CLL B cells but did not observe an association with DNA hydroxymethylation, and this may be explained, in part, by the small number of patients studied for hydroxymethylation levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In another study comparing CLL B cells to peripheral blood B cells, <italic>TET2</italic> was reported to be overexpressed and such overexpression was not associated with other clinical and biological markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The list of the mechanisms controlling <italic>TET</italic> expression in leukemic cells is growing and involves microenvironmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and miRNAs such as miR-15a and miR-29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additional experiments are required to better understand the mechanisms controlling active DNA demethylation in CLL and their consequences.</p><p id="Par20">Relevant limitations of our study include the following: (i) global 5-mCyt and 5-hmCyt analysis is likely to reflect variations of repetitive elements (half of the genome) than gene regulatory sequence, which may render comparison with EWAS studies difficult; (ii) the absence of a well-established control B cell for CLL B cells, making difficult the comparison of the transcriptional analysis between normal and tumor cells; and (iii) a transcriptional analysis for <italic>DNMT</italic>s and <italic>TET</italic>s, which does not test enzyme activity.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, our study established that loss in the 5-Cyt derivatives, 5-mCyt and, to a lesser extent, 5-hmCyt, during disease progression, better predict the CLL patients&#8217; outcome when associated with the classical cytogenetic analysis. Future work is required to develop routine assays for monitoring DNA methylation during disease course and to test their utility as therapeutic response predictors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cells and sample preparation</title><p id="Par22">Clinical and biological data were retrospectively obtained for 127 untreated patients diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and samples were collected for 60 CLL patients and 15 healthy volunteers at the Brest University Hospital.
