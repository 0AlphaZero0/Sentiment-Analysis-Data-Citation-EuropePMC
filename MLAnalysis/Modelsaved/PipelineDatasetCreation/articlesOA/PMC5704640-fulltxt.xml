However, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient quantity of RNA molecules for gene expression profiling under many practical situations. For example, minimally invasive tissue biopsy techniques, such as fine needle aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy and gastrointestinal endoscopy, are widely used clinically but minimum samples are extracted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For another example, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples with abundant clinical information, the amount of RNA is often limited due to partial RNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the studies of rare cell population, single cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or the samples taken with the laser capture microdissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] technique, the amount of RNA molecules is also extremely low.</p><p id="Par21">It is critical to overcome this challenge to leverage the power of low-input sampling techniques for biomedical applications. For this type of samples, multiple rounds of pre-amplification are necessary prior to the measurements of gene expression levels. Thus, a number of low-input RNA amplification techniques prior sequencing have been developed using PCR or in vitro transcription (IVT) to synthesize enough cDNA or cRNA, such as Smart-seq (switching mechanism at 5&#8242;-end of the RNA transcript) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], DP-seq (primer-based RNA-sequencing strategy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and CEL-seq (cell expression by linear amplification and sequencing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, current low-input amplification techniques usually bring a large bias due to the inherent defects in the amplification principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, CEL-seq incorporating IVT can result in 3&#8242; biases due to two rounds of reverse transcription before the linear amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Smart-Seq, using PCR to synthesize cDNA, is a nonlinear amplification process, and its efficiency is sequence-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; a long transcript may be truncated due to inefficient cDNA synthesis during the amplification process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been reported that the amplification bias always exists in lowly expressed genes and genes with abundant CG and long length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As a result, it is uncertain whether the expression values measured after the amplification can represent the real gene expression levels or not.</p><p id="Par22">Several studies attempted to prove that gene expression profiling can be performed on low-input RNA samples like high-input RNA samples by showing that the gene expression profiles of low-input RNA samples are significantly correlated with those of the matched high-input RNA samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, a high correlation between two measurements does not guarantee that the two measurements are congruent, which brings uncertainty to the application of most current disease signatures based on risk scores which are calculated using the measurement values of the signature genes. Therefore, for a transcriptional signature based on the quantitative expression levels, the risk score thresholds determined from high-input RNA samples may be not applicable to low-input RNA samples, and vice versa. It has been reported that quantitative transcriptional signatures lack robustness for clinical applications due to measurement batch effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], variations of the tumor epithelial cell proportions in tissues sampled from different sites of a tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and partial RNA degradation during sample preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Another type of disease signature is based on the within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which have been identified for predicting the prognosis of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], ER+ breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These REOs-based signatures are robust against various measurement biases introduced by experimental batch effects and platform differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], partial RNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and uncertain sampling sites within the same cancer tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the REOs of gene pairs within individual samples, especially those with large rank differences, might also be robust against the biases introduced by the RNA amplification procedures.</p><p id="Par23">Through comparing gene expression profiles between the samples with low-input mRNA, ranging from 25&#160;pg to 1000&#160;pg mRNA profiled by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and their paired high-input 50&#160;ng mRNA samples, we found that there were thousands of genes with at least 2 folds-change (FC) in their expression values even when the input mRNA was 1000&#160;pg. We evaluated the proportions of REOs of gene pairs in the high-input RNA samples maintained in the low-input RNA samples, and found that the proportions were approximately 90% even when the input mRNA was as low as 1000&#160;pg and the input total RNA samples was as low as 250&#160;pg, which suggests that REOs measured in the low-input samples were robust against amplification. Similar results were also found in the low input total RNA ranging from 10&#160;pg to 1000&#160;pg profiled by the Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platform compared with the 100&#160;ng input total RNA samples. As a case study to demonstrate the robustness of REOs-based signatures, we developed REOs-based signatures from high-input RNA samples for discriminating cancer tissues and showed that they can be robustly applied to low-input RNA samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Large amplification bias of low-input RNA samples</title><p id="Par24">Based on two datasets (GSE50856 and GSE17565, see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) measured by Illumina HiSeq 2000 and Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platforms, respectively, we evaluated the amplification fidelity of low-input RNA samples amplified by several techniques through comparison with the corresponding high-input RNA samples using the FC values.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Datasets in this study. <bold>a</bold> The GSE50856 dataset was divided into 6 groups: SFM-Smart, SFM-DP, SFM-CEL, AA100-Smart, AA100-DP and AA100-CEL.

As the amount of RNA in the diluted low input samples decreased, the percentage of genes with at least 2 FC increased. Similar results were also observed in the other five groups of dataset GSE50856 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the SFM-smart data, the coefficient of variation (CV) of FCs increased from 0.18 to 0.33 as the quantity of the input RNA decreased from 1000&#160;pg to 25&#160;pg (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#160;1Sa).

If 2 or 3 REOs of the 3 gene pairs in a sample were consistent with the REO patterns in the lymphoma tissue samples, the sample was identified as a lymphoma tissue sample; otherwise, the sample was identified as a breast cancer tissue sample. In the training datasets, obviously, all of the lymphoma tissues samples and the breast cancer tissue samples were correctly classified using the signature. In the independent validation dataset, consisting of 81 high-input RNA samples of lymphoma tissue from the GSE53820 dataset and 30 high-input RNA samples of breast cancer tissue from the GSE10780 dataset, all of the samples were correctly classified.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>High-input RNA tissue samples used in this study</p></caption></table-wrap>

</p><p id="Par32">We further applied the REOs-based signature to distinguish Raji and MCF-7 cell lines profiled with high-input with 100&#160;ng total RNA and low-input samples with as low as 50&#160;pg total RNA from the GSE17565 dataset. All the 8 high-input Raji cell line samples, 8 high-input MCF-7 cell line samples, 12 low-input Raji cell line samples and 12 low-input MCF-7 cell line samples were correctly classified. This case study demonstrates that a REOs-based transcriptional signature identified from the high-input RNA tissue samples can be applied to classify low-input samples robustly.</p><p id="Par33">As a second case study, we identified a REO-based signature from high-input RNA samples for discriminating primary colorectal tumors from normal colorectal tissues and showed that it can be robustly applied to low-input RNA samples summarized from single-cell RNA-seq data. Firstly, using the 41 colon adenocarcinoma samples and paired normal samples from TCGA, we identified two lists of gene pairs, each with identical REOs in all samples of the primary colorectal tumor tissue and the corresponding normal tissue, respectively. From the above two lists of gene pairs, 20,390 gene pairs were found to have reversal REOs between the tumor tissues and the normal tissues. Because there were an abundance of dropout events that led to zero expression values for approximately 90% of the genes measured in the single-cell data, it would be inappropriate to select only a few gene pairs as the diagnostic signature. Therefore, all the reversal gene pairs were directly used as the signature. In the training dataset, the 20,390 gene pairs correctly classified all the cancer and normal samples according to the majority voting rule. Then, we collected an independent dataset from GSE10950 with 25 high-input RNA samples of paired colon tumor tissues and colon normal tissues to validate this signature. Because only 18,227 gene pairs of the 20,390 gene pairs were measured in this dataset by the Illumina human Ref-8 v2.0 platform, these 18,227 gene pairs were used to classify the samples according to the majority voting rule and all the samples were correctly classified. However, with the same strategy, 272 colorectal tumor epithelial cells and 157 normal epithelial cells from the GSE81861 dataset could not be correctly classified. This result is not surprising since a cell contains only approximately 10&#160;pg RNA and 90% of genes were measured with zero expression values. The REOs of gene pairs in such small input RNA samples would be unstable as demonstrated above. To address this issue, we constructed a pooled dataset from the single-cell RNA-seq results.</p><p id="Par34">In the GSE81861 dataset, the 272 tumor epithelial cells and the 157 normal epithelial cells were extracted from 11 patients of primary colorectal tumors and paired normal tissues; however, there were no annotation on patients&#8217; information. We randomly assigned the 272 colorectal tumor epithelial cells into 11 samples with approximately equal number of cells: 10 samples each with 25 single cells and a sample with 22 single cells. Each simulated disease sample contains approximately 250&#160;pg RNA. Similarly, the 157 normal epithelial cells were also randomly assigned into 10 samples each with 14 single cells and a sample with 17 single cells. Each sample approximately contains 140&#160;pg RNA. In each sample, we calculated the sum of the measurement values for each gene to represent the expression levels of the genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Then, the REO signature with 20,390 gene pairs constructed from the high-input RNA samples was applied to classify the simulated low-input RNA samples from the single-cell data. Because only 18,308 gene pairs of the 20,390 gene pairs were measured in single cells by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, we used the measured 18,308 gene pairs to classify the samples according to the majority voting rule. This random experiment was repeated for 100 times. The results showed that the average sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 73.55%, respectively. As demonstrated in the above Section, the REOs of gene pairs in the input samples with less than 250&#160;pg RNA input tends to be less robust against the amplification bias. Therefore, for the 18,308 gene pairs, we respectively excluded 10 and 20% of pairs with the smallest average rank differences in either the normal samples or the disease samples, and used the remained gene pairs to classify the samples. For 100 random experiments, while the average sensitivity was kept at 100%, the average specificity increased to 91.82% (or 100%) when 10% (or 20%) of the gene pairs with the smallest average rank differences in either the normal samples or the disease samples were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">It is crucial to develop reliable analysis methods for the precise monitoring of global gene expression levels in limited clinical tissues in many research areas of biological and medical disciplines. For those methods based on quantitative gene expression values such as differential genes and risk score signatures, there exists large uncertainty for the low-input RNA samples due to inherent amplification bias and technical noise in the amplification procedures. However, the relative expression orderings of gene pairs are tolerant to these issues, which suggests us that we should take the advantage of the robustness of REOs to gain more reliable biological insight.</p><p id="Par36">We compared serially diluted RNA samples to evaluate the impact of amplification techniques for low-input RNA samples on the gene expression profile measurements. As displayed in the study, thousands of genes had at least 2 folds-change of expression measurements in the low-input RNA samples compared with the paired high-input RNA samples due to the amplification procedure. Consequently, for the transcriptional signatures based on the quantitative expression levels, the risk threshold values determined from high-input RNA samples could not be applied to low-input RNA samples directly and vice versa. In contrast, we found that approximately 90% of REOs of gene pairs in high-input RNA samples were maintained in the diluted 1000&#160;pg, low-input mRNA samples which were amplified and profiled by Smart-seq, DP-seq and CEL-seq techniques using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. For the low-input total samples which were amplified and profiled by the Whole-Genome DASL technique using the Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platform, at least 90% of REOs of gene pairs in the high-input samples were maintained in the diluted 1000&#160;pg and 250&#160;pg input samples but unstable in the 50&#160;pg and10 pg input samples to a certain degree.</p><p id="Par37">Our REO-based method facilitates gene expression profiling analysis in the context where the starting RNA material is extremely limited. A problem with the current study is that we cannot find appropriate data to verify the clinical value of the REOs-based signature. For the future study, it is worthwhile to further evaluate the method using clinically meaningful low-input RNA data such like tissues from minimally invasive tissue biopsy techniques and single-cell samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">Thousands of genes have at least 2 folds-change of expression measurements in low-input mRNA and total RNA samples compared with the corresponding paired high-input samples. In contrast, most of the REOs of gene pairs in the high-input samples are maintained in the diluted low-input samples. Therefore, REOs-based disease signatures determined from high-input samples can be robustly applied to low-input samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data sources and data preprocessing</title><p id="Par39">All the gene expression data analyzed in this study were downloaded from the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>), as described in details in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The control samples were labeled with &#8220;SFM&#8221; and the Activin A-treated samples were labeled with &#8220;AA1000&#8221;. The low-input samples were amplified and profiled by Smart-seq, DP-seq and CEL-seq techniques using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, with those of the paired high-input (50&#160;ng) mRNA samples. Based on the amplification methods and cell line treatment status, the dataset was divided into 6 groups: SFM-Smart, SFM-DP, SFM-CEL, AA100-Smart, AA100-DP and AA100-CEL. Each group had four input levels, 1000&#160;pg, 100&#160;pg, 50&#160;pg and 25&#160;pg, and each level had two technical replicates. The gene expression profile of dataset GSE17565 was measured by the Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platform for two cell lines, Raji and MCF-7. The dataset was divided into 2 groups: Raji and MCF-7. The low-input total RNA samples were amplified and profiled by the Whole-Genome DASL technique using the Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platform using the Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 platform, with those of the paired high-input (100&#160;ng) total RNA samples. There were four input levels, 1000&#160;pg, 100,250&#160;pg, 50&#160;pg and 25 10&#160;pg as well for both cell lines, and every input level had two technical replicates (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">For the GSE50856 dataset, we downloaded the mappable reads that fell onto gene&#8217;s exons. The experiments of standard RNA-seq, Smart-seq and DP-seq are single-end RNA-seq where every read corresponds to a single fragment. Thus, the RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) and FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) metrics are conceptually analogous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which could be used to quantify the gene expression level. The RPKM metric was estimated by the formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]: R&#8201;=&#8201;(10^9*C)/NL, where C is the number of mapped reads that fell onto the gene&#8217;s exons, N is the total number of mapped reads in the experiment, and L is the sum of the exons in base pairs. On the other hand, The experiment of CEL-seq is paired-end sequencing where two reads correspond to a single fragment and only FPKM could be used to quantify the gene expression level. For the paired-end experiment, the FPKM value would be half of the RPKM value. This is not always true because in some cases only one of the two reads belonging to a fragment might be mapped. However, for most applications this simplification works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The mouse mm9 genome was used for the genome annotation.
