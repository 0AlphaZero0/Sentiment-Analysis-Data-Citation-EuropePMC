However, the role of lncRNA in CRC liver metastasis remains unclear. <bold>Methods:</bold> a microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs between CRC tissues with and without liver metastasis. Survival analysis was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed using the log-rank test. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays were preformed to explore the biological effects of the differentially expressed lncRNA in CRC cells. <bold>Results:</bold> the lncRNA UICLM (up-regulated in colorectal cancer liver metastasis) was significantly up-regulated in cases of CRC with liver metastasis. Moreover, UICLM expression was higher in CRC tissues than in normal tissues, and UICLM expression was associated with poor patient survival. Knockdown of UICLM inhibited CRC cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC stem cell formation <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as tumor growth and liver metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ectopic expression of UICLM promoted CRC cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistic investigations revealed that UICLM induced its biological effects by regulating ZEB2, as the oncogenesis facilitated by UICLM was inhibited by ZEB2 depletion. Further study indicated that UICLM acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-215 to regulate ZEB2 expression. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> taken together, our findings demonstrate how UICLM induces CRC liver metastasis and may offer a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>long non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>CRC</kwd><kwd>lncRNA UICLM</kwd><kwd>liver metastasis.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Despite tremendous progress in the treatment of CRC in recent decades, the prognosis remains unsatisfactory, especially in advanced-stage tumors with distant metastasis <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The most common site for distant metastasis in CRC is the liver. It is reported that approximately 25% of CRC patients present with synchronous liver metastases at diagnosis, and approximately 50% of CRC patients develop metachronous liver metastases 3 years after treatment <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. As most CRC patients with liver metastases are not able to undergo surgery, the prognosis is dismal, with a 5-year survival rate less than 10% after the diagnosis of liver metastasis <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Therefore, it is vital to identify the molecular mechanisms and genetic alterations of CRC metastases to develop effective therapies.</p><p>Recently, integrative genomic studies have revealed that more than 90% of the DNA sequence is actively transcribed, with only 2% of these transcripts encoding protein, while most of the transcripts are referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Among these ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of transcripts with lengths greater than 200 nucleotides. lncRNAs have been found to be abundantly transcribed in mammalian cells as well as plant cells <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. These lncRNAs can act as guides, scaffolds, decoys and tethers of other biological molecules and are involved in various biological processes, such as cell growth, cell differentiation, cell apoptosis, cell invasion and stem cell pluripotency <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Increasing evidence has indicated that lncRNA expression profiling can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for different tumors, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer and CRC <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Although a growing number of lncRNAs have been annotated, the role and molecular regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in CRC liver metastasis are still unclear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Human tissue samples</title><p>This study was approved by the institutional ethics review board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) (Guangzhou, China), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in this study. None of the patients receive any treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) before surgery. For microarray analysis, a total of 15 CRC tissue samples (7 with liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis and 8 stage III patients who did not have metastasis at the time of diagnosis or during the follow-up period of more than 2 years after resection) were obtained from SYSUCC between May 2005 and September 2012 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). For validation, another larger cohort of patients including 55 patients with liver metastases and 67 patients without liver metastases who received surgery between March 2004 and October 2013 in SYSUCC was also included in this study. Their primary CRC tissues (n = 122), adjacent non-tumor tissues (n = 122) and corresponding matched liver metastatic tissues (n = 55) were obtained immediately upon surgery and stored at -80&#176;C or paraffin-embedded. The clinical stage was classified based on the 7th edition of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) on Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. All of the patients were followed-up regularly at 3-month intervals after surgery. The median follow-up period was 55.7 months (range, 24.5 - 156.3). The clinical data of these patients were obtained from their medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and microarray analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA quality was confirmed by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by NanoDrop ND-1000. The samples (CRC tissues with or without liver metastasis, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>) were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA, and the cDNA was then labeled and hybridized to the LncRNA Expression Microarray (Arraystar 8x60Kv3.0, Rockville, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After hybridization, the arrays were washed, and the slides were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent p/n G2565BA). Raw data were extracted as pair files using the Agilent Feature Extraction. The random variance model was used to identify the differentially expressed genes.

RNA purity was assessed using the Qubit&#174;. Each RNA sample had an A260:A280 ratio above 1.8 and A260:A230 ratio above 2.0. RNA integrity was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, USA) and each sample had a RINe above 7.0. Briefly, rRNAs were removed from Total RNA using Epicentre Ribo-Zero rRNARemoval Kit (illumina, USA) and fragmented to approximately 200 bp. Subsequently, the purified RNAs were subjected to first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis followed by adaptor ligation and enrichment with a low-cycle according to instructions of TruSeq&#174; RNA LT/HT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, USA). The purified library products were evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit&#174;2.0 (Life Technologies, USA) and then diluted to 10 pM for cluster generation <italic>in situ</italic> on the HiSeq3000 pair-end flow cell followed by sequencing (2&#215;150 bp) on HiSeq3000.

The fragment from UICLM containing the predicted miR-215 binding site was amplified by PCR and cloned into a pmirGLO Dual-luciferase Target Expression Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to form the reporter vector UICLM-wild-type (UICLM-wt). To test the binding specificity, the corresponding mutant was created by mutating the miR-215 seed region binding site (seed sequence binding fragment 5'-CAAUUCAAUG-3' changed to 5'-GGACCGAAUG-3'), which was named UICLM-mt. HEK 293Ta cells were co-transfected with the pmirGLO vector with either wild-type fragments or mutation fragments and indicated miRNAs/siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h later, a luciferase reporter assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity. To confirm the direct regulating relationship between miR-215 and ZEB2, the full-length 3'-UTR of ZEB2 mRNA and a mutant variant were amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI site of a pGL3-basic vector (Promega) and termed ZEB2-wt-3'UTR and ZEB2-mt-3'UTR, respectively. The miR-215 expression plasmid (pcDNA-miR-215) was generated using synthetic oligonucleotides and the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP vector. Cells were cultured in a 6-well plate and then transfected with the pcDNAmiR-215 or the negative control (NC) (750 ng/well), the pGL3 reporter vector (250 ng/well) and the pRL-TK luciferase reporters (25 ng/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

We identified 493 differentially expressed lncRNAs between the two groups, including up-regulated and down-regulated lncRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). To confirm the microarray results, we randomly selected top 12 lncRNAs that were up-regulated in CRC with liver metastasis for validation. The real-time PCR results confirmed that 9 of these lncRNAs were significantly overexpressed in CRC with liver metastasis compared to their expression in CRC without liver metastasis (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). To further select the lncRNAs that play a critical role in CRC liver metastasis, the expression of the above 9 lncRNAs was detected in another larger cohort of 122 CRC patients. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B, only lncRNA LOC200772 (Accession: NR_033841, a 2274 bp transcript with 9 exon and localizes in human chromosome 2q37.3) was significantly up-regulated in CRC with liver metastasis. As its function is still uncharacterized in CRC, we therefore designated it as lncRNA UICLM (up-regulated in colorectal cancer liver metastasis). Moreover, UICLM expression was markedly increased in tumor tissues compared with its expression in adjacent non-tumor tissues, and increased expression was also observed in advanced tumor stage patients (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and D). Likewise, the expression of UICLM was higher in CRC cells than in the immortalized colon epithelial cell line CCD-112CoN (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). We verified that UICLM was indeed a non-coding RNA with an<italic> in vitro</italic> translation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>) and online protein coding potential assessment software (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation and real-time PCR analysis showed that UICLM is mainly located in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>). ISH analysis confirmed the expression pattern of UICLM in tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>g i-iii). Then, to analyze the clinical and pathological association of UICLM in CRC patients, the patients were divided into two groups (high expression and low expression) based on the mean UICLM expression level from real-time PCR. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>, UICLM expression was significantly associated with tumor size (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004), liver metastasis (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and TNM stage (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008). However, no correlation was observed between UICLM and age, gender, tumor depth, histological grade or lymph node invasion. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with high UICLM levels presented with worse progression-free survival (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.075, respectively, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F and H). In addition, univariate analysis revealed that tumor size, lymph node invasion, liver metastasis and TNM stage were also associated with overall survival (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>). Finally, multivariate analysis demonstrated that UICLM expression and liver metastasis were independent prognostic indicators for CRC patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.017, respectively; Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>lncRNA UICLM is required for efficient proliferation and tumor growth of CRC cells</title><p>Specific siRNAs were used to knock down UICLM expression in two CRC cell lines, SW620 and DLD-1, which have relatively high expression of UICLM.

A colony formation assay also confirmed that UICLM knockdown markedly reduced the colony formation number in SW620 and DLD-1 cells, whereas ectopic expression of UICLM increased the colony formation number in HCT116 and HT-29 cells (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>C-D). To further investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of UICLM on CRC cells, we constructed two stable cell lines using a lentivirus vector to mediate UICLM suppression in SW620 cells, designated SW620 sh-NC and SW620 sh-UICLM. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR and the observation of green fluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>). The results indicated that the tumor volume and tumor weight of tumors formed by SW620 sh-UICLM cells (n = 10) were significantly reduced compared with the tumor volume and weight of those formed by SW620 sh-NC cells (n =10) (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). The ISH analysis confirmed that knockdown of UICLM reduced UICLM expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, and IHC analysis showed that knockdown of UICLM significantly reduced Ki-67 expression (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E and F).</p></sec><sec><title>lncRNA UICLM is required for cell migration, invasion, EMT and liver metastasis of CRC cells</title><p>A transwell assay demonstrated that knockdown of UICLM significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW620 and DLD-1 cells (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A), while ectopic expression of UICLM markedly increased cell invasion in HCT116 and HT-29 cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>A). A wound healing assay also indicated that knockdown of UICLM markedly reduced cell migration in SW620 and DLD-1 cells (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). As EMT plays an important role in cell migration and invasion, we tested whether UICLM affects EMT in CRC cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that knockdown of UICLM decreased the expression of N-cadherin, whereas the expression of E-cadherin was increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). The real-time PCR results confirmed that knockdown of UICLM significantly reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimetin, Snail, Slug) while increasing the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, &#945;-catenin, &#946;-ctenin) (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). In contrast, ectopic expression of UICLM markedly promoted cell invasion in HCT116 and HT-29 cells and increased the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimetin, Snail, Slug) while decreasing the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, &#945;-catenin, &#946;-catenin) (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>B). To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of UICLM on liver metastasis, cells (SW620 sh-NC and SW620 sh-UICLM) were injected into the distal tip of the spleen using a Hamilton syringe. The results showed that all of the mice formed tumors in the spleen, and 100% of the mice injected with SW620 sh-NC cells formed liver metastases. In contrast, only approximately 58% of the mice injected with SW620 sh-UICLM cells formed liver metastases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E). Moreover, the numbers of metastatic nodules in the livers were significantly reduced in mice injected with SW620 sh-UICLM cells compared with the numbers in those injected with SW620 sh-NC cells (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F).</p></sec><sec><title>lncRNA UICLM regulates the stemness of CRC cells</title><p>To assess the role of UICLM in regulating the stemness of CRC cells, a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technique that can exclude Hoechst 33342 dye was used to isolate CRC side population (SP) cells. The results showed that knockdown of UICLM could significantly reduce the SP cell proportion in SW620 and DLD-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). In addition, functional assays were performed to test whether UICLM could increase the stemness of CRC cells. The results showed that knockdown of UICLM significantly reduced sphere formation in SW620 and DLD-1 cells (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Furthermore, knockdown of UICLM could markedly down-regulate many stemness-associated genes (Nanog, Oct-4, SOX2, and Notch1), multiple drug-resistant transporter genes (ABCG2) and surface antigens associated with cancer stem cells (CD24, CD44, CD133, CD155 and CD166) (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Finally, a tumor formation assay was used to assess whether UICLM could increase<italic> in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity. The results demonstrated that more than 80% of the mice developed tumors when injected with 2.0 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> SW620 sh-NC cells, whereas the tumor incidence was reduced to 33.3% when mice were injected with SW620 sh-UICLM cells (Group #1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D i-ii). The tumor incidence was 58.3% in the control group when the mice were injected with 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells, and the tumor incidence was reduced to 16.6% in the sh-UICLM group (Group #2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D i-ii). Likewise, knockdown of UICLM dramatically reduced the tumor incidence from 33.3% to 8.3% when the mice were injected with 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> cells (Group #3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D i-ii). Consistently, compared with the sh-UICLM group, in the sh-NC group, the tumor volume and tumor weight were significantly decreased (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D iii).</p></sec><sec><title>lncRNA UICLM interacts with ZEB2 to promote cell proliferation and invasion in CRC cells</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism by which UICLM is associated with CRC progression and metastasis, we explored the gene expression profiles of CRC cells with knocked down UICLM expression (schematic shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). The SW620 cells were treated with specific siRNAs for UICLM, and the expression levels of all mRNAs were measured by RNA sequencing. The UICLM-associated pathways were determined by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which determines whether different pathways show statistically significant differences between two groups. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, the pathway &#8220;cellular migration and invasion&#8221; was assigned the highest enrichment score. By analysis of the correlation between UICLM and mRNAs from our lncRNA/mRNA microarray dataset, we found that ZEB2 was assigned the highest correlation coefficient in this pathway. Moreover, ZEB2 was one of the most down-regulated genes after knockdown of UICLM in SW620 cells in the RNA sequencing assay (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>). Based on these results, we supposed that a correlation might exist between UICLM and ZEB2. We used IHC and real-time PCR to measure the protein and mRNA levels of ZEB2, respectively, in 122 CRC patients. The results showed that ZEB2 was significantly overexpressed in CRC with liver metastasis compared to its expression in CRC without liver metastasis, and a positive correlation was found between the expression level of ZEB2 and UICLM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C i-ii). Moreover, the expression level of ZEB2 was higher in CRC cell lines than in the immortalized colon epithelial cell line CCD-112CoN (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). Knockdown/ectopic expression of UICLM could significantly reduce/increase the mRNA and protein level of ZEB2 in CRC cells (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E i-iii). Further functional study revealed that the cell invasion ability stimulated by UICLM overexpression could be suppressed by knockdown of ZEB2 (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>F i-ii).</p></sec><sec><title>LncRNA UICLM regulates ZEB2 expression by competing for miR-215</title><p>It is known that lncRNAs can function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to protect mRNAs by competing for their targeting microRNAs. Therefore, we investigated whether UICLM played such a role. Using bioinformatics (miRcode Starbase v2.0, and RNAhybrid) tools, we found 7 miRNAs that putatively bound to UICLM (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>). Among these candidate miRNAs, miR-215 could directly bind to both UICLM and ZEB2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A i-iii). We found that overexpression of miR-215 significantly inhibited UICLM expression, while knockdown of UICLM significantly increased miR-215 expression (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B i-ii). We also performed experiments to determine whether UILCM could affect the processing of miR-215. As UICLM is located in the cytoplasm, we looked for whether UICLM could regulate the expression of pre-miR-215. The results showed that knockdown of UICLM in SW620 and DLD-1 cells did not affect the expression of pre-miR-215 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>). Dual-luciferase assays indicated a significant reduction in luciferase activities after co-transfection of miR-215 and a wild-type UICLM reporter vector, but not in mutant-type UICLM (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). To determine whether UICLM and miR-215 are in the same RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), we performed a RIP assay. The level of UICLM and miR-215 was higher in the anti-Ago2 group than that in the anti-normal IgG group (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D). To confirm the effect of miR-215 on ZEB2 expression, SW620 and DLD-1 cells were transfected with miR-215 mimics, and the ZEB2 mRNA and protein levels were determined. The results showed that ectopic expression of miR-215 significantly decreased the ZEB2 mRNA and protein levels in CRC cells. A luciferase activity assay further demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-215 or knockdown of UICLM could significantly reduce the luciferase activity of wild-type but not mutant-type ZEB2 3'-UTR, and the reduction of luciferase activity caused by UICLM suppression could be restored by miR-215 inhibition (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E i-iii). Finally, we determined the expression of miR-215 in CRC patient tissues. Compared with tissues without metastasis, in tissues with metastasis, the miR-215 expression level was significantly down-regulated, and the miR-215 expression level showed a significant decrease with advancing clinical stage (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>F i-ii). Moreover, an inverse association between miR-215 and UICLM as well as ZEB2 was found (both <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>r</italic> = -0.53, and <italic>r</italic> = -0.72, respectively, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>F iii-iv).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The development of distant metastasis is a complex process involving the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Increasing evidence has indicated that lncRNAs play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. In this study, we identified a set of lncRNAs involved in the pathology of CRC liver metastasis, among these lncRNAs, UICLM was one of the most differentially expressed lncRNAs between CRCs with and without liver metastasis, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the biological process of CRC liver metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the role of lncRNAs in CRC liver metastasis.</p><p>Increasing studies have suggested that lncRNAs are active biological molecules rather than &#8220;transcriptional noise&#8221; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Given that UICLM was up-regulated in CRC with liver metastasis, we speculated that UICLM might affect the tumor phenotype of CRC. Our results showed that UICLM had a strong pro-malignant effect in CRC, with knockdown of UICLM inhibiting cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as tumor growth and liver metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. As EMT plays a key role in cell invasion and tumor metastasis <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, we explored whether the EMT pathway was involved in UICLM-mediated cell motility. Interestingly, knockdown of UICLM lead to increased expression of many epithelial genes and decreased expression of mesenchymal genes. More importantly, we found that UICLM could affect the stemness of CRC cells. Knockdown of UICLM decreased the percentage of SP cells, leading to a reduction of self-renewal and tumor formation. This is in accordance with previous studies that indicated cancer stem cells are a source of cancer metastasis and progression, and there existed a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. By suppressing UICLM in CRC cells and performing RNA sequencing, we identified a close association between UICLM and ZEB2, a well-defined gene involved in cell migration, invasion and EMT <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Knockdown of UICLM could reduce ZEB2 expression in CRC cells, whereas ectopic expression of UICLM enhanced ZEB2 expression. The pro-malignant effect stimulated by UICLM could be neutralized by ZEB2 suppression. These results demonstrated that UICLM modulated ZEB2 expression to regulate EMT and stem cell properties, finally affecting cell invasion and metastasis.</p><p>Next, we explored the mechanism by which UICLM regulates ZEB2. Recently, increasing evidence showed that a novel regulatory mechanism exists between lncRNAs and miRNAs. lncRNAs can act as endogenous molecular sponges to compete for miRNAs, thereby negatively regulating miRNA expression <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. For example, the lncRNA GAS5 can function as a ceRNA for miR-21 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>; the lncRNA H19 promotes glioma cell invasion by deriving miR-675 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>; and the lncRNA MEG3 functions as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-181s to regulate gastric cancer progression <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Using bioinformatics databases (Starbase v2.0, miRcode and RNAhybrid), we identified 7 miRNAs that may interact with UICLM. Among these miRNAs, miR-215 could bind to both UICLM and ZEB2. We confirmed the regulating relationship between UICLM and miR-215 based on the following: 1) knockdown of UICLM significantly increased miR-215 expression; 2) the direct binding ability of the predicted miR-215 binding site on UICLM was validated by luciferase activity assay; 3) Using RIP assays, we found that UICLM and miR-215 were in the same RISC; 4) an inverse correlation was found between the expression of UICLM and miR-215 in CRC tissues. In addition, we confirmed that miR-215 could directly target ZEB2 in CRC cells, which is in agreement with that in other tumor types <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Consistent with our results, miR-215 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types, such as pancreatic cancer <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, non-small cell lung cancer and colon cancer <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, these data strongly suggest that UICLM acts as a ceRNA for miR-215 to regulate ZEB2 expression in CRC cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings offer insight into lncRNA-miRNA-mediated CRC liver metastasis and suggest that UICLM might be used as a new biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with CRC liver metastasis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplementary figures and tables.</p></caption><media xlink:href="thnov07p4836s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81372570; No.81602053), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2014A030312015; No. 2016A030310195; No. 2017A030313640), and the fourth outstanding young talents training plan of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (No. PT04141001).</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term id="GL1">CRC</term><def><p>colorectal cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL2">lncRNA</term><def><p>long non-coding RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL3">UICLM</term><def><p>up-regulated in colorectal cancer liver metastasis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL4">IHC</term><def><p>immunohistochemistry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL5">RT-PCR</term><def><p>real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL6">ISH</term><def><p><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Torre</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferlay</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lortet-Tieulent</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><article-title>Global cancer statistics, 2012</article-title><source>CA Cancer J Clin</source><year>2015</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>87</fpage><lpage>108</lpage>
