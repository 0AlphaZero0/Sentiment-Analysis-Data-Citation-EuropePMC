This multicenter, open-label phase 2 study evaluated buparlisib (BKM120), a pan-class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Three separate cohorts of patients (with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma) received buparlisib 100 mg once daily until progression, intolerance, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was overall response rate based on a 6-month best overall response by cohort; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, safety, and tolerability. Overall, 72 patients (26 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 22 with mantle cell lymphoma, and 24 with follicular lymphoma) were treated. The overall response rates were 11.5%, 22.7%, and 25.0% in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, respectively; two patients (one each with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma) achieved a complete response. The most frequently reported (&gt;20%) adverse events of any grade in the population in which safety was studied were hyperglycemia, fatigue, and nausea (36.1% each), depression (29.2%), diarrhea (27.8%), and anxiety (25.0%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events included hyperglycemia (11.1%) and neutropenia (5.6%). Buparlisib showed activity in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with disease stabilization and sustained tumor burden reduction in some patients, and acceptable toxicity. Development of mechanism-based combination regimens with buparlisib is warranted.

Further investigation, including a broader evaluation of PI3K activation markers or multivariate analyses of baseline characteristics, would be needed to identify subpopulations of patients who might respond to buparlisib.</p><p>Preclinical models suggest that all PI3K isoforms (PI3K&#945;, PI3Kb, and PI3Kd) are expressed in leukocytes,<sup><xref rid="b38-1022104" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> but that their relative levels of expression vary in NHL according to disease stage.<sup><xref rid="b23-1022104" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Specific PI3K isoform ratios are associated with relapse and have been implicated in resistance to PI3Kd inhibitors, but not PI3K&#945;/PI3Kd inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="b23-1022104" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Previous studies on PI3K inhibitors that specifically target one or two PI3K isoforms have met with some success in indolent NHL (overall response rate of 65% with duvelisib),<sup><xref rid="b39-1022104" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> in FL and in MCL (overall response rates of 45% and 40%, respectively, with idelalisib),<sup><xref rid="b40-1022104" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-1022104" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> but not in DLBCL (overall response rate of 0% with rigosertib).<sup><xref rid="b42-1022104" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> However, improved long-term outcomes (e.g., progression-free survival) with these agents have been limited in patients with relapsed or refractory disease; for example, the median progression-free survival of patients treated with idelalisib was 3.7 months among those with MCL and 7.6 to 11 months for patients with indolent NHL (the majority, 58% &#8211; 59%, with FL).<sup><xref rid="b20-1022104" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b40-1022104" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-1022104" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Pan-PI3K inhibition results in similar or higher overall response rates (&#8804;25% in DLBCL, 83% in MCL, and 20% - 50% in FL),<sup><xref rid="b43-1022104" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b45-1022104" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> with potentially longer progression-free survival. For example, in a study of the pan-PI3K inhibitor SAR245409, the overall response rate was 50% and the median progression-free survival was not reached after 8 months of follow-up in patients with relapsed or refractory FL.<sup><xref rid="b45-1022104" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> In our study, patients with FL on treatment with buparlisib had an overall response rate of 25.0% and a median progression-free survival of 9.8 months. Thus, it appears that sustained inhibition of all PI3K isoforms has some effect on achieving response, but may have a more pronounced benefit on long-term outcomes for patients with FL and MCL. In general, PI3K inhibitors have a manageable safety profile in NHL;<sup><xref rid="b46-1022104" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b48-1022104" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> however, the European Medicines Agency has recently opened a review of idelalisib due to new safety concerns over serious adverse events (mostly infections) in ongoing clinical trials.</p><p>Buparlisib was generally well tolerated. Hyperglycemia, although frequently reported, is a known on-target effect of PI3K&#945; inhibitors<sup><xref rid="b9-1022104" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and, as in other buparlisib studies,<sup><xref rid="b30-1022104" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> was manageable with standard antidiabetic therapy. Mood disorders have been previously reported in studies of buparlisib<sup><xref rid="b49-1022104" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> owing, in part, to the ability of this drug to cross the blood-brain barrier.<sup><xref rid="b50-1022104" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> For this reason, in this study, patients with active psychiatric disorders at screening were excluded, and the patients enrolled were prospectively followed with self-assessment questionnaires (i.e., GAD-7 and PHQ-9). As in previous studies, some patients with NHL experienced mood disorders that were not serious and were manageable with dose reduction/interruption or treatment with appropriate concomitant medication. In addition, patients developing any of these adverse events were referred for psychiatric consultation. Loss of appetite and weight (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S3</italic>) in patients may compromise quality of life, as reported in some previous studies.<sup><xref rid="b51-1022104" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Most treatment-related adverse events with buparlisib were grade 1/2 and could be managed with dose reduction or interruption until resolution of toxicity. The rates of grade 3/4 elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, pneumonia, and diarrhea were lower with buparlisib than with a selective PI3Kd inhibitor in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.<sup><xref rid="b20-1022104" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Although the overall response rate with buparlisib was not substantial, the observed progression-free survival in this study warrants further evaluation of this agent in hematologic cancers. Combination of buparlisib with other treatments (i.e., targeted therapies, monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, or standard chemotherapies) should be considered, particularly for patients with FL and MCL.</p></sec>
