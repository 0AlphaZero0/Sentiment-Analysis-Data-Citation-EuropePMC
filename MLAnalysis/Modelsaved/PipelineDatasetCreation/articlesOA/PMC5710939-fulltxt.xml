ultraviolet-induced melanogenesis. Because excessive melanin accumulation in the skin can induce hyperpigmentation, the development of tyrosinase inhibitors has attracted attention in cosmetic-related fields. However, side effects including toxicity and low selectivity have limited the use of many tyrosinase inhibitors in cosmetics. We synthesized 12 novel 2-(substituted benzylidene)malononitrile derivatives and investigated their anti-melanogenic activities. Of these 12 compounds, 2-(3, 4-dihydroxy benzylidene)malononitrile (BMN11) exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against tyrosinase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 17.05 &#956;M). In parallel with this, BMN11 treatment notably decreased alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced melanin accumulation in B16F10, cells without toxicity and also decreased melanin accumulation in a human skin model. As a mechanism underlying the BMN11-mediated anti-melanogenic effect, docking simulation showed that BMN11 can directly bind to tyrosinase by forming two hydrogen bonds with GLY281 and ASN260 residues, and via three hydrophobic interactions with VAL283, PHE264, and ALA286 residues in the tyrosinase binding pocket, and this likely contributes to its inhibitory effect on tyrosinase. Consistently, Lineweaver-Burk and Cornish-Bowden plots showed that BMN11 is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase. We concluded that BMN11 may be a novel tyrosinase inhibitor that could be used in cosmetics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>melanogenesis</kwd><kwd>tyrosinase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>pigmentation</kwd><kwd>photoaging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Melanin is produced in melanocytes located in the basal layer of the epidermis of skin, and is a major determinant of skin color. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a well-known stimulator of melanin synthesis in epidermal melanocytes. The synthesized melanin is transferred to keratinocytes by melanocyte dendrites. Melanin accumulation in keratinocytes can make skin darker [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although melanin pigmentation in the skin is a protective mechanism against UV radiation, excessive accumulation of melanin induces hyperpigmentation and even pigmentation disorders such as melasma, freckles, and senile lentigines [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to develop whitening compounds to reduce melanogenesis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Tyrosinase is a multifunctional type-3 copper-containing enzyme. The copper-containing sites are important for tyrosinase activity [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This enzyme mainly uses L-tyrosine as a substrate and catalyzes two rate-limiting steps in melanogenesis: the monophenolase hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (<italic>L-DOPA</italic>), and the oxidation of <italic>L-DOPA</italic> to DOPA quinine [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, inhibiting tyrosinase can be an efficient strategy to reduce melanogenesis, thereby inhibiting hyperpigmentation. However, not many tyrosinase inhibitors are currently available in the field of cosmetics and medical products because of their cytotoxicity and lack of selectivity and stability [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, kojic acid was developed as a strong tyrosinase inhibitor and used as an anti-melanogenic compound in cosmetics, but its use was prohibited because of cytotoxicity. In addition, certain benzaldehyde and benzoate derivatives isolated from plants were identified as tyrosinase inhibitors, including anisaldehyde, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, benzaldehyde, anisic acid, and methoxycinnamic acid isolated from the roots of <italic>Pulsatilla cernua</italic> [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde from the roots of <italic>Mondia whitei</italic> [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], vanillic acid and its derivatives from black rice bran [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid from the leaves of <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, advanced data are lacking for their applications as anti-melanogenic agents. Thus, additional studies are necessary to find more efficient tyrosinase inhibitors with no cytotoxicity and improved selectivity and stability. In an attempt to find a novel tyrosinase inhibitor, we synthesized 12 2-(substituted benzylidene)malononitrile derivatives. Previous studies revealed that 2-(substituted benzylidene)malononitrile analogs exhibited pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], anti-proliferative [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and &#946;&#8211;cell protective effects [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we examined their tyrosinase inhibitory activity using docking simulation, and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using B16F10 cells and a human skin model.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Because tyrosinase regulates the rate-limiting steps of melanogenesis, suppressing this enzyme has been shown to inhibit skin pigmentation [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

We used kojic acid as a positive control. Kojic acid has been shown to chelate copper at the active site of tyrosinase and suppress its activity [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To compare the direct tyrosinase inhibitory activity of BMNs with that of kojic acid, we performed a mushroom tyrosinase activity assay in test tubes. The data showed that of the 12 compounds tested, only 2-(3, 4-dihydroxybenzylidene)malononitrile (BMN11) exhibited tyrosinase inhibitory activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We further examined the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of BMN11 on tyrosinase, and calculated its IC<sub>50</sub> values (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Of these, BMN11 exhibited the strongest tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Consistent with this, BMN11 markedly inhibited &#945;MSH-induced melanogenesis without cytotoxicity in B16F10 cells and suppressed melanin accumulation in the human skin model. Although more studies are necessary to reveal the mechanism underlying BMN11-mediated inhibition of tyrosinase, it appears that instead of binding to tyrosine, BMN11 may bind directly to tyrosinase by forming two hydrogen bonds with the GLY281 and ASN260 residues of tyrosinase, and via three hydrophobic interactions with the VAL283, PHE264, and ALA286 residues of tyrosinase, which partially explains the stronger inhibitory activity of BMN11 against tyrosinase than that of kojic acid.</p><p>Based on the results of our preliminary experiments (unpublished data) and those of another study [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], many 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl compounds were reported to exhibit weak tyrosinase inhibitory activity. However, the inhibitory activities of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl compounds can be increased based on the chemical structure attached to the 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl moiety. As an example, our previous study showed that MHY-794 ((&#177;)-4-(thiazolidin-2-yl)benzene-1, 2-diol), a 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl compound, exhibited excellent tyrosinase inhibitory activity in mushroom tyrosinase and cell-based tyrosinase assays [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More studies are necessary to reveal how certain chemical structures attached to the 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl moiety are able to regulate tyrosinase activity.</p><p>When the docking scores are compared, the predicted binding affinities of BMN5 (-30.13 kcal/mol), BMN7 (-30.37 kcal/mol), and BMN9 (-30.84 kcal/mol) are comparable to that of BMN11 (-30.45). However, BMN5, BMN7, and BMN9 do not inhibit tyrosinase activity. Although it is hard to explain the discrepancy based on our data, it is likely that other BMNs may not easily locate the binding pocket of tyrosinase in the experiment using mushroom tyrosinase unlike the results from the protein-ligand docking simulation, in which the site of the binding pocket are artificially designated. Also, it is unclear how BMN11 of many similar compounds exhibites the strongest inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. According to our accumulated structure-activity relationship (SAR) data (unpublished), the 2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl moiety has played a very important role in showing potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity in many cases. Thus, the synthesis of BMN analog with a 2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl moiety was attempted using the same reaction conditions (a catalytic amount of NaOH, EtOH/water(1:4), 55 &#176;C) used for the synthesis of BMN1 &#8211; BMN12, but the desired product was not obtained. Our accumulated SAR data also indicate a tendency to decrease tyrosinase inhibitory activity in the following order: 2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl &gt; 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl &gt; 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl = 4-hydroxyphenyl = 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl &gt;&gt; other phenyls. However, the tendency is not strict and relies on the structure of the remaining residues of the compound. As expected, BMN11 having a 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl substituent exerted strong tyrosinase inhibition, but compounds with 4-hydroxyphenyl (BMN1), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl (BMN2) and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl (BMN3) substituents showed only moderate to weak tyrosinase inhibition. Similarly, in our SAR data, only one or two compounds with the above-mentioned substituents in the phenyl substituted compounds exhibit strong inhibitory activity against tyrosinase, while the remaining compounds with the indicated substituents show only moderate or weak inhibition. Our SAR data also reveal that the presence of at least one hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring is essential for strong tyrosinase inhibition.</p><p>Although our study shows that BMN11 is a tyrosinase inhibitor to prevent skin pigmentation, it is not tested whether BMN11 is actually absorbed through keratinocytes to exhibit the anti-melanogenic effect. Previously, we reported that two synthetic diphenols, 3-DBP [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and MHY-794 [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], exhibited anti-melanogenic effects <italic>in vivo</italic> through tyrosinase inhibition. The inhibitory effect of melanin formation <italic>in vivo</italic> implied that these diphenol compounds are absorbed through keratinocytes. The log P values for 3-DBP and MHY-794 calculated using the ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 program were 0.12 and 1.59, respectively. Therefore, it is expected that the diphenol compound having log P = 1 or more is absorbed sufficiently through keratinocytes. The calculated log P value of BMN11 by the program was 1.53, so that BMN11 is expected to be absorbed through keratinocytes. In addition, the anti-melanogenic effect of BMN11 on the human skin model indirectly shows that BMN11 can be absorbed through keratinocytes.</p><p>Unfavorable side effects are major concerns in many synthetic inhibitors against tyrosinase. Although our study did not provide conclusive evidence about safety of BMN11 for its application to human skin, BMN11 did not show cytotoxicity in cell lines of HaCat (human keratinocyte), B16F10 (mouse melanoma), Hs27 (human fibroblast) in our experimental conditions. Furthermore, when BMN11 was treated to the human skin model with the concentrations that did not show cytotoxicity in the cell lines, there were no visible signs of toxicity such as cell detachment or cell debris formation based on microscopic observation. However, there are few studies available that examine toxicity of 2-(Substituted benzylidene)malononitrile derivatives for its application to human skin, further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are necessary to test its safety in physiology.</p><p>In conclusion, our study proved in cell and human skin models that BMN11 is the strongest tyrosinase inhibitor of the 12 2-(substituted benzylidene) malononitrile derivatives tested and can be used as an anti-melanogenic compound in cosmetics that aim to have whitening effects on skin.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Synthesis of compounds</title><sec id="s4_1_1"><title>General synthetic method for BMN1 &#8211; BMN12</title><p>Synthesis of BMN1 &#8211; BMN11: NaOH (5 mg, 0.13 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of malononitrile (145 mg, 2.19 mmol) and an appropriate substituted benzaldehyde (0.91 equivalent) in ethanol (5 mL) and water (20 mL).
