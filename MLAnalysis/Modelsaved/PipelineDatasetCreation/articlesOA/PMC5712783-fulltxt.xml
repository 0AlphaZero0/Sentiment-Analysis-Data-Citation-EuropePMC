the identification of hub proteins. In the present study, the PPI network of 79 Mtb toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems comprising of 167 nodes
and 234 edges was investigated. The topological properties of PPI network were examined by 'Network analyzer' a cytoscape plugin
app and STRING database. The key enriched biological processes and the molecular functions of Mtb TA systems were analyzed by
STRING. Manual curation of the PPI data identified four proteins (i.e. Rv2762c, VapB14, VapB42 and VapC42) to possess the highest
number of interacting partners. The top 15% hub proteins were identified in the PPI network by employing two statistical measures, i.e.
betweenness and radiality by employing cytohubba. Insights gained from the molecular protein models of VapC9 and VapC10 are also
documented.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Toxin-antitoxin</kwd><kwd>STRING</kwd><kwd>Cytoscape</kwd><kwd>Homology Modeling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to persist inside the
host cells under a variety of adverse conditions including
oxidative stress, nutrient starvation and hypoxia helps to
understand pathogenesis [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mtb toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems
comprising of two component genetic modules - a stable toxin
and relatively unstable antitoxin, play a significant role for the
survival of bacteria under stress conditions. Mtb harbors a high
number of TA systems (79) belonging to various families such as
VapBC, MazEF, ParDE, higBA, RelBE, and several
uncharacterized TA systems [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These TA systems are associated
with antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and persistence
inside the host cells [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In response to stress conditions, the labile
antitoxin is degraded and toxin is released, which in turn halts
transcription, translation etc. and that leads to growth inhibition
and even cell death [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is imperative to many cellular
process including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation,
post-translational modification, etc. [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PPI network analysis is a
robust approach to understand the mechanisms associated with
mycobacterial pathogenesis, functional annotation of genes, etc.
[<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] PPIs can be detected by computational and experimental
methods. Experimental methods include yeast two-hybrid
system, tandem affinity purification and protein microarrays,
whereas computational methods include interlog-based method
and prediction based on genetic algorithms. In comparison to
experimental techniques, computational methods take less time
and are inexpensive [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the present study, we report the
topological and functional enrichment analysis of PPI network of
79 Mtb TA systems constructed from STRING v10.5 and
Cytoscape v3.5.0. The molecular models of VapC9 and VapC10
have also been documented to gain functional insights.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Literature mining of Mtb TA system genes</title><p>A total of 79 Mtb H37Rv TA system genes enlisted in Suppl Table

PPIs that possessed at least a medium confidence

was extracted from STRING v 10.5. To completely explore the PPI
data, the search was set to include all the source parameters. The
mined PPI data was comprised of total 468 PPI's as depicted in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Manual curation of the PPI data revealed that 63
proteins out of 468 PPIs possessed &#8805;4 interacting partners in the
network (Suppl Table 2), whereas 64 proteins were associated
with only one interacting partner. Two groups of proteins,
comprising of 20 and 15 proteins were highly connected with
each member having five and six interacting partners,
respectively. Notably, two members of VapBC family, i.e.
antitoxin VapB45 and antitoxin VapB14 were found to possess 8
interacting partners each. Interestingly, both the toxin and
antitoxin of VapBC42 were highly connected with each
possessing 9 interacting partners. Strikingly, antidote HigA1
possessed the highest number (10) of interacting partners. For 17
proteins, no PPI information could be extracted from STRING.
PPI information extracted from STRING v10.5 ranged from
medium to highest confidence scores. In fact, 84 (~18%) of the
protein-protein associations fell within highest confidence
interval (CI, S &gt; 0.9), 176 (37.6%) within high CI (0.7 &#8804; S &lt; 0.9),
and 208 (44.44%) within medium CI (0.4 &#8804; S &lt; 0.7).</p><p>In addition, topological and functional enrichment analysis of
input Mtb TA systems was carried out by STRING and 'network
analyzer' a cytoscape plugin. Network statistics obtained by
STRING database revealed that the extracted interactome was
comprised of 167 nodes and 234 edges. The average node degree
and average local clustering coefficient of the network was
determined to be 2.8 and 0.628, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). On the
other hand, 'network analyzer' a cytoscape plugin estimated
several other topological parameters such as network diameter,
network radius, shortest path, characteristic path length and
average number of neighbors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). GO biological process
and molecular function enrichment analysis of input seed
sequences was carried out by STRING v10.5. The majority of Mtb
TA system proteins were significantly enriched in biological
processes associated with regulation of growth (1.46E-77), nucleic
acid phosphodiester bond hydrolysis (1.08E-61), RNA
phosphodiester bond hydrolysis (3.73E-60) and negative
regulation of growth (2.65e-45, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, molecular
functions of such proteins were primarily related with nuclease
activity (6.27e-62), ribonuclease activity (7.72e-61), and metal ion
binding (7.36e-12, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Similar to gene enrichment analysis of
this study, activation of TA systems leading to growth arrest by
the toxin partners of VapBC, RelBE, MazEF, and HigBA families
has also been reported [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Hub proteins of PPI network represent highly connected nodes
with special biological properties and are more evolutionary
conserved than non-hubs. In fact, removal of such hubs can lead
to network disruption and thus are considered as attractive drug 
targets [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Identification of hub proteins can be carried out
by in silico tools such as Hubba, cytohubba, and CHAT etc. [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present study, cytohubba was used to explore the hub
proteins of Mtb TA systems PPI network. The top 15% hub
proteins were identified on the basis of radiality and betweenness
algorithms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). HigA1 and VapB45 antitoxins were
determined to be the top scorer hub proteins by betweenness and
radiality method, respectively. Antitoxin HigA1 (Rv1956)
belonging to HigBA family has been reported among the 10 top
most upregulated Mtb TA systems of drug tolerant persisters [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].
On the other hand, VapB45 (Rv2018) is the antitoxin partner of
VapC45, but no experimental data is available to elucidate their
role in Mtb pathogenesis. In addition, we mined the hub proteins
that were commonly identified by both the algorithms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).
Notably, majority of the hub proteins identified belonged to the
VapBC family apart from the members of HigBA and RelBE
families. VapBC is the largest family of Mtb TA systems
characterized by the presence of PIN domain and functions
mostly as ribonucleases [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly, Rv2762, which was
not part of input seed proteins, was also detected as a top ranker
hub protein.</p><p>Antitoxins are reported to be small proteins with less order in
their structure. Therefore, it is difficult to find druggable pockets
on their surface that can accommodate small-molecule inhibitors,
whereas toxins are more stable and ordered in their structure,
and are also considered as attractive targets for drug-design [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
Therefore, we focused to elucidate the structural insight of toxins
identified by in silico analysis. It was found that 5 out of 10 top
ranking hub proteins were antitoxins, i.e. higA1, VapB45,
VapB14, VapB11 and RelB, whereas three proteins were toxins,
i.e. VapC1, VapC9 and VapC10. Since the structure of VapBC1 is
available at PDB, we focused to determine the structural insights
of VapC9 and VapC10 proteins. Domain identification tools used
in the study, i.e NCBI CDD, Pfam and InterProscan revealed the
presence of PIN domain in both VapC9 and VapC10. In fact, PIN
domains are small protein domains of ~130 amino acids, which
are characterized by the presence of three invariant amino acid
residues and fourth lesser-conserved acidic residue [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
Physicochemical properties were computed by protparam tool of
ExPASy for VapC9 and VapC10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). Protein BLAST was
carried out against PDB database to identify homologs with
resolved 3D structure for structure prediction of VapC9 and
VapC10. The crystal structure of PAE0151 from Pyrobaculum
aerophilum (2FE1) was selected as the best suitable template on
the basis of maximum query coverage (100%) and maximum
identity (79%) for input VapC9 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In a
similar manner, crystal Structure of Fitacb from Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (2H1C) was chosen as the best template structure for
the development of homology model of VapC10 based on
maximum sequence coverage (81%) and maximum sequence
identity (32%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Five theoretical models generated for
each protein by Modeler v9.17 were assessed on the basis of 
DOPE score and GA341 score. The model with highest GA341
score and lowest DOPE score was selected and was further
subjected to energy minimization by Chimera v1.11.2.</p><p>Theoretical models of VapC9 and VapC10 were subjected to
various structural validation servers to assess the correctness of
the models. Ramachandran plot obtained for VapC9 by
PROCHECK of swiss model server revealed that 93 % of amino
acid residues were present in most favored regions, 6.1% in
additionally allowed regions and 0. 9 % in generously allowed
regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). On the other hand, Ramachandran plot for
VapC10 showed that 84.5 % residues were present in the most
favored region, 12.9 % in additionally allowed region and 2.6 %
in generously allowed region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). Notably, for both the
generated models, none of the amino acid residues was observed
in the disallowed region. Overall G-factor score computed for
VapC9 and VapC10 by swiss model server fell in the acceptable
cut-off range. In addition, Z-score, Q-mean score and D-fire score
were also estimated by swiss model server, which further
confirmed the reliability of the models generated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). The
overall quality factor score obtained after ERRAT analysis was
97.3 % for VapC9 and 93.5 % for VapC10. Prosa web Z score for
VapC9 and VapC10 was -4.07 and -3.64 respectively, thereby
suggesting that the structures are of good quality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>).
Predicted resolution by resprox along with LG and Maxsub score
determined by ProQ also indicated the reliability of 3D models.
In addition, MOLPROBITY revealed that none of the residue
possessed bad bonds or &#946; deviations &gt; 0.25A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). The 3D
models generated in the study were of reliable quality as assessed
by various structural assessment reports such as PROCHECK of
swiss model server, ERRAT, ProSA-web, ProQ, MOLPROBITY
and ResProx. In addition, active site of VapC9 and VapC10 was
identified by Metapocket v2.0. The generated homology models
and active site determined by metapocket v2.0 of VapC9 and
VapC10, respectively are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The
developed models can be used for structure based drug
designing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We reported the construction and extensive analysis of PPI
