Since oxaliplatin is associated with cumulative, dose-dependent toxicity, it is highly relevant to determine whether the duration of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX or CAPOX) can be shortened without losing clinical efficacy.</p><p>The IDEA (International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy) collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] pooled data from six phase&#160;III trials conducted in 12&#160;countries and included more than 12,000 patients (see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These trials investigated the non-inferiority of 3 versus 6&#160;months of adjuvant treatment with the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>IDEA trials</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p><p>Patient characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms.</p><p>The estimated 3&#8209;year DFS in patients receiving 3&#160;months of adjuvant chemotherapy (74.6%) was lower than that in patients receiving 6&#160;months of adjuvant chemotherapy (75.5%) by 0.9% (HR 1.07, 95% CI [1.00, 1.15]). Since the upper limit of the CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.12 for the DFS hazard ratio, non-inferiority was not established.</p><p>Despite this formally negative trial, preplanned subgroup analyses have possibly led to practice changing results:</p><p>Patients with lower risk disease defined as T1&#8211;3 N1 represented roughly 60% of patients. In this subgroup, non-inferiority of 3&#160;months therapy could be established when compared to 6&#160;months therapy with a&#160;DFS HR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.90&#8211;1.12).</p><p>However, this was not the case for patients with higher risk disease defined as T4 or N2 (DFS HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03&#8211;1.23), favoring 6&#160;months over 3&#160;months of adjuvant therapy.</p><p>In a&#160;not prespecified combined DFS comparison by risk group and regimen, true non-inferiority in lower risk patients was only found for CAPOX (DFS HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71&#8211;1.01), but not for FOLFOX (DFS HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.96&#8211;1.26).</p><p>The investigators hypothesized that possible reasons for a&#160;superiority in CAPOX over FOLFOX may either lie in the higher oxaliplatin dose received in the first 4&#160;weeks of treatment (CAPOX 260&#8201;mg/m<sup>2</sup>; FOLFOX 170&#8201;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or in the more continuous exposure to capecitabine in the CAPOX regimen when compared to 5&#8209;FU in the FOLFOX regimen.</p><p>The goal of lowering burdensome neurotoxicity by shortening treatment duration was achieved: patients receiving 3&#160;months of treatment had significantly lower rates of grade &#8805;2 neurotoxicity (3&#160;months vs 6&#160;months: 17% vs 48% [FOLFOX] and 15% vs 45% [CAPOX]; <italic>P</italic>&#160;= 0.0001). Presumably as a&#160;consequence thereof, compliance was worse in the 6&#8209;month arm than in the 3&#8209;month arm, irrespective of the regimen used (3&#160;months vs 6&#160;months: 90% vs. 71% [FOLFOX]; 3&#160;months vs 6&#160;months: 86% vs 65% [CAPOX]).</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Take home message</title><p>Based on these results of the IDEA trials, the authors recommend a&#160;risk-adapted approach to selecting adjuvant chemotherapy duration for stage&#160;III colon cancer:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>T1&#8211;3, N1: 3&#160;months of CAPOX or FOLFOX</p></list-item><list-item><p>T4 or N2: 6&#160;months of FOLFOX</p></list-item></list>

Indeed, similar rates of complete responses were seen in the PD-L1 positive (2.0%) and the PD-L1 negative cohort (2.8%). However, a&#160;certain decline in ORR could be observed with an increasing number of previous lines of therapy (3&#160;lines: 16.4%; 4&#160;lines: 6.4%).
