Here, we report a miRNA-based autocrine regulatory pathway that controls differentiation of preadipocytes into beige adipocytes. We identify miR-327 as one of the most downregulated miRNAs targeting growth factors in the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) under conditions that promote white adipose tissue (WAT) browning in mice. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments reveal that miR-327 targets FGF10 to prevent beige adipocyte differentiation. Pharmacological and physiological &#946;-adrenergic stimulation upregulates FGF10 levels and promotes preadipocyte differentiation into beige adipocytes. In vivo local delivery of miR-327 to WATs significantly compromises the beige phenotype and thermogenesis. Contrarily, systemic inhibition of miR-327 in mice induces browning and increases whole-body metabolic rate under thermoneutral conditions. Our data provide mechanistic insight into an autocrine regulatory signaling loop that regulates beige adipocyte formation and suggests that the miR-327&#8211;FGF10&#8211;FGFR2 signaling axis may be a therapeutic targets for treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">White adipocytes can be stimulated to express thermogenic genes in a process known as beiging.

Cold exposure, &#946;3-adrenoceptor agonists, diet, drugs, and many other stimuli are able to activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) and to induce WAT browning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Depending on their anatomical location, different WAT depots possess intrinsic properties that define their ability to remain white or become beige adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In response to mild cold exposure, rodent subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) manifests a &#8220;brown-like&#8221; phenotype, whereas visceral WAT (visWAT), a genuine WAT, is resistant to browning at similar temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. WAT browning-triggered thermogenesis may play an important role to increase whole-body energy expenditure and results in reduced fat mass, increased insulin sensitivity and improved blood lipid profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, the importance of WAT browning physiology remains a controversial issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In the adipose tissue microenvironment (AME), non-adipocytes including vascular cells, inflammatory cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells play crucial roles in modulation of adipocyte metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For example, endothelial cells, perivascular cells in the vessel wall and mesenchymal stromal cells have potentials to differentiate into adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We recently demonstrated that endothelial cells produce paracrine factors to modulate adipocyte functions and thereby play a determinant role in controlling preadipocyte differentiation and adipocyte browning through a paracrine regulatory mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, complex interactions between different cell types in the AME collectively control adipocyte function and metabolic activity. Soluble factors that mediate cellular interactions between various cell types remain a challenging issue although adipocyte-derived factors and cytokines are relatively well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, molecular regulation of growth factor production under various physiological and pathological conditions is still unknown.</p><p id="Par5">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. They often act as repressors of protein production by controlling the mRNA levels and inhibiting translation of their targets within a cell. Most miRNA studies in adipose tissues are aimed to study miRNA expression profiles in lean and obese WAT of animals and humans, and some miRNAs show strong correlations with obesity, insulin resistance and T2DM. Additionally, many studies show that numerous genes are differentially expressed in scWAT and visWAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, miRNAs and their targets regulating WAT browning are largely unknown. In particular, targeting miRNAs in non-adipocytes during WAT browning is a novel approach.</p><p id="Par6">Fibroblast growth factors encompass probably the largest growth factor family among all known growth factor families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the human FGF family, there are 22 structurally and functionally related members that display a broad range of biological functions including embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, stem cell differentiation, and endocrine regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. FGFs bind to four FGF receptors (FGFRs) to initiate signaling events that mediate these biological functions in target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. FGFR1 and FGFR2 appear to be the most commonly distributed growth factor receptors and they mediate most biological functions of the FGF family. FGF10 is a secreted protein and genetic deletion of&#160;the <italic>Fgf10</italic> gene in mice results in impaired lung development and absence of limb bud formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the development of abdominal scWAT is markedly impaired in FGF10-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Tissue distribution studies showed that the adipose tissue expresses the most abundant <italic>Fgf10</italic> transcript among all adult tissues. Moreover, FGF10 expression is particularly enriched in the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT where adipocyte progenitors reside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we identify miR-327 as a key regulator that controls preadipocyte differentiation toward beige adipocytes. We show that cold exposure and &#946;3-adrenoceptor activation markedly downregulate miR-327 expression in the browning WAT-SVF. Moreover, FGF10, as a direct target of miR-327, is increased in these settings and controls preadipocyte to beige adipocyte differentiation. In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments validate the key function of miR-327 in adipocyte differentiation and WAT browning. Our data identify a regulatory pathway in non-adipocytes of the SVF consisting of miR-327, FGF10, and FGFR2 that controls beige adipocyte differentiation through an autocrine mechanism. Modulation of this signaling pathway may provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of obesity and T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cold exposure and &#946;3-adrenoceptor agonist induced WAT browning</title><p id="Par8">We aimed to define signaling molecules in SVF cells that control adipocyte differentiation. To achieve this goal, we chose a mouse WAT browning model for the following reasons: (1) During browning of WAT, there is a significant expansion of the vascular component; (2) differentiation of preadipocyte to beige adipocyte is one of the key processes of adipocyte browning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; (3) thermogenesis can be accurately measured; and (4) the effect of therapeutic interventions can be easily assessed. We took two approaches to induce a beige phenotype in WATs. First, a &#946;3-adrenoceptor agonist CL-316243 (CL) was systemically administrated to adult C57BL/6 mice. After CL-treatment for 5 days, scWAT and visWAT exhibited distinct phenotypes of smaller adipocytes with dense intracellular contents (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, c</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CL-treated mitochondria had enriched COX4<sup>+</sup> staining in scWAT and visWAT, indicating an increased number of mitochondria in these white adipose depots (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, d</xref>). Moreover, CL-treated WATs showed increased levels of UCP1, the key thermogenic protein, with a more pronounced expression in scWAT compared to visWAT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, e</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CL and low temperature lead to WAT browning, angiogenesis, and an increased number of myofibroblast-like cells. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Histological analysis of adipocyte morphology (H&amp;E), adipocytes (PERI), mitochondria (COX4), uncoupling protein 1&#160;(UCP1), blood vessels (CD31), and myofibroblast-like cells (&#945;SMA) in <bold>a</bold> 5-day CL-316243-treated scWAT and visWAT compared to vehicle-treated control. <bold>b</bold> Two-week 4&#8201;&#176;C-treated scWAT and visWAT compared to 30&#8201;&#176;C control.

</p><p id="Par9">To define the SVF components, endothelial cell-specific marker CD31 and the perivascular stromal fibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;SMA) were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Along with the WAT browning, markedly augmented angiogenesis concomitantly occurred in CL-treated scWAT and visWAT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, f</xref>). Under CL treatment, both scWAT and visWAT showed increased &#945;SMA signals especially around the arterioles (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, g</xref>). Like CL treatment, exposure of mice to cold temperature exacerbated a browning phenotype of scWAT, demonstrating smaller adipocytes, high mitochondrial COX4 content, high level of UCP1, angiogenesis, and robust expression of &#945;SMA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, h&#8211;l</xref>). However, cold-induced increases of mitochondria and UCP1 were significantly less pronounced in visWAT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, i, j</xref>). These findings are consistent with the general view that scWAT undergoes a beige transition under cold exposure whereas visWAT is rather resistant to cold-induced browning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>miR-327 is downregulated under &#946;3-adrenonegic stimulation and targets <italic>Fgf10</italic></title><p id="Par10">To define miRNAs and their targeted signaling molecules in the SVF during early browning, we performed a genome-wide miRNA profiling analysis. CL treatment induced alterations in expression levels of a range of miRNAs in the WAT-SVF (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We focused on downregulated miRNAs because, we were interested to identify upregulated targeted signaling molecules that might mediate an SVF-adipocyte crosstalk. Among significantly downregulated miRNAs, miR-327 was a novel and stably downregulated miRNA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). miR-327 was markedly downregulated in CL-treated SVFs isolated from scWAT and visWAT as quantitatively analyzed by qPCR analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). A nearly 10-fold decrease of miR-327 was observed in CL-treated SVFs isolated from scWAT and visWAT relative to their vehicle-treated controls. At day 7 after CL&#160;treatment, miR-327 remained unchanged at a very low level similar to day 1 of treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). By contrast, no decrease of miR-327 was found in the SVFs derived from iBAT isolated from CL-treated mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), suggesting that the pattern of miR-327 downregulation was restricted to SVFs derived from WAT. Like CL treatment, cold exposure also markedly decreased miR-327 expression levels in SVFs isolated from scWAT and visWAT, but not from iBAT (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identification of miR-327 and FGF10 as SVF-derived modulators of early browning. <bold>a</bold> Heatmap of significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) up- and downregulated miRNAs from 3-day CL-316243-treated visWAT-SVFs compared to vehicle-treated controls (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;5 mice per sample; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2 samples per group). <bold>b</bold> Heatmap of significantly downregulated growth factor (GF)-targeting miRNAs extracted from <bold>a</bold>. <bold>c</bold>&#8211;<bold>f</bold> qPCR analysis of miR-327 in <bold>c</bold>,<bold> d</bold> 3-day CL-316243-treated SVFs or <bold>e</bold>,<bold> f</bold> 1-week 4&#8201;&#176;C-treated SVFs of scWAT, visWAT, and iBAT compared to respective controls.

Recent work from our laboratory and others supports the notion that preadipocyte differentiation is a key process for gaining beige cells in browning WAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Preadipocytes reside within the non-adipocyte fraction, suggesting that non-adipocytes, especially the SVF-derived cells, may play a crucial role in modulating the browning process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In support of this view, our recent work shows that blocking SVF-preadipocyte differentiation markedly attenuates cold- and CL-induced WAT browning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, molecular players, signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of SVF-derived cells to beige adipocyte are still under investigation. Knowing that the SVF plays a central role in controlling WAT browning, we focus our present work on gaining in-depth mechanistic insights into regulatory and signaling molecules in the non-adipose fractions. Our findings suggest that the initial trigger of WAT browning might be located in the non-adipocyte compartment that supplies both preadipocytes for subsequent differentiation and signaling molecules that control beige adipocyte differentiation. However, interconversion of mature adipocytes from the WAT to beige phenotype has been proposed as another mechanism of browning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Although it is unclear if differentiation or interconversion is the dominant process under different experimental settings, both possibilities clearly co-exist under physiological conditions.</p><p id="Par40">In this study, we show that cold exposure and CL treatment markedly increase the number of &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> cells that are densely distributed throughout the browning adipose tissue. Although the origin of these cells warrants further investigation, they are likely to come from two possible sources. One possibility would be a redistribution of vessel-associated &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> smooth muscle cells under browning conditions. Independent studies from other laboratories also support the fact that perivascular cells serve as a reservoir for supplying adipocyte precursor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. A second possibility is the differentiation of existing stromal fibroblasts to &#945;SMA<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts in browning WATs. The latter possibility suggests that differentiation of fibroblasts toward myofibroblasts is a prerequisite for further differentiation into beige cells. Thus, defining the signaling driving force committing stromal cell differentiation would be essential to understand the mechanisms of WAT browning.</p><p id="Par41">To decipher molecular mechanisms controlling beige cell differentiation, we focused our efforts on the non-adipocyte fractions where the mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes reside. Analysis of miRNAs in the SVF of the browning adipose tissue is a novel approach. It allows us to reveal autocrine mechanism that are regulated on the post-transcriptional level and determine preadipocyte to beige adipocyte differentiation potentials. We show that FGF10 is a novel target for miR-327 and that the expression of miR-327 is altered during browning and FGF10 protein is profoundly increased in browning WATs. In non-browning WAT, FGF10 exists in scWAT at low levels and was undetectable in visWAT. This finding suggests that FGF10 is involved in WAT browning and a low amount of FGF10 in visWAT might be linked to its resistance to browning. Although FGF10 protein is present in iBAT, its expression level remains unchanged under all experimental conditions. Thus, FGF10 is specifically responsible for WAT browning, but not iBAT activation. These data further imply the existence of differential mechanisms governing WAT browning and iBAT activation.</p><p id="Par42">We also provide convincing evidence showing that FGF10 commits to preadipocyte differentiation, but not proliferation, through the FGFR2&#8211;Akt signaling pathway. Transfection of miR-327 alone can markedly suppress FGF10 levels and attenuates preadipocyte differentiation toward browning adipocytes. These findings suggest the existence of an autocrine regulatory loop at the post-transcriptional level, where SVF cells produce one or several factors that drive them into differentiation. A causational link of the FGF10&#8211;FGFR2 signaling was established by blocking FGFR functions. Inhibition of FGFR2 blocks preadipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, activation of the downstream signaling component Akt is essentially required for FGF10-stimulated preadipocyte differentiation. Autonomous mechanisms controlling beige adipocyte differentiation through a post-transcriptional autocrine signaling pathway has not been previously described. The miR-327&#8211;FGF10&#8211;FGFR2&#8211;Akt autocrine pathway defines a completely novel molecular mechanism for thermogenic regulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10k</xref>). Although we mainly claim an autocrine mechanism in the regulation of adipose browning in the present work, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of the existence of a paracrine loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Some of the mechanisms depicted here might be relevant not only to the browning process but also to overall adipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by some of the effects found systematically in the 3T3-L1 model.</p><p id="Par43">Another interesting finding is that genetic deletion of only one allele the <italic>Fgf10</italic> gene resulted in marked reduction of FGF10 protein in <italic>Fgf10</italic>
<sup>+/&#8722;</sup> mice, which attenuated the browning phenotype in scWAT after miR-327 inhibition. This genetic approach provides robust evidence that a causational link between miR-327 and FGF10 exists to modulate WAT browning. Again, BAT remains unaffected in <italic>Fgf10</italic>
<sup>+/&#8722;</sup> mice with or without miR-327 inhibition. Therefore, both pharmacological and genetic loss-of-functions reproduce similar experimental data and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p id="Par44">In an in vivo WAT browning model, we show that delivery of Ad-miR-327 effectively blocks cold-induced browning and UCP1 expression, validating the functional impact of this miRNA on thermogenesis. Delivery of a miR-327 inhibitor alone to 30&#8201;&#176;C-exposed animals induces a browning phenotype without cold or drug stimulus. Furthermore, a miR-327 inhibitor exacerbates cold-induced WAT browning and thermogenic activity. Consequently, systemic delivery of the miR-327 inhibitor significantly increases whole-body metabolism under both thermoneutral and cold conditions. This discovery is a proof-of-concept that microRNAs can be used for treatment of obesity, T2DM and other metabolic disorders. If these preclinical findings can be successfully translated into clinical practice, miRNAs targeting FGF10 would offer an effective novel therapeutic approach. Thus, our results provide mechanistic insights and pave a novel avenue for treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Animal models</title><p id="Par45">Six-week-old immunocompetent female C57BL/6 (Charles River) and immunodeficient female NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic>
