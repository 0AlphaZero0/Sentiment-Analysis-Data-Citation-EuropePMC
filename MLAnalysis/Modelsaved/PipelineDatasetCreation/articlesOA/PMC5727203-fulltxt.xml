Seedlings of tobacco strains LY1306, ZhongYan 100 (ZY100) and Hong Hua Da Jin Yuan (HHDJY) were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 to induce osmotic stress. As validation, water-deficit-induced drought treatments, including mild drought (MD; watering 1.5&#8201;L/week) and severe drought (SD, without watering) were carried out. Changes in cell morphology, leaf water potential, antioxidant enzyme activity, as well as contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline were determined for each treatment. Transcriptome sequencing was performed for the seedlings treated with 15% PEG-6000. No obvious changes were observed in morphology of LY1306 and ZY100 under osmotic or drought stress; whereas, visible wilting was observed in HHDJY. Superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities of LY1036 and ZY100 under osmotic stress were significantly higher than those of HHDJY. Under SD, the MDA content of LY1306 was significantly lower and the proline content of LY1306 was significantly higher than that of HHDJY. Differential genes between LY1306, ZY100 and HHDJY were enriched in functions about alpha-linolenic acid, and arginine and proline metabolisms. LY1306 could increase its antioxidant enzyme activities and proline accumulation in response to drought stress, probably by regulating drought resistance-related pathways and genes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Drought is one of the most common environmental stresses and is commonly defined as a period without significant rainfall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Importantly, it is a valuable economic crop and is the most widely grown non-food crop worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Tobacco originates in the tropics under conditions of good rainfall and requires ample water for growth during development. Most tobacco crops entering the world trade are produced in the temperate and tropical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report, in 2003, China was one of the leading countries growing tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, currently, drought stress has become a main limiting factor for the production of tobacco in China, particularly in northern China. Therefore, breeding of drought-resistant tobacco varieties is an urgent requirement.</p><p id="Par4">LY1306 is a newly bred tobacco strain obtained through eight years of hybridisation (2005&#8211;2012). Considerable field trials (2012&#8211;2015) suggest that this strain has stable genetic traits, good yield and quality and high stress and viral disease resistances. However, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms have not been investigated.</p><p id="Par5">At the molecular level, most events involved in adaptation probably result from alterations in gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

In the present study, we investigated the drought resistance mechanisms of the LY1306 tobacco strain using biochemical and transcriptomic approaches by comparing with another two tobacco varieties, ZhongYan 100 (ZY100) and Hong Hua Da Jin Yuan (HHDJY). ZY100 is a flue-cured tobacco variety developed by crossing the female parent tobacco strain 9201 and the male parent variety NC82, which presents good adaptability and drought resistanceis, and is resistant to multiple diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. HHDJY is selected and bred from the variant of Da Jin Yuan, which is superior in quality, but is sensitive to drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

After being treated with 25% PEG-6000 for 5&#8201;h, the leaves of HHDJY showed visible wilting, whereas those of LY1306 and ZY100 remained normal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Moreover, after treating seedlings with 15% PEG-6000 for 16&#8201;h, slight wilting was observed in HHDJY, whereas no changes appeared in LY1306. After continuous osmotic stress (15% PEG-6000) for 24&#8201;h, there was still no obvious morphological change in LY1306. However, HHDJY exhibited severe wilting (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In addition to PEG-6000-induced osmotic stress, we induced drought by withholding water supply. Similar to the findings described above, LY1306 exhibited better drought resistance than HHDJY. LY1306 seedlings in the mild drought (MD) group retained their leaf morphology, whereas those in the severe drought (SD) group showed only slight colour changes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). For HHDJY, SD caused severe wilting and the leaves turned deep green.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The morphological responses of LY1306, ZhongYan 100 (ZY100) and Hong Hua Da Jin Yuan (HHDJY) tobacco strains under drought stress.

Our results revealed that LY1306 exhibited better drought resistance than HHDJY. Our transcriptome sequencing analyses revealed thousands of DEGs between LY1306 and two control tobacco strains (ZY100 and HHDJY). These DEGs were significantly enriched in chemical compounds involved in biosynthetic and metabolic processes associated with GO terms and KEGG pathways. Many of these chemical compounds may be responsible for the drought resistance of LY1306.</p><p id="Par20">Drought is a major environmental determinant of plant growth and productivity. Exposure to drought stress induces the generation of reactive oxygen species, which have a negative oxidative effect on cellular structures and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Plants have developed some strategies to cope with this challenge. The antioxidant defence system is one of the drought stress defence mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. SOD converts O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#8722;</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, POD reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O based on the various substrates available as electron donors and CAT dismutates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>. Many studies have suggested that the activities of antioxidant enzymes are correlated with a plant&#8217;s drought resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The activities of antioxidant enzymes are higher in stress-resistant species than in stress-sensitive species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our data revealed that SOD and POD activities of LY1306 and ZY100 were significantly higher than those of HHDJY under stress induced with 15% PEG-6000. Interestingly, there was no significant change in CAT activity of LY1306 under the various treatments.</p><p id="Par21">MDA is a by-product of lipid peroxidation, which serves as suitable marker for membrane lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and the MDA content usually increases under stress damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In general, stress-sensitive tobacco strains have a higher MDA content and electrolyte leakage in response to environmental stress than stress-resistant strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the present study, the MDA content gradually increased with increased drought stress in all the three strains. Interestingly, we also found that the MDA content of HHDJY was significantly higher than those of LY1306 and ZY100 under both MD and SD.</p><p id="Par22">Proline can accumulate to high concentrations without damaging cellular macromolecules. Therefore, it acts as a compatible osmolyte. Importantly, proline provides protection against membrane damage and protein denaturation during severe drought stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Stress-mediated changes in free proline levels have been studied in various plant species, and several possible roles conferring stress resistance have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Proline accumulation is a physiological response of plants subjected to drought stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our results regarding proline accumulation were in agreement with the results of studies cited above. In the present study, proline accumulation in response to drought was observed in all the three strains. In particular, proline contents of LY1306 and ZY100 were significantly higher than that of HHDJY. Interestingly, our pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs between LY1306 and ZY100 and between LY1306 and HHDJY, such as mRNA_107515, mRNA_109766, and mRNA_142147, were up-regulated in LY1306 and significantly enriched in arginine and proline metabolisms. Therefore, proline accumulation in LY1306 under drought stress may be associated with mRNA_107515, mRNA_109766, and mRNA_142147 as well as arginine and proline metabolisms.</p><p id="Par23">Plant resistance to drought involves not only morphological and biochemical adaptations but also responses at the genetic level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In the present study, numerous DEGs were identified between LY1306 and ZY100, and between LY1306 and HHDJY. Some of these DEGs, such as mRNA_139072, mRNA_139073, and mRNA_139074 (all the three genes encoded linoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 2-1, chloroplastic-like, partial), are significantly involved in alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolisms; these acids are important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) associated with cell membrane lipids. Lipids are important membrane components and are severely affected by drought stress. Lipid composition changes maintain membrane integrity under water stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In the biochemical experiments conducted in our study, the MDA content was hypothesised to be a key indicator of drought resistance of LY1306. MDA appears to be the most mutagenic product of lipid peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In general, lipid peroxidation is described as a process under which oxidants attack lipids containing carbon&#8211;carbon double bond(s), particularly PUFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolisms as well as their enriched genes (mRNA_139072, mRNA_139073 and mRNA_139074) may be associated with the MDA content in all the three tobacco strains.</p><p id="Par24">Furthermore, our GO enrichment analysis found that these up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in genes that regulate biochemical processes associated with cinnamic acid, and jasmonic acid biosyntheses. Cinnamic acid identified from the root exudates of cucumber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> could inhibit plant growth by affecting ion uptake and hydraulic conductivity. Cinnamic acid has been reported to reduce lipid peroxidation and increase activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and POD, in drought-stressed cucumber leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Jasmonic acid, belonging to a class of derived polyunsaturated fatty acid phytohormones, occurs ubiquitously in plants and induces a wide range of plant stress responses. In particular, jasmonic acid is effective in protecting plants from drought-induced oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. A recent study has reported that jasmonic acid can modulate the antioxidant response mechanism of higher plants by tightly regulating biomembrane peroxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculated that the higher antioxidant enzymes activities in LY1306 in response to drought stress are associated with cinnamic acid and jasmonic acid biosyntheses.</p><p id="Par25">Although our study investigated drought resistance mechanisms of LY1306 at the transcriptomic level and identified some DEGs and pathways that may play roles in drought resistance of LY1306, the relative expression of DEGs or the possible involvement of biochemical pathways in regulating the expression of DEGs was not further investigated. Therefore, our future study will focus on relevant research regarding these factors.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, our study suggests that the LY1306 strain could significantly enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes, increase the accumulation of proline and decrease the MDA content in plant cells as an adaptive response to drought stress. These drought resistance reactions may be associated with biochemical pathways of arginine, proline, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolisms, and cinnamic acid and jasmonic acid biosyntheses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par27">The LY1306 tobacco strain (provided by Luoyang tobacco company, Henan, China) and two control tobacco strains, ZhongYan 100 (ZY100) and Hong Hua Da Jin Yuan (HHDJY) (both provided by Henan Agricultural University, Henan, China) were used as biomodels in the present study.
