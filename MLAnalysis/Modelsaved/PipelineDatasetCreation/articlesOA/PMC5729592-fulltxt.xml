This can be achieved with a 4 mg intravenous dose given annually [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone metastases, ZA given every 3 weeks has been demonstrated to delay time to first skeletal-related event (SRE defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, requirement for radiation therapy or surgery to bone, or change in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Treatment with ZA has no effect on progression-free or overall survival and is associated with potentially serious side effects including renal impairment, hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the duration of suppression of bone turnover following a single dose of ZA in men with bone metastases from CRPC. Our hypothesis was that a single injection of 4 mg ZA would suppress bone turnover in most men for at least 12 weeks.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0001"><title>Methods</title><p>This single arm, prospective cohort study was conducted at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT01062503). Institutional ethics approval was obtained. Eligible men had CRPC with evidence of bone metastases, were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &#8804;2, had never received bisphosphonates for prostate cancer and had adequate renal and hepatic function. Exclusion criteria included receipt of bisphosphonates within 1&#160;year, infection/abscess on dental exam or dental extraction within 4 weeks prior and other acute problems such as pathological fracture, spinal cord compression or hypocalcemia.</p><p>Patients received a single 4&#160;mg intravenous injection of ZA (Zometa<sup>&#174;</sup>, Novartis, Switzerland) in 100&#160;ml saline as a 15-min infusion. Fasting morning blood and urine samples were collected prior to administration of ZA for measurement of the markers of bone turnover uNTX and sCTX (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Patients had 3-weekly measurements of these markers up to 12 weeks as long as the concentrations of uNTX and sCTX remained suppressed (defined as &lt;50% of baseline value and &lt;100 mmol/mmol creatinine for uNTX and &lt;600 ng/l for sCTX). If the uNTX or sCTX rose above these values, the patient came off study and received further ZA; otherwise they received subsequent ZA at 12 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with suppression of bone turnover at 12 weeks. Any adverse events were recorded at 3-weekly visits and the relation of such events to treatment with ZA was assessed.</p><p>We also measured patients&#8217; quality-of-life (QoL) at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain (FACT-BP) and the Bone Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mean FACT-BP and BPI scores are reported descriptively and we sought correlations between changes in uNTX and sCTX concentrations and changes in FACT-BP and BPI scores using Pearson's correlation.</p><p>We conducted a univariable proportional hazards regression analysis to determine if baseline variables (age, BMI, prior radiation, prior spinal cord compression, prior chemotherapy, prior SRE, prior surgery to bone and telopeptide concentrations) predicted for suppression of bone turnover at 12 weeks. A multivariable analysis adjusting for covariates was planned. All statistical tests were two sided and statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2&#160;(SAS Institute Inc.,&#160;NC, USA). No corrections were made for multiple significance testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0003"><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p>From January 2010 to June 2014, 69 men were screened, of whom 29 either declined the study or were ineligible due to use of a bisphosphonate and/or abnormal organ function.

Here, we demonstrate that many men achieve suppression of markers of bone turnover for 12 weeks following ZA. High telopeptide at baseline is known to be correlated with higher burden of bone metastasis [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and men with high baseline telopeptide levels had a lower chance of suppressed telopeptide levels at 12 weeks. Whether such men might derive benefit from more frequent ZA treatments is unknown although a recent study reported in this journal suggested that bone turnover markers are suitable predictors of mortality risk, disease progression and SREs in men with prostate cancer [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Although QoL assessed by FACT-BP and BPI did not change significantly during the study period, there was a correlation between the fall in sCTX concentrations and improvement in QoL scores. Given that bone turnover was suppressed in most men, QoL is largely a function of side effects of treatment. Therefore, less frequent administration of ZA is likely to have favorable effects on men's QoL. However, short study duration may have impacted our results on QoL.</p><p>ZA is used to delay or prevent SREs in other tumor types that involve bone such as breast cancer and myeloma. Clinical outcomes of 4- and 12-weekly schedules of ZA in women with breast cancer and bone metastases were shown to be similar [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, a large study evaluating monthly versus 3-monthly use of ZA in multiple tumor types was reported at a meeting to demonstrate noninferiority for 3-monthly compared with monthly dosing (29.5 vs 28.6% of participants with SREs at 2&#160;years, respectively). Similar questions apply to the optimal frequency of administration of the RANK ligand inhibitor denosumab and a Phase III clinical trial assessing the efficacy of 4&#160;versus 12 weeks of denosumab is underway [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Our study has limitations. It did not have a control arm and the sample size was small; it was conducted at a single tertiary cancer center potentially introducing selection bias. Also, the optimal level of telopeptide suppression to achieve clinical meaningful effects remain unknown. Despite these limitations, we found that the majority of men with CRPC and bone metastases have suppression of markers of bone turnover for at least 12 weeks following their first injection with ZA, suggesting that a less frequent schedule of administration should be investigated in definitive clinical trials with clinical end points.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion &amp; future perspective</title><p>Based on the markers of bone turnover suppression, we demonstrate that majority of men require less frequent injections of ZA than is currently approved. Given the recent evidence suggesting similar efficacy with 12-weekly ZA compared with 3 weekly, less frequent injections are likely sufficient in most men: individualizing frequency based on baseline risks could help save inconvenience and cost of frequent treatments. Results of studies looking at appropriate frequency of treatment with other bone targeted agents like denosumab (NCT02051218) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are awaited.</p><boxed-text id="BB1" position="float"><caption><title>Summary points</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Zoledronic acid (ZA) delays skeletal-related events in men with prostate cancer and bone metastases.
