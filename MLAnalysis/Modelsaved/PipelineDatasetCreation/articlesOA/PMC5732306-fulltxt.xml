The highest methane yield (480&#8201;mL/g VS) was observed in the mesophilic digester (MDi) fed with food waste alone. The mesophilic co-digestion of food waste and manure (McoDi) yielded 26% more methane than the sum of individual digestions of manure and food waste. The main volatile fatty acid (VFA) in the mesophilic systems was acetate, averaging 93 and 172&#8201;mg/L for McoDi and MDi, respectively. Acetate (2150&#8201;mg/L) and propionate (833&#8201;mg/L) were the main VFAs in the thermophilic digester (TDi), while propionate (163&#8201;mg/L) was the major VFA in the thermophilic co-digester (TcoDi). The dominant bacteria in MDi was <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> (54%), while <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was dominant in McoDi (60%).

This process is carried out by a complex microbial community which degrade various organic compounds into final products such as methane and carbon dioxide, collectively called biogas.</p><p id="Par3">There are presently many research efforts worldwide on anaerobic digestion of food waste to improve process efficiency, stability and economic competitiveness. Studies of co-digestion of food waste generally found that inclusion of food waste was beneficial for methane yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, while digestion processes with food waste as the sole substrate were often found to be unstable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Several researchers have reported the benefits of using mixed feedstocks, including increased biogas production, enhanced degradation rates and higher digester capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The beneficial effects of co-digestion are mostly related to a balanced availability of macro- and micronutrient required by the microbial community, optimal moisture content, buffer capacity and dilution of inhibitory or toxic compounds. Additionally, co-digestion may improve the process kinetics rather than the bioavailability of the feedstock. Ebner <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> measured hydrolysis rates using bio-methane potential assays, and found that co-digestion increased hydrolysis rates when food waste and manure was co-digested compared to mono-digestion in BMP assays. The synergistic effect was attributed to dilution of inhibitory compounds and improved nutrient balance due to co-digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The enzymes involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation requires trace elements such as selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo) tungsten (W), cobolt (Co), nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Lack of these trace elements can limit the syntrophic acetate oxidation as well as formate oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The resulting accumulation of formate may again inhibit propionic acid oxidation. This will result in an overall acid accumulation, which eventually can cause the pH in the digester to drop, severely affecting or completely stopping the methanogenesis. Notably, the toxicity of intermediate compounds also increases with increasing temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and thermophilic digesters are commonly considered to be more prone to process inhibition than mesophilic digesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, anaerobic digestion processes operating at high-temperature often selects for a less diverse microbial community, which is more vulnerable to stress and operational changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Most studies in the literature have focused on enhancing functionality and operation of anaerobic co-digesters using food waste and other feedstocks. Several studies have compared performance of mesophilic and thermophilic digesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, but comparison of community structures and diversity in anaerobic digesters and anaerobic co-digesters at these different temperatures are rare in the literature.</p><p id="Par4">Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial structure of co-digestion of food waste and cow manure under mesophilic (37&#8201;&#176;C) and thermophilic (55&#8201;&#176;C) conditions. Additionally, we compared the microbial structure of the co-digestion process to that of food waste digestion alone to determine how the co-digestion process influences the microbial communities. Also, performance parameters were studied under the various conditions and it was attempted to explain performance efficiencies using microbial data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Performance of the biogas reactors</title><p id="Par5">The average pH values for MDi, McoDi, TDi and TcoDi were 7.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.1, 7.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.1, 7.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2 and 8.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.1, respectively. As illustrated in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the average pH of McoDi and MDi was comparable, although slightly higher in McoDi. Notably, while the pH of TDi was similar to mesophilic processes, an elevated pH was clearly seen for TcoDi. This agrees with the higher ammonia concentrations in the co-digestion systems (McoDi and TcoDi), which were 16.5% and 13.7% higher than the MDi and TDi digesters, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additionally, as shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, alkalinity was also higher in the co-digesters than the digestion systems. This is most likely due to the addition of manure, as manure typically has high content of nitrogen-bearing material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> that are released as ammonia during the fermentation process and acts as a buffering system.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The pH and alkalinity in the various digesters, presented as an average of measurements over a period.

</p><p id="Par6">The degradation of organic material in all the digesters was measured in terms of TCOD removal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Regardless of the operational temperature, the removal efficiencies were higher for the digestion systems (MDi: 73.0% and TDi: 66.4%) than the co-digesters (McoDi: 61.4% and TcoDi: 56.7%). This was expected due to a general high degradability of food waste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. MDi had the highest methane yield of all four digesters with 479.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;33.9&#8201;ml CH<sub>4</sub>/g VS<sub>feed</sub>, which was 11.5%, 7.0% and 31.6% higher than the McoDi, TDi and TcoDi, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results are in agreement with earlier studies reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, lower methane production in the thermophilic reactors may be related to the presence of higher free ammonia concentrations that was, on average, 198&#8201;mg/L for TDi and 431&#8201;mg/L in TcoDi (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), potentially causing inhibition of the methanogenesis process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>TCOD concentrations in the influent (blue) and effluent (red) and average methane generation (grey) from each digester.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_15784_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e437"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par7">It has been observed that co-digestion of food waste and manure may enhance biogas production, and lead to more stable digestion processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We also observed higher methane production when we compared the methane yield of McoDi fed with the mixture of food waste and manure with that of manure-only fed mesophilic (37&#8201;&#176;C) digester. The methane yields of manure-fed digester and McoDi were 133&#8201;&#177;&#8201;18 and 430&#8201;&#177;&#8201;28&#8201;mL CH<sub>4</sub>/g VS<sub>feed</sub>, respectively. Based on the measured specific methane yield from MDi and the manure-only reactor, the expected methane yield for McoDi without any synergistic effects would be 341&#8201;mL CH<sub>4</sub>/g VS<sub>feed</sub>. However, our results showed that the observed methane yield of McoDi was 430&#8201;mL CH<sub>4</sub>/g VS<sub>feed</sub>, meaning that the co-digestion of food waste and manure (McoDi) resulted in 26% higher methane production than the sum of&#160;digestions of individual substrates.</p><p id="Par8">The solubilization values estimated for MDi, McoDi, TDi and TcoDi were 56, 55, 63 and 48%, respectively (see Equation&#160;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). The highest solubilization extent was observed in the TDi (63%), although less methane was generated in this system as compared to MDi and McoDi (discussed above). It was also noticed that the SCOD fraction of the extent of solubilization in TDi was quite high (10%) and thus less solubilized compounds were converted into the final product methane. This accumulation of soluble COD was likely prompted by the higher degradability of the food waste as compared to manure. The SCOD accounted for 1, 2 and 6% of the solubilization extent in MDi, McoDi and TcoDi, respectively. Moreover, the TcoDi showed the lowest solubilization extent (48%), indicating less efficient solubilization of the substrate mixture. Additionally, when the SCOD results were compared between the digester sets (i.e., MDi vs. TDi and McoDi vs. TcoDi), it revealed that the SCOD was 10 and 4 times higher in the effluent of the TDi and TcoDi than those of MDi and McoDi. However, the effluent SCOD concentrations were statistically comparable in the mesophilic digester (932&#8201;&#177;&#8201;151) and co-digester (1537&#8201;&#177;&#8201;511) (p<sub>value</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.05).</p><p id="Par9">Overall, both mesophilic digesters had low concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Analysis of the VFAs measurements (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) revealed acetate as the main VFA in the mesophilic digesters MDi and McoDi, which was, on average, 172&#8201;&#177;&#8201;61 and 93&#8201;&#177;&#8201;54&#8201;mg/L, respectively. The remaining VFAs detected in the mesophilic digesters, propionic, iso-butyric and butyric acids, were all below 50&#8201;mg/L (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Thus, it appeared that the fermenting and methanogenic processes were in balance preventing accumulation of intermediate products in MDi and McoDi. Low VFAs concentrations were reported for an anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic condition for food waste treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The analysis of the VFA profiles (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) revealed a totally different behavior in the thermophilic digester TDi and co-digester TcoDi. Acetate and propionate accumulated in TDi, averaging 2150&#8201;&#177;&#8201;208 and 833&#8201;&#177;&#8201;282&#8201;mg/L, respectively. These results were consistent with previous works reported in literature that under thermophilic condition increased concentrations of VFAs were observed, while mesophilic digesters were capable of achieving lower VFA concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As can be seen from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the concentrations of total VFAs in TcoDi were less than 300&#8201;mg/L, in which propionate was the main VFA with an average concentration of 163&#8201;&#177;&#8201;27&#8201;mg/L. This difference in the VFA profile in TDi and TcoDi might be due to an improved synergistic performance of acetogens and methanogens in TcoDi that prevented the accumulation of the intermediate products and resulted in significantly lower concentrations of VFAs in TcoDi. The slow degradation of the manure which constituted 40% (on VS basis) of the feedstock in the co-digesters may also explain this difference.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Volatile fatty acids concentrations in (<bold>A</bold>): MDi; (<bold>B</bold>) McoDi; (<bold>C</bold>): TDi; and (<bold>D</bold>): TcoDi digestion systems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_15784_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e524"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microbial composition of the mesophilic reactors</title><p id="Par10">Statistical analysis demonstrated that the anaerobic co-digestion process resulted in a significantly (p<sub>value</sub>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.005) higher microbial richness compared to the digesters fed with food waste alone (see Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The major bacteria in both mesophilic digesters included <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, the distribution of these major bacteria in the digesters was different. <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, which in the final phase constituted 54% of the sequences, was the dominant phylum in MDi, followed by 25% <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 15% <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (60% of the sequences in the final phase) was the dominant phylum in McoDi, while the relative abundance of <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> (22%) and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (8%) was noticeably lower in McoDi than MDi. Additionally, the candidate phylum WWE1 was identified in McoDi and accounted for 5% of the relative abundance. Limam <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> investigated the metabolic function of WWE1 members and suggested that the members of this division were involved in hydrolysis of cellulosic materials. WWE1 was also found in mesophilic co-digestion studies of manure with various agricultural residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, the addition of cow manure to the co-digestion system seems to spur the growth of WWE1 members, probably involved in decomposition of cellulose content of the manure. It should be noted that WWE1 was not detected in the cow manure in the current study. The dominance of <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> in MDi (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which was mainly made up of the T78 group of family <italic>Anaerolinacea</italic>, was probably due to the presence of fermentable carbohydrates in the preprocessed food waste used (pasteurized at 70&#8201;&#176;C). <italic>Anaerolinacea</italic> are mostly saccharolytic anaerobes and use a number of carbohydrates for growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Use of manure in the feedstock of the co-digestion systems resulted in a different relative abundance of bacterial communities in McoDi and prompted the prevalence of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, which include members with very versatile metabolic characteristics and more potential to degrade the recalcitrant manure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>Firmicutes</italic> has been reported as one of the major microbial contributors in several studies carried out on anaerobic digesters, indicating that the phylum is common in both mesophilic and thermophilic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> dominance has also been linked to better reactor performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The higher relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in MDi, which was fed with the preprocessed food waste, probably indicates involvement of their members in degradation of intermediate degradation products of carbohydrates and proteins.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic distribution of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in anaerobic digesters and co-digesters, presented at phylum level.

</p><p id="Par11">Notably, the relative abundance of <italic>Fimicutes</italic> increased in the final phase of McoDi compared to MDi. This could be due to the addition of manure which is a potential source of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, as organisms belonging to this phylum dominated the microbial profile of the manure feedstock with 78% of all sequences (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). To evaluate this, the genus level distribution of the sequences was investigated and a high diversity within the <italic>Firmicutes</italic>-phylum was noticed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). An unclassified genus of the family <italic>Tissierellaceae</italic> accounted for 32% of the sequences assigned to the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the final phase of MDi, while this value was much lower in McoDi (11% of phylum) where the main genus was <italic>Clostridium</italic> (42% of phylum). In compliance, three OTUs assigned to <italic>Clostridium</italic> were significantly more abundant in McoDi compared to MDi (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, see also Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). Thus, it would appear that <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in general and <italic>Clostridium</italic> in particular played an important role in McoDi system. This genus was also represented in the cow manure samples, accounting for 9% of the <italic>Firmicutes</italic>-related sequences. A principle component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate possible links between microbiome and performance. Based on this analysis an association of <italic>Clostridium</italic> to the concentration of n-Butyrate was observed, although only low levels of butyrate were measured in both mesophilic digesters (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Notably, a correlation was observed between the abundance of <italic>Clostridium</italic> and the cow manure used in the feedstock mixture of the co-digestion system. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the increase in relative abundance of <italic>Clostridium</italic> in the co-digestion system was originated from the cow manure as a feedstock. It should nevertheless be mentioned that some <italic>Clostridium</italic> species can form endospores that enable them to tolerate moist heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and pasteurization pretreatment applied on the food waste collected from the processing center. The food waste can therefore not be eliminated as a source of <italic>Clostridium</italic>. However, a carry-over from the cow manure used seems more likely due to the abovementioned increase of <italic>Clostridium</italic> in McoDi. This was further supported by the correlation of higher numbers of <italic>Clostridium</italic> with the addition of cow manure.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic distribution of the genera within (<bold>A</bold>) phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and (<bold>B</bold>) phylum <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic>.

Additionally, principle component analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>) showed a correlation between the relative abundance of S1 and the concentrations of VFAs, indicating that the elevated concentrations of VFAs in TDi could be a cause-effect of an enhanced degradation of polysaccharides by <italic>Thermotoga</italic> S1. Furthermore, the free ammonia measured was 2.2 times greater in TcoDi (431&#8201;mg/L) than TDi (198&#8201;mg/L), suggesting that ammonium may possibly influence the abundance of the <italic>Thermotoga</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Overall, it would appear that the detection of higher relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes assigned to the genera <italic>Anaerobaculum</italic>, <italic>Coprothermobacter</italic>, <italic>Thermotoga</italic> and <italic>Syntrophomonas</italic> in TDi might indirectly imply an enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the food waste as compared to the co-digestion of food waste and manure.

Nevertheless, co-digestion resulted in a higher microbial diversity at both temperatures, compared to anaerobic digestion of food waste as sole substrate. This could be a reflection of the increased complexity of feedstocks in co-digestion, selecting for a richer microbial community. Although similar in the initial phase, the microbial community compositions diverged when cow manure was added at both temperatures. Based on our observations, we speculate that this variation is mostly explained by cow manure providing trace minerals and a balanced C/N ratio, rather than carry-over of microorganisms from the cow manure. However, the increased population <italic>Clostridium</italic> in both McoDi and TcoDi indicates that the establishment of this population is a direct result of microbiome transmission from the cow manure. Carry-over of methanogens from the cow manure, represented by <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> was also suggested for the mesophilic co-digestion system (McoDi), while only to a minor extent in the thermophilic co-digestion system (TcoDi). As higher microbial diversity often is associated with a microbiome that is more resilient to environmental changes and stress, co-digestion could potentially enhance the robustness of the anaerobic digestion process. Additionally, co-digestion at mesophilic temperature clearly showed a synergistic effect, yielded more methane than the digestion of manure-alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Feedstock</title><p id="Par21">Food waste (FW) was shipped from Norsk Matretur AS (Norwegian food recycling, Finstadjordet, Norway), which is a central food waste pre-treatment plant which reduces particle size to &lt;7&#8201;mm and sanitizes the waste at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8201;hour, as required by Norwegian health regulations.
