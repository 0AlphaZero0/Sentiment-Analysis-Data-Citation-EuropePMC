acts as an oncogene through dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and nuclear accumulation of YAP1 is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer (GC). We previously identified ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, as a YAP1 inhibitor. Here, we aimed to clarify whether ivermectin had antitumor effects on GC through inhibition of YAP1. First, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of ivermectin on human GC cells using <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation assays and a xenograft mouse model. YAP1-knockdown assays were performed to assess whether the sensitivity to ivermectin depended on YAP1 expression. Next, we explored the mechanism through which ivermectin regulated YAP1 expression or localization by immunoblotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for YAP1 and the downstream gene <italic>CTGF</italic>. Finally, the clinical significance of <italic>YAP1</italic> expression was examined using three independent GC datasets. We found that MKN1 GC cells were most sensitive to ivermectin, whereas MKN7 cells were most resistant. In MKN1 xenografts, ivermectin suppressed tumor growth, and the sensitivity of MKN1 cells to ivermectin was decreased by YAP1 knockdown. Ivermectin inhibited YAP1 nuclear expression and CTGF expression in MKN1 cells but not MKN7 cells. Moreover, ivermectin decreased <italic>YAP1</italic> mRNA expression, thereby inhibiting nuclear accumulation of YAP1 in MKN1 cells. In survival analysis, low <italic>YAP1</italic> mRNA expression was associated with a better prognosis in three independent GC datasets. In conclusion, we identified ivermectin as a potential antitumor agent and found a promising novel therapeutic strategy for inhibition of GC progression by blocking YAP1 expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ivermectin</kwd><kwd>yes-associated protein 1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>antiproliferative effect</kwd><kwd>therapeutic target</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite recent advances in medical treatments, such as chemotherapy and biological therapy, for the management of GC, patient survival remains poor, particularly for those with advanced disease [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], highlighting the need for the development of novel therapeutic agents.</p><p>Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is upregulated and exhibits oncogenic properties in GC. Moreover, increased nuclear expression of YAP1 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. YAP1 is a downstream target of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates organ size during development [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. YAP1 acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the nucleus, activating TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD)-mediated transcription of cell proliferation genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Activation of the Hippo pathway phosphorylates YAP1 at Ser127, which inhibits the activity of YAP1 and results in retention of YAP1 in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, nuclear YAP1 is a positive regulator of cell proliferation that is suppressed by Hippo signaling. Hence, inhibition of YAP1 expression may prevent tumor progression and improve prognosis in various malignancies, including GC [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>We previously identified ivermectin as a potential YAP1 inhibitor by chemical compounds screening [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ivermectin is a chemically modified derivative of avermectin, which was initially purified by Drs. Campbell and Omura as an effective antiparasitic agent [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], earning these researchers a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015. Recently, ivermectin has been reported to be a promising antitumor agent for various types of malignant tumors, including colon cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and leukemia [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ivermectin-mediated suppression of tumor growth, and no studies have evaluated whether ivermectin has antitumor effects in GC. Accordingly, such studies may enable ivermectin to be repositioned as a novel anticancer drug.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to clarify the antitumor effects of ivermectin in GC and evaluate the mechanisms through which regulation of YAP1 expression modulates these antitumor effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Ivermectin suppressed GC growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a xenograft mouse model</title><p>First, the antiproliferative effects of ivermectin on GC were examined by MTT assays and colony formation assays using GC cell lines. MTT assays demonstrated that the response to ivermectin was different among cell lines. Among the tested cell lines, we found that MKN1 cells were most sensitive to ivermectin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 10.2 &#956;M) and that SH-10-TC cells were also sensitive to the drug (IC<sub>50</sub> = 21.2 &#956;M; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Colony formation assays showed that ivermectin treatment significantly reduced colony formation in MKN1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In contrast, MKN7 cells were resistant to ivermectin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 31.9 &#956;M), as were MKN28 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 25.4 &#956;M; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Therefore, we defined MKN1 and SH-10-TC cells as ivermectin-sensitive cells and MKN7 and MKN28 cells as ivermectin-resistant cells. In addition, we performed apoptosis assays to determine whether ivermectin induced apoptosis in GC cells and found that ivermectin treatment did not induce apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Ivermectin suppressed the growth of GC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a xenograft mouse model</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sensitivity of GC cells to ivermectin.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, ivermectin treatment dramatically reduced tumor growth in mice. Macroscopically, ivermectin-treated tumors were much smaller than control tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Consistent with these findings, tumor weight was reduced in ivermectin-treated mice compared with that in the control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In addition, we also assessed whether mice showed any alterations in whole body weights after ivermectin treatment. The body weights of mice from the ivermectin-treated group were similar to those of control mice during the entire treatment period, except for 7 days after the start of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Finally, immunohistochemical analysis for xenografts tumor tissues showed that ivermectin-treated xenografts displayed weaker YAP1 and Ki67 staining than control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Moreover, ivermectin treatment did not induce apoptosis in tumor tissues, as demonstrated by TUNEL assays (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). We attempted to establish a xenograft mouse model with subcutaneous tumors using SH-10-TC. However, we were unable to establish such a model. Taken together, these data suggested that ivermectin suppressed the growth of GC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by inhibiting proliferation rather than inducing apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>The antiproliferative effects of ivermectin were dependent on YAP1 expression</title><p>MTT assays were then conducted to investigate whether the proliferation of MKN1 cells (ivermectin-sensitive) and MKN7 cells (ivermectin-resistant) was dependent on YAP1 expression. <italic>YAP1</italic> knockdown induced significant downregulation of YAP1 protein expression in both MKN1 and MKN7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). <italic>YAP1</italic> knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation in MKN1 cells but not in MKN7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Next, we examined whether the effects of ivermectin on cell proliferation were dependent on YAP1 expression in YAP1-knockdown GC cells since ivermectin had previously been shown to inhibit YAP1 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Furthermore, our findings suggested that high <italic>YAP1</italic> mRNA expression may be a novel biomarker of poor prognosis and could be a surrogate marker for the therapeutic efficacy of ivermectin in GC.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the mechanism through which ivermectin regulates YAP1 function for the first time and demonstrated that ivermectin decreased <italic>YAP1</italic> mRNA expression, resulting in reduced nuclear expression of YAP1 protein in GC cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Ivermectin-induced <italic>YAP1</italic> mRNA downregulation was assumed to occur through transcriptional inactivation or mRNA destabilization [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further experiments are required to clarify this mechanism.</p><p>In drug discovery, one successful strategy is the exploitation of established drugs that have already been approved for treatment of other diseases (i.e., drug repositioning or drug repurposing) [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we showed that ivermectin, which is used as an antiparasitic drug and is commercially available at a low cost, could be an effective treatment option for patients with GC. Thus, we suggest that ivermectin may be repositioned as a novel drug for the treatment of YAP1-dependent GC.</p><p>In summary, ivermectin suppressed the growth of GC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by inhibiting YAP1 expression. Furthermore, GC with low <italic>YAP1</italic> expression had favorable clinicopathological features and a good prognosis. These findings provided insights into the antiproliferative effects of ivermectin as a YAP1 inhibitor and established a theoretical basis for preclinical evaluations of ivermectin for management of GC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human GC cell lines MKN1, MKN7, MKN28, MKN45, MKN74, SH-10-TC, NUGC-3, NUGC-4, AGS, GSU, and KE-39 were purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan).
