Introduction</title><p>Cold and drought are the most common and primary environments that adversely affect plant growth and crop production worldwide. Because plants are sessile and have to endure one or more environmental challenges, plants have developed multiple complex signaling networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of stress-related genes to cope with adverse environmental conditions during their long-term adaptation [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is recognized as a secondary messenger and appears to play crucial roles in signal transduction under both cold and drought stresses, via the changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref rid="B2-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several kinds of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, including calmodulin (CaM), CaM-like protein (CML), calcineurin B-like protein (CBL), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), are induced in response to cold and drought [<xref rid="B2-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic plants with over-expression of <italic>GmCaM4</italic> or <italic>VaCDPK20</italic> exhibit enhanced stress tolerance [<xref rid="B3-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), another secondary messenger, is an important mediator in signal transmission, connecting the perception of external stimuli to cellular responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that MAPKs are involved in cold, drought, or both cold and drought stresses [<xref rid="B5-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, are also secondary messengers and accumulate under cold and drought stresses. They are signals contributing to stress injury in plants, as transgenic plants over-expressing ROS scavengers or mutants with higher ROS-scavenging ability show increased tolerance to environmental stresses [<xref rid="B7-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the secondary messengers, hormones have been demonstrated to be key players in the response to cold and drought. Of these, abscisic acid (ABA) plays a critical role in response to various stress signals [<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Under osmotic conditions imposed by drought, the most rapid response of plants is closure of the stomata, mediated by ABA, to maintain their water balance. Accordingly, expression of several ABA biosynthesis genes, such as <italic>NCED3</italic> and <italic>LOS6</italic>/<italic>ABA1</italic>, are up-regulated by drought stress [<xref rid="B9-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to the ABA-dependent pathway, molecular analyses have revealed that ABA-independent pathways are also involved in transcriptional regulatory networks under drought stress [<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, under cold stress, the expression of genes is influenced largely through an ABA-independent pathway, because expression of some key genes (e.g., <italic>ZEP</italic> and <italic>NCED</italic>) involved in ABA biosynthesis is not obviously up-regulated by cold and there is little or no increase in ABA content in plants subjected to cold treatment [<xref rid="B7-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the expression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene <italic>RD29A</italic> was subject to both ABA-dependent and -independent regulation under both drought and cold conditions [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to ABA, hormones such as ethylene, salicylic acid (SA), and brassinosteroid (BR) are also involved in abiotic stress responses [<xref rid="B12-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, these hormones interact with one another in regulating stress signaling and tolerance in plants [<xref rid="B13-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are also key regulators involved in plant abiotic stress signaling. Many cold-regulated genes (<italic>COR</italic>) have been identified as responding to cold treatment. The most characterized transcriptional cascade, with a large role in cold stress pathways, is called &#8220;ICE-CBF-COR&#8221; [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of these, C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) are members of the AP2/EREBP family and are involved in regulation of ABA-independent expression of <italic>COR</italic> genes under cold stress. Constitutive- or over-expression of CBFs enhances cold stress tolerance in several plants [<xref rid="B14-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Inducer of CBF expression (<italic>ICE</italic>), a member of the bHLH family, can directly interact with CBFs and regulate their expression upon cold treatment [<xref rid="B16-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the over-expression of <italic>ICE</italic>s in transgenic plants results in improved freezing tolerance [<xref rid="B17-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ABA is a major player in response to drought stress, thus the TFs involved in ABA signaling pathways are related to drought stress. For example, ABRE-binding factor (ABF), of the bZIP family, can bind to the ABRE motif and activate ABA-dependent gene expression during drought stress [<xref rid="B18-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other important TFs, such as the MYC and myeloblastosis (MYB) proteins, are also known to function as activators in ABA-dependent regulatory pathways. Transgenic plants over-expressing both <italic>AtMYC2</italic> and <italic>AtMYB2</italic> showed an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype and improved osmotic stress tolerance [<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to the cold- or drought-specific induced TFs, some others (e.g., <italic>WRKY45</italic>, <italic>ZAT12</italic>, and <italic>NAC6</italic>) are involved in both cold and drought stresses.</p><p>To further increase the understanding of signaling pathways for the improvement of crop stress tolerance, it is essential to know how plants respond to stresses and which genes and pathways are involved in the stress tolerance. Over recent decades, significant progress has been made regarding our knowledge of plant response to abiotic stresses, and thousands of genes and tens of signaling pathways have been identified concerning cold and drought [<xref rid="B8-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, many of these genes were found to be regulated commonly or specifically in response to drought and cold stresses in several plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B21-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], rice [<xref rid="B22-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and cotton [<xref rid="B23-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] at the transcriptional level. However, in tropical plants (e.g., cassava), similar studies are very limited, and the molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance to both drought and cold stresses remain largely unknown.</p><p>Cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz) is an important cash crop and provides staple food for over 750 million people in tropical and sub-tropical areas [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is a major crop for starch, bio-fuel production, and animal feed, owing to its starch-enriched root [<xref rid="B25-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cassava is generally thought to be drought-tolerant, however, similarly to other crops, this drought tolerance is usually at the cost of restrained growth and decreased economic yield [<xref rid="B25-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a tropical root crop, cassava is native to a warm habitat and is very sensitive to cold, which greatly damages the plants and reduces yield [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, it is very important to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cold and drought stresses in cassava. With rapid development of next generation sequencing techniques and the release of the cassava draft genome [<xref rid="B27-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], much progress has been made in large-scale identification of genes involved in cold [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and drought [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] responses, respectively, in cassava at the transcriptional or proteomic levels. However, very few studies have focused on comparisons of transcriptome profiles in response to cold and drought stresses in cassava, and the related signaling pathways have not been adequately explored. In this study, the same cassava cultivar leaves (including folded and full-expanded leaves) and roots were respectively collected at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h after cold treatment and 0, 4, 6, and 10 days after drought treatment, to investigate the genome-wide transcriptome changes through RNA-seq technology. The results will provide new insights into the signaling regulation networks responding to cold and drought in cassava, and will also provide solid bases for cassava improvement in regard to these two abiotic stresses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-18-02668"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-18-02668"><title>2.1. Stress Responses and Transcriptional Profiling of Cassava</title><p>Compared with controls, there were respective distinct symptoms in the cold- and drought-treated plants as the treatment time progressed (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S1</xref>). For the cold treatment, the plants were badly wilted at 6 h, their top leaves were curved at 24 h, and symptoms were more serious at 48 h. The drought-treated plants were badly wilted at 4 days, their lower leaves began to fall off at 6 days, and only a few upper leaves remained at 10 days (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the spatial and temporal gene expression in response to abiotic stresses in cassava at the transcriptional level, different tissues, including folded leaves (FL, the first three folded leaves), fully expanded leaves (FEL, three most newly fully expanded leaves), and fibrous roots (RT), were respectively collected at 0, 6, 24, and 48 h after cold treatment and 0, 4, 6, and 10 days after drought treatment. Overall, 88.2 million raw reads of 35 bp in length were obtained by single end sequencing with the Illumina GAII platform. After sequence pre-processing, 83.4 million adapter-trimmed clean reads were kept, and 95.8% of them were mapped to the cassava reference genome (Available online: <uri xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net">http://www.phytozome.net</uri>) with a maximum of two mismatches.</p><p>Overall, 18,271 genes, approximately two-thirds of the annotated genes in the reference genome, were expressed across drought-treated samples. Comparatively, a similar number of genes (17,352) were expressed across cold-treated samples. Interestingly, in either cold or drought treatment, the numbers of expressed genes were quite similar in the samples of all examined time points within the same tissue, as well as in different tissues when considering all the time points together (i.e., a gene was counted if it was expressed in at least one of four time points within the same tissue) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, in both cold and drought treatments, most of these genes were commonly expressed while only a few were exclusively expressed in FL, FEL, and RT, respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S2</xref>). The results indicated that there were similar amounts of expressed genes in different tissues (e.g., FL, FEL, and RT) of cassava to maintain a kind of housekeeping effect during cassava growth and development, regardless of experiencing abiotic stress or not. Once subjected to abiotic stress, the expression of these genes in cassava would be up- or down-regulated to cope with the adverse environments.</p><p>In addition, seven genes of interest were selected and their expression patterns were validated with high correlation coefficient (r = 0.94) between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR methods (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-18-02668"><title>2.2. Transcriptome Changes in Response to Drought and Cold</title><p>To reveal the transcriptome changes affected by abiotic stresses, differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified under cold and drought, respectively. Under cold treatment (signified by prefix &#8220;c.&#8221;), there were 2479, 1921, and 1408 DE genes in c.FL, c.FEL, and c.RT, respectively, with an increased gradient change of DE gene number from bottom to top of a plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Unlike expressed genes, most of these DE genes were exclusively identified in c.FL (1471), c.FEL (1056), and c.RT (766), but only 217 were commonly identified in all of these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Under drought treatment (signified by prefix &#8220;d.&#8221;), a similar gradient change of DE gene number was observed: d.FL (1229) &gt; d.FEL (1134) &gt; d.RT (1087), although the numbers were slightly lower compared with those of the cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Similarly, most of these DE genes were also exclusively identified in d.FL (854), d.FEL (753), and d.RT (794), and only a few (59) were commonly identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Thus, in response to cold and drought, expression of DE genes was more influenced in cassava leaves than in roots, and the majority exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns while only a small proportion were commonly influenced across tissue types.</p><p>The DE genes were compared between cold and drought treatments within the same tissue to explore their roles and expression responses to different abiotic stresses. In FL, 1951 (61.4%) DE genes were uniquely identified under cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Functional category enrichment showed that these genes were significantly enriched in calcium signaling and ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S3</xref>). As compared, 701 (22.0%) DE genes were uniquely identified under drought and 528 (16.6%) were identified under both cold and drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). These two groups of genes were commonly enriched in several categories, including cell wall, photosynthesis, and abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S3</xref>). In FEL, 1556 (57.8%) and 769 (28.6%) DE genes were uniquely identified in cold and drought, and they were enriched in photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole synthesis, and redox and abiotic stress, respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S3</xref>). In total, 365 (13.6%) DE genes were commonly found in response to cold and drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>F), however, no significantly enriched categories were observed. In RT, 1090 (50.0%) DE genes were uniquely identified under cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>G), but there were no significantly enriched categories. A total of 769 (35.3%) DE genes were uniquely identified under drought, and 318 (14.6%) were commonly identified under both cold and drought (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>G); these genes were significantly enriched in secondary metabolism and abiotic stress, respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-18-02668">Figure S3</xref>). These results also revealed that the expression of genes was more influenced by cold (~55%) than drought (~30%), and only a few of genes (~15%) were commonly influenced by both cold and drought in FL, FEL, or RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f001">Figure 1</xref>E&#8211;G).</p><p>To further characterize the functions of DE genes that were uniquely or commonly identified in cold and drought stress, fold-change-based clustering analysis and functional category enrichment were performed for each group, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-18-02668"><title>2.3.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the expression of genes from groups G1&#8211;G6 was significantly changed in only one tissue in response to cold.

Together, these results indicated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, MAPK, and SA hormone-mediated sub-network involving stomatal movement under cold and drought stresses in cassava.</p><p><italic>ICE1</italic>, a MYC-type bHLH transcription factor, is the most upstream TF in the cold signaling pathway [<xref rid="B16-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As expected, <italic>ICE1</italic> was significantly induced in response to cold stress, although its expression was depressed in FEL during the early stage of cold treatment. Besides, <italic>ICE1</italic> was also induced in FL but repressed in FEL and RT under drought condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Two auxin-related genes, including an auxin efflux carrier <italic>PIN1</italic> and an auxin inducable Aux/IAA type TF <italic>IAA14</italic> [<xref rid="B53-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], were co-expressed with <italic>ICE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that auxin and <italic>ICE1</italic> might interact pathways in cold and drought stresses in cassava. Another two genes, <italic>MAPKKK1</italic> and <italic>TCP2</italic>, were also co-expressed with <italic>ICE1</italic>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that <italic>ICE</italic> genes can directly interact with CBFs and regulate the expression of CBFs responding to cold stress [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although three CBFs, including two <italic>CBF3</italic> and one <italic>CBF4</italic>, were differentially expressed under stress conditions, their expression trends were differed from that of <italic>ICE1</italic>, supporting that the CBF regulon in cassava may differ from its counterparts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or <italic>ICE1</italic> may regulate the expression of CBFs by controlling the stability of ICE1 protein as recently proposed [<xref rid="B54-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>ABA is a major hormone with important roles in plants osmotic stresses. NCED and AAO are two key enzymes in the ABA biosynthetic pathway. Here, three genes (<italic>NCED7</italic>, <italic>NCED8</italic>, and <italic>AAO2</italic>) were uniformly depressed in RT under both cold and drought, although they showed some increase in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>CBF</italic> genes are mainly induced by cold stress, but, to some extent, they can also be mediated by drought through an ABA-dependent pathway [<xref rid="B1-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, CBFs are necessary for regulation of genes (e.g., <italic>GA2OX6</italic>) related to GA metabolism pathways [<xref rid="B55-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports in other species, we observed that three ABA biosynthesis genes (<italic>NCED7</italic>, <italic>NCED8</italic>, and <italic>AAO2</italic>), three CBFs (two <italic>CBF3</italic> and one <italic>CBF4</italic>), together with two GA metabolism genes (<italic>GID1C</italic> and <italic>GA2OX6</italic>) were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that this sub-network functioned in cold and drought stresses in cassava, especially in root tissue. Some exceptions were also observed. ABFs are bZIP TFs that can bind to the ABRE motif and regulate ABA-dependent gene expression [<xref rid="B18-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the expression patterns of two <italic>ABF2</italic> genes were quite different to those of the three ABA biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Similar results were observed for one bZIP TF (<italic>HY5</italic>) and two HB TFs (<italic>HB7</italic> and <italic>HB12</italic>), although they were ABA-dependent and responded to drought stress [<xref rid="B56-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], as well as for one GA synthesis enzyme <italic>GA20OX1</italic> and one GA receptor <italic>GID1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-02668-f006">Figure 6</xref>). These results strongly suggested that <italic>HB7</italic> and <italic>HB12</italic> and the related co-expressed TFs and hormone genes constituted a sub-network and played important roles in cold and drought stresses in cassava via an ABA-independent pathway, which was in agreement with our recent independent study [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the regulatory networks of cold and drought stresses in cassava.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-ijms-18-02668"><title>3.3. Comparison of Different Omics Studies Related to Cold or Drought Stress in Cassava</title><p>To date, only a few studies were reported concerning cold [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or drought [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] stress in cassava. Comparing our work with these studies, two major differences were found: (1) Different types of tissues were used, e.g., most previous studies used pooled samples, while our study used separate FL, FEL, and RT to profile the cold- and drought-responsive transcriptional variations, and revealed that the majority of DE genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns and only a small proportion of genes were commonly influenced. The results presented here are more beneficial and can be considered as a complement to the previously reported studies; (2) The treatment conditions were varied among the published articles. Previous studies applied one-step cold or drought treatment, e.g., temperature directly drop from 28 to 7 &#176;C [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for cold and air withering- [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or PEG6000- [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] simulated dehydration stress for drought. Differently, our study adopted a much more natural method of stress treatments: for cold, 5 days of 14 &#176;C was added to trigger the potential chilling acclimation before 4 &#176;C treatment; for drought, watering was stopped in rain-shed. Thus, the transcriptional changes of our study might be much closer to what happens to cassava in the field, and the cold and drought DE genes obtained here might be more suited for the genetic improvement of cold and drought tolerance in cassava.</p><p>Although they are of different characteristics, similar conclusions were observed among these studies. For examples, Utsumi et al. [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Fu et al. [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that genes related to the signaling pathways of ABA, which is a well-characterized hormone that plays important roles in expression regulation of abiotic stresses in plants, were involved in the drought stress response in cassava. Moreover, this conclusion was confirmed in our present study, supporting the proposal that cassava has similar mechanisms for drought stress response as other plants [<xref rid="B24-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. An et al. [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that the contents of two stress-responsive metabolites, malondialdehyde and proline, were significantly changed in response to cold stress in cassava. Similar phenotypes were observed when cassava was suffered to drought stress [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Correspondingly, the expression levels of ROS-scavenging genes (including dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) were significantly altered in cold and drought stress conditions [<xref rid="B29-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similar conclusions were observed in our study, although the expression patterns of a few genes (e.g., <italic>APX1</italic>) were different when compared with previous studies [<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which might be due to their different treatment conditions. It has been demonstrated that the expression levels of genes related to photosynthesis were significantly inhibited by either cold or drought stress [<xref rid="B26-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-18-02668" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, our study confirmed this result and further demonstrated that photosynthesis metabolism was greatly influenced by tetrapyrrole biosynthesis through the chlorophyll branch, specifically under cold condition.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provided a global overview of transcriptional changes of genes in response to both drought and cold stresses. These findings will improve our understanding of the specific and common responses to cold and drought in cassava, and can be considered as a useful complement to the previous studies which were performed only in cold or drought stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-18-02668"><title>4.
