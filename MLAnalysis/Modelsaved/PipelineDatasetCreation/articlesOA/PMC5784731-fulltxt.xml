The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread quickly throughout North America. Infection with PEDV causes watery diarrhea and up to 100% mortality in piglets, particularly for highly pathogenic non-InDel strains circulating in the US. PEDV is mainly transmitted by the fecal&#8211;oral route. Transmission via the venereal route has been suspected but not previously investigated. The aim of the study was to determine if PEDV could be detected in semen from infected specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars inoculated with a PEDV US non-InDel strain suggesting venereal transmission may occur. Two boars orally inoculated with PEDV showed clinical signs and virus shedding in feces. Transient presence of the PEDV genome was detected by RT-qPCR in the seminal (5.06&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>2</sup> to 2.44&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>3</sup>&#160;genomic copies/mL) and sperm-rich fraction of semen (5.64&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>2</sup> to 3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup>&#160;genomic copies/mL) and a longer duration of viral shedding was observed in the sperm-rich fraction.

The virus responsible for this disease is an <italic>alphacoronavirus</italic> known as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The PEDV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. An infection with PEDV in pigs leads to severe liquid diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. In suckling piglets population, PEDV causes high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In older animals, morbidity may approach 100%, but mortality remains low between 1 and 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Economic losses due to this virus are significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Currently, PEDV is present on the Asian, American and European continents. In 2013, 40&#160;years after the first cases of PED in Europe, the disease emerged in the United States (US), in the Midwestern state of Iowa, and ultimately affected the swine population of the entire country; until this date, the US had been free from PED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The virus spread rapidly causing a major impact on pig production including mortality of 10% of the total US swine production or approximately 7&#160;million piglets in less than 1&#160;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two genetically strains of PEDV have been identified in the USA, namely, the &#8220;non-InDel&#8221; strain, close to the aforementioned Asian strains, and the &#8220;InDel&#8221; strain, showing insertion-deletion in the S1 part of the S gene. Currently, PEDV is endemic in the US with periodic waves of infection occurring mostly during winter. The virus also spread to others countries in North and South America, such as Canada and Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Europe, PED cases associated with the InDel strains have been detected since 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Different PEDV transmission routes have been identified. The major mode of transmission is the fecal&#8211;oral route through direct or indirect contact with infected pigs or contaminated feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Transmission of PEDV also occurs through contact with contaminated equipment, contaminated vehicles used for animal transport, or farm employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Experimental studies have shown that airborne samples containing PEDV can be infectious for pigs so PEDV could be spread through aerosols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, PEDV has been transmitted vertically through contaminated milk from the sow to its piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PEDV transmission through semen has also been a concern due to a viremia that occurs during the acute phase of infection during which the virus may be recovered in blood and sexual organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Contamination of semen by PEDV during processing may also occur. A recent study demonstrated PEDV nucleic acid detection in infected boars&#8217; semen; however, the authors were not able to rule out external contamination by fecal material during collection and/or preparation of the semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The PEDV genome has also been detected in the semen of healthy boars from three different farms in China. The quantity of detected PEDV genome ranged from 10<sup>1.46</sup> to 10<sup>3.65</sup>&#160;genome copies/mL of semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is known that some viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Japanese B encephalitis virus (JBEV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are shed in semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, PEDV detection in and transmission via semen has not been previously studied in experimentally infected boars. Contamination of semen by different porcine viruses via contaminated feces or aerosols could be possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In France, non-InDel strains of PED are classified in the first category of regulated animal health hazards (Order Number: AGRG1410808A). In order to maintain the PEDV free status for non-InDel strains in France and in Europe, importing boars and boar semen from countries where non-InDel strains are endemic is strictly controlled. Therefore, it is important to know if PEDV can be shed in semen from infected boars in order to determine appropriate biosecurity measures necessary to prevent transmission of the virus. The objective of this study was to determine if PEDV can be shed in semen from specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars infected by a US non-InDel strain of PEDV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p id="Par21">The experiment was carried out in the air-filtered level 3 biosecurity facilities of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ANSES) in accordance with the European and French regulations on animal welfare. The protocol for this experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee registered under number #16 by the French Ministry of Research (Referral No.16-083). Four Large White specific pathogen free (SPF) boars were included in the experimental trial, with two inoculated boars housed in the same room (Room 1: boars F1 and F2). The room contained two separate pens with one boar in each. The two remaining boars C1 and C2 (two and a half years-old) used as negative controls were housed in the ANSES SPF herd. The two boars in room 1 F1and F2 (two and a half years-old and one and a half year-old respectively) were orally inoculated in the morning of day 0 with a 5&#160;mL homogenate of a non-InDel strain, PEDV/USA/2014/IOWA (GenBank Number: MF373643). The inoculum was prepared by homogenizing the jejunums (20% w/v) collected from PEDV infected pigs from a herd in the state of Iowa (USA) in 2014. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10&#160;000&#160;&#215;&#160;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45&#160;&#181;m filter. The complete genome of the PEDV/USA/2014/IOWA strain was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) according the protocol already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and no additional RNA viral sequences were identified. The absence of PCV2 and PRSSV in the inoculum was assessed by absence of seroconversion against PCV2 and PRSSV after inoculation. The inoculum contained 10<sup>8</sup>&#160;genomic copies/mL based on a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. The experiment lasted for 52&#160;days post-inoculation (dpi). Clinical signs (lethargy, outward appearance, behavior, breathing, and diarrhea) were recorded daily. A scoring system was used for the consistency of the feces (0: absence of feces, 1: normal, 2: semi-liquid without a formed consistency, and 3: liquid/watery contents). PEDV shedding was assessed in fecal samples collected daily from the inoculated boars the first week after infection, and then three times a week until 52&#160;dpi, using a RT-qPCR. Semen was collected before inoculation and every day during the first week post-infection and twice weekly thereafter. Serum was collected prior to inoculation and at 29&#160;dpi in order to evaluate seroconversion. All samples were stored at &#8211;80&#160;&#176;C. At 52&#160;dpi, on necropsy, the following tissue samples were collected and stored at &#8211;80&#160;&#176;C in RNA later tissue storage reagent (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA): duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, spleen, liver, mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, Peyer&#8217;s patches (jejunum and ileum), psoas muscle, lungs, vas deferens (right and left), testicles (right and left: apical pole, distal pole, median axis), epididymis (right and left: head, body, tail), prostate, Cowper&#8217;s glands (right and left), seminal vesicles (right and left: apical pole and distal pole) and spermatic cords (right and left).

So far, it has been reported that adults, such as boars and sows, show less severe clinical signs than new-born and weaned piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the study reported here, boars demonstrated similar clinical signs (diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia) compared to what has been described previously in PEDV-infected post-weaning pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The duration of virus shedding in boars&#8217; feces determined in our study (16 and 19&#160;days) was also close to values reported for weaned piglets infected with a non-InDel strain, i.e. 17&#160;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Based on our data from this report, we conclude that boars, irrespective of age, can also show similar clinical signs as young piglets in response to infection with a non-InDel PEDV strain that should not be considered systematically as subclinical in this age.</p><p id="Par37">To the best of our knowledge, the presence of PEDV RNA in semen has never been evaluated previously in experimentally inoculated boars, although sows infected by PEDV may demonstrate reproductive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. If sows can be infected by contaminated semen, these data suggested that the trade or dispersion of contaminated semen may lead to a risk of spreading the disease to breeding/gestation and farrowing farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Several publications emphasized the importance of monitoring semen because of to the large increase in the use of artificial insemination throughout the world. In fact, 90% of sows in Europe, North America and Latin American countries as well as 70% of sows in Thailand and in Taiwan are bred through artificial insemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Here, we showed the presence of PEDV RNA in the semen of infected specific pathogen-free boars inoculated with a non-InDel strain of PEDV as early as 0.5&#160;dpi. The swabs of the prepuce were negative for PEDV RNA at the same time PEDV nucleic acid was detected in semen. Therefore, it is unlikely that the semen was cross-contaminated with PEDV infected feces during collection of the boars. PEDV RNA was present in both fractions of semen although larger amounts of PEDV were more consistently detected in the sperm-rich fraction which contains sperm and non-sperm cells (spermatozoa, leucocytes, immature germ cells, etc.). In these sperm-rich fractions, the maximum PEDV genomic load reached 3.40&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup>&#160;genomic copies/mL for one boar and 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup>&#160;genomic copies/mL for the second one. Interestingly, viral excretion in the seminal fractions was transient. Viral shedding in the sperm-rich fraction could be due to viremia or due to irrigation of the genital tract by infected blood cells. Viral shedding in this fraction has already been reported for other porcine viruses such as PCV2 and PRRSV, the latter belonging to the same order, <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, as PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For PRRSV, there is currently no consensus among scientists regarding the mechanism of viral shedding in this fraction. One hypothesis is that the virus could be transported by non-sperm cells, such as mononuclear cells or granulocytes. Infected monocytes or macrophages could disseminate the virus through the bloodstream or via the lymph fluid in the genital tract and to semen, without viral replication in the reproductive tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Another hypothesis for the presence of PRRSV in the sperm-rich fraction is that the virus is directly associated with sperm cells. A previous study showed that PRRSV can infect spermatogenic epithelium and can also infect testicular germ cells of pigs and replicate in these cells. In addition, an association of this virus with macrophages was demonstrated, which is consistent with the previous hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Both hypotheses mentioned above can be put forward to explain the PEDV shedding in the sperm-rich fraction of infected boars demonstrated in our study. The virus may be associated with non-sperm cells and migrate in the genital tract and in semen, or may be associated with actual sperm cells. Regarding the results of our study, the second hypothesis seems less likely. Following necropsy, no PEDV RNA was found in genital tract tissues. However, RNA degradation during necropsy could not be excluded and would explain a lack of PEDV detection in these tissues. Unfortunately, semen samples were not collected the day of necropsy. These samples would possibly have been negative, consistent with the absence of PEDV RNA detected in sexual organs. We can also hypothesize that infection of genital tract tissues may depend on individual susceptibility with a high degree of variability between animals, and that the number of animals infected with PEDV in our study was too low (2) to consistently detect PEDV RNA in genital tract tissues. As a comparison, in the case of the PRRSV, the virus was found in reproductive organs for few infected boars: in the head of the epididymis (37.5% of boars), in the body of the epididymis (20% of boars), in the tail of the epididymis (12.5% of boars), in the testicles (2.5% of boars), in Cowper&#8217;s glands (7.5% of boars), in the seminal vesicles (5% of boars), and in the prostate for 12.5% of boars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The individual variability observed when detecting PRRSV in the reproductive tract is important for the virus pathogenesis and transmission suggesting that PEDV variable detection in reproductive tissues could explain the absence of detection in the two inoculated boars. On necropsy, PEDV RNA was only detected in lymphoid organs including the mesenteric lymph nodes and both jejunum and ileum Peyer&#8217;s patches. The presence of extraneous RNA from other viruses of the <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order was already highlighted in lymphoid organs. For example, PRRSV RNA was recovered in lymph nodes from 74.3% of infected boars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Lymphoid tissues contain a large panel of cell types such as innate immune response cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes or granulocytes) and cells of the adaptive immune response (B and T lymphocytes, primary and secondary lymphoid cells, etc.). We may postulate that PEDV might be associated with one of these cell types, similar to what has been described before for PRRSV and might migrate with these cells to the male genital tract. We can also hypothesize that PEDV replication could be possible in one of these cell types such as dendritic cells (DCs) for example. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated previously that viral replication in DCs is possible for other porcine viruses, including CSFV and PRRSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This includes the ability of the viruses to use these cells with high migratory capacity to be transported to various sites of the host body. Further studies should be performed to evaluate whether PEDV could use DCs or other cells of lymphoid tissues for replication and/or transportation to the boar genital tract.</p><p id="Par39">The quantity of PEDV genomic copies per milliliter of sperm-rich fraction described in our study was lower than the quantity of genomic copies per milliliter of sperm-rich fraction reported for other porcine viruses. The quantity of PEDV RNA in semen was 10&#8211;100 times lower than the quantity found in semen for PCV2 for example. The quantity of recovered PCV2 did not enable infection of the sow by artificial insemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As result, it could be debated whether artificial insemination could infect a sow considering the PEDV viral titers that were detected in boar semen in this experiment.</p><p id="Par40">We also noted that shedding of PEDV in semen was intermittent. We can make two hypotheses in this regard: the first is that viral shedding is truly intermittent, and the second is that viral shedding in semen is continuous but that the quantity of PEDV RNA is sometimes too low to be detected by RT-qPCR. Intermittent shedding of porcine viruses has already been shown for PCV2, CSF and PRRSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We also observed that shedding of PEDV in semen appeared before shedding in feces and prior to the onset of the clinical signs. This is consistent with the data reported for other porcine viruses, such as CSFV and Aujeszky&#8217;s disease virus, which showed viral excretion occurring in semen before the development of clinical signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, boars infected by PEDV may be detected after delivery of potentially infected semen. Consequently, specific control measures should be implemented for breeding pigs before semen or boars are imported. This may include the control of seroconversion and control of the absence of previous virus shedding in feces and reporting clinical signs. Implementing these types of measures is particularly important because we have demonstrated that PEDV RNA can be detected in semen even when the boars no longer shed virus in feces and do not show any clinical signs. It would also be beneficial to have more data regarding the prevalence of PEDV among boars used in boar studs.</p><p id="Par41">To conclude, we have demonstrated the shedding of a non-InDel US PEDV strain in the semen (sperm-rich fraction and seminal fraction) of inoculated boars. Further studies are required to determine if the PEDV detected by RT-qPCR in infected semen is potentially infectious. It could be possible to challenge weaned piglets with contaminated semen and observe whether these pigs shed PEDV. If the semen is infectious, it would be necessary to assess whether it can be transmitted by artificial insemination to sows, and evaluate any reproductive disorders.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ASFV</term><def><p id="Par2">African swine fever virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSFV</term><def><p id="Par3">classical swine fever virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dpi</term><def><p id="Par4">days post-inoculation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMDV</term><def><p id="Par5">foot and mouth disease virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JBEV</term><def><p id="Par6">Japanese B encephalitis virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NGS</term><def><p id="Par7">next-generation sequencing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="Par8">phosphate buffer saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p id="Par9">polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCV2</term><def><p id="Par10">porcine circovirus type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEDV</term><def><p id="Par11">porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PED</term><def><p id="Par12">porcine epidemic diarrhea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPV</term><def><p id="Par13">porcine parvovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRRSV</term><def><p id="Par14">porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RNA</term><def><p id="Par15">nucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-qPCR</term><def><p id="Par16">real-time reverse transcriptase PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S/P</term><def><p id="Par17">sample-to-positive</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p id="Par18">United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Authors&#8217; contributions</title><p id="Par42">NR, BG, SG, AM, GL, FP, NP, EA, LB, MB, PCG and VC designed and carried out the experiments.
