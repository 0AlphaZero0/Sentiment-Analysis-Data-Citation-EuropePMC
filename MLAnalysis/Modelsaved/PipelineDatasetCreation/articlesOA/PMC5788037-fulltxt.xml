Vessel normalization (VN) may resolve this paradox<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. VN involves increased pericyte coverage, improved tumour vessel perfusion, reduced vascular permeability, and consequently mitigated hypoxia<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. While these processes alter tumour progression, their regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells play a crucial role in VN. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene expression features related to VN correlate with immunostimulatory pathways, especially T lymphocyte (TL) infiltration/activities. To delineate the causal relationship, we employed various mouse models with VN or TL deficiencies. While VN disruption reduced TL infiltration as expected<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, reciprocal depletion or inactivation of CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs decreased VN, indicating a mutually-regulatory loop. Additionally, CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL activation by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) increased VN. IFN&#947;<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells are the major population associated with VN. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumours growing in immunodeficient animal hosts exhibited enhanced hypoxia compared to the original tumours in immunocompetent human hosts, which was reduced by adoptive Th1 transfer. Our findings elucidate an unexpected role of Th1 in vasculature and immune reprogramming. Th1 cells may be a marker and a determinant of both ICB and anti-angiogenesis efficacies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">To better understand angiogenesis, we examined angiogenesis-related genes in breast cancer using METABRIC database<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Among 377 genes, 30 positively and 27 negatively correlate with survival, and are defined as good- and poor-prognosis angiogenesis genes (GPAGs and PPAGs), respectively (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1a,b</xref>), which together stratify patients with different prognoses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Single metrics defined by (&#931;GPAGs &#931;PPAGs) or Principal Component Analysis are prognostic in multiple breast cancer datasets (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1c&#8211;f</xref>), suggesting that different aspects of angiogenesis may play opposing roles in tumour progression.</p><p id="P3">GPAGs are mostly related to heterotypic cell-cell adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2a,b</xref>). Pericytes and smooth muscle cells share gene expression programs and may be ontologically related<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Pericyte recruitment is often regulated by common pathways as pericyte proliferation, and is pivotal to VN<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Thus, GPAGs may reflect VN. In contrast, PPAGs are mostly related to extracellular matrix (ECM) disassembly and hypoxia (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2a,c</xref>), processes regulated by mechanisms opposite to VN<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The GPAG-VN connection is further tested in liver cancer. CD31<sup>+</sup> tumour-associated endothelial cells (TECs) or the matched CD31<sup>+</sup> normal endothelial cells (NECs) from the same patient were profiled (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Compared to NECs, TECs express decreased GPAGs and increased PPAGs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). In GSE20017, (&#931;GPAGs &#931;PPAGs) inversely correlates with &#8220;invasive vasculature&#8221; (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Thus, (&#931;GPAGs &#931;PPAGs) is a VN indicator.</p><p id="P5">In breast cancer, GPAGs correlate with immunostimulatory pathways (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), especially T Cell Receptor (TCR) signaling (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Similarly, in GSE51401, (&#931;GPAGs &#931;PPAGs) in TECs correlated with TCR signatures in non-TECs from the same tumours (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d,e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To investigate VN-TLs relationship, we examined mammary tumours in various host strains deficient of pericytes or TLs. We orthotopically transplanted E0771 murine tumour cells into mice expressing both NG2cre<sup>ERTM</sup> and cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (Peri<sup>Del</sup>). Upon tamoxifen and diphtheria toxin treatment, NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes were significantly reduced (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>), which decreases total infiltrating immune cells, consistent with previous findings<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. TLs exhibited a particularly dramatic decrease, whereas CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>&#8722;</sup>cells remained unchanged (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c,d</xref>), suggesting that VN preferentially promotes TL infiltration.</p><p id="P7">To investigate any reciprocal effects of TLs on VN, we transplanted E0771 cells into animals with CD4 knockout (CD4KO), CD8 knockout (CD8KO) and T-cell receptor knockout (TCRKO, lacking both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>-TLs). Tumours were removed at similar time points with similar sizes. Flow cytometry revealed significant effects of CD8KO on TEC frequency, and of CD4KO on TEC:pericyte ratio (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). TCRKO exhibited both phenomena, suggesting that vascular proliferation and VN are distinct processes. Immunofluorescence staining of pericytes and TECs validated these conclusions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). E0771 tumours growing in CD4KO or TCRKO mice, but not in CD8KO mice, exhibited increased vessel permeability (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), consistent with pericyte deficiency. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) were increased in all three models including CD8KO (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting permeability-independent, CD8-specific mechanisms, including 1) increased intravasation due to elevated vascular frequency (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and 2) increased CTC survival due to loss of cytotoxic TLs. Pulmonary metastases correlated with CTC frequencies, and were increased in all three models. The effects of CD4KO and CD8KO on metastases were additive, as TCRKO mice had the highest metastatic burden (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We further validated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL-mediated VN effects in other models with varying baseline CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL frequencies. CD4KO in 4T1 tumour-bearing mice led to decreased pericyte coverage and alterations related to VN disruption, including enhanced hypoxia, increased dextran leakage, and reduced lectin perfusion (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure. 3a&#8211;g</xref>). We also employed &#945;CD4 antibodies to deplete CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs. This can be administered in an acute manner (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3h</xref>) to delineate roles of CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs in different metastasis stages. A regimen that restricts &#945;CD4 effects to orthotopic tumours reduced later metastasis formation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3i&#8211;k</xref>), supporting that anti-metastasis functions of CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs begin in orthotopic tumours. Another model, AT3, has a lower baseline TL infiltration (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3l</xref>). CD4KO resulted in reduced pericyte coverage and enhanced hypoxia (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3m,n</xref>). However, dextran leakage and lectin perfusion efficiency were not altered (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3o,p</xref>), which may be because of the already-low CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL level. Similarly, T11 and T1 are two additional models from a collection of p53-null tumour lines<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, with high and low baseline CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL infiltration, respectively (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3q</xref>). CD4KO significantly increased hypoxia in T11, but did not affect the already-high hypoxia level in T1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3r</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To ask if CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs also regulate VN in normal tissues, we examined mammary glands and lungs of tumour-free mice. There was no difference in vascular structures between wild type and CD4KO mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Wounded tissues trended toward lower pericyte coverage in CD4KO mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Since tumour microenvironment may resemble wound-healing<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, the VN effects of CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs may have initially evolved to cope with wound-healing.</p><p id="P10">We asked if CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL activation is required for VN. We conditionally knocked out class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) by combining Tie2cre and H2Ab<sup>floxP/floxP</sup> (M-II<sup>KO</sup>). Because Tie2 is required for post-natal hematopoiesis, MHC-II was deleted in professional antigen-presentation cells, but not in thymus, leaving positive selection intact (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a&#8211;e</xref>). Although 5&#8211;10% of pericytes and &lt; 1% of TECs also express MHC-II, they only account for 0.1% of all MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells and are unlikely to influence the immune microenvironment (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5f,g</xref>). This conditional knockout reduced activated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs, decreased ratio between effector memory and na&#239;ve cells, but did not alter total CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL numbers (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5h&#8211;j</xref>). Moreover, among CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL subsets, only IFN&#947;<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells were substantially decreased (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5k</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Tumours in M-II<sup>KO</sup> mice phenocopied those in CD4KO or Peri<sup>Del</sup> mice with decreased pericyte coverage (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>), increased vascular leakiness (dextran and Evans Blue assays, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b,c</xref>), decreased lectin perfusion (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d</xref>), increased hypoxia (nuclear HIF1&#945;- and pimonidazole-staining, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6e,f</xref>), and decreased infiltration of immune cells except for neutrophils, which were increased (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To study molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA-seq on TECs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>), the central cell type that integrates signals from TLs, pericytes and cancer cells in this vasculature remodeling process. Indeed, CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL deficiency caused transcriptomic alterations to TECs, including reduced immune response genes, lower GPAGs, higher PPAGs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b&#8211;d</xref>). It also changed pathways/genes known to regulate vessel normalization<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, including increased <italic>Vegfa</italic>, decreased <italic>Angpt1</italic>/<italic>Angpt2</italic>, and decreased adhesion and ECM molecules (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7e&#8211;h</xref>). Col-IV staining revealed discontinuous TEC ECM in CD4KO mice (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Videos</xref>). We also examined Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its precursors, ruling out a role of S1P pathway in CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL-mediated VN (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7i,j</xref>). Thus, CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs regulate multiple VN-related pathways in TECs.</p><p id="P13">To ask if activated TLs co-localize with TECs, we adoptively transferred stimulated tdRFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL and tdRFP<sup>+</sup>;CFSE<sup>+</sup> na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs into tumour-bearing TCRKO mice (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). Compared to na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs (tdRFP<sup>+</sup>;CFSE<sup>+</sup>), stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs (tdRFP<sup>+</sup>;CFSE<sup>&#8722;</sup>) were more frequent in tumours (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>), and predominantly co-localized with lectin<sup>+</sup> vessels (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c,d</xref>), suggesting direct crosstalk between stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs and TECs.</p><p id="P14">We reasoned that immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) should be immunostimulatory and thereby enhance VN. We used CD8KO mice to separate CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs from CD8<sup>+</sup>-TL-mediated cytotoxicity. Interestingly, even without CD8<sup>+</sup> TLs, combinatory inhibition of PD1 and CTLA4, two clinically relevant ICB targets<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, significantly delayed orthotopic E0771 tumour growth. In size-matched tumours, ICB led to increased pericyte coverage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), and decreased pulmonary metastasis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Besides tumour size-matched experiments, we performed time-matched experiments (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a,b</xref>) to understand how a certain duration of ICB alters tumour microenvironment. While total immune cell number appeared unaffected (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs increased (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>), accompanied by other alterations, including increased dendritic cells and decreased neutrophils (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9e,f</xref>). Among CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs, the percentage of regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs (Tregs) decreased, and the effector memory/na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL ratio increased (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9g,h</xref>). Intracellular cytokine staining uncovered Th1 as the major population increased by ICB (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9i,j</xref>), accompanied by other VN hallmarks (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d&#8211;g</xref>), indicating Th1-mediated VN.</p><p id="P16">Our data suggest a positive feedback loop between Th1 and VN. Disruption of VN via pericyte depletion decreased TL infiltration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Reciprocally, CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL knockout/inactivation reduced VN (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>), whereas activation improved VN (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

To test the role of pericytes in this loop, we transferred CD45.1<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells into CD45.2<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>). This procedure improved pericyte coverage (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>), and increased infiltration of host CD45.2<sup>+</sup> immune cells including CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs, macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10e,f</xref>). Neutrophils exhibited an opposite trend (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10g</xref>), similar to previous experiments (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5l</xref>, <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9e,f</xref>). Pericyte depletion attenuated these effects (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10e,f</xref>), confirming the role of pericytes (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10h</xref>).</p><p id="P17">PDX models provide an opportunity to establish the causal role of Th1 in VN for human tumours, because tumours were transferred from immunocompetent (original patients) to immunodeficient (animals) environment. We analyzed gene expression profiles of PDX-original tumour pairs of multiple cancer types. GPAGs and PPAGs were not comparable due to inter-species differences. Mouse stroma cell genes could not be captured by human microarray platforms, or were removed when aligned to human genomes in RNA-seq analyses. However, hypoxia-related signatures in human cells can reflect VN, which were indeed enriched in PDX tumours as compared to the matched or un-matched human tumours (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). We first used human MDA-MB-231 tumours for Th1 adoptive transfer. Tumours with Th1 transfer had higher expression of IFN&#947; (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), confirming successful infiltration. Th1 induced VN, as indicated by decreased hypoxia and vessel leakiness, pruning of large/dilated vessels, and improved perfusion efficiency (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d&#8211;g</xref>).

We also applied this strategy to nine PDX models, seven of which responded to Th1 transfer with reduced hypoxia. The two non-responders expressed VEGF signatures at a lower baseline level, and correspondingly displayed a low starting level of pimonidazole (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>), suggesting that the lack of response is due to initially-low VEGF signaling/hypoxia.</p><p id="P18">Finally, we asked if CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL-VN connection can be generalized to other cancer types. In TCGA we analyzed nine solid tumour types. In seven, estimated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL infiltration (CIBERSORT<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>) and hypoxia inversely correlated. In eight, CD4<sup>+</sup>-TL infiltration and (&#931;GPAGs &#931;PPAGs) positively correlated (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Although TLs have previously been linked to angiogenesis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, their impact on VN has not been appreciated. Therefore, our finding adds to the growing list of TL functions. Multiple lines of evidence support that stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup>-TLs, especially Th1, likely mediate VN by localizing to the vicinity of TECs, changing the cytokine environment, and subsequently affecting pericyte recruitment/attachment. VN, in turn, alters the immune landscape by recruiting TLs and decreasing neutrophils. At a molecular level, this mutually-regulatory loop is orchestrated in part by IFN&#947; and CD40L, via their effects on multiple downstream pathways. Our results argue that ICB efficacies may be achieved partially through Th1-mediated VN. A recent finding demonstrated that IFN&#947; signaling is essential for therapeutic responses to ICB therapies<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Anti-angiogenesis therapies have also been extensively tested in the clinic<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The clinical outcomes of these therapies may partially depend on their effects on VN and the consequent reprogramming of immune microenvironment. It is conceivable, for instance, that improving VN will increase immune cell infiltration and enhance the efficacies of immunotherapies such as anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 treatments. Thus, combinatory interventions that simultaneously perturb both processes may present promising strategies for potential synergy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p id="P20">E0771 cells (CH3 Biosystems) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, supplemented with 10 mmol&#183;L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> HEPES (Gibco)), 4T1 cells (Michigan Cancer Foundation), AT3 cells (gift of Dr. Scott I.
