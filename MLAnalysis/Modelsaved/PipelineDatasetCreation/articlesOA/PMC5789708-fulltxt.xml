Highly prolific breeds of domestic sheep are valuable genetic resources for the global sheep industry. Two important fertility traits, the ovulation rate and litter size, are of high economic value in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For thousands of years, animals with good fertility have been favoured in the domestication process. Modern animal breeding and quantitative genetic studies have shown that traditional selective breeding for traits has been slow, with low genetic gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The low heritability and high individual variation of fertility traits have been crucial limitations to improving the reproductive performance of breeds, and typically the traits have been improved through crossbreeding with a prolific breed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These limitations of traditional selection methods, which are mainly based on phenotypic characteristics, have led to a growing interest in the identification and characterization of genes and genomic regions that regulate these economically important traits.</p><p id="Par5">During reproductive processes, ovulation and follicle numbers are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis) and involve sequential waves of endocrine events, including changes in progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nutrition is one of the most important environmental factors affecting reproductive performance in sheep. Flushing, the practice of increasing nutrient intake and body condition prior to and during breeding, has been shown to affect the ovulation rate and, therefore, the lambing rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the genetics and physiological mechanisms that underlie this effect have not been well elucidated. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of how nutrition affects folliculogenesis and the ovulation rate is essential for facilitating targeted nutrition and improving overall sheep fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Earlier studies have indicated that fertility traits in sheep can be regulated by individual genetic markers with major effects, which are known as fecundity genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or by polygenic effects, particularly in prolific breeds, such as Finnsheep and Romanov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A number of mutations in major functional genes, such as <italic>GDF9</italic>, <italic>BMP15</italic>, <italic>BMPR1B</italic> and <italic>B4GALNT2</italic>, control ovulation rate and litter size in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recently, transcriptomic analyses via RNA-seq and microarray analysis of different sheep reproductive organs have provided further insights into the gene expression landscapes of these tissues, and a few novel genes (e.g., <italic>PTGS2</italic>, <italic>STAR</italic>, <italic>UCP2</italic>, <italic>IL1A</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic>) have been found to be associated with prolificacy in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, none of the earlier studies have involved cross-bred ewes, an excellent model for understanding the heritability of important genes.</p><p id="Par7">In the present study, we applied modern genomic methods to identify and characterize genetic markers, candidate genes and pathways associated with reproductive traits. The selection of tissue samples and the underlying computational methods used were based on our pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We sequenced both the mRNA and miRNA from biopsied ovarian tissues from two sheep breeds, Finnsheep and Texel, and their F1 crosses. Finnsheep, a prolific native breed, have an average litter size of 2.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], whereas Texel sheep have an average litter size of 1.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finnsheep have been used in crossbreeding with local breeds in many counties for decades to improve the prolificacy of these local breeds. The F1 cross was included into the study to investigate the transmission of the prolificacy phenotype into F1 generation. A total of 39 mRNA libraries representing 31 ewes were sequenced. An integrated analytic approach combining mRNA and miRNA sequencing data was used to investigate the gene expression patterns in the sheep ovaries. The effects of diet on the global ovarian mRNA and miRNA profiles was also investigated by maintaining approximately half of the ewes from each breed group on a flushing diet and the other half on a normal diet. The gene expression profiles of pure breeds were compared by using the subset of control diet ewes. Network analysis of the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs was also implemented to reveal the gene ontology terms and pathways associated with developmental changes and reproduction in sheep. This study elucidates the gene expression landscape in the ovaries and the factors affecting reproductive efficiency in sheep.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pedigree verification, feeding experiments and phenotypic observations</title><p id="Par8">The aim of the present study was to investigate possible differences in the ovarian transcriptomes of two breeds and their F1 crosses. The animals were selected on the basis of their pedigree records. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based results for the genetic relationships between individuals confirmed the ancestries of the groups derived prior to the feeding experiment on the basis of the pedigree records. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot based on IBS scores from SNP genotype data indicated three clearly different, non-overlapping clusters (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1A), and F1 cross individuals were located between Finnsheep and Texel.</p><p id="Par9">Ewes in the experiment were mature, with an average age and weight of 4.25&#160;years and 71.2&#160;kg, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). On average, the Finnsheep ewes had a larger litter size of 2.7, and Texel had the lower litter size of 1.8, whereas their F1 crosses had litter sizes intermediate between those of the two breeds, with an average litter size of 2.4. Most of the ewes were in good body condition at the start of the flushing period, with an average body condition score (BCS) of 3.0. Any potential confounding effects of age, weight or BCS at the start of the trial were eliminated by allocating the animals between the two treatment groups (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S2 and S3). The feeds used in the experiment consisted of hay, minerals, oats and rapeseed meal (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). A statistically significant flushing effect was detected for BCS (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3), although the average rise in BCS was only 0.26 within six weeks. This increase was small, given the expected rise of 1 BCS unit within six weeks in thin animals grazing on good pasture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The BCS of the animals that did not receive the flushing diet remained constant during the trial. The low levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; &lt;0.4&#160;mmol/l) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (&#946;-HB; &lt;0.5&#160;mmol/l) indicated that the animals were not mobilizing body reserves during the trial. Flushing elevated blood urea concentrations in the flushing group (5.25&#160;mmol/l) compared with the non-flushing group (4.37&#160;mmol/l), most probably because of the rapeseed meal included in the flushing diet (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>mRNA expression in ovaries</title><p id="Par10">The overall quality of the mRNA-seq reads was very good, with average quality scores &gt;&#8201;28. After removal of the low-quality reads and universal Illumina adapters present in approximately 5% of the data, an average of 114.5 million reads per sample (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4) were used for further analyses. The percentage of reads from each sample that mapped to the ovine reference genome ranged from 64.7% to 84.5%.</p><p id="Par11">Altogether, 16,402 genes (baseMean &#8805;5) were expressed in the samples, which represented 60.6% of the known (27,054) ovine genes. Moreover, breed-specific expression revealed that the largest number of genes were expressed in F1 crosses (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;17,345), followed by Finnsheep (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;16,079) and Texel (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;16,039). Unlike SNP-based grouping (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1A), initial clustering of highly expressed genes from all samples did not reveal breed- or diet-specific groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1B), thus suggesting little gene expression variance within and between groups. This conclusion was further illustrated by the observation that among the top 500 most expressed genes, 446 were common to all three groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). The top 20 Ensembl IDs with the highest variance across samples included known sheep genes, such as <italic>CA5A</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG000000012206</italic>), <italic>TRH</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG00000001309</italic>), <italic>TFF2</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG000000010688</italic>), <italic>IL1RL1</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG00000013111</italic>), <italic>SPP1</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG0000002590</italic>), <italic>OXT</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG00000004595</italic>), <italic>KIAA1324</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG0000009083</italic>) and <italic>SERPINA5</italic> (<italic>ENSOARG00000015144</italic>) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As shown in the Venn diagram, cross-bred ewes were genetically closer to Finnsheep (25 shared genes) than Texel (15 shared genes). However, only 12 of the 500 top expressed genes were shared by Finnsheep and Texel ewes. We believe the more similar behaviour of F1 ewes to Finnsheep may be associated with epigenetic inheritance of both paternally and maternally expressed imprinted genes in the ovaries. Moreover, because the ovary biopsies including follicular and connective tissues were used for RNA extraction, the heterogeneity of the tissue itself might have affected the overall gene expression dynamics. Thus, future experiments using methods such as manual microdissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] may provide a clearer picture of the different cell types.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Heatmap plot of the top 20 genes with the highest genetic variance across all samples.

The top ten most expressed genes were <italic>ND1</italic>, <italic>ND2</italic>, <italic>ND4</italic>, <italic>ND5</italic>, <italic>COX1</italic>, <italic>COX2</italic>, <italic>COIII</italic>, <italic>CYTB</italic>, <italic>ATP6</italic> and <italic>ENSOARG00000006149</italic>, which represented approximately 12% of the total clean reads. Interestingly, the top nine genes expressed in ovarian samples belonged to the mitochondrial genome, and a BLAST search against the non-redundant (NR) database showed that the protein sequence of <italic>ENSOARG00000006149</italic> was 100% identical to elongation factor 1-alpha 1 (<italic>EEF1A1</italic>) from mammals (including human, mouse and cattle). The sheep mitochondrial genome (16,616&#160;bps) consists of 13 coding genes and 24 non-coding genes. All 13 coding genes were expressed together with 9 non-coding genes (2 rRNAs and 7 tRNAs). Moreover, the expressed mitochondrial transcriptome represented approximately 14% (total base mean: 4,380,733) of the expressed ovarian transcriptome (total base mean: 31,729,678). Overall, mitochondrial genes were expressed significantly more highly than nuclear genes. Previous studies have identified mitochondrial differences in various human tissues, in which the mitochondrial transcriptome abundance is directly proportional to the energy requirements of the given tissue. The mitochondrial transcripts in the heart have been shown to compose ~30% of the total mRNA, whereas adrenal, ovary, thyroid, prostate, testes and lung tissues make up only ~5% of the mitochondrial transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The elevated amounts of mitochondrial transcripts in sheep ovaries revealed that the expression of mitochondrial transcripts varies among not only tissues but also species. Our results further implied that sheep ovaries are a high-energy demand tissue compared with those of mono-ovulatory species, such as humans.</p><p id="Par13">We observed that one or more mRNA libraries prepared from the same ovary resulted in variations in the amount of RNA and the level of gene expression, whereas the libraries prepared from the same RNA sample (i.e., mRNA derived from the same tube of RNA sample) were identical. Therefore, we considered the replicates derived from the same mRNA sample as being true replicates and those from different mRNA extracts but from the same ovary as being biological replicates, which were used for conducting differential expression analyses. There were 12 different classification categories, including within-breed effect of diet, differences between breeds with diet as a secondary factor, comparisons to identify genes associated with the flushing diet and differences between breed groups without considering the effect of diet, as detailed below. On the basis of the differential expression analyses, we compiled a list of potential candidate genes (see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> below).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>List of 20 candidate genes based on differential expression analysis.

Similarly, 25 genes (4 upregulated in the flushing group) were differentially expressed between the two F1 crosses fed a different diet. The majority of genes were upregulated in Texel because of the effect of the flushing diet. However, most of the DEGs were downregulated in the flushing group of F1 crosses. In general, the flushing diet had a profound effect in Texel, as shown by the comparatively higher number of DEGs in comparisons both within and between breeds. Additionally, Finnsheep were the least responsive to diet. The minor effect of the flushing diet on the litter size of Finnsheep ewes has also been previously reported in a feeding experiment<sup>9</sup>.</p><p id="Par15">In comparisons between breed groups with the introduction of diet as a second factor, highest number of genes were differentially expressed between Texel and F1 crosses (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

Notably, the <italic>CST6</italic> gene was also differentially expressed in the diet comparisons. This gene is involved in processes such as anatomical structure morphogenesis, epidermis development and negative regulation of endopeptidase activity. Previous studies have indicated its role in the differentiation process of the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Owing to the inhibitory role of the gene, the lower level of <italic>CST6</italic> expression most probably promotes ovulation. Whereas <italic>CST6</italic> expression was downregulated in Finnsheep and the F1 crosses compared with Texel, the flushing diet appeared to minimize the expression of this gene in Texel, because it was downregulated in the Texel group receiving the flushing diet (within breed diet comparisons).

Both <italic>CST6</italic> and <italic>MEPE</italic> were downregulated in Finnsheep and upregulated in Texel. One explanation for the differential expression of these genes might be that the higher level of cell differentiation promoted by these genes may be associated with greater follicle numbers. Similarly, the differential expression pattern may also be associated with the difference in the progression of the follicular phase of the oestrus cycle. Thus, the follicular growth phase might progress faster in Finnsheep than in Texel because cellular differentiation occurs only after proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>GO and KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes</title><p id="Par19">From the list of 600 genes differentially expressed genes between Finnsheep and Texel receiving the flushing diet, 435 genes were associated with 220 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which were further clustered into 36 GO groups on the basis of a Kappa score threshold of 0.4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

Our analysis of the RNA-seq data from two globally important breeds with contrasting fertility traits revealed important features regarding the ovarian transcriptome landscape. Our results indicated that important markers (such as SNPs that contribute to the V371&#160;M mutation in <italic>GDF9</italic>) can be easily inherited over generations, thus increasing the commercial value of these genetic markers and the Finnsheep breed itself. Our findings provide strong insights into the importance of the flushing diet to increase sheep reproduction, particularly in breeds with low reproductive traits. We found that Texel, a breed with a comparatively smaller litter size, was genetically responsive to the flushing diet, whereas Finnsheep were non-responsive on the basis of the absence of DEGs between flushing versus the control diet (within-breed). Unexpectedly, whereas the genotypes place the F1 crosses as a true hybrid of Finnsheep and Texel, gene expression patterns revealed that the F1 crosses were more similar to Finnsheep. The three differentially expressed genes between Finnsheep and Texel receiving the control diet may be candidate genes for prolificacy. Moreover, the most highly expressed genes were dominated by mitochondrial genes, thus illustrating that the ovaries are organs with a high energy demand in multiparous species. We identified a cluster of 51 miRNAs on chromosome 18, and a follow-up analysis of other reproductive tissues was required to characterize whether such clusters were tissue-specific. The identification and characterization of miRNAs that are differentially expressed between pure breeds should facilitate understanding of the regulatory roles of miRNAs during folliculogenesis in these breeds. Additionally, the novel miRNAs should enrich the relatively scarce resources available for sheep miRNAs. Future research investigating the roles of other important reproductive tissues, such as endometrium and <italic>corpus luteum</italic> from the same individuals but at different stages of the oestrous cycle, will allow elucidation of the roles of tissue-specific gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Animals and the feeding experiment</title><p id="Par33">The feeding experiment was performed at Pusa farm in Urjala, Finland.

Thus, the biopsies included the remaining ovary tissue, which was not homogenous. CLs were collected separately from the remaining ovaries of the same ewes after establishment of pregnancy (data not shown). Ovaries were cut into a number of sections (20&#8211;30&#160;mg) in RNAlater and stored in RNAlater reagent (Ambion/Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions, before tissues were transported to the laboratory. Tissue samples were stored at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C until extraction. Total RNA, including small RNAs, was extracted using an RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the RNA extraction details). The RNA concentration and RNA integrity number (RIN) were measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, and genomic DNA was extracted for SNP genotyping using the standard phenol-chloroform method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ovine HD BeadChip SNP genotyping</title><p id="Par36">The animals were divided into experimental groups on the basis of their pedigree records (purebred Finnsheep and Texel and their F1 crossbreds). To obtain an overview of the genetic relatedness of the animals and to assure the breed status, the samples were genotyped using Illumina Ovine 700&#160;K SNP BeadChips (Illumina, USA). Genotyping was conducted at the Finnish Institute of Molecular Medicine (FIMM), Helsinki, Finland. All genotypes were called using GenomeStudio software v2011.1, and SNPs that failed to meet any of the following criteria were discarded: (1) low success rate (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3760); (2) low intensity (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2126); (4) uncertain clustering (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4635) and (5) too many clusters (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;3571). Altogether, 606,006 SNPs that passed the initial quality control (QC) assessments were used to calculate the pairwise identity by distance (IBS) of 31 samples that were used for RNA-seq with Plink v1.90b3v [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>RNA library preparation and sequencing</title><p id="Par37">Library preparations and sequencing were performed at FIMM. RNA libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Acess library kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to the Illumina TruSeq&#174; Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide (part #15031047). Unique Illumina TruSeq indexing adapters were ligated to each sample during the adapter ligation step, and subsequently several samples were pooled in one flow cell lane. The high quality of the libraries was confirmed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), and the concentrations of the libraries were quantified via Quibit&#174; fluorometric quantitation (Life Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only high-quality libraries were sequenced. The samples were normalized and pooled for automated cluster preparation, which was conducted with an Illumina cBot station. The samples were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument with TruSeq v4 sequencing chemistry. Paired-end sequencing with a 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;100-bp read length was used for mRNA and single-end sequencing with 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;50-bp read length for the miRNAs. Additional mRNA and miRNA libraries for one of the samples from the Finnsheep flushing, Texel flushing and F1 flushing groups were sequenced. Additionally, one of the mRNA libraries from the F1 control group was sequenced three times. Hence, altogether, we obtained sequence data for 39 mRNA-seq and 37 miRNA-seq samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Processing of the sequencing data</title><p id="Par38">The overall quality of mRNA- and miRNA-seq reads was inspected using the FastQC tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>).

In addition, low-quality reads and reads shorter than 20&#160;bp were discarded from the raw mRNA-seq reads. Similarly, from the miRNA-seq data, reads with lengths ranging from 16 to 26&#160;nt were selected for downstream analyses. Trimmed reads were reassessed to ensure that the data were free from noise.</p><p id="Par39">Clean raw reads from both mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq data were mapped against the ovine reference genome (Oarv3.1) and Ensembl (Ensembl release 76) annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. mRNA-seq reads were mapped using the Tophat2 v. 2.0.14 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], whereas the Bowtie v. 1.1.1 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] was used to map miRNA sequences against the ovine reference genome. MiRDeep2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] was used to identify known miRNAs and to predict novel miRNAs.

In addition, to obtain an overview of genetic differences between pure breeds, we performed differential gene expression analyses on the subset of the controlled diet group. DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] was used to test DEGs and miRNAs within and between breeds for 12 different comparisons. The ovine transcriptome was downloaded from the Ensembl database, and all of the bam files that originally mapped to the ovine reference genome were queried against the transcriptome to count the reads belonging to exonic regions. The Python-based software htseq-count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] was used to produce counts from the aligned reads. Adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.05 and 0.10 were used to generate the list of significant DEGs and miRNAs, respectively. Because predicted novel miRNAs have only genomic coordinates and can differ among samples, comparing a large number of samples would be difficult. However, a true novel miRNA is often detected in multiple samples. We implemented a strategy to merge a commonly detected novel miRNA across samples if their start/end coordinates overlapped by at least 80%. A new genomic coordinate would be created for these miRNAs by using the outermost coordinate. We observed that the most commonly detected miRNAs had the same or very similar coordinates, thus providing further verification of a true novel miRNA. We used this approach as implemented in the CAP-miRSEQ pipeline, and all novel miRNAs and their corresponding genome coordinates were listed in a table. All DEGs were used for GO annotations and KEGG pathway analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Prediction of miRNA target genes</title><p id="Par41">TargetscanHuman release 7.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] was used to retrieve all gene targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. The resulting target genes belonged to the human genome, and we were interested only in DEGs. Thus, human orthologues of all DEGs for a given comparison were retrieved using the bioconductor package in BioMart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

Protein binding was the most common GO term amongst all known sheep genes and DEGs. Both the GO annotations and KEGG pathways were analysed in Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] using the ClueGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] plugin. We set the initial criteria of at least five genes and 5% of genes to be present in the list of DEGs for identifying GO terms. Similarly, KEGG pathways representing at least four DEGs and 4% of the given pathway were retrieved. GO terms covering five different levels (levels 3&#8211;8) were grouped on the basis of similar associated genes with a Kappa score threshold of 0.4. GO terms and pathways for genes that were differentially expressed in two (Finnsheep vs. Texel with the flushing diet and Texel vs. F1 crosses with the flushing diet) of the 12 comparisons were identified. We noticed that many sheep genes were missing annotations from the ClueGO source files available for sheep. Therefore, all of the DEGs were grouped, and the unique Ensembl IDs were selected to determine the number of genes that lacked annotations. All genes without annotations available in the ClueGO source files were queried using the Ensembl BioMart server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] to retrieve three additional features: Entrez ID, transcript ID and protein ID. The ClueGO source files were manually updated by adding those features. With that approach, comparatively high numbers of genes were annotated. ClueGO allows users to define certain thresholds and configurations to identify significant ontologies and pathways. Similar GO terms and pathways were grouped together using a Kappa score threshold of 0.4. A right-side hypergeometric test with a Bonferroni step-down correction method was used to identify significant terms and pathways. A minimum of three and a maximum of eight GO levels were included in our analysis. To be considered as an enriched term or pathway, at least one gene and at least 5% of genes should be expressed.</p><p id="Par43">Novel miRNAs with baseMean (mean expression between all samples, as explained in the DESeq2 bioconductor package)&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;10 were annotated using a BLAST search against the human and cattle sequence database.

The average depth coverage for each sample was calculated using bedtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and the mean of the average depth coverage for all samples was used for filtration. In addition, SNPs within 3&#160;bp and indels and clusters of indels separated by &#8804;5&#160;bp were removed. The resulting SNPs were annotated using the standalone Ensembl VEP tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. VEP predicts the consequence of variants on genomic regions and the locations of the variants. The VCF file consisting of the SNPs for all samples was used for the annotation against the ovine genome.
