alternatives to antibiotics a compelling need. Bacteriophage (Phage) lysins are enzymes that hydrolyze the cell wall of bacteria and represent a promising alternative to tackle this ever-increasing problem. Despite their use is believed to be restricted to Gram-positive bacteria, recent findings have shown that they can also be used against Gram-negative bacteria. By using a phage genome-based screening approach, we identified and characterized a novel lysin, PlyE146, encoded by an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> prophage and with a predicted molecular mass of ca. 17 kDa. PlyE146 is composed of a C-terminal cationic peptide and a N-terminal N-acetylmuramidase domain. Histidine-tagged PlyE146 was overexpressed from a plasmid in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> NZ9000 and purified by NI-NTA chromatography. PlyE146 exhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> optimal bactericidal activity against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K12 (3.6 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL decrease) after 2 h of incubation at 37&#176;C at a concentration of 400 &#956;g/mL in the absence of NaCl and at pH 6.0. Under these conditions, PlyE146 displayed antimicrobial activity towards several other <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (3 to 3.8-log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL decrease) and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (4.9 to &gt;5-log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL decrease) strains. Therefore, PlyE146 represents a promising therapeutic agent against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> infections. However, further studies are required to improve the efficacy of PlyE146 under physiological conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>SNSF</institution></funding-source><award-id>310030-125325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1046-088X</contrib-id><name><surname>Entenza</surname><given-names>Jos&#233; Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 310030-125325).

This phenomenon is particularly alarming in Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, which are responsible for a broad spectrum of infections that could become untreatable [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The rise of these MDR bacteria and the shortage of novel antibiotics warrants the search and the development of new alternative antibacterial agents [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Bacteriophage lysins, namely phage-encoded enzymes that hydrolyze the cell wall peptidoglycan of phage-infected bacteria for progeny release [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], represent a very promising novel alternative class of antimicrobial agents. In fact lysins, which generally have a broader spectrum activity than the producing phage, can ideally be exploited to eliminate specific bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other advantages offered by lysins are the rapidity of action, high efficiency and the low chance to develop bacterial resistance since they target peptidoglycan components that are essential for bacterial viability [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A possible drawback of lysin therapy could be the generation of neutralizing antibodies, as they are exogenous proteins. However, several studies have shown that antibodies specific for lysins do not block their activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and anaphylaxis was not observed in mice after repeated administration, implying that they can be utilized more than once [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The use of lysins as potential therapeutic agents has been widely investigated against Gram-positive bacteria, where when externally applied can induce rapid bacterial lysis due to the direct accessibility to the peptidoglycan [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By contrast, Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane which protects the peptidoglycan from hydrolysis by phage lysins when applied from outside [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Consistent to this notion, only a few lysins with intrinsic antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria have been reported so far [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As an example, using a phage genome-based analysis Lai et al. have identified two lysins (A1S-1600 and A1S-2016) which were active against several <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using the same approach, Lood et al. have more recently identified a lysin, namely PlyF307, which efficiently killed <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Of remark, PlyF307 is composed of an N-terminal N-acetylmuramidase (lysozyme) domain [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and a highly positively charged C-terminal domain, suggesting that penetration through the outer membrane and subsequent hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan substrate from the lysins may be mediated by cationic peptides. This concept was supported by the observation that just the cationic peptides retained substantial antimicrobial activity towards <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent to this notion, recent studies have shown that lysins can be engineered to become active against Gram-negative bacteria by fusing the N- or C- terminus with cationic peptides [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, reports of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria remain limited and mostly focus on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>In an attempt to identify novel lysins naturally active against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the C-terminal cationic peptide of PlyF307, alias P307, was used as a query to search for translated proteins sequences with similar properties in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> genomes deposited in the NCBI database. In this study, a novel <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> phage lysin, namely PlyE146, was identified and its antimicrobial activity against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was evaluated. PlyE146 was shown to efficiently kill in vitro several strains of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192507.t001">Table 1</xref>.

Due to the shortage of novel antibiotics, innovative strategies must be developed. Lysins are phage-related enzymes that hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan and therefore represent an attractive option to tackle this issue. However, due to the presence of the outer membrane that hinders the access of the lysins to the peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria, lysins have been for long time considered useful only against Gram-positive bacteria. Notwithstanding, recent works have shown that lysins (natural or engineered) do possess antibacterial activity against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], raising the prospect of a possible use for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections too.</p><p>A common feature of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria is the presence of a highly cationic peptide at the C- or N-terminus that can potentially destabilize the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and give access to the peptidoglycan. This notion has been supported by the work of Lood and others [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which showed that the highly positively charged C-domain of a phage lysin active against <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> was sufficient to kill the bacteria. Inspired by these observations, we searched similar lysins with antimicrobial activity towards <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and identified PlyE146, a putative lysin with a predicted highly positively charged C-terminal domain and an N-acetylmuramidase (lysozyme) N-terminal domain. PlyE146 exhibited a significant lethal activity against several <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> strains with a &gt; 3 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL decrease after 2 h of exposure. However, the antimicrobial activity against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> varied from strain to strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an endolysin with significant intrinsic antibacterial activity towards <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The only endolysins with a reported killing activity against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are the fusion <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> phage Lysep3 lysins, which exhibited a maximal activity comparatively lower than that of PlyE146 (slightly above of 1 log<sub>10</sub> kill after 10 h exposure) (23). The killing activity of PlyE146 was much greater against <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> and resulted in ca. 5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL decrease for three clinical isolates tested. By contrast, no activity was detected against <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic> isolates. This species and strain-specificity, together with the apparent greater sensitivity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic>, might be ascribed to different features at the level of the outer membrane structure, like a different composition in the lipopolysaccharides, which may prevent or facilitate the access to exogenous lysins [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent to what observed for other endolysins with intrinsic activity towards Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], PlyE146 exerted its optimal activity at pH 6.0, suggesting a central role played by the cationic peptide in providing access to the peptidoglycan substrate. Indeed, at low pH the cationic peptide becomes more protonated and may thereby destabilize more efficiently the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria through the interaction with the negatively charged phosphates of the outer membrane by interfering with the stabilizing divalent cations. Consistent to this notion, pretreatment of cells with the membrane-permeabilizer EDTA [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] did not improve the activity of PlyE146. Of note, the presence of a 6-His tag in the proximity of P146 might have had an effect on the putative translocating activity mediated by P146, a possibility that is for further studies to determine.</p><p>In contrast to the fast kinetics generally observed with Gram-positive lysins [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or the artificial lysin Art-175, where cell explosions could be observed within 5 min of exposure, the effects of PlyE146 on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K12 cells could be observed only after 30 min exposure and reached a similar killing efficacy after 2 h treatment. This finding, which is in agreement with the results obtained with for PlyF307, further supports the scheme of a two-step mechanism with an initial slow penetration of the outer membrane followed by the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as evidenced by the TEM analysis of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> cells after 2 h exposure to PlyE146. Remarkably, even in the presence of a clear dispersion of the cell wall, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> cells do not appear to explode, as it generally occurs with Gram-positive lysins [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or Art-175 [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], where cells burst after the bulging of the cytoplasmic membrane through punctured holes in the cell wall. Although the exact mode of killing is for further studies to be determined, the slower activity of PlyE146 is likely behind this killing effect.</p><p>As expected, the activity of PlyE146 against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells in logarithmic phase was much greater as compared to cells in stationary phase. Indeed, lysins have been reported to be generally less active against stationary-phase cells than against logarithmically growing cells [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This effect can be ascribed to the thinner peptidoglycan layer at the level of the septum in growing cells, which makes it an easier pray for the lysin [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As previously shown for other lysins [<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0192507.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], PlyE146 became inactive against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> in serum. Absence of activity in serum as well as under physiologically relevant conditions, like in the presence of salts and at physiological pH 7.4, at the moment precludes a potential use of PlyE146 as a therapeutic agent. A study is undergoing in the laboratory to investigate whether modifications thereof can revert this loss of function.</p><p>In conclusion, we characterized a new <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> prophage lysin able to efficiently kill different Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. This study further demonstrates that bacteriophage lysins represent a promising alternative to antibiotics in the fight against MDR Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0192507.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Spellberg</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name> (<year>2008</year>) <article-title>Antibiotic resistance and antibiotic development</article-title>. <source>Lancet Infect Dis</source>
