Here, we used spatial and ecological statistics to analyze the role that saliva plays in structuring bacterial communities of the human mouth using &gt;9000 dental and mucosal samples. We show that regardless of tissue type (teeth, alveolar mucosa, keratinized gingiva, or buccal mucosa), surface-associated bacterial communities vary along an ecological gradient from the front to the back of the mouth, and that on exposed tooth surfaces, the gradient is pronounced on lingual compared to buccal surfaces. Furthermore, our data suggest that this gradient is attenuated in individuals with low salivary flow due to Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome. Taken together, our findings imply that salivary flow influences the spatial organization of microbial communities and that biogeographical patterns may be useful for understanding host physiological processes and for predicting disease.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Oral microbial communities are excellent sites for examining the mechanisms of structural variation in the microbiota.

In landscape ecology, communities are known to follow a set of characteristic spatial patterns&#8212;exhibiting homogenous, random and patchy, or gradual distributions across space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Currently, few studies of host-associated microbiota have explored the types and extent of spatial patterns characteristic of community variation within gross anatomic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, particularly at spatial scales that encompass an entire anatomic region.</p><p id="Par4">Cavities and other forms of dental disease, such as chronic periodontitis, demonstrate a remarkable degree of site specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This is one reason that the human oral cavity is an excellent body site for examining mechanisms underlying spatial patterns in the human microbiota. Other reasons include the feasibility of detailed spatial sampling, the wealth of unique microbial habitats such as, soft vs. hard tissues and keratinized vs. non-keratinized soft tissues, and aspects of host physiology that create environmental gradients. For example, proximity to the nearest major salivary gland determines the velocity of the salivary film flowing over individual surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; flow velocity in turn determines the rate that molecules such as sucrose and acids are cleared from different oral compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In healthy individuals, salivary film velocity varies considerably between the front and the back of the mouth, and oral clearance is known to be faster from lingual sites compared to buccal ones. As a consequence, salivary flow is a major determinant of microbial metabolic potential and intra-plaque pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, both of which likely vary according to salivary film velocity, and thus tooth position, even in healthy individuals.</p><p id="Par5">Several experimental systems demonstrate that the loss of salivary flow results in a site-specific shift in the spatial pattern of dental cavities. In healthy individuals with normal salivary flow, caries tend to be restricted to the biting and inter-proximal surfaces of teeth particularly impacting the molars and pre-molars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. An experimental model in which salivary glands were surgically removed from rats revealed mesial, distal and lingual smooth surfaces, particularly sites in the lower jaw, to be especially susceptible to caries following the onset of hyposalivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In humans, several disparate patient populations experience low salivary flow and similarly exhibit an increased burden, compared to controls, of root, cervical, and smooth surface caries of the incisors and canines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although aging is arguably an independent predictor of low salivary flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, a definite endogenous and systemic cause is the progressive inflammatory autoimmune disorder Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome (SS) that results in the gradual loss of salivary and lacrimal gland function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, iatrogenic causes of low salivary flow include the use of any one of &gt;400 different medications spanning virtually every medication class<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> as well as radiation therapy to the head or neck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The aberrant metabolic activity of the microbiota largely drives cariogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, this characteristic shift in the spatial pattern of caries, from the back to the front of the mouth, during states of hyposalivation implies that salivary flow typically plays a role in shaping the spatial organization of microbial communities in human health. Yet despite longstanding knowledge of this relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, our understanding of how salivary flow impacts the spatial patterning of the microbial consortia across teeth remains limited. This deficit in our knowledge is likely related to the widespread use of sample types and collection methods that are ill-suited for studying biogeographical position effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Sample types such as saliva, and methods such as rinsing samples, or pooled dental plaque samples, which average communities from a wide array of intra-oral habitats, cannot be used to assess fine-scale spatial effects.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we sought to identify the type and extent of spatial patterns formed by bacterial communities inhabiting the oral cavity before investigating, as part of an ongoing larger study, the impact of low salivary flow on observed spatial patterns. Our analysis suggests that bacterial communities inhabiting the molars and incisors, of healthy humans, can be distinguished from one another. In addition, our data indicate that communities inhabiting soft and hard tissues vary across the anterior to posterior dimension of the mouth in a manner consistent with an ecological gradient, despite the profound differences between these intra-oral habitats. Finally, we provide evidence that the anterior&#8211;posterior gradient is modulated in patients with low salivary flow due to SS. Taken together, these results imply that salivary flow plays a role in structuring the community gradient. The reproducible framework used here to identify specific spatial patterns in the variation of human indigenous communities (and associated processes) may be extended to other body sites, improving our understanding of how spatial patterns and processes contribute to human health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of data and patient cohorts</title><p id="Par8">Bacterial community taxonomic count data (3 data sets) were generated from a total of 9449 samples collected from 31 individuals (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The first coordinate explained 23.48% of the total variation and partially separated molar and incisor communities: 69% of incisor samples mapped to positive axis 1 scores of which about half exceeded 0.25 while only 26% of molar samples mapped to positive axis 1 scores with fewer than 0.7% exceeding 0.25 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Strikingly, 54% of all lingual samples also mapped to positive axis 1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which suggests an interaction between tooth class and tooth aspect.

After accounting for the non-independence of temporal replicates, interpersonal variation explained 46.9% of the total variance while the difference between molars and incisors (tooth class) accounted for 9.4% and tooth aspect (buccal vs. lingual) accounted for 3.8% (Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The interaction between subject and tooth class accounted for an additional 9.5% of the variation, suggesting that physiological differences or behavioral habits (or both) between subjects contributed to the variability observed between the molar and incisor communities. The interaction between tooth class and tooth aspect accounted for 4.3% of total variation indicating that the communities on different aspects (buccal, lingual) of individual teeth represent unique community patches. These patterns in community composition were robust to a variety of data transformation methods (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and distance metrics (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>; Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and were consistent with findings from the discovery data set (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>), drawn from observations on 11 different individuals, samples of which were sequenced on a different platform to a lower sequencing depth.</p><p id="Par12">The rate of decay in community similarity over time was modest for all subjects (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Supplementary Note&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), confirming previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> that oral microbial consortia in the aggregate tend to be relatively stable despite fluctuations in the abundances of individual ASVs over time.

We collected samples of the buccal and lingual aspects of all teeth (excluding third molars) from each of 7 individuals and performed a trend surface analysis (117 taxa; 1701 samples), a method used to analyze multivariate spatial patterns in community ecology.</p><p id="Par14">Community composition varied across tooth class in a manner suggestive of an ecological gradient. Regardless of tooth aspect (buccal, lingual), communities on the central incisors (teeth 8&#8211;9, 24&#8211;25) were associated with lower axis 1 scores compared to communities on the molars (teeth 2&#8211;3, 14&#8211;15, 18&#8211;19, 30&#8211;31) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Axis 1 scores for communities on the remaining tooth classes (lateral incisors, canines, and pre-molars) gradually increased in a stepwise, ordered fashion from lower toward higher axis 1 scores (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In other words, the central incisors and first molars corresponded to opposing poles of a gradient in community composition.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Supragingival communities vary by tooth class in a structured fashion suggestive of a gradient. <bold>a</bold> Trend surface analysis (TSA) was performed on the species by sample data matrix (117 taxa, 1701 samples).

Prior evidence supports our finding that the microbial consortia vary between the front and back of the mouth though extant studies have not identified the spatial pattern of variance as a gradient and have only examined tooth-associated surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our data likewise support prior observations that the difference between molar and incisor communities is unlikely an artifact of differences between sites in plaque biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> although biomass undoubtedly influences the composition of communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data suggest that the gradient is a reflection of a large-scale environmental factor that selects for a gradual change in the abundances of a large fraction of non-core taxa across sites. While the 10 most abundant &#8220;core&#8221; taxa did not exhibit site specificity, the vast majority of the others did, indicating that the most abundant taxa may be habitat generalists, whereas lesser abundant taxa exhibit site specificity. While one research group used patterns of co-occurrence to identify microbial interactions as a likely explanation for the differentiation of molar and incisor communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, other non-mutually exclusive explanations include habitat selection and historical contingencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Salivary flow appears to play a role in maintaining the gradient in community composition in healthy individuals.

As a consequence, in healthy humans, the duration of plaque exposure to dietary and microbial-derived acids, and hence pH, varies across the anterior to posterior dimension&#8212;and, a reduction in salivary flow results in prolonged periods of low pH at sites that otherwise rebound quickly following stimulation of salivary flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that normal salivary flow gives rise to habitat heterogeneity between sites (i.e., the molar and incisors appear to be different) by generating a pH differential. We further postulate that a clinically significant reduction in salivary flow leads to a reduced difference in oral clearance and intra-plaque pH across the anterior&#8211;posterior dimension leading to homogenization of intra-oral compartments and reduced heterogeneity of microbial communities. In keeping with this, we and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> have found individuals with low salivary flow experience a higher burden of anterior caries and an enrichment of acid-loving, acid-producing organisms even though only one of our participants had active caries at the time of sample collection.</p><p id="Par29">Disease progression and autoimmune processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> in SS may explain the varying degree of gradient modification observed between SS patients.

As a consequence, patterns of gradient attenuation or amplification may be related to differences in disease progression; this was not directly assessed as a source of the personalized differences reported in this work. Future studies should focus on identifying the degree to which the date of diagnosis and therefore the duration of hyposalivation influence observed patterns not just on dental surfaces, but on soft tissues as well. Difficulties inherent in working with the SS population include uncertainty surrounding the onset of salivary gland pathology due to a prolonged subclinical period of disease. Low salivary flow often antedates symptoms and complaints of xerostomia and SS is consequently diagnosed on average 9 years after the first tooth is lost to the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.

Glandular measurements, although technically challenging, may help explain the differential responses of the low-flow patients in the degree of gradient attenuation or modulation. Similarly, salivary composition may be as important as the flow rate and may contribute to inter-individual responses, but was not examined in this study. Individuals with SS tend to produce lower salivary concentrations of antimicrobial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> compared to otherwise healthy individuals, which may partially explain why they harbor more acidogenic and aciduric organisms compared to controls. Moreover, current limitations in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved technologies hinder reliable measurements of dental plaque pH in situ (despite our attempts to do so; this study), so we could not associate spatial patterns in community composition with pH directly. Future work should include efforts to measure intra-plaque pH, glandular flow rates, and salivary composition to quantify the effect of each on the structure of bacterial communities. Finally, our reliance on 16S rRNA gene sequencing limits our ability to assess the extent to which dispersal or&#8212;any mechanism other than salivary flow&#8212;influences the observed spatial patterns. Additional work should evaluate these spatial patterns using strain-resolved metagenomics, as it is likely that dispersal, among other factors, influences community composition in the human oral cavity.</p><p id="Par31">Here, we identified a gradient in community composition that encompasses the entire spatial extent of the oral cavity.

A PCA using the dudi.pca function of the ade4 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> was used to obtain a duality diagram for subsequent input into a PCA with respect to instrumental variables (PCA-IV) in which a third-order polynomial function of the modeled geographic coordinates was used as the constraint. To examine whether mucosal communities also conformed to a gradient, a trend surface analysis was also performed on the mucosal biogeography data set (542 samples; 101 taxa) consisting of buccal and lingual samples of supragingival plaque, and as applicable, of the BM, AM, and KG collected from three additional individuals. The robustness of these findings was assessed by comparing the results to those of a PCNM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and by analysis using MEM&#160;and by EMS (Supplementary Notes&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>; Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Impact of clinical variables on community composition</title><p id="Par43">Constrained correspondence analysis was used to evaluate the extent to which UWS-FR, SWS-FR, and the MFS index for smooth surfaces (Supplementary Methods) explain variation in community composition across supragingival surfaces. The validation data set consisting of samples from the low-flow and healthy control cohorts (147 taxa; 825 samples) was used in the analysis. Permutational analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of UWS-FR, SWS-FR, and MFS as predictors of community composition with all permutations stratified within subjects. To evaluate the taxa that explain the segregation of samples into low-flow and healthy control groups, we projected the taxa onto the first and second coordinates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par44">The data supporting the results of this study are available in the NIH Short Read Archive, SRA accession number SRP126946: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra</ext-link>).
