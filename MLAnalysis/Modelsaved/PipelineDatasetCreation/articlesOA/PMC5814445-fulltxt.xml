Here we integrated large-scale profiling data of alterations in gene expression, allelic copy number (CN), and nucleotide sequences in 111 well-characterized patients. Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identify novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics. The overall lesional spectrum of T-PLL is mainly annotated to axes of DNA damage responses, T-cell receptor/cytokine signaling, and histone modulation. We formulate a multi-dimensional model of T-PLL pathogenesis centered around a unique combination of <italic>TCL1</italic> overexpression with damaging <italic>ATM</italic> aberrations as initiating core lesions. The effects imposed by TCL1 cooperate with compromised ATM toward a leukemogenic phenotype of impaired DNA damage processing. Dysfunctional ATM appears inefficient in alleviating elevated redox burdens and telomere attrition and in evoking a p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic insults. As non-genotoxic strategies, synergistic combinations of p53 reactivators and deacetylase inhibitors reinstate such cell death execution.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis.

Since T-PLL cells resemble memory T-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, a long-lived subset predestined to accumulate high amounts of DNA damage, we also compared the WES-derived mutational profiles of T-PLL to those of memory T-cells isolated from 3 age-matched healthy donors (ages 61, 63, and 65 years), with memory T cells from 3 young donors (22, 28, and 31 years) as controls.

This is in agreement with the residual, albeit diminished, damage sensing, and platform recruitment, observed here. It is therefore attractive to speculate that the expressed mutated ATM in T-PLL is hypomorphic only with respect to selective ATM functions. In fact, a robust activation of the heterochromatin factor KAP1 was frequently seen (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a, b</xref>) and may represent a GOF branch of altered ATM, in resemblance of oncogenic empowerments of mutated p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In indirect support of this theory is the assumption that an <italic>ATM</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> constellation is likely disadvantageous given the reported absence of <italic>ATM</italic> promoter silencing in T-PLL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and a complete lack of cases with biallelic <italic>ATM</italic> losses here (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Obviously, major ATM/p53-mediated branches of the DDR to restore genome integrity or to execute safeguarding responses, e.g., to oncogenic stressors or therapy, are insufficient in T-PLL. This might also be due to incomplete compensation by stand-in&#8217;s (i.e., ATR) or supplementing defects of other DNA repair genes, as we detected this in the few cases with unaffected <italic>ATM</italic>. Importantly, we provide first hints that consequences of functional ATM deficiencies (e.g., in regulated redox homeostasis or maintenance of telomere length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>) are aggravated by the pro-survival or other specific effects of TCL1 (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In support, we previously showed TCL1A to augment mitochondrial ROS biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.

In contrast to many cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, the incidence of p53 disrupting genomic lesions in T-PLL is surprisingly low. Our data implicate that in T-PLL mainly dysfunctional proximal ATM renders p53 inactive. Since ATM kinase activity and p53 de-repression stand in a synthetic lethal relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and in light of the need for non-conventional therapies in T-PLL, we devised here a promising interventional strategy.

However, this has to be expanded on at various levels. Also, the T-cell permissive cooperation between TCL1 and ATM needs to be further interrogated for the concise pathway overlaps and the exact modes of checkpoint abrogations through TCL1. This also has to consider the significance of a protein&#8211;protein interaction of TCL1 with ATM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Proposed model of T-PLL development.

The TCL1A expression construct was generated by an insertion of the TCL1A-encoding cDNA sequence into a commercially available PiggyBac expression vector pJ547-17 (DNA2.0, USA). Following Amaxa-based nucleofection (Lonza, Germany) of the TCL1A expression construct, TCL1A-expressing MEF sub-lines were established by the selection of the stable clone with hygromycin. Transfection efficacy was controlled via TCL1-APC staining using flow cytometry analysis. Cells were passed three times (48&#8201;h interval) in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT, 200&#8201;nM) to achieve respective genotypes via the 4OHT-inducible Cre recombinase (performed separately for each biological replicate). Genotyping was done using a standard PCR protocol. For viability assays, MEF cells were seeded in 96-well plates (6&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>3</sup>cells/well) and irradiated with 5 or 15&#8201;Gy.

Representative images were captured using AxioVision software. Quantification of yH2AX, RAD51, and TP53BP1 foci was performed by manually counting the foci in 30 nuclei per time-point (means with SEM calculated). Cytosolic or nuclear ATM localization was assessed by measuring fluorescence intensity using the ImageJ software. Fluorescence signals derived from the whole cell and from the nucleus were determined separately in 5 cells per sample and condition.
