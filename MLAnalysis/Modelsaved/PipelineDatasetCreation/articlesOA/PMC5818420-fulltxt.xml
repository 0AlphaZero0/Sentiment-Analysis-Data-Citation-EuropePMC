Small scale preliminary experiments use outdated plasma from the American Red Cross as the starting material for purifying BChE (P06276). Many of the volunteer donor plasma samples are turbid with fat, the donor having eaten fatty food before the blood draw. The turbid fat interferes with enzyme assays performed in the spectrophotometer and with column chromatography. Our goal was to find a method to remove fat from plasma without loss of BChE activity. Satisfactory delipidation was achieved by adding a solution of 10% dextran sulfate and calcium chloride to fatty plasma, followed by centrifugation, and filtration through a 0.8 &#956;m filter. Treatment with Aerosil also delipidated fatty plasma, but was accompanied by loss of 50% of the plasma volume. BChE activity and the BChE isozyme pattern on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis were unaffected by delipidation. BChE in delipidated plasma was efficiently captured by immobilized monoclonal antibodies B2 18-5 and mAb2. The immunopurified BChE was released from antibody binding with acid and visualized as a highly enriched, denatured BChE preparation by SDS gel electrophoresis. In conclusion, delipidation with dextran sulfate/CaCl<sub>2</sub> preserves BChE activity and the tetramer structure of BChE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aerosil 380F</kwd><kwd>dextran sulfate</kwd><kwd>fatty plasma</kwd><kwd>butyrylcholinesterase</kwd><kwd>delipidation</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Foundation for the National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000009</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">P30CA036727</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="4382"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipemia in blood is caused by a rise in chylomicron particles following a meal containing fat. Within 1 h after a meal, fat is evident in human blood and continues to rise, peaking between 2 and 4 h (Gage and Fish, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1924</xref>). If no additional food is consumed, the fat is cleared to baseline levels after 8 to 10 h. Patients scheduled for blood tests are asked to fast overnight because lipemic blood can interfere with clinical biochemical tests for alanine aminotransferase, total protein, phosphorus, creatinine, and calcium concentration (Calmarza and Cordero, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Lipemic blood has been reported to interfere with electrophoretic analysis of alpha-2-globulin. Lipoproteins can interfere with clinical serology tests by blocking binding sites on antibodies (Nikolac, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Volunteers who donate blood to the American Red Cross are encouraged to eat before they donate blood. A significant number of bags of outdated plasma that we receive for research are opalescent with fat. We purify butyrylcholinesterase from plasma by column chromatography and find that fatty plasma fouls our chromatography media. We investigated methods for delipidating plasma so that we would be prepared to process large volumes of human plasma through our BChE purification protocol.</p><p>Human plasma containing genetic variants of BChE may be lipemic (Delacour et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The spectrophotometric assays we use require pipetting 10 or 20 &#956;L plasma. Fat in plasma coats the pipette tip inside and out, creating uncertainty in the volume of plasma delivered and inconsistency in assay results. Our goal was to identify a process that yields the highest volume of delipidated plasma and to determine whether the delipidation reagent affects BChE activity, binding to antibodies, performance on affinity chromatography, and visualization of BChE isozymes on denaturing gel electrophoresis.</p><p>Lipids can be extracted from plasma or serum with chloroform/methanol or hexane/isopropanol (Ferraz et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Treatment with organic solvents can destroy enzyme activity. For example, extraction of human serum with butanol-diisopropyl ether is accompanied by loss of 80 to 90% of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activity (Agnese et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). BChE is inactivated by 25% ethanol and 3% n-butyl alcohol (Whittaker, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>). Methanol changes the kinetic properties of BChE (Ferro and Masson, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). To preserve BChE activity we avoiding using organic solvents to delipidate plasma and instead tested solid phase extraction reagents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Outdated, once-frozen and thawed human plasma in citrate phosphate dextrose anticoagulant was obtained from the University of Nebraska Hospital Blood Bank. The plasma had no identifiers, thus classifying use of the plasma as exempt from regulations pertaining to human specimens, according to United States law 45 CFR 46.101(b). The volunteer donor blood had been collected and tested for pathogens by the American Red Cross. Dextran sulfate (Sigma D-6001), Aerosil 380F, acid washed (Univar). Hupresin affinity gel was synthesized by Emilie David (CHEMFORASE, Mont-Saint-Aignan, France).</p><sec><title>Delipidation of fatty plasma with calcium chloride and dextran sulfate</title><p>Fatty plasma was identified by its cloudy appearance. The presence of fat was confirmed by centrifuging a 1 mL aliquot at 4&#176;C and finding a layer of fat on the surface. Donors who ate a high-fat meal before blood draw have lipemic blood.</p><p>Two methods for delipidation using dextran sulfate and calcium chloride were tested. The initial strategy followed the method of Proksch and Bonderman (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). One Liter of plasma was adjusted to 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> by adding 20 mL of 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Dextran sulfate (0.3 g) was hydrated in 40 mL plasma on a rotating mixer for 1 h at room temperature. The hydrated dextran sulfate was added to plasma in small aliquots while mixing the plasma. After overnight storage at 4&#176;C the treated plasma was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (23,000 &#215; g) in an SS34 rotor in a Sorvall RC5C refrigerated centrifuge for 30 min at 4&#176;C. A cream-colored pellet was discarded. The supernatant was hazy but free of fat. Storage at 4&#176;C for 2 days or more caused a white precipitate to settle out, leaving a clear delipidated plasma solution. Slow addition of the 40 mL of dextran sulfate was critical. Rapid addition resulted in immediate formation of a gelatinous lump occupying 400 mL. The gelatinous lump only partly dispersed during stirring and did not collapse during centrifugation.</p><p>The second strategy was that of Masseyeff et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). A 10% (w/v) solution of dextran sulfate was prepared by hydrating 0.5 g dextran sulfate in 5 mL water. This made a clear solution. A 10 mL aliquot of fatty plasma was treated with 0.1 mL of 10% dextran sulfate and 0.2 mL of 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The suspension was rotated for 2 h at room temperature. Centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4&#176;C yielded delipidated plasma. Dextran sulfate particles settled out over a period of days. Alternatively, the delipidated plasma was filtered through a 0.8 &#956; filter to remove residual dextran sulfate. The Masseyeff approach was preferred over that of Proksch and Bonderman because it is simpler. Note that when solid dextran sulfate was added directly to plasma without first being hydrated, the fatty plasma remained turbid.</p></sec><sec><title>Delipidation with aerosil 380F</title><p>Use of Aerosil 380 to delipidate human serum is described by Agnese et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Aerosil 380F is a fluffy white substance that occupies 5.5 mL for 0.2 g dry weight. Aerosil (0.2 g) was added to a 15 mL plastic tube in a fume hood to avoid inhaling the silica particles. Fatty plasma (10 mL) was added and the tube rotated at room temperature for 2 h. Centrifugation at 4,000 rpm in a table-top Sorvall centrifuge brought down a pellet that occupied 2 mL. There was a layer of fat on top of the plasma. An additional 0.3 g of Aerosil was added to the tube. After 2 h rotation the Aerosil had swollen to 10 times its weight. Centrifugation resulted in 5 mL of solid and 5 mL of delipidated plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme activity assay</title><p>BChE activity was measured in 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 with 1 mM butyrylthiocholine iodide and 0.5 mM 5,5&#8242;-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma D1830). The rate of increase in absorbance at 412 nm was converted to &#956;moles hydrolyzed per min using the extinction coefficient E<sub>412nm</sub> = 13,600 M<sup>&#8722;1</sup> cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (Ellman et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>).

The monoclonals were immobilized on Sepharose beads and stored in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% sodium azide. A 0.1 mL suspension contained 33 &#956;g antibody bound to 20 &#956;L beads. Eight microfuge tubes each received 0.1 mL suspension of immobilized B2 18-5 and eight received 0.1 mL suspension of immobilized mAb2. After brief centrifugation in a microfuge, the liquid from 0.1 mL suspension was discarded. Duplicate 1.5 mL samples of control plasma (minimal fat), fatty plasma, dextran sulfate treated plasma, and Aerosil 380F treated plasma were added to each set of B2 18-5 and mAb2 beads. Tubes were rotated overnight at room temperature. BChE activity was tested in the unbound supernatant plasma and compared to activity in plasma before incubation with immobilized antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualization of BChE bound to immobilized monoclonal antibodies</title><p>To confirm that the BChE in plasma had been captured by immobilized antibodies rather than simply inactivated, we extracted bound protein from the beads and visualized the extracted proteins on an SDS slab gel stained with Coomassie blue. In brief, beads were transferred to 0.45 micron spin filters and washed with 0.5 mL aliquots of phosphate buffered saline until the absorbance at 280 nm of the flow through was &lt;0.04. The washed beads were desalted by two washes with 0.5 mL water. Bound proteins were released from the antibody by two treatments with 50 &#956;L of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 20 &#956;L of SDS/dithiothreitol, glycerol, bromphenol blue, denatured in a boiling water bath for 3 min and loaded on an SDS gel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Delipidation with dextran sulfate and calcium chloride</title><p>The photograph in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the difference in turbidity of a 1 L plasma sample before and after delipidation with dextran sulfate and calcium chloride according to the method of Proksch and Bonderman et al.

It was concluded that monoclonals mAb2 and B2 18-5 immobilized on Sepharose beads have high selectivity and high binding capacity for BChE in plasma and that fat and delipidating agents have minimal effects on the ability of immobilized antibodies to capture BChE from plasma.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used established protocols to delipidate plasma (Masseyeff et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>; Proksch and Bonderman, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Agnese et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Our goal was to identify the protocol that best fit our work with human butyrylcholinesterase. We concluded that delipidation with dextran sulfate/CaCl<sub>2</sub> using the method of Masseyeff et al. yielded the highest volume of delipidated plasma, was simple, and was consistently effective. Delipidated plasma retained full BChE activity and retained its native tetramer structure. BChE in delipidated plasma was efficiently captured by immobilized monoclonal antibodies B2 18-5 and mAb2. These monoclonals recognize conformational epitopes on native BChE and do not bind completely denatured BChE (Peng et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This means the delipidating agents, dextran sulfate and Aerosil 380F, did not denature BChE.</p><p>Plasma was visibly clear after it was delipidated with dextran sulfate/CaCl<sub>2</sub>, centrifuged, and allowed to settle. However, when 100 mL of this plasma was pumped onto a 2 mL Hupresin affinity column, a layer of dextran particles accumulated on the surface of the Hupresin column. This raised the concern that the particles could change the properties of our chromatography media when we process liters of plasma. We solved this potential problem by filtering the delipidated plasma through a 0.8 micron filter. The filtered plasma left no dextran particles on the affinity column. It was concluded that delipidated plasma will require filtration before it is used for column chromatography to purify BChE from liters of plasma.</p><p>Delipidation is a critical step in purification of BChE from human plasma typically available from the Red Cross. The method of Masseyeff et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>) with the attendant modification described in this paper provides a workable method for delipidation. The method may have application for delipidating milk containing recombinant human proteins (Huang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SO and OL performed experiments.
