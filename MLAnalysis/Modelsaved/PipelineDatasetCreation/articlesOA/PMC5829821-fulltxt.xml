Mounting evidence shows that eukaryotes have conserved enzymes that prevent the accumulation of reactive metabolites that cause stress inside the mitochondrion. 2-Aminoacrylate is a reactive enamine generated by pyridoxal 5&#8242;-phosphate-dependent &#945;,&#946;-eliminases as an obligatory intermediate in the breakdown of serine. In prokaryotes, members of the broadly conserved RidA family (PF14588) prevent metabolic stress by deaminating 2-aminoacrylate to pyruvate. Here, we demonstrate that unmanaged 2-aminoacrylate accumulation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria causes transient metabolic stress and the irreversible loss of mitochondrial DNA. The RidA family protein Mmf1p deaminates 2-aminoacrylate, preempting metabolic stress and loss of the mitochondrial genome. Disruption of the mitochondrial pyridoxal 5&#8242;-phosphate-dependent serine dehydratases (Ilv1p and Cha1p) prevents 2-aminoacrylate formation, avoiding stress in the absence of Mmf1p. Furthermore, chelation of iron in the growth medium improves maintenance of the mitochondrial genome in yeast challenged with 2-aminoacrylate, suggesting that 2-aminoacrylate-dependent loss of mitochondrial DNA is influenced by disruption of iron homeostasis. Taken together, the data indicate that Mmf1p indirectly contributes to mitochondrial DNA maintenance by preventing 2-aminoacrylate stress derived from mitochondrial amino acid metabolism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Deleterious reactive metabolites are produced as a consequence of many intracellular biochemical transformations.

Biochemical genetic studies in the bacterium <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> determined that RidA proteins are deaminases that hydrolyze the reactive enamine 2-aminoacrylate (2AA), and other enamine/imine substrates, to ketoacids (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In cellular metabolism, 2AA is generated by pyridoxal 5&#8242;-phosphate (PLP)-dependent &#945;,&#946;-eliminase enzymes as an intermediate in the conversion of amino acids to pyruvate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Following release from the enzyme, 2AA can be spontaneously converted to pyruvate by solvent water (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although 2AA can covalently modify enzymes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the potential for intracellular enamine damage was initially dismissed because of the short (~1.5-s) half-life of 2AA in water (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that in the absence of RidA, unbound 2AA persists <italic>in vivo</italic> and inactivates PLP-dependent enzymes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These data indicate that the cellular milieu lacks sufficient free water to rapidly hydrolyze 2AA and provides the framework for phenotypes displayed by <italic>ridA</italic> mutants (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The prevalence of PLP-dependent enzymes (including &#945;,&#946;-eliminases) involved in basic metabolic pathways, coupled with the broad distribution of RidA homologues, suggests that 2AA stress likely occurs in diverse organisms.</p><p>Little is known about eukaryotic Rid proteins, although early reports suggested involvement in a variety of cellular processes mediated by undefined mechanisms (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interestingly, the mitochondrial RidA protein Mmf1p (mitochondrial matrix factor) influences mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Unlike some mitochondrial DNA maintenance factors (e.g., Abf2p) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), Mmf1p does not bind and stabilize the mitochondrial nucleoid directly (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Characterization of enamine deaminase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and genetic complementation analyses <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that RidA proteins from the three domains of life share a conserved cellular function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The biochemical activity of RidA from yeast (e.g., Mmf1p) was not addressed by those previous studies. Here, we demonstrate that 2AA generation provokes the irreversible loss of mtDNA in <italic>S.&#160;cerevisiae</italic> lacking Mmf1p. The data indicate that iron present in the growth medium influences the stability of mtDNA when 2AA stress is encountered. Furthermore, 2AA stress elicits a growth defect that is distinct from the respiratory deficiency caused by mtDNA loss. This report establishes the role of Mmf1p in indirectly stabilizing mtDNA by preventing 2AA stress in a eukaryote and highlights damage that results from reactive metabolite imbalance in mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>Disruption of <italic>MMF1</italic> leads to a growth defect and loss of mtDNA.</title><p>The <italic>MMF1</italic> locus of the haploid <italic>S.&#160;cerevisiae</italic> strain YJF153 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was replaced with a drug cassette by targeted gene disruption, and the drug marker was resolved to generate mutant strain DMy22 (<italic>mmf1</italic>&#916;<italic>0</italic>). A plasmid expressing <italic>MMF1</italic> or an empty vector (pSF-TEF1-G418; Sigma) was introduced into DMy22, the wild-type parent (&#961;<sup>+</sup>), and a chemically induced cytoplasmic petite (&#961;<sup>&#8722;</sup>) strain derived from the wild-type strain.

In this case, 2AA generated by serine/threonine dehydratase (IlvA; EC 4.3.1.19) accumulates and compromises growth. Isoleucine allosterically inhibits IlvA, prevents 2AA generation, and restores growth in defined medium. Two nuclearly encoded serine/threonine dehydratases (EC 4.3.1.19) are active in the <italic>S.&#160;cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrion. Ilv1p is the biosynthetic serine/threonine dehydratase required for isoleucine biosynthesis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and Cha1p is a catabolic dehydratase induced by serine or threonine (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Much like the bacterial enzyme IlvA, Ilv1p catalyzes the first committed step in isoleucine biosynthesis, is subject to feedback inhibition by isoleucine, and uses serine as a substrate as an alternative to threonine (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, Ilv1p dehydrated serine and released 2AA, which Mmf1p used as a substrate, leading to an increased rate of pyruvate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2B</xref>).

If true, preventing allosteric inhibition of Ilv1p would abolish the benefit of the presence of isoleucine in cells lacking Mmf1p. To test this hypothesis, an allosterically resistant variant of Ilv1p (Ilv1p<sup>R416F</sup>) was generated using an allosterically resistant variant of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> IlvA (IlvA<sup>R362F</sup>) as a template (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, recombinant Ilv1p<sub>(46&#8722;576)</sub><sup>R416F</sup> was insensitive to isoleucine concentrations that completely inhibited the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#160;2C</xref>).

Wild-type <italic>ILV1</italic> was replaced with the full-length allele (<italic>ILV1-1</italic>) encoding Ilv1p<sup>R416F</sup> to generate a strain where 2AA production by Ilv1p could not be inhibited.

Therefore, isoleucine improves growth of the <italic>mmf1</italic>&#916; mutant strain in part through allosteric inhibition of Ilv1p and not by satisfying an isoleucine requirement. Taken together, these data show that Ilv1p generates 2AA from endogenous serine and that growth is limited unless Mmf1p or isoleucine quenches 2AA or inhibits Ilv1p activity, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s1.3"><title>Cha1p increases 2-aminoacrylate stress when exogenous serine is present.</title><p>The &#961;<sup>0</sup>

Therefore, if 2AA stress were to contribute to mtDNA loss, an additional enzyme would be required to generate 2AA in the presence of isoleucine. The catabolic Ser/Thr dehydratase Cha1p is a logical source of 2AA, since <italic>CHA1</italic> expression is induced by serine, which is present in YPD, and since the enzyme is insensitive to regulation by isoleucine (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).

Several PLP-dependent enzymes in the yeast mitochondrion influence iron homeostasis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and the disruption of iron homeostasis can lead to mitochondrial iron accumulation, enhanced oxidative stress, and diminished mtDNA stability (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

Sequestration of iron in the growth medium using BPS prevented 2AA-dependent loss of mtDNA, perhaps reflecting that 2AA stress induces accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, leading to damage and eventual loss of mtDNA.

Furthermore, Mmf1p prevents 2AA accumulation in the <italic>S.&#160;cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrion. Two consequences of 2AA accumulation in the mitochondrion were identified: the irreversible loss of mtDNA giving rise to respiration-deficient &#961;<sup>0</sup> cytoplasmic petites and a transient growth defect on fermentable carbon substrates. The latter phenotype is reminiscent of the growth defects caused by 2AA stress in <italic>S.&#160;enterica</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and other organisms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). PLP-dependent enzymes are the only targets of 2AA damage characterized to date (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>mmf1</italic>&#916; strain growth defect is due to inhibition of one or more (of 10 possible) target PLP enzymes in the mitochondrion (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#160;6</xref>). 2AA tested with a bacterial system is not mutagenic <italic>in vivo</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#160;S2</xref>&#160;in the supplemental material), making it unlikely that direct DNA damage by 2AA causes the loss of mtDNA. We suggest that loss of mtDNA is caused by the stress that 2AA exerts on the mitochondrial metabolic network. Specifically, we favor a model in which 2AA damages multiple mitochondrial PLP-dependent enzymes, ultimately leading to destabilization and loss of the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#160;6</xref>). The independent disruption of mitochondrial PLP-dependent enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis (Hem1p; EC 2.3.1.37), iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (Nfs1p; EC 2.8.1.7), one-carbon metabolism (Shm1p; EC 2.1.2.1), and aspartate metabolism (Aat1p; EC 2.6.1.1) has been reported to influence mtDNA stability to various degrees (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Notably, Hem1p and Nfs1p are directly involved in iron metabolism; damage to these enzymes caused by 2AA may underlie the iron sensitivity of <italic>mmf1</italic>&#916; mutants. The iron sensitivity of the <italic>mmf1</italic>&#916; mutant is reminiscent of that of yeast lacking the frataxin homologue <italic>YFH1</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), consistent with mitochondrial iron accumulation giving rise to oxidative stress that damages mtDNA. Given the variety of PLP-dependent enzymes that individually impact iron homeostasis and mtDNA stability, it is reasonable to conjecture that the presence of a combination of partially defective enzymes could result in mtDNA loss. Further understanding of how 2AA leads to loss of mtDNA may uncover a novel stress response pathway in mitochondria.</p><fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;6&#160;</label><caption><p>Model of 2AA stress in the yeast mitochondrion.

The precedent for 2AA damaging PLP-dependent enzymes suggests that the negative influence of 2AA on mtDNA maintenance is indirect and likely due to damage of one or more target PLP-dependent enzymes. 2KB, 2-ketobutyrate; 2AA, 2-aminoacrylate; CHA1 and ILV1 encode serine/threonine dehydratases (EC 4.3.1.19).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0011837420006"/></fig><p>Our work identified a lethal consequence of uncontrolled reactive metabolite accumulation in the mitochondrion.

Cells were harvested at 4&#176;C by centrifugation (15&#160;min at 8,000&#160;&#215;&#160;<italic>g</italic>) and resuspended in binding buffer containing 50&#160;mM potassium phosphate (pH&#160;8), 500&#160;mM sodium chloride, 10&#160;mM imidazole, 1&#160;mM TCEP, 10&#160;&#181;M PLP, and 10% glycerol. Lysozyme (1&#160;mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 g/ml), and DNase (25 g/ml) were added to each cell suspension, which then sat on ice for 1&#160;h. Cells were mechanically lysed using a French pressure cell (5 passes at 10,342&#160;kPa). Each resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation (45&#160;min at 48,000&#160;&#215;&#160;<italic>g</italic>) and filtered through a membrane with 0.45-&#181;m pores. Filtered lysates were loaded onto HisTrap HP Ni-Sepharose columns (5&#160;ml), and the columns were washed with five column volumes of binding buffer containing 40&#160;mM imidazole. Protein was eluted by increasing the concentration of imidazole in the elution buffer from 40 to 300&#160;mM over 10 column volumes. Purified protein was concentrated by centrifugation with a 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff filter unit (Millipore), and the buffer was replaced with 50&#160;mM Tris-HCl (pH&#160;7.5) containing 10&#160;&#181;M PLP and 10% glycerol using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Protein recovery as determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) was approximately 10.8&#160;mg/ml for Ilv1p<sub>46-576</sub> and 13&#160;mg/ml for Ilv1p<sub>(46&#8722;576)</sub>R416F.

Figures were generated by merging Z stacks of rhodamine B and SYTO 18 images, and the resulting merged images were deconvoluted using a conservative ratio and 15 processing cycles and automated softWoRx 6.5.2 (GE) image acquisition software. A quick projection was generated, and the resulting images were exported to Adobe Illustrator 21.0.2. Images were cropped and resized without adjusting features related to contrast or brightness. Cell borders were generated in Adobe Illustrator by outlining each cell boundary as determined from a white light snapshot.</p></sec><sec id="s3.9"><title>Impact of iron on respiratory capacity.</title><p>The <italic>MMF1</italic> locus was disrupted by transforming a &#961;<sup>+</sup> wild-type strain with a drug resistance cassette (<italic>loxP-kanMx-loxP</italic>), and recombinants were selected on YPG medium containing 280&#160;&#181;g/ml Geneticin.
