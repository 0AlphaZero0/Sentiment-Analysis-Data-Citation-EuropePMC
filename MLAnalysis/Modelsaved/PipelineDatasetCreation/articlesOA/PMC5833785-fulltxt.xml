They possess a self-renewal capacity and can differentiate into a variety of cell types. Taking advantage of these characteristics, MSCs have been considered as one of the important sources of regenerative medicine. But unlike embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), MSCs lose their proliferation activity and original characteristics after repetitive subculture, although they are considered to have a stemness nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Aging tissues experience a progressive decline in homeostatic and regenerative capacities, which has been attributed to degenerative changes in tissue-specific stem cells, stem cell niches and systemic cues that regulate stem cell activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This age-dependent deterioration of stem cell function is thought to be similar to the phenomenon experienced by MSCs after repetitive culture. MSCs undergo only a limited number of cell divisions under standard culture conditions in a process called replicative senescence that results in extensive phenotypic changes and abrogates the in vivo therapeutic potential of MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Human bone marrow MSCs (hBM-MSCs) are the most investigated source of adult stem cells.

To evaluate whether the impaired proliferation occurs in a dose-dependent manner, hBM-MSCs at P5 were transfected with serial concentrations of <italic>UBC</italic>-siRNA and their proliferation was assessed using a real-time cell monitoring system. Growth curves indicated that the impaired proliferation of hBM-MSCs occurred in a <italic>UBC</italic> dose-dependent manner (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>).

Remarkably, the cell index lined up perfectly in the order of <italic>UBC</italic>-siRNA concentration. Growth curves revealed the highest proliferation activity at P2 followed by P5 and P7 sequentially in hBM-MSCs from all three donors. The average slope of growth curves during 96&#8201;h showed that the higher slope was associated with an earlier passage and KD with lower <italic>UBC</italic>-siRNA concentration, and vice versa (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).

This observation suggested that both senescence and apoptosis occurred during in vitro culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In parallel, we scrutinized gene expression changes at early and late passage using integrative signal network analyses to explore the molecular mechanism of replicative senescence in hBM-MSCs. We clearly demonstrated a senescence-associated molecular mechanism that is expressed as downregulation of proliferation machinery. Ontogenetically, it was striking to document the significantly reduced expression in senescent cells of genes involved in cell cycle, cell division, organelle organization, DNA replication, DNA packaging, cell cycle checkpoint, response to DNA damage stimulus, DNA repair, RNA metabolic process, regulation of protein, cell proliferation and DSB repair.
