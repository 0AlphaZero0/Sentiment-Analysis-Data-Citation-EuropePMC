Numerous studies have been devoted to understanding its biological effect since the exact composition of the Fc N-glycan modulates the magnitude of effector functions such as the antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). To date, systematic analyses of the properties and influence of glycan variants have been of great interest. Understanding the principles on how N-glycosylation modulates those properties is important for the molecular design, manufacturing, process optimization, and quality control of therapeutic antibodies. In this study, we have separated a model therapeutic antibody into three fractions according to the composition of the N-glycan by using a novel Fc&#947;RIIIa chromatography column. Notably, Fc galactosylation was a major factor influencing the affinity of IgG-Fc to the Fc&#947;RIIIa immobilized on the column. Each antibody fraction was employed for structural, biological, and physicochemical analysis, illustrating the mechanism by which galactose modulates the affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa. In addition, we discuss the benefits of the Fc&#947;RIIIa chromatography column to assess the heterogeneity of the N-glycan.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The importance of IgG therapeutic antibodies as a tool for combating several diseases has greatly expanded over the past several decades. More than 40 antibodies and derivatives have been approved for the treatment not only of cancer, but in recent times also for various other diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (Dupilumab in 2015 in the US)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, familial hypercholesterolaemia (Alirocumab in 2015 in the US)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, or serious bleeding of patients taking Dabigatran (Idarucizumab in 2015 in the US)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the realm of cancer treatment, novel therapeutic antibodies against immune checkpoints have been developed by pharmaceutical industries, opening the possibility to eradicate cancer cells by inhibiting these crucial molecular switches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, the dramatic progress of bioengineering techniques is fostering vigorous research to generate antibody drugs with tailored properties and improved efficacy, such as for example bispecific and glyco-engineered antibodies, and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADC). These approaches are undoubtedly strengthening the benefits of therapeutic antibodies to treat a wide range of human diseases with increased advantages for patients and the medical community.</p><p id="Par3">Therapeutic antibodies expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and other mammalian cells display a molecule of carbohydrate (N-glycan) attached to residue Asn297 of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Such N-glycan comprises a constant core region composed of two <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and three mannose (Man) units. The core region is generally enlarged with additional saccharides of fucose (Fuc), GlcNAc, galactose (Gal), and sialic acids (<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid or <italic>N</italic>-glycolylneuraminic acid). Because these saccharides appear in variable compositions, the oligosaccharide attached to Asn297 exhibits significant heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The glycosylation of each of the two chains of Fc further increases the diversity of the glycosylation pattern, resulting in heterogeneity also at the functional level. The influence of glycosylation is demonstrated by its modulation of key effector functions such as the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">CDC is a cytotoxic effect initiated by binding of C1q to the Fc region of antibody. Subsequently, the complement components C2 to C9 induce clustering, starting the classical complement cascade. Ultimately the complement cascade induces the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) eliciting cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In this sense, the composition of the N-glycan of Fc and in particular the presence of a terminal galactose enhances the intensity of the CDC response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">ADCC is a cytotoxic effect elicited by immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. Fc&#947; receptor IIIa (Fc&#947;RIIIa) governs this response by engaging immune complexes (IC) to these immune cells. Upon binding of IC to Fc&#947;RIIIa, the immune cells are activated, leading to the release of cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzyme. The correlation between the intensity of ADCC and the glycosylation of Fc has been studied intensively, showing that the removal of fucose significantly increases the effect of ADCC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. More importantly, the preparation of afucosylated antibodies resulted in an effective strategy to improve their therapeutic capabilities as demonstrated by the approval of two glyco-engineered antibodies for the treatment of human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">There is a strong interest in reaching a comprehensive and predictable understanding of the effect of glycosylation on antibody properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> In particular, the fundamental principles explaining the influence of the galactose units of the N-glycan in the physicochemical properties of the interaction between IgG-Fc and Fc&#947;RIIIa is critical for the molecular design, manufacturing process optimization, and quality control of therapeutic antibodies.</p><p id="Par7">Herein we have addressed the mechanism by which the terminal units of galactose of the N-glycan of IgG-Fc modulate its affinity for Fc&#947;RIIIa. We employed a chromatographic column in which an engineered Fc&#947;RIIIa was immobilized. We demonstrate that the antibodies studied are separated according to their level of galactosylation, and determine their biological, structural, and physicochemical properties. On the basis of those analyses, we have discussed the recognition mechanism between of IgG-Fc and Fc&#947;RIIIa. We concluded that the CH2 dynamics, which is affected by the composition of the N-glycan, is an important factor to be taken into account when developing therapeutic antibodies, especially in terms of their effector function, and overall stability, which are readily analyzed by a novel Fc&#947;RIIIa-immobilized column.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protein cloning, expression and purification of Fc&#947;RIIIa muteins</title><p id="Par8">The amino acid sequence of mutated residues is shown in Supplemental Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

One possible explanation for the separation profile could be the existence of glycosylation variants that could influence the binding affinity to the immobilized receptor.

Thus, the retention time provides first-hand information that helps to assess the affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa (corresponding ADCC). Three Rituximab (Roche, In-house, India) showed slightly different elution profiles, such as retention time, width, and height.

However, the separation described herein using Fc&#947;RIIIa-immobilized column showed an elution peak corresponding to the afucosylated antibody (Mogamulizumab, Supplemental Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), indicating that even the non-glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa may exhibit sufficient affinity to an afucosylated antibody.</p><p id="Par39">Thomann, <italic>et al</italic>., and Dashivets <italic>et al</italic>. reported that an affinity column with glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa separates fucosylated from non-fucosylated antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. On the other hand, non-glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa cannot distinguish fucosylated from non-fucosylated antibody in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In our study, the non-glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa column does not exhibit significant resolution to fucosylated/non-fucosylated antibody (Mogamulizumab, Supplemental Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), supporting previous observations.</p><p id="Par40">The column presented in our study was developed to increase stability, resulting in the fine resolution of fractions differing in their level of galatosylation. Based on our results, and the data from the group of Roche, it is conceivable that a mutated and glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa column may exhibit separation capability for both galactosylation and fucosylation simultaneously.</p><p id="Par41">Our results showed that highly galactosylated antibody exhibits higher affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa, and greater thermal stability, ADCC activity and CDC activity. These results highlighted the importance of controlling the heterogeneity of glycoform during preparation of therapeutic antibody to obtain consistent biological and therapeutic effects.</p><p id="Par42">Crystallographic analysis revealed the detailed molecular interaction between Fc and non-glycosylated Fc&#947;RIIIa, although the structural data could not explain the molecular mechanism of how N-terminal galactose modulate the affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa. Additional data was necessary to explain the role of galactose. Evidence from thermodynamic analysis and HDX-MS showed that not the static, but the dynamic behavior of CH2 is a key mechanism modulating the affinity of IgG-Fc for Fc&#947;RIIIa. Specifically, the galactose moiety decreased the conformational entropy of CH2, facilitating the engagement of Fc to Fc&#947;RIIIa (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Considering that the terminal &#945;1, 6 galactose interacts with Lys246 of CH2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, our results support this interaction partially stabilizes CH2, resulting in enhanced affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Binding model. Our data supports that the conformational entropy modulated by galactose governs the binding affinity of IgG to Fc&#947;RIIIa. The terminal galactose moiety stabilizes the hinge &#945;-helical peptide located at the interface between the CH2 and CH3 domains. In the presence of N-glycans containing galactose, the CH2 domain remains in a more rigid conformation than that in the agalactosylated G0F glycoform. The rigid conformation yields a less unfavorable entropy change, facilitating the binding to Fc&#947;RIIIa. IgG-Fc and Fc&#947;RIIIa are represented in gray, and light orange respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_22199_Fig5_HTML" id="d29e1325"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, our study further clarifies the mechanism of how glycosylation of Fc modulates the affinity to Fc&#947;RIIIa, and the impact of terminal galactose on biological function. This information will help guide better antibody therapy by rational molecular development of therapeutic antibody.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Accession codes</title><p id="Par44">The coordinates and structure factors for IgG-Fc in complex with Mut Fc&#947;RIIIa (non-glycosylated) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 5YC5.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
