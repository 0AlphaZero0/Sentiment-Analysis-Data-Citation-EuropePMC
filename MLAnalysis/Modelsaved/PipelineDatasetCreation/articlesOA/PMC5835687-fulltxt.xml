The orange varieties were identified as undeclared genetically engineered (GE)-plants, harboring a maize dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (<italic>DFR, A</italic><sub>1</sub>), which was used in former scientific transgenic breeding attempts to enable formation of orange pelargonidin derivatives from the precursor dihydrokaempferol (DHK) in petunia. How and when the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> cDNA entered the commercial breeding process is unclear. We provide an in-depth analysis of three orange petunia varieties, released by breeders from three countries, with respect to their transgenic construct, transcriptomes, anthocyanin composition, and flavonoid metabolism at the level of selected enzymes and genes. The two possible sources of the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> cDNA in the undeclared GE-petunia can be discriminated by PCR. A special version of the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> gene, the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> type 2 allele, is present, which includes, at the 3&#8242;-end, an additional 144 bp segment from the non-viral transposable <italic>Cin4-1</italic> sequence, which does not add any functional advantage with respect to DFR activity. This unequivocally points at the first scientific GE-petunia from the 1980s as the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> source, which is further underpinned e.g., by the presence of specific restriction sites, parts of the untranslated sequences, and the same arrangement of the building blocks of the transformation plasmid used. Surprisingly, however, the GE-petunia cannot be distinguished from native red and blue varieties by their ability to convert DHK in common <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays, as DHK is an inadequate substrate for both the petunia and maize DFR. Recombinant maize DFR underpins the low DHK acceptance, and, thus, the strikingly limited suitability of the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> protein for a transgenic approach for breeding pelargonidin-based flower color. The effect of single amino acid mutations on the substrate specificity of DFRs is demonstrated. Expression of the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> gene is generally lower than the petunia <italic>DFR</italic> expression despite being under the control of the strong, constitutive p<italic>35S</italic> promoter. We show that a rare constellation in flavonoid metabolism&#8212;absence or strongly reduced activity of both flavonol synthase and B-ring hydroxylating enzymes&#8212;allows pelargonidin formation in the presence of DFRs with poor DHK acceptance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Petunia</italic> &#215; <italic>hybrida</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Zea mays</italic></kwd><kwd>dihydroflavonol 4-reductase</kwd><kwd><italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> type 2 allele</kwd><kwd>anthocyanin</kwd><kwd>pelargonidin</kwd><kwd>orange flower color</kwd><kwd>transgenic plant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Austrian Science Fund<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002428</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">P 28134-B25</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">European Commission<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000780</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">H2020-MSCA-EID-2015-675657</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7935"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The color of anthocyanin pigments is determined by their B-ring hydroxylation pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), ranging from orange to bright red (one hydroxy group), dark red to magenta (two hydroxy groups), and violet to blue (three hydroxy groups; Halbwirth, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This basically depends on two factors, which have both been exploited by biotechnological methods to influence flower color (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>): the presence of enzymes introducing hydroxy groups vicinal to that in position 4&#8242; [flavonoid 3&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8242;H) and flavonoid 3&#8242;5&#8242;-hydroxylase (F3&#8242;5&#8242;H)], and the substrate specificity of DFR (Winkel-Shirley, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simplified flavonoid pathway demonstrating the influence of the B-ring hydroxylation pattern on the establishment of petunia flower color. <sup>1</sup>Petals contain prevalently the respective anthocyanidin type.

This is based on the presence of a substrate specific dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) enzyme, which does not accept the essential precursor, dihydrokaempferol (DHK), as a substrate.</p><p>DFR is an oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.219) that catalyzes the NADPH dependent stereospecific reduction of the keto group of (+)-(<italic>2R,3R</italic>)-dihydroflavonols in position 4 to the respective (<italic>2R,3S,4S</italic>)-flavan-2,3-<italic>trans</italic>-3,4-<italic>cis</italic>-diols (leucoanthocyanidins), as well as the reverse reaction in the presence of NADP<sup>+</sup> (Halbwirth et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Petit et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). DFR is the first of the so-called &#8220;late&#8221; enzymes of the flavonoid pathway which shows a major impact on the formation of anthocyanin pigments, flavan 3-ols and flavonols. DFR provides the immediate precursors for the formation of anthocyanidins and flavan 3-ols, the building blocks of condensed tannins. On the formation of flavonols, DFR has an indirect effect. DFR competes with flavonol synthase (FLS), which opens a side branch of the anthocyanin pathway, for common substrates (Winkel-Shirley, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Several DFRs can convert dihydroflavonols irrespective of their hydroxylation pattern, but petunia possesses a DFR that does not convert DHK into leucopelargonidin. In the 1980s and 1990s genetically engineered (GE)-petunias with orange flowers were created by introducing either a maize DFR encoded by the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> gene (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Elomaa et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) or a gerbera DFR (Elomaa et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>).</p><p>The petunia belongs to the predominant balcony and bedding plants worldwide. A few years ago petunia varieties, showing a novel orange flower color, started to appear on the market and were swiftly adopted in private and public flower arrangements, in Europe and the US. Recently, the vast majority of them turned out to be genetically modified, after PCR-screening for the <italic>35S</italic>-promoter and the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> gene (Bashandy and Teeri, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; David, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Servick, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>We selected three varieties, released by breeders from three countries, for an-in-depth investigation of the presence and nature of a transgenic construct and its impact on the flavonoid metabolism. We show that they all carry the same construct, and that this can be traced back to the first GE-petunia (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) with near absolute certainty. But surprisingly, the orange petunias were not characterized by a drastically changed DFR substrate specificity compared to common red and blue petunia flowers, as would have been expected. We aimed on elucidating this paradox and demonstrate that the orange petunia owe their color primarily to a rare biochemical background. We underpin this by flavonoid analyses together with enzyme assays and expression and transcriptome studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Material</title><p>Flowers (stage 1: buds of 0.6&#8211;3 cm length, stage 2: buds of 3&#8211;5 cm length, stage 3: open flowers) of cv.

The creation of an orange petunia by a transgenic approach in the 1980s at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany was a further landmark in the field of flower color research and the subsequent field trial attracted attention far beyond the horticultural community. Thus, the fact that petunia does not naturally possess orange flower color, and the underlying biochemical reason, has been established knowledge for a few decades (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Johnson et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Therefore, the appearance of orange petunia varieties on the European market attracted the interest of scientists familiar with anthocyanin flower color. As they were not declared as genetically modified plants, which would have been compulsory if a transgenic breeding method had been used, they were apparently a result of classical breeding. Recent research demonstrated, however, that the vast majority of the commercially available orange petunia varieties, but not all, are genetically engineered and harbor the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> cDNA clone from <italic>Zea mays</italic> (Bashandy and Teeri, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Despite the general consensus that the transgenic construct most probably derived from the first scientific GE-petunia (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), it always remained unmentioned that there was a second scientific petunia (Elomaa et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), which was constructed with the same GE-elements, which could have been a possible source of the putatively unintentionally escaped <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> cDNA clone.

Such elevated dihydroflavonol levels were not found in common petunia varieties with a high F3&#8242;5&#8242;H activity, as this favors creation of delphinidin based pigments. Likewise, in the absence of F3&#8242;5&#8242;H activity, accumulated DHK and DHQ can be converted to flavonols, if FLS is active in the petals, as is the case in the red variety (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Moreover, we never observed DHK conversion with enzyme preparations of the orange petunia petals independently of a high (open flowers) or low <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>/PhDFR</italic> (buds) expression ratio, raising the question, if, besides the maize DFR, the petunia DFR could also contribute to pelargonidin-precursor production.</p><p>To determine how the orange coloration may occur at all, if a poorly expressed non-petunia <italic>DFR</italic>, with an additionally low substrate specificity for DHK, was present in GE-petunia petals, we compared the transcriptomes of the three orange varieties (cvs. Salmon Ray, Viva Orange, Electric Orange), red (cv. Corso Rot) and black (cv. Blackberry) petunias (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>) and analyzed the genes particularly involved in color formation (Bombarely et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). An increased <italic>DFR:FLS</italic> expression ratio in the red and orange cultivars was observed, compared to the black, which was confirmed by qPCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and by the relatively small amounts of flavonols found in the petals of orange varieties (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Quantitative gene expression of <italic>PhDFR, A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, <italic>F3</italic>&#8242;<italic>H</italic> and <italic>FLS</italic>, normalized to <italic>actin</italic> in three developmental stages (st. 1: buds of 0.6&#8211;3 cm length, st. 2: buds of 3&#8211;5 cm length, st. 3: open flowers) of orange petunia flowers in three varieties (cvs. Salmon Ray, Viva Orange, Electric Orange). Average values were calculated from at least three biological replications collected at different sites. Error bars show standard deviation. Different letters above bars denote statistical difference according to Duncan test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the developmental stages separately for each variety. Different letters above cultivar names denote statistical difference according to Duncan test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the three varieties in general calculated from pooled stages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-00149-g0006"/></fig><p>Apparently, the establishment of orange petunia flower color can occur only in the absence of interfering F3&#8242;H and FLS activities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Considering the low substrate specificity of both <italic>Ph</italic>DFR and A<sub>1</sub> protein for DHK, sufficient leucopelargonidin precursor for pelargonidin-type flowers will be synthesized (i) very slowly over a long time, (ii) only if no other dihydroflavonol precursor is present (absent or low F3&#8242;H and F3&#8242;5&#8242;H activity), and (iii) if the accumulating DHK is not redirected by a highly active FLS toward flavonols. In the same way, cyanidin-based red flowering petunia varieties occur naturally, despite the fact that <italic>Ph</italic>DFR shows stringent specificity for DHM as substrate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The red cultivar used as a control accumulates a substantial amount of dihydroflavonols, however, thereby confirming the low <italic>FLS</italic> expression and elevated <italic>DFR:FLS</italic> expression ratio in the red cultivars already indicated by the transcriptome analysis. Considering the DFR substrate specificity of petunia for DHM, increased flavonol formation, at the expense of anthocyanin accumulation, and thus, only a pale color, would be expected in the case of a highly active petunia FLS. The elaborate creation of transgenic petunia and the current global commotion surrounding the escaped <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> gene seem to be a great cause, in comparison to the relatively small color effects attained by the use of the inefficient maize DFR.</p><p>American and European authorities unambiguously stated that the GE-petunia is not harmful to consumers and environment. It is still unknown, how plants harboring the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> construct of Meyer et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) entered classical breeding programmes. Nefarious use of GE-plants is unlikely, due to foreseeable troubles when plants inevitably attract attention. There are, however, several scenarios how the GE-petunia could have escaped. After its creation at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), and the contentious field trial in Germany in 1990, the plants were kept in several institutions, and were also used for breeding purposes (Oud et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Servick, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), followed by field trials in the US. Currently, the most favored explanation (Servick, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) seems to be that during a chain of company fusions the GE-background of orange petunias was forgotten, and the lines could therefore enter new breeding programmes. Our results demonstrate why the presence of the <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> does not result in orange phenotypes in a common biochemical petunia background, which facilitates undetected dispersion. Thus, the original GE-petunia (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) or progenies thereof, created by classical breeding (Oud et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) or&#8212;less likely&#8212;by escaped pollen, in the field or in the greenhouse, could have infiltrated classical breeding chains, unless it re-emerged as orange petunia in a rare event of a proper genetic background. The large spectrum of undeclared GE-petunia varieties can be explained by the use of early orange varieties as parent plants in classical breeding attempts for further orange varieties by other companies and by the use of non-orange breeding material harboring an unrecognized <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>. The fact that a single construct was found so far in the orange petunia varieties, as opposed to plural different constructs, points at a single event in the breeding chain rather than at multiple parallel events.</p><p>In the current debate, it was iterated that real orange petunia flower colors cannot occur naturally (David, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Some few petunia varieties, however, show a pattern of red and yellow pigments that, at a glance, might be mistaken for orange (Bashandy and Teeri, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). But even minor mutations in the active site of the DFR can result in higher DHK specificity, as demonstrated by the existing patent for a DHK specific DFR (Johnson et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). A spontaneous mutation occurring in a suitable background, although unlikely, could indeed provide a naturally orange-flowering petunia. This could also be achieved by cutting-edge genome editing methods causing a targeted mutation, which can currently not be distinguished from mutations induced by well accepted methods such as mutation via chemicals or radiation. It remains to be seen how the escaped GE-petunias will influence the current debate about the classification of genome editing as a genetic engineering method, and on biotech patents in general, which was provoked by the recent barley patents obtained by large brewing companies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All data supporting the findings is contained in the manuscript and its supplementary files.
