The dominant fate of wound macrophages is unclear and debated. Here we show that two-thirds of all granulation tissue fibroblasts, otherwise known to be of mesenchymal origin, are derived from myeloid cells which are likely to be wound macrophages. Conversion of myeloid to fibroblast-like cells is impaired in diabetic wounds. In cross-talk between keratinocytes and myeloid cells, miR-21 packaged in extracellular vesicles (EV) is required for cell conversion. EV from wound fluid of healing chronic wound patients is rich in miR-21 and causes cell conversion more effectively compared to that by fluid from non-healing patients. Impaired conversion in diabetic wound tissue is rescued by targeted nanoparticle-based delivery of miR-21 to macrophages. This work introduces a paradigm wherein myeloid cells are recognized as a major source of fibroblast-like cells in the granulation tissue.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">At the site of injury, macrophages exit their characteristic phenotype undergoing direct conversion to fibroblasts.

Current understanding of the fate of cells at the wound site and factors that guide them remains incomplete.</p><p id="Par4">Monocytes and macrophages, of myeloid origin, are primarily responsible for mounting an inflammatory response at the injury site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Both robust mounting of inflammation as well as timely resolution are key to successful tissue repair. The dominant fate of macrophages, following resolution of inflammation, is unclear and debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Egress from the injury site via lymphatic vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> are two proposed fates for injury-associated macrophages. An additional consideration here is the substantial plasticity properties of macrophages introducing the notion of a phenotypic switch at the site of injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Injury-site macrophages are not limited to switching their functional phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 to pro-resolution M2 state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

This study rests on our observation that at the site of injury, infiltrating myeloid cells convert to fibroblast-like cells populating the granulation tissue. The objectives of this work were to delineate the mechanism of such cell conversion at the wound site as well as to understand the significance of such conversion in wound healing. This work shows that the vast majority of the &#160;fibroblasts at the wound site originate from cells of myeloid lineage such as macrophages. Keratinocyte-derived miR-21, packaged in extracellular vesicles, positively regulates such plasticity of wound macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Myeloid origin of fibroblast-like cells in wound bed</title><p id="Par5">To determine the fate of extravasated macrophages at the wound site, we developed tdTomatoLysMGFP (LysMcre/Gt (ROSA)6Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J), referred to as LysM<sup>Cre</sup>-Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup>mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref><bold>)</bold>.

Vast majority (65&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5%) population of Fibroblast-Specific Protein 1 (FSP1)<sup>+</sup> cells (blue) at the wound-edge tissue were detected to be of myeloid lineage. FSP1 had been reported to be marker of fibroblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These myeloid cells presented fibroblast-like phenotype (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The possibility that these fibroblast-like cells were granulocytes was categorically ruled out based on lack of immunostaining with Myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody. MPO<sup>+</sup>/FSP1<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected at the wound edge (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). In support of the notion that wound-site fibroblast-like cells originated from wound-site differentiated macrophages, it was observed that 68% of all FSP1<sup>+</sup> cells at the wound granulation tissue were F4/80<sup>+</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Considering the related lineage tracing observation that 65% of all FSP1<sup>+</sup> cells were of myeloid origin, it is reasonable to conclude that transitioning wound macrophages represent a major source of wound-site fibroblast-like cells. Further support to this notion was provided by immunostaining for pan fibroblast marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor &#945; (PDGFR&#945;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>).

The expression of FSP1 as well as that of fibroblast-abundant Collagen 1 A1 (COL1A1) gene was significantly higher in d7 compared to that in d3. This revealed that most of the said transition of macrophages to fibroblast-like cells take place during the acute inflammatory phase (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Flow cytometry of CD11b<sup>+</sup> wound monocytes showed that in an early d3 time point, although none of the monocytes co-stained for fibroblast marker CD90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, a small population of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages demonstrated an early transition by testing positive for CD90 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). On d7, a vast majority (68&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.3%, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4) of all mature wound macrophage (F4/80<sup>+</sup>) presented as fibroblast-like by testing positive for the co-presence of CD90 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Consistent with these observations in experimental animal models, CD68<sup>+</sup> FSP1<sup>+</sup> fibroblast-like cells were detected in the wound fluid isolated from chronic wound patients (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Circulating fibrocytes (CD34<sup>+</sup>/Col1A<sup>+</sup>) are also of myeloid origin and could contribute to the fibroblast pool at the wound-site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In wounds of LysM<sup>Cre</sup>-Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup> mice, only 15% of all GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were CD34<sup>+</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Under the same conditions, 65&#8211;68% were fibroblast-like cells as manifested by GFP<sup>+</sup>/FSP1<sup>+</sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#8211;f</xref>). Thus, it is estimated that among all fibroblast-like cells under such acute inflammatory conditions, a vast majority of the cells are represented by non-fibrocyte myeloid cells. In support of the contention that these cells originated from mature wound macrophage, transition to fibroblast-like cell was impaired in LysM<sup>Cre</sup>-Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup> mice treated with clodronate liposomes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). To address a related confounding factor, the possibility of cell fusion contributing toward GFP<sup>+</sup>/FSP1<sup>+</sup> in wounds of LysM<sup>Cre</sup>-Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup>mice was ruled out by cell ploidy analyses (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). In addition to the expression of LysM promoter in cells of myeloid lineage, LysM is also reported in subsets of neuronal and neuronal progenitor cells including subsets of peripheral neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The current study utilizes a cutaneous wound model where, albeit in very low abundance, it is plausible that some LysM-GFP may express in the peripheral neural fiber of skin wound. In the interest of additional rigor, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiment adopting methodology previously reported by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this experiment, GFP<sup>+</sup>&#160;BM cells from B6 ACTb-EGFP mice (Jackson #006567) were transplanted to non-EGFP C57 BL/6 mice. The presence of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells colocalizing with COL1/FSP1 was evident in the granulation tissue. To test whether GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with fibroblast markers are indeed macrophages, an additional macrophage marker F4/80 was used. GFP<sup>+</sup> FSP<sup>+</sup>/COL1<sup>+</sup> cells tested F4/80<sup>+</sup> supporting the proposed macrophage transition (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>a-b). BM cells were transplanted from CD90.2 B6 ACTb-EGFP mice (donor, Jackson #006567) to CD90.1 (recipient, Jackson #000406) mice. Wound macrophages were isolated on d7 post-wounding and four-color flow cytometry was performed to detect F4/80, CD90.1, CD90.2, and GFP. Presence of donor macrophages (GFP<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup>) expressing fibroblast marker CD90.2 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>d-e) is evident. The absence of lymphoid cells in isolated wound macrophage was ruled out by co-staining the cells with CD90 and CD19 (B cells)/CD3 (T Cells)/CD127 (Innate lymphoid cells) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Conversion of wound-site macrophages to fibroblast-like cells was abundant, particularly closer to newly forming epidermis, at the early phase (d5) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

Out of a total of 266,220 probe sets for putative full-length mRNA tested, 2757 genes (1%) were differentially expressed in d7 compared to that in d3 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

For wounds, much of this cue is captured in the wound fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the context of macrophage conversion, do wound fluid from healing and non-healing chronic wound patients perform differentially? Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) polarized to M1 were treated with wound fluid obtained from healing or non-healing chronic wounds. Interestingly, wound fluid from healing but not from non-healing cases caused huddling of cells, characteristic of cell conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Indeed, such huddled cells showed signs of transition to fibroblast-like cells as evident by increased expression of FSP1 and Col1A1 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, d</xref>). To understand the causative factor underlying such transition, exosomal content of wound fluid from healing patients were analyzed revealing higher abundance of miR-21 compared to that from fluid of non-healing cases (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The significance of miR-21 as an active principle in the wound fluid, which advances wound macrophages to fibroblast-like cells, was heightened by our finding that delivery of miR-21 mimic to M1 macrophages induced cell conversion. Such conversion of macrophages manifested as increased FSP1 protein expression, FSP1/COL1A1 gene expression and increased collagen production as determined using Sircoll assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e&#8211;i</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b, d</xref>). Sequestration of miR-21 from the wound fluid of healing patients markedly impaired cell conversion (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). miR-21 delivery ex vivo to day 3 wound macrophages from pOBCol3.6GFPtpz tg mice, that express topaz-GFP upon COL1A1 promoter, led to promoter activation (GFP<sup>+</sup>, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j, k</xref>). Furthermore, delivery of miR-21 to human M1 macrophages caused activation of FSP1 promoter (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>). Taken together, it is evident that elevated miR-21 plays a critical role in the conversion of macrophages to fibroblast-like cells. The possibility that higher myeloid fibroblast abundance may have been caused by proliferation of converted cells, as opposed to induction of conversion, was ruled unlikely based on the observation that miR-21 mimic treatment did not induce Ki67 in converted cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Conversion of wound macrophages to fibroblast-like cells require miR-21. <bold>a</bold> MDM were polarized to pro-inflammatory M1 with LPS and IFN&#947;.

We then established KLF-5 as a direct target of miR-21 using 3&#8242;UTR reporter assays (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b&#8211;d</xref>). Knockdown of KLF-5 using siRNA-augmented FSP1 demonstrating a critical role of KLF-5 in miR-21-mediated FSP1 and Vitronectin expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>a-b).

At the wound site, do keratinocyte miR-21 influence macrophage function? Exosomes isolated from human HaCaT keratinocytes enriched with miR-21 mimic directly activated the Col1A1 promoter of wound macrophage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Furthermore, miR-21-enriched keratinocytes induced FSP1 expression in wound macrophages placed in a chamber separated by a cell-impermeable transmembrane (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). To test the significance of keratinocyte miR-21 on wound macrophage function, miR-21<sup>fl/fl</sup> K14<sup>Cre</sup> mice were developed to conditionally deplete miR-21 from keratin14<sup>+</sup>(K14<sup>+</sup>) cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>). This depletion resulted in significant lowered level of miR-21 levels in exosomes of the wound fluid recognizing keratinocytes as a contributor of miR-21 to the wound fluid environment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Cellular EV release is regulated by micro environmental conditions such as inflammation. EV production by the skin during the inflammatory phase of wound healing was six folds higher than that of the intact skin (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9c</xref>).

Lineage tracing studies established that myeloid cells may convert to endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or white adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Other lines of evidence claim that macrophages may give rise to osteoclasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.This work provides first evidence not only to establish that cells of myeloid origin may convert to fibroblasts but also that the majority of fibroblasts at the wound site are contributed by such conversion. Thus, the reported conversion represents a dominant fate of blood-borne myeloid cells at the wound site. The source and characteristics of fibroblast-like cells at the site of injury has been a center of active debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. While study in cardiac fibroblast suggest that resident fibroblast proliferate upon stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, other studies have reported that blood-derived fibrocytes migrate to site of injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. We have shown very low abundance of fibrocytes in granulation tissue. Therefore, it is evident that the fibroblast population at the wound site may not be accounted for simply by the hyperplasia of resident tissue fibroblasts or by fibrocytes. In this study, we showed through flow cytometry, the increased abundance of fibroblast-like cells from macrophages in d7 compared to d3. In support of our study, Ross and Beditt reported in 1961, that the fibroblast starts to appear in the granulation tissue on day 3 post-wounding and reached their peak on day 7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, early reports indicated that peritoneal macrophages and those of tumor origin express collagen 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, FSP1 expression has been reported in a subset of inflammatory macrophages following liver injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Anecdotal evidence of macrophage to fibroblast conversion has been reported under pathological conditions of helminth infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and in cardiac as well as renal fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. These studies lacked mechanistic insight and characterization of the conversion. Genetic ablation of macrophages from the wound site diminishes the abundance of fibroblasts and compromise collagen deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This work provides definitive evidence using lineage tracing and mechanistic studies recognizing blood-borne myeloid cells as the primary source of wound fibroblasts populating the granulation tissue. During the inflammatory phase, myeloid to fibroblast conversion is efficient in non-diabetics but impaired in diabetics. This latter deficit is responsible for lack of advancement of wound macrophages to their intended fibroblast fate thus causing longer retention of wound macrophages in their pro-inflammatory state. This notion is consistent with abundant literature reporting persistent inflammatory response in diabetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Long-term persistence in post-repair skin and elevated expression profile of fibroblast and ECM genes lend credence to the postulate that the converted cells not only help advance the wound healing process beyond the inflammatory phase but also play an active role in post-closure tissue remodeling. The physiological significance of converted fibroblasts is therefore wide ranging and is expected to rapidly unfold in the context of injury repair of specific organs.</p><p id="Par21">Development of the significance of myeloid-converted fibroblast-like cells at the wound site rests on the appreciation that the production of appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) represents a major cornerstone of the healing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Discussion on this topic is often skewed toward the scarring response, which may be viewed as a reflection of dysregulated ECM homeostasis. During the course of physiological healing, matrix metalloproteases regulate the ECM turnover to avert any such dysregulation. For example, MMP12 limits fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In this work, upregulation of MMP12 in converted fibroblast-like cells and persistence of these cells until the late remodeling phase of wound healing support the contention that these cells are an integral component of physiological tissue repair and remodeling. Under conditions of diabetes, myeloid to fibroblast-like conversion was compromised. This finding is consistent with previous observations that the diabetic cutaneous wound suffer from compromised ECM production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. ECM provides essential physical scaffolding for the cellular constituents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and in doing so advances the healing process through the physiological route of re-epithelialization, wound angiogenesis and tissue remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Indeed, wound fluid from healing chronic wound patients was able to convert M1-polarized human macrophages to fibroblast-like cells. Such effect was not recorded for wound fluid from non-healing chronic wound patients. As the primary contributor of wound-site ECM in the early-inflammatory phase, myeloid-converted fibroblast-like cells are a critical driver of the physiological healing response. Two earlier lines of investigation from our laboratory recognized a central role of miR-21 in determining the functional fate of wound macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and in regulating ECM homeostasis at the site of tissue injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Successful and adequate efferocytosis constitutes a critical cue that switches macrophages from pro-inflammatory to a pro-resolving phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This is enacted by induction of miR-21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Such efferocytosis-dependent induction of miR-21 is compromised in diabetic wound macrophages. Low miR-21 in the diabetic wound tissue restrains macrophage plasticity dampening the transition to fibroblast-like cells. miR-21 has been directly implicated in cellular plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In this work, we recognize a direct contribution of inducible miR-21 in enabling the conversion of myeloid cells to fibroblast-like cells at the wound site via two distinct pathways. KLF5 was recognized as a novel miR-21 target in this work. KLF5 has been recently recognized as a myeloid transcription factor with a role in determining lineage choice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Furthermore, silencing of KLF5 favors cell transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. PTEN, the second pathway, was recognized by our laboratory as a miR-21 target in fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The lipid phosphatase PTEN plays a key role in determining macrophage cell fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Specifically, silencing of PTEN advances cell transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Of relevance in this context, elevated levels of PTEN have been reported in T2DM patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. In this work, while myeloid-specific deletion of miR-21 had no influence on the above-mentioned conversion, myeloid to fibroblast-like conversion was markedly blunted in mice where miR-21 was ablated specifically in keratinocytes. These findings pointed toward a potential keratinocyte-myeloid cell cross-talk involving miR-21. Of note, such cross-talk with keratinocytes has been reported for innate immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> as well as for melanocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Efforts to characterize the nature of cross-talk between keratinocytes and myeloid cells at the wound site led to the finding that keratinocytes originating V) carry miR-21 as cargo to be delivered to myeloid cells. miR-21 delivery is critically important in converting wound-infiltrating myeloid cells to fibroblast-like cells. Consistent with this observation, miR-21 in the wound fluid of healing chronic wound patients was observed to be packaged in EV. In non-healing patients, wound fluid-derived EVs showed lower abundance of miR-21. Post-injury inflammation induces EV release from ketainocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. TNF&#945;, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine at the wound site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, emerged as a marked inducer of EV release from human keratinocytes. EVs are known to participate in cell-to-cell communications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Keratinocyte-secreted exosomes loaded with mRNA and miRNA play an important role during injury-repair process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> and cellular reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. We have recently reported that skin-derived EVs may achieve vasculogenic direct conversion of fibroblasts in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. The present study assigns EV-dependent cross-talk between keratinocytes and myeloid cells at the wound site a pivotal role in cellular plasticity and somatic cell conversion central to physiological tissue repair. This work provides a novel conceptual framework to explain results that have existed in the literature for many years. FSP1<sup>+</sup> macrophages have been reported in the context of tissue injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. While they have been recognized as specific subsets of macrophage, systematic studies on the origin of &#160;such subsets were lacking. The versatile plasticity of macrophages has been long recognized. In that vein, concepts that dominated include conversion of macrophage to endothelial and adipose cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This work provides a set of evidence establishing that during the acute phase of wound inflammation, conversion of wound-site macrophages to fibroblasts represents a significant event. A missing link that helped develop the current paradigm is the recognition of EVs as a major contributor to cell&#8211;cell communication at the wound site. Macrophages arrive at the wound site armed with the capability to respond to the call of the tissue microenvironment. In this case, it is the EV-delivered cue from the resident keratinocytes that direct the conversion&#160;of macrophage to fibroblasts. Taken together, findings of this work introduce a new paradigm where blood-borne myeloid cells infiltrating the wound site are recognized as a major source of fibroblast-like cells in the granulation tissue. Studies addressing specific myeloid cell populations led to evidence demonstrating direct conversion of wound-site macrophages to fibroblast-like cells. Such finding also provides a novel dimension to the currently understood fate of macrophages at the site of injury. Ability to convert myeloid to fibroblast-like cells was prominent property of the wound fluid from healing patients. Furthermore, the process of conversion was strikingly impaired under conditions of experimental diabetes. Thus, the reported conversion to fibroblast-like cells is likely to be an integral component of the physiological repair process. A single miR, miR-21, was observed to be critically important in enabling the above-mentioned cell conversion. Importantly, myeloid cells had to rely on miR-21 cue from the keratinocytes to execute cell conversion. ECM homeostasis, a critical cornerstone of the physiological repair process, is largely guided by the converted fate of infiltrating inflammatory cells. This work therefore introduces a novel dimension to the significance of the post-injury acute inflammatory phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par22">LysM Cre/Gt (ROSA) 26Sor <sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup>/J mice express cell membrane localized red (tdTomato) fluorescence in all cells/tissue, whereas cells of keratinocyte origin express membrane-localized GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.
