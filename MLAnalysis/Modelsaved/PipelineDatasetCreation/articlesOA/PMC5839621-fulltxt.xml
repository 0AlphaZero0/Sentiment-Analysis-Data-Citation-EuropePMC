The nature of the vast majority of <italic>SPG11</italic> mutations found to date suggests
a loss-of-function mechanism of the encoded protein, spatacsin. The SPG11 phenotype is, in
most cases, characterized by a progressive spasticity with neuropathy, cognitive
impairment and a thin corpus callosum on brain MRI. Full neuropathological
characterization has not been reported to date despite the description of &gt;100
<italic>SPG11</italic> mutations. We describe here the clinical and pathological
features observed in two unrelated females, members of genetically ascertained SPG11
families originating from Belgium and Italy, respectively. We confirm the presence of
lesions of motor tracts in medulla oblongata and spinal cord associated with other lesions
of the central nervous system. Interestingly, we report for the first time pathological
hallmarks of SPG11 in neurons that include intracytoplasmic granular lysosome-like
structures mainly in supratentorial areas, and others in subtentorial areas that are
partially reminiscent of those observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, such as
ubiquitin and p62 aggregates, except that they are never labelled with anti-TDP-43 or
anti-cystatin C. The neuropathological overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
associated with some shared clinical manifestations, opens up new fields of investigation
in the physiopathological continuum of motor neuron degeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>spastic paraplegia 11</kwd><kwd>spatacsin</kwd><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>lipofuscin</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurodegenerative diseases, which include a large
spectrum of inherited disorders presenting with lower limb spasticity as the common clinical
feature (<xref rid="aww061-B15" ref-type="bibr">Harding, 1983</xref>). They are usually
classified according to their clinical presentation, pattern of inheritance, age at onset
and, more recently, their putative physiopathological mechanism (<xref rid="aww061-B12" ref-type="bibr">Finsterer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B11" ref-type="bibr">Fink, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lo Giudice
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B41" ref-type="bibr">Tesson
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Traditionally, and according to clinical
criteria, which remains the most operative for nosographic classification, two forms of the
disease are considered: the pure or uncomplicated forms, which represent the most frequent
HSPs in European countries, and the complex or complicated forms, which are more frequent in
recessively inherited HSP and therefore in countries with a higher rate of consanguinity
(<xref rid="aww061-B2" ref-type="bibr">Boukhris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>;
<xref rid="aww061-B33" ref-type="bibr">Ruano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).
Besides the spasticity, the latter form is often characterized by one or more additional
neurological symptoms, such as peripheral neuropathy, dementia or intellectual disability,
cerebellar ataxia, optic atrophy, deafness, retinopathy, etc. (<xref rid="aww061-B15" ref-type="bibr">Harding, 1983</xref>). The variety of inheritance modes (autosomal
dominant, autosomal recessive, mitochondrial and X-linked) and of mutated genes (&gt;70)
contributes to further heterogeneity of these neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="aww061-B41" ref-type="bibr">Tesson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the most common (14 to 26%) autosomal recessive spastic paraplegias (AR-HSP) is
caused by mutations in the <italic>SPG11</italic>/<italic>KIAA1840</italic> gene on
chromosome 15q (<italic>SPG11</italic>; MIM 610844) (<xref rid="aww061-B40" ref-type="bibr">Stevanin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="aww061-B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B2" ref-type="bibr">Boukhris <italic>et al.</italic>,

2014</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B30" ref-type="bibr">Pensato <italic>et al.</italic>,
2014</xref>). This form is, in most cases, characterized by a combination of progressive
spasticity, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and a thin corpus callosum on brain
MRI (<xref rid="aww061-B16" ref-type="bibr">Hehr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B39" ref-type="bibr">Stevanin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B10" ref-type="bibr">Denora <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Atypical
cases of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with long disease
duration (<xref rid="aww061-B29" ref-type="bibr">Orlacchio <italic>et al.</italic>,
2010</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B7" ref-type="bibr">Daoud <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>) or with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<xref rid="aww061-B27" ref-type="bibr">Montecchiani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) have also been found with mutations in
<italic>SPG11</italic>. The nature of the vast majority of <italic>SPG11</italic>
mutations found to date suggests a mechanism of loss-of-function of the encoded protein,
spatacsin. The function of spatacsin is indeed largely unknown but its interaction with
AP5Z1 (SPG48) (<xref rid="aww061-B37" ref-type="bibr">S&#322;abicki <italic>et al.</italic>,
2010</xref>), a member of the adaptor-protein complex 5, suggests that it plays a role in
intracellular trafficking (<xref rid="aww061-B17" ref-type="bibr">Hirst <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and endolysosomal homeostasis in particular (<xref rid="aww061-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). An abnormal
anterograde trafficking has also been demonstrated in neurons derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells of SPG11 patients (<xref rid="aww061-B31" ref-type="bibr">P&#233;rez-Branguli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Recently, its requirement for
lysosome turnover and autophagy has also been evidenced (<xref rid="aww061-B3" ref-type="bibr">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B32" ref-type="bibr">Renvois&#233; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B42" ref-type="bibr">Varga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Finally, the consequences of
its knock-down in zebrafish (<xref rid="aww061-B25" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B38" ref-type="bibr">Southgate <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), together with the early age at onset in most patients,
suggest a role for this gene during development of the CNS.</p><p>Neuropathological reports of cases with spastic paraplegia are sparse and often without
genetic&#8211;aetiological considerations. We report here the clinical and pathological
description of two unrelated female autopsy cases, members of genetically ascertained SPG11
families originating from Belgium and Italy, respectively. We show that motor neuron
degeneration, particularly in spinal cord and medulla oblongata, presents with histological
lesions and immunolabelling partially reminiscent of those observed in ALS. This illustrates
the overlap between HSPs and ALS and should help to improve our understanding of the
physiopathological continuum of motor neuron degeneration. We also show that lysosomal-like
granules accumulate in agreement with the potential role of spatacsin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Neuropathological studies</title><p>Full neuropathological examination was conducted according to classical methods,

uneventful pregnancy. Her parents, of Italian ancestry, were healthy and unrelated. Her
initial growth and development were normal. Onset of the disease manifested at the age of
10 years as a learning disability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="aww061-T1">Table 1</xref>).
At 12 years of age, she developed a mild motor disability, which progressed to a severe
spastic-ataxic gait at age 18 years; walking was possible with one stick. At age 31 years
she was wheelchair-bound. Sagittal and axial T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and coronal
T<sub>2</sub>-weighted brain MRI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2A and B</xref>), performed at age 14, showed corpus callosum
thinning, diffuse white matter abnormalities in frontal, occipital, temporal and
periventricular regions and atrophy of frontal and occipital brain regions. MRI
examination performed at age 24 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2C</xref>) confirmed the severe evolution of the white matter and
cortical abnormalities. Neurological examination at 27 years, when she was
wheelchair-bound, showed lower and upper limb spasticity with brisk reflexes as well as
extrapyramidal rigidity, cerebellar ataxia in the four limbs, dementia and dysarthria, and
distal amyotrophy suggesting axonal peripheral neuropathy. No fasciculations were seen at
that time. Electroneuromyographic (ENMG) and nerve conduction velocity recordings
performed in the following years revealed slightly reduced amplitudes of compound motor
action potentials, while amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials and motor and
sensory nerve conduction velocities (38 m/s in the tibial nerve, 48 m/s in the median
nerve) were normal. ENMG of the tibialis anterior muscle showed chronic denervation with
long durations and large amplitudes of motor unit action potentials. The patient died

Her parents of Belgian origin were healthy and related.
Onset of the disease, at age 10 years, was characterized by incoordination of all four
limbs and intentional tremor; subsequently, a stiff gait was noted. She had mild
intellectual disability. She developed a spastic cerebellar ataxic gait that progressed
rapidly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="aww061-T1">Table 1</xref>). At age 20 years she was
wheelchair-bound. She had sporadic generalized epileptic seizures. The EEG was normal at
that time. MRI of the brain was performed at age 36 years. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images
showed diffuse white matter lesions in periventricular areas and diffuse atrophy of the
brain. Neurological examination at age 36 years showed pyramidal signs with brisk reflexes
in all four limbs and bilateral Babinski sign, cerebellar ataxia, distal atrophy in all
four limbs and bilateral pes cavus. By age 45 years she had complete quadriparesis, claw
hands and bulbar palsy with dysphagia and dysarthria. Severe feeding problems arose due to
the dysphagia and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was needed. No ENMG
examination was performed at this stage of the disease. She developed bradypsychia and
dementia. She died at the age of 46 years, severely demented. Brain and spinal cord

stiffness in the lower limbs. Distal amyotrophy was seen in all four limbs, with claw
hands. By age 29 years, he was wheelchair-bound due to a severe spastic ataxic gait. No
dementia and no bulbar palsy were seen in this patient.</p><p>Patient BG-3, sister of proband Patient BG-2 is still alive at age 51 years. She also has
mild intellectual disability. Onset of the disease was at age 10 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="aww061-T1">Table 1</xref>). First, she had a wide-based cerebellar
ataxia. Later on a spastic gait developed with distal amyotrophy in all limbs. She had pes
cavus. She became wheelchair-bound at the age of 20 years. She had dysarthric speech and
saccadic eye movements by age 24 years. The distal muscles became severely atrophied and
she developed complete bilateral drop-foot and claw hands. Sporadic generalized epileptic
seizures were seen. Her EEG was normal. An ENMG examination performed in the upper limbs
at age 42 years showed normal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity responses (49
m/s and 53 m/s in the right ulnar and median nerves) with normal amplitudes of the action
potentials. Signs of chronic neurogenic degeneration with large motor units (polyphasic or
giant motor unit potentials) were seen in the thenar and hypothenar muscles and in the
first interosseous muscles. No clinical signs of bulbar involvement were observed in this
patient. Cognitive function remained normal. MRI of the brain performed at age 25 years
showed a thin corpus callosum. Whole exome sequence analysis was performed in this
patient. Both Belgian parents are deceased.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic analyses</title><p>Whole exome sequencing in Patient BG-3 revealed the homozygous truncating mutation

the thoraco-lumbo-sacral spinal cord. Macroscopic examination revealed mild atrophy of the

and a greyish aspect of the white matter, especially in subcortical areas. There was some
depigmentation of the substantia nigra, a slight atrophy of the pons and atrophy of the

particularly the gyrus cinguli, the frontal gyri, mainly in the third layer and, to a
lesser extent, the temporal gyri. Only a few, although shrunken, Betz neurons remained in
the precentral gyrus. In the thalamus, focal neuronal loss was severe in the mediodorsal
nucleus and the lateral dorsal nucleus in both patients. The caudate and putamen nuclei
were only moderately affected in Patient IT and were spared in Patient BG-2. Lesions in
the brainstem were heterogeneous. The reticular formation was spared, but moderate
(nucleus X and principal olivary nucleus) to severe neuronal loss (hypoglossal, gracilis
and cuneate nuclei) was observed in other brainstem regions in the two cases. In Patient
BG-2, neuronal loss was evidenced in the ventro-lateral part of the zona compacta of the
substantia nigra but not in the pontine locus coeruleus (these structures were not
available for Patient IT). The cerebellar cortex was only atrophied in Patient IT with
loss of Purkinje and granule cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2F</xref>). Anti-calbindin 28 kD immunolabelling in Patient IT
confirmed the rarefaction of Purkinje cells (data not shown). Deep cerebellar nuclei were

genetically proven SPG11 families. The two cases share similar lesions, including cortical
atrophy, white matter involvement with myelin pallor and severe astrogliosis. They also
share a demyelination of the pyramidal pathways and loss of motor neurons in medulla
oblongata and anterior horns of spinal cord. The thalamus of the two cases was also
affected, especially the mediodorsal nucleus of Patient BG-2.</p><p>In contrast, there were some differences in severity of the lesions between the two cases
in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="aww061-T2">Table 2</xref>).
The cerebellar cortex of Patient IT was severely affected after 22 years of disease duration
(onset at age 10 years), while it was spared in Patient BG-2 after 36 years of disease
duration (onset also at age 10 years) in spite of a cerebellar syndrome in both patients.
Patient BG-2 showed moderate gliosis of dentate nucleus that could however account for the
observed cerebellar ataxia. Why the involvement of specific neuronal populations and the
severity of the lesions varied between the two cases remain an unresolved question. Other
genetic or environmental factors might have played a role.</p><p>Other clinicopathological studies of HSP cases have been reported, but without genetic
investigations. More particularly, two reported cases share similar clinical and
neuropathological characteristics with ours (<xref rid="aww061-B43" ref-type="bibr">Wakabayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B22" ref-type="bibr">Kuru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). After 37 years of disease duration, the first
patient had a slowly progressive spastic tetraplegia with mental deterioration and severe
amyotrophy. Marked cerebral atrophy with thin corpus callosum was shown by brain MRI. The
second patient had spastic paraplegia, mental retardation and amyotrophy with sensory
disturbances after a disease duration of 26 years. Interestingly, while the cerebellum was
atrophied in the first case, it was normal in the second case, which mimics the
heterogeneity also found in our two SPG11 patients. A severe thinning of the corpus callosum
was present in both autopsies. In these two published cases, the remaining neurons also
presented abundant eosinophilic and lipofuscin granules, which were partially identified as
anti-ubiquitin positive in one case (<xref rid="aww061-B43" ref-type="bibr">Wakabayashi
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), but were not fully characterized. As between our
two cases, some differences between the two Japanese cases themselves could result from the
circumstances of death or different time in post-mortem examination. In addition, we cannot
exclude different genetic conditions in the two Japanese cases as the <italic>SPG11</italic>
gene was not tested.</p><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Overlapping findings between our SPG11 cases and ALS</title><p>Our SPG11 patients partially shared various clinical and neuropathological features of
ALS.</p><p>The neuropathological features, especially observed in subtentorial areas, namely medulla
oblongata and spinal cord, including the dorsal columns, are reminiscent of findings
already observed in ALS, thus emphasizing a putative physiological link between
<italic>SPG11</italic> mutations and some forms of ALS. In agreement with this
observation, <italic>SPG11</italic> mutations were recently reported in autosomal
recessive juvenile ALS with unusual long disease durations (<xref rid="aww061-B29" ref-type="bibr">Orlacchio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B7" ref-type="bibr">Daoud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The brainstem and spinal
cord autopsy of one of these juvenile ALS patients mutated in <italic>SPG11</italic>
showed minor lesions after 33 years of disease duration (<xref rid="aww061-B29" ref-type="bibr">Orlacchio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Neuronal loss and
astrogliosis were limited to glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nuclei and to the anterior
horn of the spinal cord, and a myelin pallor was reported in the anterolateral columns.
The remaining motor neurons of the spinal cord showed central chromatolysis, pigmentary
degeneration and hyaline inclusions that were not characterized using immunohistochemistry
markers. Neither Bunina bodies nor skein-like inclusions were observed.</p><p>In our SPG11 cases, Bunina bodies were also not evidenced by the anti-cystatin-C
antibody. Peculiar observations were, however, found in our patients; the supratentorial
structures&#8212;namely frontotemporal cortex, basal ganglia and the thalamic mediodorsalis
nucleus&#8212;showed neuronal degeneration without the immunohistochemical landmark of ALS
pathology as we did not observe ubiquitin, p62, or TDP-43 immunoreactivity either in basal
ganglia or in the neocortex. In medulla oblongata and spinal cord, however, ubiquitin and
p62-positive granules were found. Indeed, the accumulation and/or aggregation of
neurofilaments in motor neuron perikarya and axons (axonal spheroids) together with the
abnormal topographic location of neurofilaments in the cell body are classical features
associated with familial and sporadic ALS (<xref rid="aww061-B8" ref-type="bibr">Delisle
and Carpenter, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B44" ref-type="bibr">Xiao <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, a clinical overlap between complicated HSP and ALS was overt in Patient BG-2.
In the end stage of her disease, there was a severe bulbar palsy in addition to severe
cerebellar dysarthria. There were severe feeding problems and a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube was needed. There was an evolution to a proximal and distal amyotrophy
and a spastic quadriparesis. All this suggests a clinical evolution toward a complicated
form of HSP with involvement of the lower motor neuron and a more severe ALS-like
phenotype. However, fasciculations were seen at that time and no ENMG was performed at
that stage, which could have supported the diagnosis of ALS.</p></sec><sec><title>SPG11 pathology includes abnormal aggregation and lipid storage</title><p>Lipofuscin-positive granules were abnormally abundant in supratentorial neurons of our
SPG11 patients and in the anterior horn associated with granular osmiophilic amorphous
aggregates. Interestingly, granular intracytoplasmic eosinophilic/PAS+ structures were
exclusively found in motor neurons in spinal cord and hypoglossal nucleus. All these
deposits were restricted to neurons and were labelled with anti-cathepsin-D as
lysosomal-like structures in supratentorial areas, and by anti-ubiquitin and anti-p62 in
spinal cord neurons and ganglion cells. Although we showed, by electron microscopy,
unusual fibrillary filaments intermingled with lipofuscin deposits, no relationship could
be established with the immunostained inclusions in the absence of immuno-electron
microscopy.</p><p>The abundance of pigment granules in neurons seems to represent a cytopathological
hallmark of SPG11. Recent studies showed that SPG11 and SPG15 proteins interact with the
late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor protein complex AP-5 (<xref rid="aww061-B17" ref-type="bibr">Hirst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and their involvement in
this pathway is consistent with the abnormal lysosomal storage evidenced in fibroblasts
from SPG11, SPG15 and SPG48 patients (Renvois&#233; <italic>et al.</italic>, 20014; <xref rid="aww061-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Very
recently, an <italic>Spg11</italic> knockout mouse model was reported to recapitulate the
major clinical features of the human disease (<xref rid="aww061-B42" ref-type="bibr">Varga
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Briefly, the <italic>Spg11</italic> knockout
mice developed symptoms reminiscent to spastic paraplegia with progressive loss of
cortical motor neurons and Purkinje cells, as we observed in the human pathology (present
study). Degenerating neurons accumulated autofluorescent material, which was dark and
osmiophilic at the electron microscopy level, consistent with the accumulations observed
in our human brain samples. The neuronal inclusions in the knockout mouse model were
partially immunostained with anti-p62 and with the anti-lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1,
supporting the observation of lysosome/autophagy defects. In addition, morphological
analysis of neurons from <italic>Spg15</italic> knockout mice also showed accumulation of
large intraneuronal deposits of membrane-surrounded material, which co-stained with the
lysosomal marker LAMP1 (<xref rid="aww061-B20" ref-type="bibr">Khundadze <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although differences exist between human and mouse brains,
the aformentioned observations indicate that the invalidation of <italic>Spg11</italic> in
the mouse mimics the pathology we observed in SPG11 patients and this is relevant for
future studies aimed at identifying potential therapeutic avenues.</p><p>Taken together, these results argue in favour of a lysosomal impairment in SPG11 and
SPG15. The abnormal deposits observed in our SPG11 cases are also reminiscent of other
pathological hallmarks of motor neuron diseases associated with mutations in other genes.
Motor neuron inclusions (e.g. granular lesions, ubiquitin, TDP-43, and/or p62 positive
structures) may represent a pivotal feature of these diseases. TDP-43 accumulation is
observed in patients with mutations in <italic>GRN</italic> (progranulin),
<italic>C9orf72</italic>, <italic>DCTN1</italic> (dynactin), <italic>OPTN
(</italic>optineurin), <italic>VCP</italic> (valosin-containing protein),
<italic>ANG</italic> (angiogenin) (<xref rid="aww061-B6" ref-type="bibr">Da Cruz and
Cleveland, 2011</xref>), but not in our SPG11 cases. On the other hand, TDP-43
proteinopathy with widespread spinal cord and cerebral skein-like and round neuronal
cytoplasmic inclusions has recently been observed in patients with <italic>NIPA1</italic>
(SPG6) mutation associated with ALS clinical features (<xref rid="aww061-B26" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Lage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Regarding p62
deposits, the evidence of their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases is growing
(<xref rid="aww061-B45" ref-type="bibr">Zatloukal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).
The p62 protein, after mono- or poly-ubiquitination, is associated with autophagy (<xref rid="aww061-B34" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsztein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The
cytological association between LC3 and p62 markers in neuronal inclusions may indicate
autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins. Inhibition of autophagy and increasing
levels of p62 are generally correlated and p62 itself is degraded by autophagy (<xref rid="aww061-B45" ref-type="bibr">Zatloukal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B35" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="aww061-B26" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Lage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In Lewy body
disease, it was shown that p62 deposition precedes ubiquitination (<xref rid="aww061-B23" ref-type="bibr">Kuusisto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) but p62, ubiquitin and
TDP-43 deposition kinetics remains unknown; further biochemical studies and cellular and
animal model analyses are needed to elucidate these kinetics. In our SPG11 patients, the
deposition of p62 and ubiquitination were only observed in subtentorial neurons and dorsal
root ganglia. The differences in composition of the aggregates according to neuronal
populations remain unanswered and we can hypothesize that the immunohistochemical
discrepancy between p62 and TDP-43 deposits observed in the present SPG11 cases and as
reported by others (<xref rid="aww061-B21" ref-type="bibr">King <italic>et al.</italic>,
2011</xref>) could be explained by two different hypotheses. Different kinetics of
deposition of these proteins may vary according to the subpopulations of neurons.
Alternatively, SPG11 could represent a subtype of motor neuron pathology in which TDP-43
does not aggregate, as it has been observed in the human pathology and in a mouse model of
ALS/frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to multivesicular body protein
(<italic>CHMP2B</italic>) gene mutation (<xref rid="aww061-B13" ref-type="bibr">Ghazi-Noori <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study, performed in two distinct sibships, is the first report of
brain and spinal cord autopsy in complex forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia with
<italic>SPG11</italic> mutations. We demonstrate the neuropathological link between HSP
and ALS in terms of neurodegeneration topology and show for the first time the existence
of abnormal accumulations in neurons of SPG11, a disorder that can then be added to the
growing list of diseases associated with aggregates. Further studies, using animal and
cellular models may determine if the aggregation of proteins and lysosomal abnormalities
with abnormal lipidic deposits may precede axonal dying back, which was proposed as a
pathological mechanism associated with HSP (<xref rid="aww061-B1" ref-type="bibr">Behan
