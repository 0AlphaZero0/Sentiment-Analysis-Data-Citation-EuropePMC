Affinity maturation drives this evolution through cycles of mutation and selection leading to enhanced antibody specificity and affinity. Elucidating the biophysical mechanisms that underlie affinity maturation is fundamental to understanding B-cell immunity. An emergent hypothesis is that affinity maturation reduces the conformational flexibility of the antibody&#8217;s antigen-binding paratope to minimize entropic losses incurred upon binding. In recent years, computational and experimental approaches have tested this hypothesis on a small number of antibodies, often observing a decrease in the flexibility of the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops that typically comprise the paratope and in particular the CDR-H3 loop, which contributes a plurality of antigen contacts. However, there were a few exceptions and previous studies were limited to a small handful of cases. Here, we determined the structural flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop for thousands of recent homology models of the human peripheral blood cell antibody repertoire using rigidity theory. We found no clear delineation in the flexibility of na&#239;ve and antigen-experienced antibodies. To account for possible sources of error, we additionally analyzed hundreds of human and mouse antibodies in the Protein Data Bank through both rigidity theory and B-factor analysis. By both metrics, we observed only a slight decrease in the CDR-H3 loop flexibility when comparing affinity matured antibodies to na&#239;ve antibodies, and the decrease was not as drastic as previously reported. Further analysis, incorporating molecular dynamics simulations, revealed a spectrum of changes in flexibility. Our results suggest that rigidification may be just one of many biophysical mechanisms for increasing affinity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibody repertoires</kwd><kwd>affinity maturation</kwd><kwd>complementarity determining regions</kwd><kwd>conformational flexibility</kwd><kwd>rigidity theory</kwd><kwd>pebble game algorithm</kwd><kwd>RosettaAntibody</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">National Institute of General Medical Sciences<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000057</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">F31-GM123616, R01-GM078221, T32-GM008403</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003382</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">JPMJCR1402</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000038</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn04">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001691</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn04">17K18113</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="2"/><ref-count count="80"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="13090"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies are proteins produced by the B cells of jawed vertebrates that play a central role in the adaptive immune system. They recognize a variety of pathogens and induce further immune response to protect the organism from external perturbation. Molecules that are bound by antibodies are referred to as antigen and are recognized by the antibody variable domain (Fv), which is comprised of a variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) and light (V<sub>L</sub>) domain. To overcome the challenge of recognizing a vast array of targets&#8212;the number of antigens being far greater than the number of antibody germline genes&#8212;antibodies rely on combinatoric and genetic mechanisms that increase sequence diversity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Starting from a limited array of germline genes, a na&#239;ve antibody is generated by productive pairing of a randomly recombined V<sub>H</sub>, assembled from V-, D-, and J-genes on the heavy locus, and randomly recombined V<sub>L</sub>, assembled from V- and J-genes on the kappa and lambda loci (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Next, in a process known as affinity maturation, iterations of somatic hypermutation are followed by selection to evolve the antibody in specific response to a particular antigen. This evolution results in the gradual accumulation of mutations across the entire antibody, with higher mutation rates in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) than in the framework regions (FRs) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The CDRs are hypervariable loops comprising a binding interface on the Fv domain beta-sandwich framework, with three loops contributed by each chain; the light chain CDRs are denoted as L1, L2, and L3 and the heavy chain CDRs are denoted as H1, H2, and H3. The five non-H3 CDRs can be readily classified into a discrete amount of canonical structures (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) because they possess limited diversity in both sequence and structure. The CDR-H3 on the other hand is the focal point of V(D)J recombination, resulting in exceptional diversity of both structure and sequence. While all CDRs contribute to antigen binding, the diverse CDR-H3 is often the most important CDR for antigen recognition (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, to understand the role of B cells in adaptive immunity and how they evolve antibodies capable of binding specific antigens, we must first understand the effects of affinity maturation on the CDRs, and in particular on the CDR-H3.</p><p>Over the past 20&#8201;years, the effects of affinity maturation have been studied with an assortment of experimental and computational methods. X-ray crystallography has been used to compare antigen-inexperienced (na&#239;ve) and antigen-experienced (mature) antibodies with both antigen present and absent. Analysis of the catalytic antibodies 48G7, AZ-28, 28B4, and 7G12 showed a 1.2&#8201;&#197; average increase in C&#945; root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the CDR-H3 upon antigen binding in the na&#239;ve over that of the mature antibody, whereas motion in the other CDRs varied (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Beyond structural studies, surface plasmon resonance has been used to assess the energetics and association/dissociation rate constants of antibody&#8211;antigen binding. Manivel et al. studied a panel of 14 primary (na&#239;ve) and 11 secondary (mature) response anti-peptide antibodies, observing that affinity maturation resulted in increases in the association rate and corresponding changes in the entropy of binding (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Schmidt et al. saw the opposite when studying a broadly neutralizing influenza virus antibody, observing that affinity maturation resulted primarily in a decrease in the dissociation rate, with little effect on the association rate (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) has also been used to determine antigen-binding energetic, including the enthalpic and entropic contributions. For nine anti-fluorescein antibodies, including 4-4-20 and eight anti-MPTS antibodies, ITC results revealed diverse effects of affinity maturation: 14 of 17 mature antibodies bound antigen in an enthalpically favorable and entropically unfavorable manner, yet 3 of 17 showed the opposite, with entropically favorable and enthalpically unfavorable binding energetics (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) spectroscopy has been used to quantify dynamics of chromophore-bound antibodies on short timescales of femto- to nanoseconds. 3PEPS spectroscopy results from a panel of 18 antibodies showed that mature antibodies can possess a range of motions from small rearrangements such as side-chain motions to large rearrangements such as loop motions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In a specific comparison of na&#239;ve vs. mature, for the 4-4-20 antibody, the mature antibody was found to have smaller motions, i.e., to be more rigid, than na&#239;ve (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Antibody dynamics have also been studied by hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy (HDX-MS), which in contrast to 3PEPS probes timescales of seconds to hours. Comparison of three na&#239;ve and mature anti-HIV antibodies showed changes in CDR-L2/H2, but not in CDR-H3 dynamics (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study antibody dynamics on intermediate timescales of nano- to microseconds. MD simulations showed rigidification and reduction of CDR-H3 loop motion upon maturation for seven studied na&#239;ve/mature antibodies, with two exceptions, depending on the specific study (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In an orthogonal protein design approach to examine the CDR-H3 loop flexibility, Babor et al. and Willis et al. found that naive antibody structures are more optimal for their sequences, when considering multiple CDR-H3 loop conformations (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In sum, past studies focusing on the effects of affinity maturation on CDRs have found evidence suggesting that mature antibodies have more structural rigidity and less conformational diversity than their na&#239;ve counterparts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>With recent growth in the number of antibody structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and development of homology models from high-throughput sequencing of paired V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> genes in B cells, we now have the datasets necessary to test the rigidity hypothesis on a large scale. Prior studies, usually focused on a few antibodies at time, generally support the hypothesis that affinity maturation rigidifies the CDR-H3 loop. Thus, we hypothesize that this effect should be observable in a repertoire-scale study of thousands of antibodies. We first analyzed thousands of recently determined RosettaAntibody homology models of the most common antibody sequences found in the human peripheral blood cell repertoire (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We estimated the structural flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop by applying graph theoretical techniques based on mathematical rigidity theory, namely the Floppy Inclusions and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST) and extensions of the Pebble Game (PG) algorithms to determine backbone degrees of freedom (DOFs). Surprisingly, we found no difference in the CDR-H3 loop flexibility of the na&#239;ve and mature antibody repertoires. We considered alternative explanations for our results, which were incongruent with past studies, by expanding our analysis to a large set of antibody crystal structures, including several previously characterized antibodies, and extending our methods to include other measures of flexibility, such as B-factors and MD simulations. By all analysis methods, we found mixed results: some antibodies&#8217; CDR-H3 loops were more flexible after affinity maturation whereas others&#8217; became less flexible. In summary, we find that while affinity maturation can modulate antibody binding activity by reducing CDR-H3 structural flexibility, it does not necessarily do so.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Immunomic Repertoire Modeling</title><p>Briefly, RosettaAntibody is an antibody modeling approach that assembles homologous structural regions into a rough model and then refines the model through gradient-based energy minimization, side-chain repacking, rigid-body docking, and <italic>de novo</italic> loop modeling of the CDR-H3. The approach is fully detailed in Ref. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In a typical simulation, ~1,000 models are generated and the 10 lowest-energy models are retained. The immunomic repertoire we analyzed is from DeKosky et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In that study, models were generated for each of the ~1,000 most frequently occurring na&#239;ve and mature antibody sequences from two donors (a total of ~20,000 models representing the ~2,000 most frequent antibodies).</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Structural Rigidity Determination</title><p>The flexibility or rigidity of the CDR-H3 loop backbone was determined by using several extensions of the PG algorithm (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), initially developed in Ref. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and method FIRST (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>); we refer to here as FIRST-PG. This approach can determine flexible and rigid regions in a protein and quantify the internal conformational DOFs from a single protein conformational snapshot. FIRST generates a molecular constraint network (i.e., a graph) consisting of vertices (nodes) representing atoms and edges (interactions representing covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, etc.). Each potential hydrogen bond is assigned with energy in kcal/mol which is dependent on donor-hydrogen acceptor geometry. FIRST is run with a selected hydrogen-bonding energy cutoff, where all bonds weaker than this cutoff are ignored in the network. On the resulting network, the well-developed mathematical and structural engineering concepts (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) of flexibility and rigidity of molecular frameworks and the PG algorithm are then used to identify rigid clusters, flexible regions, and overall available conformational DOFs. For a given antibody structure, DOFs for the protein backbone of the CDR-H3 loop were calculated at every hydrogen-bonding energy cutoff value between 0 and &#8722;7&#8201;kcal/mol in increment steps of 0.01&#8201;kcal/mol. This calculation was repeated for every member of that antibody ensemble (i.e., 10 lowest-energy models of the ensemble) and finally, at each energy cutoff, the DOF count was averaged over the entire ensemble.</p><p>For a given energy cutoff and a given member of the ensemble, the DOF count for the CDR-H3 loop (residues 95&#8211;102) was obtained using a special PG operation which calculates the maximum number of pebbles that can be gathered on the backbone atoms (C&#945;, C, N) of the CDR-H3 loop (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The PG algorithm starts with the constrained molecular graph and generates a directed multigraph, where available free pebbles are absorbed one by one by independent edges (constraints). Each pebble represents one of six DOF associated with an atom. After PG completion, the remaining free pebbles can be collected on the CDR-H3 backbone (i.e., a subgraph in the constrained network) represent its conformational DOF count.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>DOF Scaling</title><p>To compare flexibility across CDR-H3 loops of different lengths, the DOF metric computed above is scaled by a theoretical maximum DOF.

Finally, we computed the simulated difference of the randomized distribution means. This process was repeated 10,000 times, so we could identify the fraction of random distributions with differences greater than the observed.

The Rosetta FastRelax protocol consists of five cycles of side-chain repacking and gradient-based energy minimization in the REF2015 version of the Rosetta energy function (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Thus, FastRelax ensembles explore the local energy minimum of the crystal structure. KIC ensembles are more diverse and representative of RosettaAntibody homology models: each ensemble member was generated by running the CDR-H3 refinement step of the RosettaAntibody protocol, consisting of V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> docking, CDR-H3 loop remodeling, and all-CDR loop minimization (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Sample command lines are given in Supplementary Material. The structural ensembles produced by both FastRelax and KIC were used for rigidity analysis. For technical reasons, 6 targets could not be analyzed from the FastRelax ensemble, and 177 targets from the KIC ensemble were omitted due to non-trivial incompatibilities between the input structure numbering and Rosetta&#8217;s internal antibody numbering scheme and a computing cluster time limitation. The excluded targets were randomly distributed and likely would not affect the conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="S2-10"><title>MD Simulations</title><p>The Fv regions were retrieved from the original PDB files. The MD simulations were performed using the NAMD 2.12 package (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) with the CHARMM36m force field and the CMAP backbone energy correction (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The truncated Fv structures were solvated with TIP3P water in a rectangular box such that the minimum distance to the edge of the box was 12&#8201;&#197; under periodic boundary conditions. Na or Cl ions were added to neutralize the protein charge, then further ions were added corresponding to a salt solution of concentration 0.14&#8201;M. The time step was set to two Fs throughout the simulations. A cutoff distance of 10&#8201;&#197; for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions was used. Long-range electrostatics was evaluated through the Particle Mesh Ewald method (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p><p>The initial structures were energy minimized by the conjugate gradient method (10,000 steps), and heated from 50 to 300&#8201;K during 100&#8201;ps, and the simulations were continued by 1&#8201;ns with NVT ensemble, where protein atoms were initially held fixed whereas non-protein atoms freely moved, gradually releasing the whole system to facilitate a stable simulation over the 1&#8201;ns. Further simulations were performed with NPT ensemble at 300&#8201;K for 200&#8201;ns without any restraints other than the SHAKE algorithm to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The last 180&#8201;ns of each trajectory were used for the subsequent clustering analyses. Similar to a previous work (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), a total of 2,000 evenly spaced frames from each trajectory were clustered based on RMSD of the C&#945; and C&#946; atoms using the K-means clustering algorithm implemented in the KCLUST module in the MMTSB tool set (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The cluster radius was adjusted to maintain 20 clusters in each trajectory. The structure closest to the center of each cluster was chosen as a representative structure of each cluster. The 10 representative structures were chosen from the top 10 largest clusters and these representative structures were energy minimized by the conjugate gradient method (10,000 steps) in a rectangular water box. The minimized antibody Fv structures were used as the inputs for the rigidity analysis.</p><p>Root-mean-square quantities of the MD trajectories were calculated based on the past 180&#8201;ns trajectories. After superposing C&#945; atoms of the FR of the heavy chain (FR<sub>H</sub>) of each snapshot onto C&#945; atoms of FR<sub>H</sub> of the reference structures (i.e., crystal structures), C&#945;-RMSD of the CDR-H3 loop was calculated as the time average. Similarly, after superposing C&#945; atoms of entire Fv domains of each snapshot onto those of the reference structures, the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of a residue <italic>i</italic> was defined as the time average:

Previously, DeKosky et al. used RosettaAntibody to model the structures of 1,911 common antibodies found in the peripheral blood cells of two human donors (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Paired V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> sequences were derived from either CD3<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>&#8722;</sup> na&#239;ve B cells or CD3<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD20<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> antigen-experienced B cells (mature) isolated from peripheral mononuclear cells. RosettaAntibody structural models were created by identifying homologous templates for the CDRs, V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> orientation, and FRs; assembling the templates into one model; <italic>de novo</italic> modeling the CDR-H3 loop; rigid-body docking the V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> interface; side-chain packing; and minimizing in the Rosetta energy function (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Since <italic>de novo</italic> modeling of long loops is challenging, DeKosky et al. limited their antibody set to the more tractable subset of antibodies with CDR-H3 loop lengths under 16 residues. They compared their models for seven human germline antibodies with solved crystal structures and found models had under 1.4&#8201;&#197; backbone RMSD for the FR and under 2.4&#8201;&#197; backbone RMSD for the CDR-H3 loop.</p><p>We used the FIRST-PG method (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) to estimate flexibility from the RosettaAntibody homology models, determining the number of backbone DOFs for the CDR-H3 loop as each hydrogen bond is broken in order from weakest to strongest. FIRST models the antibody as a molecular graph where nodes represent atoms and edges represent atomic interactions. An extension of the PG algorithm uses this molecular graph to compute the DOFs of the CDR-H3 loop. To mitigate the effects of homology modeling, inaccuracies on the FIRST-PG analysis, we used an ensemble of 10 lowest-energy RosettaAntibody models. FIRST-PG analysis on structural ensembles has been shown to predict hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange and protein flexibility (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). To account for varying CDR-H3 loop lengths, we scaled the calculated DOFs by a theoretical maximum value (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Materials and Methods</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A shows a curve of the scaled DOFs averaged over all na&#239;ve or mature antibodies as a function of the hydrogen-bonding energy cutoff used in the FIRST-PG analysis. At a cutoff of 0&#8201;kcal/mol, all hydrogen bonds are intact and the average CDR-H3 loop-scaled DOFs are about 20% of the theoretical maximum. Moving from right to left on the plot increases the minimum energy cutoff for including interactions in the FIRST graph; effectively hydrogen bonds of increasing strength are &#8220;broken&#8221; and the available DOFs rise from 20 to above 90% of the maximum theoretical flexibility, while the loop becomes unstructured (unfolded) in FIRST.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CDR-H3 loop flexibility analysis of the immunomic antibody set reveals that no difference in na&#239;ve (blue) and mature (red) antibodies.

There is no difference in the average, scaled DOFs. To further quantify this comparison, we computed the average AUC plus-or-minus one SD for both antibody sets. The average AUC values are identical for the na&#239;ve (&#8722;5.21&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.44) and mature antibody repertoires (&#8722;5.23&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.44).

Thus, on the immunomic repertoire scale, we do not observe the difference in flexibility between na&#239;ve and mature antibodies predicted by the paratope rigidification hypothesis.</p><p>Before amending the rigidification hypothesis in light of these results, we considered several alternative explanations for our observations. First, we addressed whether the use of homology models for flexibility analysis introduced inaccuracies by analyzing a large set of antibody crystal structures and Rosetta-generated models from that set with varying quality, ranging from models with sub-angstrom backbone RSMD to models that may be several angstroms off (and more representative of an average homology model). Next, we addressed whether backbone DOFs, as calculated by FIRST-PG, were a good measure of flexibility, by assessing flexibility through two alternative measures: B-factors and MD simulations. Additionally, we addressed whether averaging flexibilities and comparing across many germlines affected results, by detailed flexibility analysis of previously studied na&#239;ve&#8211;mature antibody pairs and RosettaAntibody-modeled pairs.</p></sec><sec id="S3-2"><title>Only Small Flexibility Differences Are Observed between Na&#239;ve and Mature Antibodies in the Crystallographic Set</title><sec id="S3-2-1"><title>Preparation of an Antibody Crystal Structure Dataset</title><p>Of course, the strongest critique of the immunomic antibody set is that these models are only approximating the actual antibody structure. Thus, we applied FIRST-PG analysis to a large set of antibody crystal structures. We curated the set of all non-redundant mouse and human antibody crystal structures from SAbDab (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). To be consistent with the models produced by RosettaAntibody, we truncated the structure of each antibody to only the Fv domain, excluding other antibody regions or antigen. Then, we used IMGT/3Dstructure-DB (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) to identify the variable domain genes and determined the number of somatic mutations by aligning the sequence derived from the crystal structure to the IMGT-determined V-gene. We defined mature antibodies as those possessing at least one somatic mutation in either V-gene. Our full dataset has 922 antibodies of which 23 are na&#239;ve.

Flexibility analysis has previously been shown to be more accurate on ensembles in comparison to analysis using single (snapshot) conformers (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Ensembles of 10 representative structures were generated from the initial crystal structure by using either Rosetta FastRelax (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) or refinement step of RosettaAntibody (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which we term KIC ensembles after the loop modeling algorithm used in refinement (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Rosetta FastRelax samples structures around the crystallographic, local energy minimum, with typically &lt;1&#8201;&#197; backbone RMSD, whereas the refinement step of RosettaAntibody samples a more diverse set of low-energy CDR-H3 loop conformations and V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> orientations. Thus, FastRelax ensembles are representative of the crystal structures, whereas KIC ensembles are representative of RosettaAntibody homology models. By comparative FIRST-PG analysis of the two sets, we can assess the effects of modeling inaccuracies on flexibility analysis.</p><p>The scaled DOFs as calculated by FIRST-PG for FastRelax ensembles of antibody crystal structures are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A.

Again, we considered the possibility that different distributions of loop lengths in the two sets obscures the affinity maturation contributions to flexibility. Therefore, we analyzed loops of length 10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), the single most common length in the crystallographic set. When loops of a single length were compared, there was a separation between the na&#239;ve and mature sets, with the na&#239;ve antibody set average DOFs being consistently greater than the mature set, but not significantly so, except for some energy cutoffs below &#8722;5&#8201;kcal/mol, according to KS testing. As expected, the AUC values differ, but are within a SD (&#8722;128.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.0 [na&#239;ve] vs. &#8722;121.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10.1 [mature]).

Thus, we turned to three previously studied antibodies with known crystal structures and measured CDR-H3 loop flexibility. These are (1) the esterolytic antibody 48G7 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), (2) the anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and (3) a broadly neutralizing influenza virus antibody (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). For all three antibodies, the effects of affinity maturation on CDR-H3 loop flexibility have been previously studied by both experiment and simulation, allowing comparison with our results. For brevity, we presently discuss the 48G7 antibody here and full results for all antibodies are available in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>The 48G7 antibody was first studied through crystallography, with structures capturing the bound (holo) and unbound (apo) states of both the na&#239;ve and mature antibody (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Comparison between the na&#239;ve and mature CDR loop motions from the free to the bound state revealed minor changes, with the mature CDR-H3 loop being slightly more rigid and moving an Angstrom less than the na&#239;ve upon antigen binding (Figures S10 and S11 in Supplementary Material). For each of the four crystal structures, we extracted B-factors and computed B-factor <italic>z</italic>-scores for the CDR-H3 loop, measuring the distance from the B-factor mean in SDs. B-factor <italic>z</italic>-scores for the CDR-H3 loop of apo-48G7 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A. The mature antibody has lower B-factors than the na&#239;ve antibody throughout the entire CDR-H3 loop. This observation also holds for the holo-48G7 antibody structures as well (Figure S12 in Supplementary Material). Table S2 in Supplementary Material summarizes B-factors, averaged over the whole CDR-H3 loop. These B-factor results agree with the prior crystallographic observations.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Analysis of catalytic antibody 48G7 by CDR-H3 loop B-factors and root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) shows conflicting results. <bold>(A)</bold> Comparison of normalized B-factor values for the CDR-H3 loop of the 48G7 antibody in crystal structures of the unbound na&#239;ve (dark blue) and mature (dark orange) antibodies reveals a more rigidity in the mature antibody.

Briefly, 500&#8201;ps short MD simulations of the na&#239;ve and mature antibodies in the presence of antigen with an explicit solvent model (TIP3P) found the CDR-H3 loop to be more flexible in the na&#239;ve than in the mature antibody by comparison of RMSFs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), but 15&#8201;ns MD simulations of the na&#239;ve and mature antibodies in the absence of antigen with an implicit solvent model (GB/SA) found no difference between the two, again by comparison of RMSFs (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Another study based on an elastic network model also suggested that, in the absence of antigen, the fluctuations of the na&#239;ve and mature 48G7 were similar, but their binding mechanisms could differ depending on response to antigen binding; the na&#239;ve antibody shows a discrete conformational change induced by antigen, whereas the mature antibody shows lock-and-key binding (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Due to the contentious nature of these results, we ran 200&#8201;ns MD simulations for the 48G7 na&#239;ve and mature antibodies in the absence of antigen with an explicit solvent model (TIP3P). We measured both RMSDs and RMSFs for the C&#945; atoms along the CDR-H3 loop and computed the difference between the na&#239;ve and mature antibodies (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B shows that the CDR-H3 loop RMSFs are consistently greater for the mature than the na&#239;ve 48G7 antibody.</p><p>Finally, as we have done through this study, we used FIRST-PG to measure CDR-H3 loop flexibility. To limit the effects of crystal structure artifacts on FIRST-PG analysis, we used an ensemble of 10 representative structures, derived by clustering trajectory frames and selecting 10 structurally distinct cluster medians from the MD simulations, similar to a previous flexibility study for this antibody (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The CDR-H3 loop flexibility of apo-48G7, as determined by FIRST-PG analysis of MD ensembles is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. The FIRST-PG analysis showed no significant difference between the mature and na&#239;ve antibodies.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Floppy inclusions and rigid substructure topography-Pebble Game (FIRST-PG) analysis of na&#239;ve (dark blue) and mature (dark orange) 48G7 antibodies using either Rosetta FastRelax-, RosettaAntibody-, or molecular dynamics (MD)-generated 10-member ensembles does not show a difference between the na&#239;ve and mature antibodies.

The CDR-H3 loop flexibility of apo-48G7, determined by FIRST-PG analysis of FastRelax and RosettaAntibody ensembles, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. The curves from FastRelax and the MD simulation are similar for low-energy cutoffs (e.g., in the range of 0.0 to &#8722;3.0&#8201;kcal/mol), with the na&#239;ve and mature DOFs being the same. These curves diverge at higher energy cutoffs, where the FastRelax curve shows a more flexible na&#239;ve antibody and the MD curve does not. The curve from RosettaAntibody ensembles differs from the two and shows a more flexible mature antibody at low-energy cutoffs and a more flexible na&#239;ve at high-energy cutoffs. For less visual and more quantitative comparisons, we computed the AUC of the DOF vs. hydrogen-bonding energy cutoff plots (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). We find the AUC is only slightly greater for na&#239;ve than mature antibodies in the FastRelax and RosettaAntibody ensembles, with the na&#239;ve AUC reducing by only 3.9 and 0.2%, respectively, upon maturation. MD ensembles show the opposite outcome, with the mature antibody having 1.3% greater AUC than the na&#239;ve.</p><p>Further validation was carried out on two other previously studied antibodies and reported in the Table S2 and Figures S12 and S13 in Supplementary Material. For the 4-4-20 antibody, antigen-bound structures were compared and the average mature B-factors were within a SD of the na&#239;ve. For the influenza antibody, average B-factors were compared between an unbound na&#239;ve and a bound mature crystal structure, showing significant rigidification. However, results are conflated due to the lack of unbound crystal structures, as in bound structures antibody&#8211;antigen contacts artificially increase rigidity of the CDR-H3 loop. In contrast to B-factor analyses, FIRST-PG analyses yielded mixed results for these two antibodies. The 4-4-20 antibody was found to become more flexible upon maturation by FIRST-PG analysis of all, but Rosetta KIC ensembles. The influenza antibody was found to become more rigid upon mature by FIRST-PG analysis of all, but Rosetta FastRelax ensembles. Finally, we analyzed RMSDs and RMSFs from MD simulations and found that the mature 4-4-20 antibody has higher CDR-H3 loop RMSD, but lower RMSF, values than the na&#239;ve while the mature influenza antibody was found to have lower values for both (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). As with our repertoire analysis, we do not see consistent rigidification in previously studied antibodies.

However, these studies have been limited, often focusing on a single antibody and assessing flexibility indirectly. We sought to test the generalizability of the rigidification-upon-maturation hypothesis. We were enabled by the large number of antibody structures in the PDB, homology models generated from high-throughput repertoire sequencing data, and the FIRST-PG method for rapid structural flexibility calculation to ask whether affinity maturation leads to CDR-H3 loop rigidification.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in a comparison of flexibility of repertoires, our data show little difference between na&#239;ve and mature antibodies: FIRST-PG calculations showed no difference for RosettaAntibody homology model ensembles of the most common na&#239;ve and mature antibodies in human peripheral blood cells. The same calculations showed no difference in CDR-H3 loop DOFs of crystal structures under two different refinement schemes (FastRelax and KIC). After accounting for the presence/absence of antigen, CDR-H3 loop B-factor distributions were similar for both mature and na&#239;ve antibody crystal structures. These results indicate that rigidification of the CDR-H3 loop does not always occur upon affinity maturation.</p><p>Since our observations did not indicate clear rigidification over two sets of antibodies, we considered the following possibilities: (1) comparison of different length CDR-H3 loops was unfair because longer loops are inherently more flexible, (2) comparison of different antibodies was unfair because different combinations of gene segments and V<sub>H</sub>&#8211;V<sub>L</sub> pairs will result in different flexibilities, (3) mutations within CDR-H3 loop, which we could not identify for the PDB set because of the difficulty in D/J-gene alignments, may have modulated flexibilities of CDR-H3, (4) inaccuracies in the computational methods could preclude observation of rigidification, and (5) FIRST-PG-measured backbone DOFs are not a good measure of flexibility. To address the first concern, we analyzed loops of consistent length <italic>via</italic> B-factor and FIRST-PG (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B; Figures S4 and S5 in Supplementary Material). We found that, according to KS testing and when accounting for the presence/absence of antigen, B-factor distributions were not distinct for na&#239;ve and mature sets of antibodies with same length CDR-H3 loops (length 10 for the crystallographic set and 12 for the repertoire model set). We also found that FIRST-PG DOFs AUC values of the na&#239;ve and mature sets of antibodies with the same length CDR-H3 loops were within a SD for RosettaAntibody, FastRelax, and KIC ensembles. So, even when accounting for length, mature antibodies are not significantly more rigid than na&#239;ve ones.</p><p>To address the concern that comparison of sets of antibodies originating from different V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> genes is unfair, we analyzed mature/na&#239;ve antibody pairs that had been previously studied and mature/na&#239;ve-reverted pairs that we generated with RosettaAntibody and analyzed by FIRST-PG (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; Table S2 in Supplementary Material). We found that CDR-H3 loop B-factors did not always indicate rigidification upon maturation and for the 7G12 antibody we observed the reverse effect (Figure S14 in Supplementary Material). We also found that mature antibodies did not always become more flexible upon na&#239;ve reversion, but instead displayed a breadth of behaviors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). So, when analyzing matched na&#239;ve/mature pairs, we do not see consistent rigidification upon maturation.</p><p>Our analysis of previously studied na&#239;ve/mature antibody pairs coupled with the earlier repertoire analysis should alleviate concerns that our flexibility results for the PDB set were strongly affected by our inability to align D/J-gene segments, and thus consider mutations in the CDR-H3 loop. The previously studied pairs included CDR-H3 mutations and the repertoire set had antibody sequences determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing with na&#239;ve/mature status assigned by the absence/presence of the CD27 cell-surface receptor. In both cases, the na&#239;ve and mature sequences were determined through the entire Fv, and flexibility analysis still revealed mixed results.</p><p>Finally, to address the concern that RosettaAntibody models may not be accurate enough to be useful for FIRST-PG calculations, we tested FIRST-PG on a range of structural ensembles with varying deviation from the crystal structure. We found no difference in the na&#239;ve vs. mature antibody CDR-H3 loop AUC of the FIRST-PG results, regardless of the ensemble generation method used (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Figure S4 in Supplementary Material). We also determined flexibility through alternative measures, such as crystal structure B-factors and RMSFs in MD simulations. For both, affinity maturation was not found to have a consistent, rigidifying effect. Thus, even if model inaccuracies confound analysis, other data support the same hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Comparison with Prior Results</title><p>Our analysis included several antibodies that have been the subject of previous flexibility studies, permitting a direct comparison (Table S4 in Supplementary Material summarizes past studies). One of the most studied antibodies is the anti-fluorescein antibody, 4-4-20. Spectroscopic experiments measuring the response of a fluorescent probe (fluorescein) and MD simulations measuring C&#945; atom fluctuations suggested that somatic mutations restrict conformational fluctuations in the mature antibody (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our analysis of 4-4-20 was not as clear: we observed no significant difference in na&#239;ve vs. mature CDR-H3 loop crystallographic B-factors (Figure S12 in Supplementary Material) and found the mature antibody to be more rigid in FIRST-PG calculations only in the &#8722;2.0 to &#8211;0.0&#8201;kcal/mol range of hydrogen-bonding energy cutoffs (Figure S13 in Supplementary Material). Similar mixed results were observed by Li et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) who used a Distance Constraint Model (DCM) to analyze flexibility in an ensemble of 4-4-20 conformations drawn from MD simulations. They found increases in structural rigidity of the CDR-H3 loop, as determined by the DCM, occurred upon affinity maturation, but these increases did not correspond to decreases in dynamic conformational fluctuations, as determined by RMSFs from MD simulations. Further studies artificially matured 4-4-20 by directed evolution, resulting in a femtomolar-affinity antibody, 4M5.3 (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), but the crystal structures of 4M5.3 and 4-4-20 were almost identical (the reported backbone RMSD is 0.60&#8201;&#197;) and thermodynamic measurements suggested that the affinity improvement was achieved primarily through the enthalpic interactions with subtle conformational changes (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). This observation was contradicted by Fukunishi et al. (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), who performed steered MD simulations to analyze the effects of the mutations on the flexibility of 4-4-20 and 4M5.3. By applying external pulling forces between the antibodies and the antigen along a reaction coordinate, they quantified the interactions and showed that, during the simulations, fluctuations of the antibody, especially the CDR-H3 loop, and of the antigen were indeed larger in 4-4-20 than in the more matured antibody, 4M5.3 (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Thus, there is some variation not only in our results, but also in the literature as to the effects of affinity maturation on 4-4-20.</p><p>Another set of well-studied antibodies are the four catalytic antibodies: 48G7, 7G12, 28B4, and AZ-28. In fact, the first crystallography studies to suggest rigidification of the CDR-H3 loop as a consequence of affinity maturation were performed on 48G7. Wedemayer et al. observed larger structural rearrangements upon antigen binding in the CDR-H3 loop for the na&#239;ve antibody than the mature antibody (Figures S10 and S11 in Supplementary Material) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Crystallization of the na&#239;ve unbound, na&#239;ve bound, mature unbound, and mature bound states for 7G12, 28B4, and AZ-28 revealed similar results (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Additionally, MD simulations of the four catalytic antibodies in implicit solvent were used to calculate CDR C&#945; atom B-factors (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Wong et al. showed a decrease in mature CDR-H3 loop B-factors in three cases (7G12, 28B4, and AZ-28), whereas no significant difference was observed for 48G7 (see Figure 2 in Wong et al.). Furthermore, for 48G7, Li et al. used MD simulation to generate structural ensembles and DCM analysis to determine flexibility. They found that the mature CDR-H3 loop is more rigid than the na&#239;ve, according to DCM, but used an unusual loop definition that included five additional flanking residues (see Figure 1 in Li et al.), making comparison challenging (longer loops will be inherently more flexible), and they observed increases in the mature CDR-H3 loop RMSFs (see Figure 8 in Li et al.) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our analysis of CDR-H3 loop B-factors showed rigidification upon maturation for some of the 48G7 and 28B4 crystal structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; Figure S14 in Supplementary Material), but not for 7G12 and AZ-28 structures (Figures S14 and S15 in Supplementary Material). FIRST-PG analysis of FastRelax, RosettaAntibody, and MD ensembles for 48G7 showed slight to no rigidification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Additionally, RMSFs from MD simulations for 48G7 showed higher values for the mature loop, contrary to the expectation that it is more rigid. Our mixed results for the effects of affinity maturation on 48G7 are consistent with literature, but there is variation between our results and the literature as to the effects of affinity maturation on the other catalytic antibodies.</p><p>Finally, Schmidt et al. used X-ray crystallography, MD simulations, and thermodynamics measurements to investigate how somatic mutations affected the binding mechanism of anti-influenza antibodies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). They identified three mature antibodies, their unmutated common ancestor (UCA), and a common intermediate, all derived from a subject immunized with an influenza vaccine. The affinities of the mature antibodies were about 200-fold better than the UCA. MD simulations of the UCA and the mature antibodies showed that CDR-H3 loop of the UCA could sample more diverse conformations than the mature antibodies, whose CDR-H3 loop sampled only conformations optimal for antigen binding, supporting the hypothesis that somatic mutations rigidify antibody structures. In another study by the same group (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), further MD simulations were performed on the same systems, showing that, although many somatic mutations typically accumulate in broadly neutralizing antibodies during maturation, only a handful of mutations substantially stabilize CDR-H3 loop and hence enhance the affinity of the antibodies for antigen. In our studies, all the results (Figures S12 and S13 and Table S2 in Supplementary Material) for the anti-influenza antibody, except FIRST-PG flexibility calculations for the Rosetta FastRelax ensemble, show rigidification of the CDR-H3 loop as an effect of affinity maturation and agree with the detailed analysis of Schmidt et al.</p><p>For the three antibody families we analyzed in detail, we observed mixed effects of affinity maturation on two (catalytic antibodies and 4-4-20) and clear rigidification in one (anti-influenza antibody). For the two with mixed results, we note that past work has also shown conflicting results. We interpret these results as supportive of our repertoire-wide analysis that affinity maturation does not always rigidify the CDR-H3 loop.</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Biophysical Properties Underlying Antibody Binding</title><p>Why is antibody CDR-H3 loop rigidification not a consistent result of affinity maturation? Consider the process of affinity maturation, which selects for antibody&#8211;antigen binding and against interactions with self or damaged antibodies (i.e., when deleterious mutations are introduced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase) (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Under these selection pressures, what is the benefit of CDR-H3 loop rigidification? Loop rigidification can only decrease the protein-entropy cost for antibody&#8211;antigen binding, having ostensibly no effect on enthalpy and solvent entropy of binding, and self-interactions. If CDR-H3 loop rigidification is just one of many biophysical mechanisms that can be selected for during affinity maturation, then we do not expect to observe it consistently, in line with our results.</p><p>What are the other possible mechanisms then? Collectively, studies have shown that improved antibody affinity and specificity for antigen can be achieved by introducing additional interfacial interactions, including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>); increasing the buried surface area, either polar or apolar, depending on the antigen (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>); and improving interface shape complementarity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), in addition to rigidification of the paratope (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A detailed review on the structural basis of antibody affinity maturation, by Mishra and Mariuzza, can be found in this research topic (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).</p><p>An interesting consequence of the biological antibody selection process is the anti-hapten antibody, SPE7 (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). For SPE7, mutations leading to multi-specificity or promiscuity were beneficial&#8212;antibodies are multivalent, so an antibody capable of binding multiple antigens with intermediate affinity can gain an effective advantage through cooperative binding over an antibody capable of binding only one antigen. Crystal structures of SPE7 with different antigens and in its apo-state demonstrated that SPE7 can assume different conformations. Motivated by these observations, Wang et al. exploited MD simulations to investigate the binding mechanisms of SPE7 (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). The MD simulations and subsequent analyses suggested that multi-specific antigen binding is mediated by a combined mechanism of conformer selection and induced fit. Similar behavior, where the mature antibody is more flexible than the na&#239;ve has been observed for an antibody that recognizes the tumor-associated ganglioside GD2 (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Such antibodies could not have arisen if CDR-H3 loop rigidification were a consistent result of affinity maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have conducted the largest-scale flexibility study of antibody CDR-H3 loops, analyzing 922 crystal structures and 1,911 homology models. We used B-factors and FIRST-PG to assess flexibility. We sought to identify the effects of affinity maturation on CDR-H3 loop flexibility, expecting the CDR-H3 loop to rigidify. We found that there were no differences in the CDR-H3 loop B-factor distributions or FIRST-PG DOFs for na&#239;ve vs. mature antibody crystal structures and in the CDR-H3 FIRST-PG DOFs for homology models of repertoires of na&#239;ve and mature antibodies. These findings suggest that there is no general difference between na&#239;ve and mature antibody CDR-H3 loop flexibility in repertoires of na&#239;ve and mature antibodies. However, we observed rigidification of the CDR-H3 loop for some, but not all, antibodies when the mature antibodies were compared directly to their germline predecessors. So, we conclude that increased rigidity occurs alongside other affinity increasing changes, such as improved interfacial interactions, increased buried surface area, and improved shape complementarity.</p><p>Further work must be done to address the issues observed here, i.e., inconsistent results across the different methods are used to measure flexibility. One possible route is to explore experimental methods that directly measure protein dynamics across several timescales, and use them to study a relatively large (more than one or two antibodies) and diverse (e.g., from different source organisms or capable of binding different antigens) set of antibodies. For example, HDX-MS is capable of identifying protein regions with dynamics on timescales from milliseconds to days, has been previously used to study antibody dynamics, and has been correlated to FIRST-PG (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we note the need for more rapid and accurate antibody modeling methods. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, there now exits a plethora of antibody sequence data, but little structural data. Accurate modeling can overcome the lack of high-throughput structure determination method and provide crucial structural data. These structures can then be used to address scientific questions on a larger scale than before, on the scale of the human antibody repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JJ, AS, DK, and JG designed the research.
