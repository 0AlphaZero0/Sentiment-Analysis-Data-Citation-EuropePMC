Its epidemiological cycles are complex and reservoir host species of bovine strains have not yet been identified. Given that little genetic information is available on strains circulating within a defined bovine environment, our objective was to assess the genetic diversity of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> obtained from the same farms over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Blood samplings were performed several times in two European herds. In the French herd, 169 EDTA-blood samples were obtained from 115 cows (32 were sampled two to four times). In the German herd, 20 cows were sampled six times (120 EDTA-blood samples). The presence of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> DNA was assessed using a qPCR targeting <italic>msp2</italic>. The positive DNA samples underwent MLST at nine genetic markers (<italic>typA</italic>, <italic>ctrA</italic>, <italic>msp4</italic>, <italic>pleD</italic>, <italic>recG</italic>, <italic>polA</italic>, <italic>groEL</italic>, <italic>gyrA</italic>, and <italic>ankA</italic>).

In Europe, the exophilic hard tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> is the main vector of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This bacterium infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including wild and domestic ruminants, dogs, horses, rodents and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For decades it has been known that <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> causes tick-borne fever (TBF) in domestic ruminants in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">TBF outbreaks usually occur following the first time cattle graze in an endemic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The main clinical signs are hyperthermia, anorexia, mild to moderate depression, a sudden drop in milk yield, and abortions in pregnant females. Respiratory signs such as coughing, polypnea, nasal discharge, and abnormal lung sounds have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For European farms, this infection leads to significant economic losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], whereas TBF has never been described in the USA to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par11"><italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> epidemiological cycles are complex and differ greatly between the USA and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several genetic lineages are described and some are thought to have specific host tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Transovarial transmission has not yet been described in the vector tick under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, exploiting mammalian hosts as reservoirs is essential for <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Moreover, experimental infections in sheep - which are among the most frequently infected domestic species in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] - demonstrated long-term bacterial persistence in sheep peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], suggesting that they could also be reservoirs of sheep-infecting strains. However, proof that cattle play a role as reservoirs for cow-infecting strains has not yet been obtained.</p><p id="Par13">The development of many novel molecular typing methods in recent years offers an unparalleled opportunity to generate new information about the complex epidemiology of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> and its genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Building this tree allowed identifying groups of isolates and variants within groups. Variants are defined here as bacteria that evolved from the same bacterial cell. In the case of intra-cellular bacteria such as <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, mutations (and possibly recombinations) occur at a high rate in single strains within an infected host. A group therefore gathers together variants that have highly similar profiles according to phylogenetic analyses, and that probably share the same ancestor. Two groups of bovine variants (A and B) were obtained, which were clearly distinct from the American strains, from the French horse strains, and from the Norwegian sheep strain (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Both groups were detected within the French herd, whereas only group A was present in the German herd. Interestingly, four French cows with positive results at two different time points enabled the comparison of two entire profiles from the same animal. Three of these cows (BV0012, BV0048 and BV2802), had a different profile at each time point which clustered into separate groups. Conversely, the two profiles from the fourth cow (BV0047) both clustered into group A.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Neighbor-joining trees obtained with six loci concatenation.

These groups did not associate with geographical origin, as cattle from the study by Chastagner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] originated from several French regions and clustered into either group. Moreover, these two groups remained stable over time according to MLST profiles, as identical sequences were obtained 31&#160;months apart in the French herd. Although the bovine strains of these two groups are clearly distinct in NJ trees, the variant diversity within them remains high, as has already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The variability of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains within defined sheep flocks was already mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Even so, there is no molecular typing data from any longitudinal study of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection in cattle herds.</p><p id="Par34">The six loci used in this study were sufficient to discriminate isolates belonging to the two groups, variants within the same group and successive isolates from the same animal. Indeed, the two strains from BV61, which were obtained only three weeks apart, were separated by using the concatenation of only five markers (<italic>typA</italic>, <italic>ctrA</italic>, <italic>pleD</italic>, <italic>recG</italic>, and <italic>polA</italic>). Given the irregularity in the collection of samples over time and given the possible interference of antibiotic treatments, this study was not intended to determine the intra-herd infection rate but instead to collect data on the molecular characteristics of circulating <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains within one given herd. Indeed, two groups, with variants within them, were clearly observed. Nevertheless, the use of additional markers could help to discriminate isolates obtained from the same animal at very close successive dates. Thus, another longitudinal study with more frequent and regular sampling would be very interesting in order to study in depth the succession of strains and/or the evolution of strains with time within one given animal.</p><p id="Par35">The two groups of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains co-circulated within the French farm, whereas only one was observed in the German herd. The presence of variants from only one group in the German herd could be related to the fact that they are dairy cows (red and black Holsteins, German Simmental and hybrids), whereas the French herd are beef cattle (Limousines). Dairy cows are more confined, have less extensive grazing pastures, and return every day to the stable, so may be less likely to contract infections by different <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains through tick bites<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par36">In addition, in 42% of French samples (13/31), double chromatogram peaks were encountered. The presence of these ambiguities suggests the simultaneous occurrence of two <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> profiles resulting from two different alleles at some positions. In some cases, these double peaks could be the consequence of punctual mutations occurring during a prolonged infection by a single strain that evolved over time within the host, leading to a final co-existence of two variants. This is likely the case when only one or two ambiguities at a single locus are observed in a sample. Nevertheless, other cases were suggestive of simultaneous infection by two or more distinct strains, as several samples contained sequences with many successive ambiguities (5/5 for <italic>typA</italic>, 10/11 for <italic>msp4</italic>, and 19/20 for <italic>pleD</italic>). This could result from the simultaneous transmission of several strains by the same tick, or from several ticks biting the same cow, leading to several independent inoculations of different strains. Interestingly, four of the eight French cattle that were positive at two different time points presented ambiguities in up to four loci, and for three cows, this occurred on both sampling dates. In future studies, performing PCR products cloning could lead to the identification of strains that are associated in multiple infections and could help to investigate whether specific strains are more likely to be present in simultaneous infections.</p><p id="Par37">The presence of multiple infections has already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and is considered to be a major drawback in typing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The MLST study of Huhn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated that double infections are more frequently found in wild ruminants, and another study indicated that 60.7% of infected French roe deer harbored two or three genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Chastagner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported that approximately 30% of roe deer samples presented multiple infections, compared to very few cattle samples. In addition, in a longitudinal study involving lambs, only 4 out of 85 PCR-positive samples (4.7%) were infected with multiple <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]<italic>.</italic> In our study, more than 40% of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> sequences obtained from cattle in France presented double peaks, a higher frequency than that which was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Assuming that ticks can harbor several <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains, animals with frequent tick exposure could be at risk of multiple infections. In Sologne, ticks were frequently found on cattle, so it was assumed that infection pressure with multiple strains could be high. Conversely, none of the <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> sequences obtained from cattle in Germany presented double peaks. This could be due to the fact that all variants circulating within the farm belonged to the same group. Nevertheless, such typing methods are only able to detect simultaneous infections by multiple strains if one variant does not dominate the pool, so the number of multiple infections could be underestimated.</p><p id="Par38">This work also raises the question whether cattle can act as reservoirs for <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>. Eight French cattle and three German cows remained positive after several weeks or months. Three French cattle (BV0012, BV0048, and BV2802) were found to be successively infected by strains from each group, but the order of infection was not always the same (group A strain then group B strain, or vice versa) (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). These results demonstrate that neither of the two groups appears to be predominant, and instead may favor reinfection by a different variant, which strongly suggests the existence of complex interactions between cattle and <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic>, as well as a lack of cross protection against other <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains. Conversely, for BV0047 (French heifer), BV46 and BV61 (German heifers), both the initial and subsequent infective strains belonged to the same group and were genetically similar. These results favor a long-term infection by the same variant, which could have evolved with time, perhaps to counteract the host immune response. It is noteworthy to mention here that one of the two German samples (BV61) also displayed another <italic>msp2</italic> sequence although samples were taken only three weeks apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Future work should aim to sample animals daily or weekly in order to determine if long-term infections result from the evolution and divergence of the initial strain and/or by reinfection with another variant.</p><p id="Par39">Moreover, as several animals were infected at each sampling time point, it could be hypothesized that a reservoir could exist at the herd scale. Such a reservoir would facilitate tick reinfection following tick inactivity periods, subsequent transmission to other cattle and the circulation of various strains within the herd. An experimental study in sheep demonstrated that <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> can persist in the tissues of this theoretical reservoir, even though blood PCR analyses failed to detect infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It has also been shown that sheep are efficient reservoirs of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> even during the post-acute phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and thus these bacteria could periodically circulate in the blood and infect feeding ticks. Further studies are required to confirm the hypothesis that cattle could be considered as reservoirs, whether via long-term <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> persistence at the animal scale, and/or via active <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> circulation at herd scale, taking into account strain evolution in infected animals. This hypothesis is already reinforced by both our own results and by several previous studies.</p><p id="Par40">First, in our study, none of the French and German bovine strains clustered with <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains from other host species, which clustered into two distinct phylogenetic groups, separating horse and dog sequences from roe deer sequences. This was not unexpected as only a few cattle sequences had been associated with these two groups in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Secondly, recent multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis showed that cattle strains could be divided into two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the aforementioned study, the first group clustered only with red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>) strains, whereas the second clustered with strains isolated from various host species (roe deer, horses, dogs, humans, and sheep)<italic>.</italic> Cattle may represent accidental hosts for variants belonging to the second group, which also included sheep, another domestic ruminant species already recognized as an <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> reservoir species for its own strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These data are very interesting as cattle and sheep do not usually share grazing pastures in France and Germany. It is therefore unlikely that sheep are potential reservoirs of cattle strains in these countries. Conversely, both red deer (suspected reservoir hosts of cattle variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) and cattle herds themselves (current results) could be implicated according to ecological contexts, in the long term persistence of cattle-infecting strains. This role does not contradict the development of protective immunity at the scale of the individual animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as indicated by the young mean age of positive cattle in our study. In recently infected animals, there could be a window of time where <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> may escape the immune response via antigenic variations and other mechanisms. Moreover, according to our results, it seems likely that a new strain is able to co-exist with another strain and/or with the immune response previously developed by a cow against another strain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">For the first time, our study demonstrates the co-circulation of two major groups of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains within a cattle herd in France and the presence of multiple variants within the group(s) circulating in France and in Germany. Eleven cows were found infected several weeks to several months after previous sampling, with a variant belonging or not to the same group. Moreover, 42% of French cattle presented ambiguous sequence reads at one or several loci, suggestive of simultaneous infections with multiple strains. Interestingly, at each sampling time point, <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> DNA was detected in blood samples from several cattle without clinical signs. This suggests that cattle could play the role of reservoir for strains with bovine host tropism, at least at the herd level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
