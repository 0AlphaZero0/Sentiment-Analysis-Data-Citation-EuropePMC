It could degrade 2C4NP at temperatures from 20 to 40&#160;&#176;C and at pH values from 5 to 10, and degrade 2C4NP as high as 1.6&#160;mM. Kinetics assay showed that biodegradation of 2C4NP followed Haldane substrate inhibition model, with the maximum specific growth rate (<italic>&#956;</italic><sub>max</sub>) of 0.148/h, half saturation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) of 0.022&#160;mM and substrate inhibition constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>) of 0.72&#160;mM. Strain CNP-8 was proposed to degrade 2C4NP with hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-benzenetriol, BT) as the ring-cleavage substrate. The 2C4NP catabolic pathway in strain CNP-8 is significant from those reported in other Gram-negative 2C4NP utilizers. Enzymatic assay indicated that the monooxygenase initiating 2C4NP catabolism had different substrates specificity compared with previously reported 2C4NP monooxygenations. Capillary assays showed that strain CNP-8 exhibited metabolism-dependent chemotactic response toward 2C4NP at the optimum concentration of 0.5&#160;mM with a maximum chemotaxis index of 37.5. Furthermore, microcosm studies demonstrated that strain CNP-8, especially the pre-induced cells, could remove 2C4NP rapidly from the 2C4NP-contaminated soil. Considering its adaptability to pH and temperature fluctuations and great degradation efficiency against 2C4NP, strain CNP-8 could be a promising candidate for the bioremediation of 2C4NP-contaminated sites.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13568-018-0574-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>2-Chloro-4-nitrophenol</kwd><kwd>Hydroxyquinol pathway</kwd><kwd>Kinetics</kwd><kwd>Chemotaxis</kwd><kwd><italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. strain CNP-8</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Foreword Key Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>QYZDB-SSW-DQC013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31600085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Key Research Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1402300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par12">Chloronitrophenols (CNPs) are typical representatives of chlorinated nitroaromatics, which are widely utilized in synthesizing pesticides, fungicides, drugs, dyes, among others (Arora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">b</xref>). The natural formation of CNPs is extremely rare, and most of these xenobiotics in the environment are mainly coming from their manufacture and use, and the chemical or biological degradation of their derivatives. As the most common isomer of CNPs, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (2C4NP) is used for production of herbicide dicapthon and fungicide nitrofungin (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Due to its water solubility and high mobility, 2C4NP has caused serious contamination to agricultural soils and water resources, and has caused severe health effects to humans and animals (Arora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014a</xref>). Therefore, removal of 2C4NP from the environment has recently aroused wide concern.</p><p id="Par13">In the past decade, several physico-chemical methods have been reported on the degradation of 2C4NP (Priya and Madras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Verma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>); however, these methods are cost-consuming and do not yield complete mineralization of 2C4NP. Bioremediation process, which is more environmental-friendly and cost-effective in comparison with physico-chemical methods, has turned out to be a promising strategy for degradation of various nitrophenol pollutants (Chi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017a</xref>; Xu and Zhou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>). Moreover, microbial-based processes can be also effectively integrated with the activated sludge system which was already used in the conventional effluent treatment plants.</p><p id="Par14">Although 2C4NP is released into the environment for a relatively short period, several microorganisms have evolved their ability to degrade this xenobiotic (Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>; Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Tiwari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). The Gram-negative <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. strain SJ98 degraded 2C4NP with chlorohydroquinone (CHQ) as the ring-cleavage compound (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>), whereas the Gram-positive <italic>Rhodococcus imtechensis</italic> RKJ 300 degraded 2C4NP with hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-benzenetriol, BT) as the ring-cleavage compound (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. RKJ800, another Gram-negative 2C4NP-utilizer, was reported to initiate 2C4NP degradation with formation of CHQ, which was then dechlorinated to hydroquinone (HQ) (Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Due to its high toxicity, 2C4NP with concentration more than 0.5&#160;mM was reported to inhibit the growth of previously reported 2C4NP-utilizers (Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Tiwari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). Furthermore, most 2C4NP-utilizers were reported to degrade 2C4NP at neutral pH. Industrial wastewaters, especially the pesticide production wastewaters, may contain high concentration of 2C4NP and the pH often varies widely. Thus, the search for new microorganisms that can adapt to a wide pH range and degrade 2C4NP at high concentration is still of great scientific and industrial significance.</p><p id="Par15">In this study, <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. strain CNP-8 has ability to adapt a wide range of pH and temperature and utilize 2C4NP up to a concentration of 1.6&#160;mM, which is apparently higher than the maximum concentration degraded by previous 2C4NP-utilizers. Strain CNP-8 was proposed to degrade 2C4NP via the BT pathway, which was reported in a Gram-negative 2C4NP-degrading bacterium for the first time. The kinetics of 2C4NP degradation and the chemotaxis of 2C4NP by this strain was also investigated. Microcosm studies demonstrated that strain CNP-8 could be an efficient candidate for bioremediation application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strain, media and chemicals</title><p id="Par16">Strain CNP-8 was recently isolated from the pesticide-contaminated soil collected from Yantai, Shandong, China (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017b</xref>).

To investigate the effect of pH and temperature on 2C4NP degradation, biodegradation experiments were performed at different pH (4&#8211;10) and temperatures (20&#8211;40&#160;&#176;C). Glucose (0.2, 0.5 or 5&#160;g/L) was added into the MSM to study the effect of supplemented carbon source on 2C4NP degradation.

It is obvious that the inoculated strain CNP-8 played crucial role in removing 2C4NP in the contaminated soil, whereas the indigenous microorganisms seemed to have no ability to degrade 2C4NP. The 2C4NP degradation rate in inoculated non-sterile soil (T3) is lower than that in inoculated sterile soil (T5).

The value of biomass yield coefficient decreased at high 2C4NP concentration, likely due to that more energy was required to overcome the substrate inhibitory effect when the initial 2C4NP concentration was too high.

Both CBQ and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone were not detected during 2C4NP degradation is likely due to that they were easily reduced to CHQ and BT, respectively by nonenzymatic transformation, in line with the hypotheses of nonenzymatic reduction of other quinone compounds (Xun and Webster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>; Perry and Zylstra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>; Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>; Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>).

Pandey et al. have reported that <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. strain SJ98 initiated 2C4NP degradation with formation of <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenol, which was then transformed to BT via 4-nitrocatechol (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C) (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>); however, subsequent genetic and biochemical identification suggested CHQ pathway is likely the actual pathway of 2C4NP catabolism in this strain (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B) (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). In this study, BT was identified as the ring cleavage substrate during 2C4NP degradation by strain CNP-8. This clearly reveals that the removal of chloro group occurs before ring cleavage during 2C4NP catabolism in strain CNP-8, whereas the chloro group was removed after ring cleavage in strain SJ98. Although the removal of chloro group also occurs before ring cleavage during 2C4NP degradation by <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. RKJ800 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D), HQ rather than BT was identified as the ring cleavage substrate (Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). <italic>Rhodococcus imtechensis</italic> RKJ 300, a Gram-positive 2C4NP-utilizer, was reported to degrade 2C4NP with BT as a ring cleavage substrate, which was then transformed to maleylacetate (&#955;<sub>max</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;243&#160;nm) by BT dioxygenase (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). In present study, although the ring fission product of BT was not identified, enzymatic assay clearly showed that the product of BT had a &#955;<sub>max</sub> of 320&#160;nm (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3B), apparently different from the spectral property of maleylacetate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 2C4NP degradation via the BT pathway in a Gram-negative 2C4NP utilizer, and this finding could enhance our understanding of the diversity of metabolic pathways of microbial 2C4NP degradation.</p><p id="Par41">More interestingly, most 2C4NP-utilizers including <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. strain SJ98 (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>), <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. strain RKJ800 (Arora and Jain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>) and <italic>Rhodococcus imtechensis</italic> RKJ 300 (Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>) were also able to grow on PNP. In particular, both the single-component 2C4NP monooxygenase (PnpA) from the Gram-negative strain SJ98 (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>) and the two-component 2C4NP monooxygenase (PnpA1A2) from the Gram-positive strain RKJ 300 (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) were reported to be able to catalyze the monooxygenation of 2C4NP and PNP. In contrast, enzymatic assay in present study clearly revealed that the monooxygenase involved in 2C4NP catabolism in strain CNP-8 was unable to catalyze the transformation of PNP, indicating its special substrate spectrum as compared to other reported 2C4NP monooxygenations. Now, the purification and characterization of enzymes involved in 2C4NP catabolism in strain CNP-8 is in progress, and the genetic characterization of strain CNP-8 will be the subject of further work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
