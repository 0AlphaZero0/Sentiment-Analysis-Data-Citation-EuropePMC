The highest OR was obtained in never smokers (OR = 2.59).AbstractLittle is known whether genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies interact to increase bladder cancer risk. Recently, we identified two- and three-variant combinations associated with a particular increase of bladder cancer risk in a urinary bladder cancer case&#x02013;control series (Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors at TU Dortmund (IfADo), 1501 cases, 1565 controls). In an independent case&#x02013;control series (Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study, NBCS, 1468 cases, 1720 controls) we confirmed these two- and three-variant combinations. Pooled analysis of the two studies as discovery group (IfADo-NBCS) resulted in sufficient statistical power to test up to four-variant combinations by a logistic regression approach. The New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (2080 cases and 2167 controls) were used as a replication series. Twelve previously identified risk variants were considered. The strongest four-variant combination was obtained in never smokers. The combination of rs1014971[AA] near apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A) and chromobox homolog 6 (CBX6), solute carrier family 1s4 (urea transporter), member 1 (Kidd blood group) (SLC14A1) exon single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1058396[AG, GG], UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A complex locus (UGT1A) intron SNP rs11892031[AA] and rs8102137[CC, CT] near cyclin E1 (CCNE1) resulted in an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.59 (95% CI = 1.93&#x02013;3.47; P = 1.87 &#x000d7; 10&#x02212;10), while the individual variant ORs ranged only between 1.11 and 1.30. The combination replicated in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (ORunadjusted = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.10&#x02013;2.33; P = 0.013). The four-variant combination is relatively frequent, with 25% in never smoking cases and 11% in never smoking controls (total study group: 19% cases, 14% controls).

Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants at 15 locations associated with UBC risk (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the identified variants show very small odds ratios (ORs) ranging between 1.11 and 1.24 (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An exception is the homozygous deletion variant of <italic>glutathione S-transferase M1</italic> (<italic>GSTM1</italic>) with an OR ranging between 1.28 and 1.70 in large studies with a mean OR of about 1.43 in Caucasians (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#8211;8</xref>).</p><p>Relatively little is known whether the identified genetic variants interact to modulate UBC risk (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). An open question is to which extent the common occurrence of several risk variants in an individual enhances risk. Recently, two large studies used a weighted allele score (or polygenic risk score) for each individual to model the consequences of common occurrence of risk alleles (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the approach of these two studies, each analysed variant was assigned a score from zero to two risk alleles, which were summed to an overall weighted score for each individual. Weights were based on the estimated OR of each variant. Subsequently, ORs of the score quartiles were estimated. Analysis of 12 variants in the study group of Garc&#237;a-Closas <italic>et al</italic>. by this technique resulted in an OR of 2.94 for the highest scores (&gt;75% quantile) compared with the lowest (&lt;25% quantile) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Similarly, analysis of seven single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in a Chinese study group resulted in an OR of 2.58 (&gt;75 versus &lt;25% quantile) (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A limitation of this weighted allele score approach is that it does not identify the specific genetic variants that in combination enhances UBC risk as it does not model particular interactions of SNPs. Therefore, in 2012, our group applied a logistic regression approach in which all possible combinations of seven high-risk variants were considered (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This approach identified specific three-variant combinations, where carriers of three high-risk alleles had higher ORs than carriers of only one of the alleles (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study in the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors at TU Dortmund (IfADo) case&#8211;control series in 2012 was that an independent study group for replication was not available. Also, higher order than three-variant combinations could not be studied because the case numbers in individual risk combination subgroups became smaller than 100, which did not allow analysis with sufficient statistical power. Meanwhile, the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (NBCS), an independent ongoing case&#8211;control series comprising 1468 cases and 1720 controls (in the present analysis), has become available for this purpose (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#8211;18</xref>). In the present study, we used this independent group to replicate the three-variant combinations previously identified in the total IfADo case&#8211;control series. In addition, the IfADo and NBCS case-control series were combined to achieve sufficiently high case numbers to identify four-variant combinations. These four-way combinations were further explored in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;21</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We used 2969 cases and 3285 controls from two case&#8211;control series in Germany (the multicentric IfADo case&#8211;control series, 1501 cases/1565 controls) and the Netherlands (NBCS, 1468 cases/1720 controls) with complete genotype data for the 12 investigated genetic variants as a discovery group and 2080 cases and 2167 controls from the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies with complete genotype data as a replication series (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1, is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Study group characteristics of the discovery and replication series</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="fn-01"><p>For detailed information on the analysed variants, see Supplementary Table 1, available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online. </p></fn><fn id="fn-02"><p>IQR, interquartile range (Q75&#8211;Q25%); SD, standard deviation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="s3"><title>IfADo case&#8211;control series</title><p>In total, 1501 confirmed UBC cases and 1565 controls without malignant disease of European descent of four case&#8211;control series from Germany and Hungary were collected by the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors at TU Dortmund (IfADo).

In a first step of the present study, we performed similar analyses in the NBCS and estimated the individual and combination effects. Unadjusted ORs of the individual variants with respect to UBC risk were similar between both study groups (Supplementary Tables 1B, 2). In both study groups, IfADo and NBCS, the lowest <italic>P</italic> values were obtained for the <italic>GSTM1</italic> deletion variant and for rs9642880[TT]. Moreover, the previously reported strongest two- and three-variant combinations identified in the IfADo study group (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) resulted in similar unadjusted ORs in the NBCS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The top 10 two-variant combinations identified in the IfADo study group were all significant also in the NBCS and the ORs obtained from both independent groups never differed by more than 0.14 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Also, the top 10 three-variant combinations identified in the IfADo study group were all significant in the NBCS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

Unadjusted ORs of the individual variants were also quite similar between both study groups stratifying for smoking habits (Supplementary Table 3). In current and never smokers, case numbers were too low (<italic>N</italic> &lt; 100 per risk group in cases and in controls) to allow a comparison of the NBCS and the IfADo study groups (Supplementary Table 4, available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online). However, in ever and former smokers when case and control numbers exceeded <italic>N</italic> = 100, similar ORs were obtained in both study groups (Supplementary Table 4, available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online).

Furthermore, we added both&#8212;interactions and corresponding individual variants&#8212;in each step to the model (Supplementary Figure 1B and Table 6C, available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online). For the improvement of the model fit, the interactions were more relevant than the corresponding main effects. Additionally, we tested the significance of each two-, three- and four-way interaction in the presence of the corresponding individual variants as main effects separately for each top combination (Supplementary Table 7). Remarkably, the four-way interactions were still significant in a logistic regression model that also contained the corresponding main effects. For instance, in never smokers, the interaction term rs1014971[AA] &#215; rs1058396[AG, GG] &#215; rs11892031[AA] &#215; rs8102137[CC, CT] (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.0003) was significant in a common model containing also rs1014971[AA] (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.4318), rs1058396[AG, GG] (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.1236), rs11892031[AA] (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.1207) and rs8102137[CC, CT] (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.8005), which were not significant in presence of the interaction term (Supplementary Table 7).</p><p>The analyses of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> focussed on a single top performing combination.

A similar pattern was obtained for the ten top combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) compared with the best one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The &#8220;top ten approach&#8221; additionally offered the advantage that the assumed increase/decrease in the unadjusted ORs by increase of the number of combined variants could be analysed by pairwise comparisons.

For both, ever and current smokers, the deletion of phase II detoxifying <italic>GSTM1</italic> was identified as the most significant variant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>GSTM1</italic> was not among the best four-variant combinations in former smokers. Instead former and ever smokers overlapped in rs9642880 near the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene.

To identify the most characteristic differences between ever smokers (considering also former and current smokers) and never smokers, we analysed the top ten combinations of two, three and four variants in these subgroups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, Supplementary Tables 8 and 9, available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online). The frequency of the specific variant among the top ten combinations was analysed, and significant differences between the four groups were analysed by a chi-squared test.

So, <italic>GSTM1</italic> is a typical &#8220;current smoker variant&#8221;, (ii) rs1014971 near <italic>APOBEC3A</italic> was more frequent in never smokers, compared with ever, current and former smokers indicating that this variant is a typical &#8220;never smoker SNP&#8221; and (iii) rs9642880 near <italic>MYC</italic> was more frequent in ever and former smokers compared with never smokers and more frequent in former compared with current smokers. Therefore, rs9642880 is a typical &#8220;former smoker SNP&#8221; and seems to be relevant for cigarette smoke exposed individuals only if smoking occurred in the past with no current exposure.</p><table-wrap id="T4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Variants in the ten best four-variant combinations differ between smokers and never smokers</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="fn-06"><p>Subgroups are compared regarding the occurrence of each variant in the ten best combinations by chi-squared or fishers exact tests.

For this purpose, corresponding SNP data from 2080 additional bladder cancer cases and 2167 controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were available from the published New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;21</xref>). The rs1014971[AA] &#215; rs1058396[AG, GG] &#215; rs11892031[AA] &#215; rs8102137[CC, CT] combination in never smokers was confirmed in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies resulting in increasing (unadjusted) ORs of 1.32 for the single variant to 1.60 for the four-variant combinations, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>). Similarly, the four-variant combination in current smokers (<italic>GSTM1 null</italic> &#215; rs11892031 [AA] &#215; rs1058396[AG, GG] &#215; rs1014971[AA, AG]) was confirmed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>). In contrast, the four-variant combination in former smokers (rs9642880[TT] &#215; rs8102137[CC, CT] &#215; rs1495741[AA, AG] &#215; rs17674580[CC, CT]) could not be replicated, possibly due to the fact that former smokers are much more heterogeneous compared with never or current smokers. The adjusted logistic regression (Supplementary Table 5C) led to similar results as the unadjusted analysis shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Discussion</title><p>An important question is whether genetic variants can interact leading to higher ORs for combined high-risk alleles than the combination of individual variants alone. In a previous study, we identified three-variant combinations of seven confirmed UBC risk variants in the IfADo case&#8211;control series and obtained remarkable differences between ever and never smokers (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the present study, we used the NBCS to confirm the previous results. Importantly, all frequent three-variant combinations could be replicated. In particular, we confirmed the results for the total study group and the subgroups of ever and former smokers. Three-variant combinations identified in current and never smokers were not significant, possibly because of their low frequency (<italic>N</italic> &lt; 100 in cases and in controls).</p><p>As results and study group characteristics were comparable, we combined both case&#8211;control series to analyse up to four-variant combinations with sufficient power. Moreover, five further UBC risk variants were added to the combination analysis. We restricted the analysis to combinations present in at least 100 cases and controls to obtain robust results. We also restricted the analysis to four-variant combinations to avoid a bias towards frequent variants in higher fold combinations.</p><p>The strongest four-variant combination in never smokers was obtained for the high-risk alleles of rs1014971[AA] near <italic>APOBEC3A</italic> and <italic>chromobox homolog 6</italic>, the <italic>SLC14A1</italic> exon SNP rs1058396[AG, GG], the <italic>UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A complex locus</italic> intron SNP rs11892031[AA] and rs8102137[CT, CC] near <italic>CCNE1</italic>. The combination resulted in an unadjusted OR of 2.59 (95% CI = 1.93&#8211;3.47, <italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 1.87 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This four-variant combination was still relatively frequent, with 25 and 11% in cases and controls, respectively. The relatively high OR of the combination (OR = 2.59) is remarkable considering that the individual ORs were small (OR = 1.11&#8211;1.30; Supplementary Tables 3K, L). Furthermore, the individual variants were not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#8805; 0.1207) in a common logistic regression model in presence of the four-way interaction effect (<italic>P</italic><italic>=</italic> 0.0003; Supplementary Table 7). LR tests also showed that the increase from two- to four-variant combinations led to a significant increase in ORs for each step. Next, we tested whether the four-variant combination in never smokers (rs1014971[AA] &#215; rs1058396[AG, GG] &#215; rs11892031[AA] &#215; rs8102137[CC, CT]), identified in the combined IfADo-NBCS study group, could be confirmed in an independent case&#8211;control series, the published New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;21</xref>). The increased risk replicated in this group (OR<sub>unadjusted</sub> = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.10&#8211;2.33, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0130) with similar frequencies of the combination (18% in cases, 12% in controls, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>).</p><p>The main effect in never smokers, i.e. the most important individual variant, of the four-variant combination was attributable to rs1014971[AA]. This SNP maps to an intergenic region close to the <italic>chromobox homolog 6</italic> and <italic>APOBEC3A</italic> genes (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic>Chromobox homolog</italic> genes have been reported to be involved in regulation of heterochromatin while <italic>APOBEC3A</italic> seems to be associated with genetic instability (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27&#8211;29</xref>). The second SNP in the four-variant combination rs1058396[AG, GG] is a <italic>SLC14A1</italic> exon SNP (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). SLC14A1 is a urea transporter in the bladder which influences urine concentration as measured by specific gravity (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The third variant of the four-variant combination was rs11892031[AA], an intron SNP of the phase II metabolism gene <italic>UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A complex locus</italic> involved in glucuronidation (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Variant number four in the combination was rs8102137[CC, CT] near <italic>CCNE1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic>CCNE1</italic> is involved in cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In conclusion, the four strongest interacting SNPs for never smokers seem to be associated with the biological processes of chromatin modification, genetic stability, detoxification and proliferation. This leads to the question why there is an interaction effect between these variants. We speculate that the interacting variants seem to belong to completely different biological processes, which may be assigned to detoxification, proliferation and DNA stability, thereby covering a broad set of functions relevant for carcinogenesis, instead of focusing on a specific single function. However, this interpretation should be treated with caution, since little is known about the functions of the variants themselves, let alone the combinations.</p><p>Increased ORs for the strongest four-variant combinations in the combined IfADo-Nijmegen study group were obtained in the never as well as the current smokers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3A</xref>). The results of both four-variant combinations were confirmed in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies, although ORs were numerically lower (but <italic>P</italic> values still significant; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>), which is not unusual for analysis of an independent replication series. The strongest interaction of the entire study, the four-variant combination in never smokers, is characterized by a monotonous trend, where each added variant leads to increased ORs. However, also other scenarios were obtained. The four-variant combinations in current and former smokers show a non-monotonous trend with a decreased OR by the two-variant combination but increased ORs associated with the following variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3A</xref>). Such combinations are possible because the applied approach searches for the strongest variant combination independently within all two-, three- and four-variant combinations&#8212;ignoring that a best lower fold combination has been found already. Remarkably, the previous set of combined variants usually kept stable with increasing numbers of combined variants. So, the switch from a protective two-variant combination to a risk combination of three and four variants is easily explained: Either low risk genotypes were added to the low-risk genotype of the most important variant in the subgroup (<italic>GSTM1 positive</italic> for current smokers, rs9642880[GG, GT] for former smokers) or vice versa high-risk genotypes were combined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3A</xref>). Importantly, the four-variant combinations as well as the non-monotonous trend were confirmed in the New England and Spanish Bladder Cancer Studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3B</xref>).</p><p>The variants of the best four-variant combination of the subgroup of ever smokers showed no overlap with that of the never smokers. In smokers, the strongest variant of the four-variant combination was the <italic>GSTM1</italic> deletion. <italic>GSTM1</italic> is known to be involved in detoxification of cigarette smoke carcinogens (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33&#8211;35</xref>). Already in previous publications, the relevance of this polymorphism has been demonstrated particularly in smokers and individuals occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Interestingly, after cessation of occupational and/or environmental exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the <italic>GSTM1</italic> polymorphism was no longer relevant (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The previous interaction analysis of the IfADo case&#8211;control series comprising seven of the investigated polymorphisms also identified the <italic>GSTM1</italic> deletion as the most important variant in smokers (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The second variant in the four-variant ever smoker combination was rs9642880, a variant approximately 30000 bases upstream of <italic>MYC</italic> which has been reported to be associated with RNA levels of the oncogene (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The biological function of the third and the fourth variant in the combination, the glycoprotein <italic>PSCA</italic> and the microtubule regulating <italic>TACC3</italic> variants rs2294008 and rs798766 in relation to bladder carcinogenesis is still not fully understood (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39&#8211;43</xref>). Interactions of the <italic>GSTM1</italic> deletion, rs9642880 and rs2294008 but not rs798766 with smoking habits have also been found in a large UBC study (3942 cases, 5680 controls) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Missense SNP rs2294008 alters the <italic>PSCA</italic> start codon and results in less promoter activity but more mRNA (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). <italic>PSCA</italic> owning an androgen responsive element in its promoter region influences <italic>PSCA</italic> expression (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It is hypothesized that gender-specific UBC risk might be modulated via androgen responsive element-depending <italic>PSCA</italic> transcription activity in presence of rs2294008. However, relevant signalling pathways remain unclear (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The functional role of the <italic>TACC3</italic> intron SNP rs798766 is still unclear (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). TACC3 is a centrosomal adaptor protein that is involved in spindle microtubule dynamics during cell division (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In particular, TACC3 protein complexes seem to be essential for mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics and, hence, for prevention of genomic instability (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, the observed association of rs798766 with UBC risk might also be due to the nearby <italic>fibroblast growth factor receptor 3</italic> (<italic>FGFR3</italic>) gene. Fibroblast growth factor receptors play a key role in activation of signalling pathways, for instance, the RAS/MAPK, phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLC&#947;1), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways that regulate proliferation, migration and differentiation (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Point mutations in the <italic>FGFR3</italic> gene and increased expression of the variant gene are common in low-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial bladder carcinomas (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45&#8211;47</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type <italic>FGFR3</italic> is more common in invasive than in non-invasive tumors (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Recently, <italic>FGFR3-TACC3</italic> gene fusions have been detected in UBC as well as glioblastoma patients and cell lines (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46&#8211;48</xref>). The fusion seems to result in a loss of the C-terminus of <italic>FGFR3</italic> and an overexpression of the <italic>FGFR3-TACC3</italic> fusion product (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The protein seems to be highly oncogenic <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and can be assumed to induce signalling via the MAPK pathway in urothelial cells (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>It should be considered that differences in variant combinations were not only observed between ever and never smokers but also between current and former smokers. The subgroup of former smokers lost the &#8220;smoker variant&#8221; <italic>GSTM1</italic> in their best four-variant combination. Instead, the &#8220;never smoker SNP&#8221; rs8102137 5.8 kb upstream <italic>CCNE1</italic> occurs in the best four-variant combination of former smokers. The SNP rs9642880 near <italic>MYC</italic> is the strongest variant in the subgroup of former smokers. It is not present in the best four-variant combination of current smokers, nor of never smokers. However, it should be taken into account that this four-variant combination identified in the combined IfADo-Nijmegen case&#8211;control series was not confirmed in the replication series and should therefore be discussed with caution. Reasons for the discrepant result may be the general heterogeneity of the subgroup of former smokers, differences in definition and determination of a status as a former smoker which is associated with a higher degree of uncertainty than in case of current or never smokers. Or this observation could be a chance finding.</p><p>In conclusion, the present logistic regression based approach demonstrated that specific combinations of three to four variants confer UBC risk. The highest unadjusted OR was obtained for a four-variant combination in the subgroup of never smokers (OR = 2.59). Importantly, this four-variant combination was confirmed in an independent case&#8211;control series. Moreover, different SNP combinations were obtained for current smokers (OR = 1.61) and former smokers (OR = 2.13). The dominant SNP for never smokers is rs1014971 near <italic>APOBEC3A</italic>. The most important &#8220;smoker variant&#8221; is <italic>GSTM1</italic>, while former smokers shift to rs9642880 near <italic>MYC</italic>. The study demonstrates the strength of logistic regression approaches for SNP interactions that identify specific interaction profiles. This present study further supports the concept, according to which individual polymorphisms add only little to overall UBC risk, but the combined presence of many individually weak SNPs leads to substantially increased ORs (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> online.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Funding</title><p>KI&#8217;s work has been supported by Deutsche Forschungs gemeinschaft (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 &#8220;Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Analysis&#8221;, project C4.
