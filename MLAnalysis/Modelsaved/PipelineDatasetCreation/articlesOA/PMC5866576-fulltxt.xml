Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied. We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Viruses from Africa (clade C) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula (clades A and B) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests. Viruses from West (Nigeria, Burkina Faso) and North (Morocco) Africa form a subclade, C1, that shares clade-defining genetic signatures including deletions in the accessory gene <italic>ORF4b</italic>. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice. A reverse genetics-derived recombinant MERS-CoV (EMC) lacking <italic>ORF4b</italic> elicited higher type I and III IFN responses than the isogenic EMC virus in Calu-3 cells. However, <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletions may not be the major determinant of the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to zoonotic potential. There is an urgent need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal&#8211;human interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MERS</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">US National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">HHSN272201400006C</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">US National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">PO1 AI060699</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">Commisioned Grant from the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food &amp; Health Bureau, Hong Kong</funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">Nil</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">DR772/12-1</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5">Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">206298</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs6"><funding-source id="sp6">Mahen Postdoctoral Fellowship, Fred Huthinson Cancer Center</funding-source><award-id rid="sp6">Nil</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remains a disease of global public health concern (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Many human infections are zoonotic in origin, but some result from clusters of human-to-human transmission, especially within hospitals and health care facilities (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Zoonotic disease has been reported from the Arabian Peninsula, and dromedary camels are the only confirmed source of zoonotic infection (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is also endemic in dromedaries in Africa, where the majority of dromedary camels are found (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), zoonotic infections have not been reported from Africa. Hypotheses for this pattern of zoonotic disease include genetic differences in the viruses; cultural, behavioral, or dietary differences in interactions between humans and camels and camel products; or unnoticed human cases through lack of awareness and surveillance in African countries. Data on phylogenetic and phenotypic characterization of MERS-CoV from Africa are limited. We previously reported that MERS-CoV from Egypt and Nigeria appear to be phylogenetically distinct from those currently circulating in the Arabian Peninsula (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).

Three viruses from Burkina Faso, one from Morocco, nine from Nigeria, and three from Ethiopia were fully sequenced, and an additional virus from Ethiopia was sequenced from the S2 gene region to the 3&#8242; end of the genome (5,126 nt).

Targeted sequencing of the <italic>ORF3</italic>/4b gene region was done on additional African camel viruses from which full genomes could not be obtained because viral load was too low.

The type i/v deletion found in BF785 and BF434 viruses truncated the ORF4b protein from 246 aa found in the EMC prototype MERS-CoV EMC to 14 aa, deleting the whole of the nuclear localization signal as well as the enzymatic domain that cleaves 2&#8242;,5&#8242;-oligoadenylate (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Nig1657 retains the nuclear localization signal and part of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain and is truncated to 71 aa. All these deletions disrupt the PDE catalytic site. ORF4b encoded a polypeptide known to be an IFN antagonist (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The N-terminal region of ORF4b encodes the nuclear localization signal. Deletion of this region abrogated nuclear localization and led to a loss of suppression of IFN-&#946; induction via the IRF3- and IRF7-signaling pathways. However, it did not affect suppression of IFN-&#946; via Tank-binding kinase 1 and I&#954;B kinase, which was demonstrated in transient transfection experiments and appears to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of ORF4b (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These data come from ORF4b protein overexpression and may or may not be physiologically relevant. The two Saudi Arabian clade B viruses Riyadh_1 and Bisha_1 had less extensive deletions of the PDE domain, although they also disrupt the PDE catalytic site.</p><p>Deletions and insertions at the 3&#8242; end of <italic>ORF3</italic> from viruses from Nigeria (including Nig1657) and five viruses from Burkina Faso (BF697, BF698, BF748, BF750, and BF764) resulted in the truncation of the 103-aa ORF3 polypeptide to 98, 88, or 84 aa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718769115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Fig. S3</ext-link>).

The amino acid sequence of the Egyptian virus NRCE-HKU270, an East African virus most closely related to the West African clade C1 viruses, is also included for comparison. The amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain of the spike proteins of the BF785 had amino acid substitution T424I, while Nig1657 had amino acid substitutions L495F and L588F. None of these amino acid substitutions was at the receptor-interacting interface of the spike protein and thus likely did not affect the affinity of the protein for the host receptor, although L495F is close to the interacting interface.</p><p>The antigenic similarity of BF785 and Nig1657 was compared with prototype strain EMC, AH13, and Egypt NRCE-HKU270 by microneutralization tests using serum from a dromedary camel immunized with a vaccinia-vectored MERS-CoV strain EMC spike vaccine (provided by B.

However, while zoonotic MERS has been repeatedly reported from the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic human disease has not so far been reported in Africa. There are, however, little viral genetic data from MERS-CoV in Africa. To begin to address this knowledge gap, we genetically characterized MERS-CoV from Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Morocco, and Ethiopia. We found that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedaries in Africa are phylogenetically distinct from viruses in the Arabian Peninsula. There are no homoplasies (convergent mutations) shared between the African and Saudi clades, suggesting no recombination between these lineages (consistent with a single or just a few introductions into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and limited further contact between the lineages). MERS-CoV from North and West Africa form a distinct subclade (clade C1) within those from Africa, and they have characteristic deletions in <italic>ORF4b</italic>, an accessory gene that has been previously reported to be an IFN antagonist (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Some of these viruses also have partial deletions of <italic>ORF3</italic>. The biological function of ORF3 still remains unclear. Dromedary camel movements in Africa occur more in the north&#8211;south direction with movements between countries such as Morocco, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria being more much likely than east&#8211;west movements, i.e., between West Africa and Ethiopia or Egypt (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This may explain the observed separate phylogenetic clustering of viruses from West and North Africa as clade C1, which were also the viruses that have the <italic>ORF4b</italic> gene deletions. Although genetically distinct, MERS-CoV from West Africa were antigenically similar to the prototype EMC virus (clade A), AH13 (clade B), and Egypt NRCE-HKU270 (clade C, nonclade C1) viruses in microneutralization tests. Thus, it is likely that neutralizing antibodies elicited by the prototype strain EMC in putative vaccines are likely to be cross-protective against these genetically diverse African strains.</p><p>We successfully isolated representative clade C1 viruses from West Africa (BF785 from Burkina Faso and Nig1657 from Nigeria) for phenotypic characterization in comparison with human clade A (strain EMC) virus and a camel clade B (AH13) virus from Saudi Arabia. BF785 has the most extensive deletion of the ORF4b gene product, with loss of the whole PDE domain as well as the nuclear-localizing signal, while Nig1657 retains the nuclear-localizing domain and part of its PDE domain, although the PDE catalytic site is lost. Compared with EMC and AH13, both BF785 and Nig1657 viruses had significantly reduced replication competence in Calu-3 cells as assessed by titration of infectious virus at 24 and 48 h post infection at MOIs of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. In contrast, we had previously demonstrated that the East African dromedary/Egypt-NRCE-HKU-270/2013 had comparable or better replication competence than EMC and AH13 viruses in Calu-3 cells (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Compared with EMC and AH13, the BF785 virus also had reduced replication competence in vivo in the lungs of Ad5-hDPP4&#8211;transduced mice and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. The mouse model used does not manifest overt clinical disease, and thus a comparison of disease severity was not possible (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is notable that the impaired virus replication competence of the West African viruses in human respiratory epithelial cells does not appear to impair the fitness of these viruses in transmitting between dromedaries because these viruses are widespread in camels in West Africa (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Because BF785 and Nig1657 differ from EMC and AH13 in having deletions in the <italic>ORF4b</italic> gene, and because the ORF4b gene product is reportedly associated with evasion of host cell IFN defense mechanisms (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we further investigated whether the impaired replication competence correlated with a loss of such immune evasion in Calu-3 cells. In contrast to influenza H5N1, which was a potent inducer of IFN-&#946;, IFN-&#955;1, IP10, ISG15, and Mx1 by 24 h post infection, the four MERS-CoV had little effect in up-regulating these innate immune responses at 24 h post infection, suggesting that potent innate immune-evasion mechanisms remained active in all four coronaviruses despite the <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletion in BF785 and Nig1657 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Coronaviruses have multiple antagonists of IFN induction and signaling, and thus deletion of ORF4b by itself may not be decisive in this regard. By 48 h post infection, there was detectable induction of innate immune responses by some MERS-CoV, although this was still much lower than those elicited by H5N1 virus. Nig1657 also has deletions in <italic>ORF3</italic>. No consistent pattern was discerned between innate immune responses (or evasion of such responses) and the impaired virus replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Taking these findings together, we conclude that the impaired replication phenotype was not associated with the lack of innate immune evasion. In contrast, it was recently reported that a recombinant MERS-CoV clone with <italic>ORF3</italic>/4/5 deletions had reduced virus replication competence in Calu-3 (but not Vero) cells and in the lungs of human DPP4-transgenic mice, suggesting that the combined loss of these ORFs does lead to attenuation of the virus (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>To specifically investigate whether the <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletion contributed to reduced replication competence, we compared recombinant EMC (rgEMC-WT) with an isogenic virus that was deleted in <italic>ORF4b</italic> (rgEMC&#916;4b). We found rgEMC&#916;4b viral titers did not significantly differ from rgEMC-WT at 24 h replication, in contrast with BF785 and Nig1657 viruses where replication was significantly reduced at this time. Thus, the <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletions in BF785 and Nig1657 were likely not major contributors to the reduced virus replication observed in clade C1 virus-infected cells. At 48 h post infection rgEMC-WT replicated to modestly lower titers compared with rgEMC&#916;4b. The rgEMC&#916;4b virus elicited significantly higher mRNA expression of IFN-&#946;, IFN-&#955;1, CXCL10 (IP-10), ISG15, and MX1 in rgEMC&#916;4b-infected cells. Previous evidence for an IFN antagonist role for ORF4b protein (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) was based solely on the overexpression of <italic>ORF4b</italic>, while our data were generated from an isogenic deletion mutant virus. Increased mRNA of type I IFN and type III IFN as well as TNF-&#945; suggests that ORF4b has effects on IRF-3 as well as NF&#954;B pathways.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that BF785 and Nig1657 have reduced replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung and, in the case of BF785, also have reduced replication competence in Ad5-hDPP4&#8211;transduced mice (comparable experiments were not carried out with Nig1657). Although these viruses have deletions in <italic>ORF4b</italic>, this does not appear to be the major explanation for the reduced viral replication competence of clade C1 viruses. It is relevant that two clade B viruses, Riyadh_1_2012 and Bisha_1_2012, which also have <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletions, have previously been isolated from patients with severe human disease. Thus, <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletions by themselves are unlikely to contribute to altered zoonotic transmission of West African viruses. Furthermore, in previous experiments where EMC virus has been serially passaged in mice to derive mouse-adapted MERS-CoV, such mouse adaptation and increase in virulence for mice have often been associated with deletions or frameshift mutations in all the accessory proteins, including ORF5 (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Recently, a clade B MERS-CoV with a deletion in <italic>ORF4a</italic> (a different accessory gene) and a minor deletion in <italic>ORF3</italic> has been isolated from humans diagnosed as part of a hospital outbreak in Jordan (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). All 13 viruses from patients sampled during this outbreak had this <italic>ORF4a</italic> deletion, indicating that these viruses were transmissible in humans. <italic>ORF4a</italic> is also known to be an IFN antagonist acting by binding and antagonizing the dsRNA-binding protein PACT (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is not yet reported whether <italic>ORF4a</italic> deletions in these human MERS-CoV affect IFN responses or virus replication competence.</p><p>Differences in viral genes other than <italic>ORF4b</italic> or <italic>ORF3</italic> genes likely contribute to the impaired viral replication of BF785 and Nig1657. MERS-CoV BF785 and Nig1657 differ from EMC in several proteins, including nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp12, nsp13, nsl14, nsp15, and nsp16, the spike protein, <italic>ORF3</italic>/4/5 gene regions, and N protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718769115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Dataset S2</ext-link>). The spike protein is a crucial determinant of virus tropism and interspecies transmission. However, none of the amino acid differences between Arabian and West African viruses is in the receptor-binding interface.</p><p>The observation that <italic>ORF4b</italic>, <italic>ORF4a</italic>, and <italic>ORF3</italic> deletions appear to arise independently in clade B and C viruses and that <italic>ORF4b</italic> deletions are fixed in MERS-CoV from dromedaries West Africa may suggest that the virus is not yet fully adapted to camels and the presence of these genes is either neutral or slightly deleterious to virus growth in these settings. Given the propensity of viruses to discard unnecessary genetic information, these results suggest that these accessory proteins are advantageous in some other reservoir host species, perhaps bats. The time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for MERS-CoV, the &gt;99% nucleotide homology of viruses across a wide geographic area, the genetic instability of the virus in dromedaries, and the lack of endemic infection in dromedaries in parts of the world (e.g., Kazakhstan) (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) suggest that MERS-CoV has not been endemic in dromedary camels for very long. However, the presence of antibodies to a MERS-CoV&#8211;like coronavirus in dromedary sera from Africa and the Middle East collected 30 y ago indicates that the virus has been transmitting in camels for at least this period of time (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Taken together, these data may suggest that dromedaries, although currently the source of zoonotic infection, are themselves a relatively recent host of MERS-CoV and that the virus is still adapting to this species.</p><p>In conclusion, MERS-CoV in Africa are phylogenetically distinct but antigenically similar to those currently circulating in the Arabian Peninsula. Clade C1 MERS-CoV that are enzootic in dromedaries in West Africa had lower replication competence in human respiratory epithelium in vitro, in cultures of human bronchus and lung ex vivo, and in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. The genetic determinants of this reduced virus replication competence of clade C1 viruses remains to be established. It is possible that these observations may be relevant to explain the apparent lack of zoonotic disease in West Africa. It is important to note that viruses from Egypt were not phenotypically different to those from the Arabian Peninsula, and thus there is no indication that MERS-CoV from East Africa have reduced zoonotic potential. These findings highlight the need for more extensive and sustainable surveillance and monitoring systems, especially in East Africa, including seroepidemiologic studies in humans regularly exposed to dromedaries, to ascertain whether unrecognized zoonotic MERS infections are taking place.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s6"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p content-type="flushleft">Details of the study sites (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), specimen collection, and RT-PCR detection of MERS RNA are detailed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1718769115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>Supporting Information</italic></ext-link>.
