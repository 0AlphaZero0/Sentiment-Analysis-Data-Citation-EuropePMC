Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (<italic>Ptpn5</italic>). We show that <italic>Ptpn5</italic> is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CPRIT</institution></funding-source><award-id>RP110471-P3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conneely</surname><given-names>Orla M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funding from CPRIT grant RP110471-P3 to OMC.

Estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;) and progesterone receptors (PRs) play a central role in regulating both postnatal development of the mammary gland and breast cancer by promoting proliferation of mammary epithelial and breast cancer stem/progenitor cells [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The majority (~75%) of breast cancers are ER&#945; positive, hormone-dependent for growth and responsive to endocrine therapy [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Endocrine therapy using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) to block estrogen production or antiestrogen selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) remain the most widely used and most effective treatment for breast cancers in women who have tumors positive for ER&#945; [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, both SERMS and AIs have been shown to confer substantial protection (&gt;50%) against ER+ breast cancer development leading to FDA approval of tamoxifen and raloxifene to reduce BC risk in women at high risk of BC development [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The tumor suppressor gene p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers occurring at a frequency of &gt;25% in luminal and &gt;80% in triple negative BCs [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and <italic>p53</italic> mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194913.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While the vast majority (~75%) of p53 mutations are associated with loss of p53 function, a subset of mutations also lead to aberrant gain of oncogenic functions [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The loss or mutation of p53 in mice leads to enhanced tumorigenic potential by promoting cell proliferation and genomic instability [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. p53 null mice die at 4 to 5 months of age due to lymphosarcomas but do not develop mammary tumors at an appreciable level [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194913.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To directly address the consequences of p53 loss on mammary tumorigenesis, a p53 null mammary epithelium transplantation model has been developed. Transplantation of p53 null mammary epithelium into cleared fat pads of wild-type (WT) mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by development of spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The normal p53 null mammary epithelium is ER&#945; positive and responsive to ovarian steroid hormones that contribute to growth, functional differentiation and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, gene expression profiling for classification indicates that, like human tumors, p53 null mouse mammary tumors fall into multiple molecular groups, including luminal, basal-like and claudin-low subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Blockade of estrogen signaling by ovariectomy or antiestrogen treatment strongly reduces mammary tumorigenesis in p53 null mammary epithelium indicating that ovarian steroid hormones are required for tumorigenesis in p53 null mammary cells [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Indeed, short term exposure to tamoxifen in the p53 null model confers robust (&gt;90%) and sustained protection against mammary tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the cellular and molecular events associated with tamoxifen-induced protection against mammary tumorigenesis in the p53 null model remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study, we used genome-wide transcription profiling to determine whether persistent global changes in the ER&#945; responsive transcriptome contribute to the tumor protective effects observed after transient exposure of p53 null mammary glands to tamoxifen. We disclose the intrinsic changes in the ER&#945; responsive genes that are associated with tamoxifen-dependent tumor protection and we address the functional contribution of a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene, the protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN5 to tumor suppression in a xenograft model of p53 mutant human BC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>All donor and recipient mice were bred and maintained at Baylor College of Medicine.

Briefly, the inguinal (#4) mammary fat pads of three week old Balb/c WT mice were cleared. Five weeks after fat pad clearance, 1-mm<sup>2</sup> fragments of mammary duct from 8 week old female p53-null mice were transplanted into both cleared inguinal mammary fat pads. The transplanted cells take 8 weeks to completely fill the fat pad, at which point the cells assume a steady-state level of proliferation. Thus, tamoxifen treatment was started at 16 week old hosts&#8217; age to avoid any effects of the agents on the ability of the cells to grow and fill the fat pad. At 16 weeks of host age, mice received a 5mg tamoxifen (TAM) pellet or sham (control) pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) subcutaneously (SC) on the back. The pellets remained in place for 13 weeks before removal. At 4 weeks or 8 weeks after cessation of tamoxifen, all mice were injected with 17&#946;-Estradiol (100&#956;g SC).

Among these, we observed persistent changes in estrogen responsive growth factor signaling pathways including downregulation of amphiregulin, an essential ER&#945; regulated mediator of estrogen induced proliferation in the mammary gland [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194913.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and upregulation of growth inhibitory factors including <italic>Ptpn5</italic>. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a large family of enzymes which generally antagonize the actions of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). PTPs are responsible for modulating PTK activity by dephosphorylating various tyrosine residues on intracellular proteins. They also regulate ligand-mediated receptor signaling as well as cell cycle events [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Deregulation of PTPs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A recent study showed that PTPN12 is frequently compromised in a subset of TNBC by deletions, defective sequence variants, or loss of expression [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This suggests that HER2/EGFR and other RTK signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in non-HER2 amplified breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We identified <italic>Ptpn5</italic> as a novel direct target of ER&#945; whose expression is repressed by estrogen and upregulated by tamoxifen in the mammary gland. Our ER&#945; ChIP-seq analysis identified an ER&#945; binding site located in the distal downstream region of the <italic>Ptpn5</italic> gene that may regulate PTPN5 expression via long range chromatin interactions [<xref rid="pone.0194913.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>We found that PTPN5 expression is strongly correlated with improved DMFS in tamoxifen treated breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel prognostic marker of tamoxifen response. Functional validation of PTPN5 in tamoxifen sensitive, tamoxifen resistant and TNBC cells shows that activation of PTPN5 suppressed the EGF-induced MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Further, activation of PTPN5 potently inhibits tumor growth of breast cancer growth in a xenograft mouse model of p53 mutant TNBC, suggesting that PTPN5 acts as a tumor suppressor of breast cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings reveal that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a persistent reduction in mammary gland side branching morphogenesis and MEC proliferation which is associated with intrinsic changes in expression of a subset of estrogen regulated target genes in MECs after tamoxifen withdrawal. <italic>Ptpn5</italic>, a novel upregulated gene in tamoxifen exposed MECs, was identified as a novel potential biomarker of tamoxifen response with tumor suppressor activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194913.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Transient exposure to tamoxifen inhibits mammary ductal side-branching in the p53 null mammary gland.</title><p>(A) Schematic view of the p53 null transplantation into WT mice.
