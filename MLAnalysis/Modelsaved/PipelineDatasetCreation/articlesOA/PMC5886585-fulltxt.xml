Eastern box turtles (<italic>Terrapene carolina carolina</italic>) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wildlife diseases have caused mass mortality events in all vertebrate taxa, including mammals (white-nose syndrome), birds (West Nile virus), fish (infectious salmon anemia), amphibians (chytridiomycosis), and reptiles (snake fungal disease) [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These mortality events can threaten species survival, and in some cases, lead to extinction [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, emerging zoonotic diseases have been uncovered during wildlife mortality events (i.e. West Nile virus), highlighting the importance of these outbreaks from a public health perspective [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Investigation of wildlife disease outbreaks can identify etiologic agents, determine risk factors and population impacts, and lead to management recommendations to avoid or mediate future episodes&#8211;potentially impacting wildlife conservation, food security, and human health [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The dynamics of health, disease, and death in wildlife populations are inherently complex, and mortality investigations are most useful when conducted in conjunction with routine health surveillance programs which document &#8220;expected&#8221; causes and rates of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Historical data incorporating spatiotemporal factors can help identify patterns of disease and mortality associated with specific demographic groups, stocking densities, and landscape features, all of which can suggest mechanisms for pathogen transmission and maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Longitudinal data provide a context for identifying mortality events which are larger than expected, attributed to an unusual etiology, or which impact population size and viability. Health datasets which incorporate baseline health surveillance, spatiotemporal factors, and specific mortality investigations from longitudinally sampled populations therefore promote a greater understanding of the proximate causes and drivers of mortality events affecting species survival. Combined mortality investigation and health surveillance programs have been used to identify and address disease-related threats to several endangered species in the United States, including bubonic plague in black-footed ferrets (<italic>Mustela nigripes</italic>), avian vacuolar myelinopathy in bald eagles (<italic>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</italic>), and parasitism in Laysan ducks (<italic>Anas laysanensis</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>While mortality investigations yield valuable information for conservation, they are subject to some important biases. Identification of mortality events is most likely in areas which are highly populated or traveled, and in large, charismatic, or highly visible species [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Failure to detect mortality events is more common in remote areas, cryptic animals, and species in which remains are quickly scavenged [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Chelonians represent one of the most imperiled vertebrate groups, with over 60% of species considered threatened or worse [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Turtle population stability is highly impacted by removal of mature adults, especially females, due to a combination of delayed sexual maturity and low juvenile survivorship [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mortality events involving multiple individuals may therefore represent an important threat to chelonian population viability. However, due to the small size and cryptic nature of turtles in the family Emydidae, mortality events are infrequently reported and the opportunity to formulate targeted conservation strategies is lost [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Eastern box turtles (<italic>Terrapene carolina carolina</italic>) are experiencing range-wide declines due to a combination of anthropogenic factors and disease [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Disease-related mortality events, primarily associated with frog virus 3-like ranavirus (FV3), are reported for captive [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and translocated [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] box turtles, but few reports involve free-living populations. While FV3 represents a known cause of box turtle mortality, several novel pathogens including Terrapene herpesvirus 1 (TerHV1), box turtle adenovirus (BTADV), and an un-named <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp. (BTMyco) have been recently identified [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The impact of these pathogens on free-living populations and their relationship to mortality events is unclear. Characterization of natural mortality events is an important step towards improving baseline knowledge of box turtle health and disease, identifying potential threats, and forming effective conservation strategies for this species.</p><p>We have performed mortality investigations, health assessments, and multi-pathogen surveillance in several populations of Eastern box turtles since 2011.

Permission to work at each public field site was granted by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois (Protocols: 10051 and 13061). Euthanasia of some wild turtles encountered during this study was deemed necessary by a veterinarian (author MC Allender) due to the presence of severe clinical signs and overall grave prognosis for recovery. Euthanasia was carried out by a veterinarian (author MC Allender) using the following American Veterinary Medical Association and IACUC approved protocol: turtles were first heavily sedated using ketamine (100mg/kg IM, MWI Animal Health, Boise, ID 83705) and then euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital (390mg IV, Vortech Pharmaceutical Ltd, Dearborn, MI 48126).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study sites</title><p>Box turtle populations were surveyed at Forest Glen Nature Preserve (FGNP [40.01&#176;, -87.57&#176;]), Kennekuk Cove County Park (KCCP [40.19&#176;, -87.72]), and Kickapoo State Park (KSP [40.14&#176;, -87.74]) in east-central Illinois from April-October beginning in 2011. FGNP is an 1800 acre park composed primarily of beech-maple and oak-hickory forest bounded by the Vermillion River. KCCP contains 3000 acres of oak-hickory forest interspersed with small prairies bounded by the Middle Fork National Scenic River. KSP is a 2800 acre park situated on a reclaimed surface mine. It includes relatively young successional forests and the Middle Fork National Scenic River. Invasive plant species are actively removed at FGNP, but they are not removed and have become pervasive at KCCP and KSP. Natural and man-made wetlands are present at all sites.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Animal populations and sample collection</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Non-outbreak sampling</title><p>Routine turtle health assessment occurred using canine searches one to three times each active season (May, June/July, and September) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, teams of 3&#8211;4 dogs were used to locate eastern box turtles during a 2&#8211;4 hour search period. The search path was equivalent each time a site was visited, but due to the differences in topography, size, and hydrology, sampling efforts were not directly comparable between sites. Capture locations were recorded using global positioning software (GPS) via handheld devices (Garmin International Inc., Olathe, KS, USA). Date, time, and categorical habitat (field, forest, edge) and microhabitat (leaves, grass, brambles, soil, road, moist area) data were also recorded at each turtle location. Microhabitat classification was assigned based on the primary ground cover beneath and within a one foot radius of the turtle. Moist areas consisted of ephemeral bodies of water. Air and substrate temperature were collected at the start and stop of each turtle search, and the results were averaged and recorded for each animal encountered (Kestrel 3000 Weather Meter, Nielsen-Kellerman, Boothwyn, PA 19061; Taylor 9878 Digital Pocket Thermometer, Taylor Precision Products, Oak Brook, IL 60523).</p><p>Turtles were weighed to the nearest gram, categorized by sex and age class, and measured (straight carapace length (SCL), carapace height (CH), and straight carapace width (SCW)) to the nearest millimeter. Age class (adult vs. juvenile) was assigned based on carapace length and annuli count. Turtles with a carapace length less than 9 cm (3.5 in) and an annuli count less than or equal to seven were characterized as juveniles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sex was classified as male, female, or unknown based on plastron concavity and tail length. Blood samples (less than 0.8% body weight) were collected from the subcarapacial sinus into lithium heparin coated microtainers (Becton Dickinson Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417) for hematology and pathogen detection. Swabs of the oral cavity and choana were collected using cotton-tipped plastic handled applicators (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA 15275) and stored at -20&#176;C. A single veterinarian evaluated clinical signs (MCA). Physical examination abnormalities were recorded as present (1) or absent (0) for the carapace, plastron, appendages, tympanic membranes, integument, nares, and cloaca. The presence of diarrhea, ectoparasites, and clinical signs of upper respiratory disease (ocular discharge, blepharoedema, nasal discharge, oral discharge, oral plaques, and open mouth breathing) were coded as present (1) or absent (0). The marginal scutes were notched with a unique pattern for permanent identification [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Each turtle was released at its original capture site within six hours of initial contact.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Outbreak sampling</title><p>Outbreaks were identified by park or lab staff and targeted human searches were conducted every 1&#8211;3 days by lab staff. Searches were discontinued when 3 consecutive visits to the site failed to identify any new cases. Sampling and evaluation of live turtles was performed as described for non-outbreak turtles. In injured turtles, wound beds were flushed with sterile saline. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were collected with sterile cotton-tipped applicators, placed into transport media (Remel Stuart Transport Medium, Remel A.C.T. II, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and stored at 4&#176;C for 2&#8211;4 hours until submission to the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Turtles with severe clinical signs of illness (stuporous mentation, respiratory distress) were hospitalized for supportive care and monitoring. Turtles in moribund condition, or those that declined during hospitalization, were euthanized as described above. Euthanized turtles were either submitted for full necropsy with histopathology, or frozen at -20&#176;C for future testing.</p><p>Shells or freshly dead turtles found in the field were collected, double bagged, and transported to the lab on wet ice. GPS locations of the remains and categorical habitat and microhabitat data were recorded as previously described, and each animal was given a unique identification number. Samples of remaining soft tissue were collected, if present, and banked at -80&#176;C for future testing. Shells were stored at -20&#176;C. In 2015, a bone marrow sample was collected from the right bridge of each shell using a hand-held drill with sterilized bits [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bone marrow samples were stored at -20&#176;C until DNA extraction.</p><p>Live and dead amphibians were opportunistically collected from moist areas at each study site during visual encounter surveys as part of an ongoing demographic study. Up to five individuals of each species were humanely euthanized using an overdose of buffered tricaine methylsufate (3-Aminobenzoic Acid Ethyl Ester, Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO 61378) for vouchering with the Illinois Natural History Survey and either frozen at -20&#176;C or preserved in 100% ethanol (Decon Laboratories Inc., King of Prussia, PA 19406). In 2013, samples of liver and kidney were harvested from amphibians collected within the same stream as five deceased box turtles and stored at -20&#176;C for future qPCR pathogen testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Sample analysis</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Hematology</title><p>Packed cell volume (PCV) was determined using sodium heparinized microhematocrit tubes (Jorgensen Laboratories,Inc., Loveland, CO 80538) centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for five minutes.

We found that box turtle mortality occurs commonly and has the potential for reoccurrence at a single site. Pathogens were frequently detected before, during, and after mortality events; and FV3 was the most common cause of death. One mortality event was investigated in isolation, but led to the development of health assessment projects that characterized the other three outbreaks. The important findings and limitations of each event will now be reviewed.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>2011 &#8211;Necrotizing bacterial infection at forest glen nature preserve</title><p>In April, 2011 over 50 box turtles were found dead at a single location. Remains were completely skeletonized, precluding a definitive diagnosis. However, FV3 was not detected in banked shells, lowering the likelihood of one known cause of mass mortality [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Almost half of the live turtles were diagnosed with a necrotizing bacterial infection (NBI) based on histopathology (N = 2), consistent culture isolates (N = 4), and compatible clinical signs (N = 5). NBI are characterized by rapidly progressive soft tissue necrosis due to direct cellular damage from bacterial toxins, thrombosis, and the development of compartment syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Sepsis and toxemia can occur rapidly, contributing to a high mortality rate. NBI can develop secondary to relatively minor trauma such as needle sticks and insect bites, but in up to 50% of human cases no underlying cause is identified [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In human medicine, NBI are divided into three categories: Type I is due to polymicrobial infections and is most common, while Types II and III are due to monomicrobial infections with group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. or methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> sp., <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp., <italic>Aeromonas</italic> sp., and others, respectively. In Type I infections, common aerobic isolates include <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp., <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. <italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp. are the most common anaerobic isolates [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The syndrome identified in box turtles was clinically, histologically, and microbiologically consistent with a polymicrobial NBI. This diagnosis is rare in veterinary medicine, and even more unusual in reptiles. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, the only report of NBI in reptiles involves a series of monomicrobial <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> infections in farmed saltwater crocodiles (<italic>Crocodylus porosus</italic>), suspected to be associated with an environmental bacterial source [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. An environmental source of bacteria transmitted by inoculation of wounds or through the bite of insect vectors was also suspected in the present report. However, this cannot be confirmed because environmental samples were not collected for culture. Furthermore, interpretation of wound culture results should be approached with caution, as the causative agent may have either been outcompeted in culture, or may have been an organism which does not routinely grow in standard culture conditions [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The end of the outbreak was also poorly defined due to a lack of follow-up sampling at FGNP within the same year. While a novel disease syndrome was discovered during this mortality investigation, late recognition and lack of baseline health assessments reduced the quantity and quality of diagnostic information obtained. A routine health surveillance program was established at FGNP in 2012 and no additional mass mortalities have been identified, though an additional case of NBI was diagnosed and successfully treated in 2017.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>FV3 at kennekuk Cove County Park (2013) and kickapoo state park (2014, 2015)</title><p>Mortality events attributed to FV3 were identified at two sites in Illinois over the course of three years. FV3 has previously been associated with free-living eastern box turtle mortality events in Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New York, Georgia, West Virginia, and Maryland, encompassing approximately the entire range of the species [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. FV3 is typically diagnosed in box turtles during their active season (approximately April&#8211;October), but expected outbreak durations are poorly defined. In Kentucky, a suspected FV3 mortality event began in June and lasted for approximately 43 days [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Pennsylvania, recurrent mortality events began in late July or August and lasted approximately 60 days [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These reports used radio-telemetry to closely monitor turtles, facilitating early recognition and response to mortality events.</p><p>The FV3 outbreak at KCCP occurred in August and lasted 30 days, while both events at KSP were identified in July and ranged from 9&#8211;20 days. Outbreak identification in the present study was opportunistic, and the true duration of FV3 mortality events may be underestimated. However, all observed FV3 cases clustered both spatially and temporally, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Detection of FV3 during outbreaks, but not during pre and post outbreak surveillance, supports classification of FV3 as an epidemic disease in our study populations.</p><p>It is hypothesized that FV3 epidemics in box turtles are due to spillover from infected amphibians. This theory is supported by transmission studies documenting inter-class spread, a characteristic 3&#8211;4 week time lag between natural amphibian and chelonian infections, and field observations documenting concurrent FV3 infection in sympatric amphibians and box turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ranavirus-infected box turtles have been reported to congregate in wetlands, suggesting a potential route for contact and disease transmission between infected amphibians and turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The present report documented significantly higher odds of FV3 detection in box turtles occupying moist microhabitats used by FV3 positive amphibians. This lends statistical credence to anecdotal observations, supports microhabitat use as a predictor of FV3 infection in box turtles, and identifies ephemeral wetlands as a possible target for disease management interventions.</p><p>While FV3 was the ultimate cause of death in the outbreaks from 2013&#8211;2015, co-pathogen infections can modulate ranavirus mortality rates in amphibians and box turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and may have impacted the timing of infection or susceptibility of the animals in this report. In one study, captive eastern box turtles naturally co-infected with FV3, TerHV1, and BTMyco had a higher survival rate (63%) than turtles infected with FV3 alone (50%) [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the present study, mortality outcomes were unknown for most FV3 cases and the impact of co-pathogen infections on mortality rates could not be assessed directly. Anecdotally, blepharoedema and ocular discharge were identified more commonly in turtles with co-pathogen detection compared to those with single pathogens; though an improvement in sample size would be needed for rigorous statistical assessment of these findings. There were no consistent patterns of infection during any of the outbreak groupings, and neither single nor co-pathogen status were significant predictors of FV3 detection. Co-pathogen detection appears common preceding, during, and after box turtle mortality events, and the influence of co-pathogen infections on mortality outcomes warrants further study in both captive and natural settings.</p><p>Clinical signs of FV3 infection include blepharoedema, ocular, oral, and/or nasal discharge, oral plaques, respiratory distress, depression, cutaneous abscessation or erosions, cloacal plaques, edema, and death, though several of these signs are variably reported [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The only physical exam abnormalities significantly associated with FV3 detection in the present study were oral plaques and nasal discharge, but these signs were not consistently present between sites and years. Importantly, these clinical signs were indistinguishable from those associated with detection of BTMyco during the 2013 outbreak, and with previous reports of BTMyco infection in box turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Clinical signs alone are not a reliable method to diagnose FV3, and confirmatory testing must be pursued when investigating upper respiratory disease outbreaks in wild box turtles.</p><p>Clinical pathology changes in FV3 positive box turtles were limited to elevations in the heterophil count and the HL ratio (driven primarily by increased heterophils). Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies consistent with FV3 infection are sometimes visualized in box turtle blood smears, but they were not observed in affected turtles in the present report [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Red-eared sliders also show minimal hematologic changes during FV3 infection, with transient elevations in WBC and a persistent decrease in TS over time despite overwhelming systemic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. While hematology findings for FV3 positive chelonians are infrequently reported, available information indicates that complete blood counts have limited diagnostic utility for FV3 infection unless they are performed serially or at the population level to detect subtle changes [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is possible that clinically useful information may be gained from evaluation of additional CBCs in FV3-positive box turtles, but an increase in sample size is needed.</p><p>Ranavirus outbreaks can recur in herptile populations over the course of multiple years, though the mechanisms for persistence are unknown [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the present report, recurrent FV3 infection was observed within the same 0.2km area in KSP during 2014 and 2015. This location encompasses several ephemeral ponds used for amphibian breeding and multiple small fields heavily invaded by autumn olive (<italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic>) shrubs. These invasive plants are hypothesized to degrade box turtle habitat quality by eliminating access to fields, a favored site for foraging, thermoregulating, and nesting [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is unclear whether the recurrent ranavirus outbreaks may be related to poor habitat quality, habitat fragmentation, frequent contact with ephemeral ponds containing infectious amphibians, increased exposure to human disturbance in public parks, or other factors. However, one of the most useful outcomes of mortality investigation is identifying populations for targeted study, and the 2014 and 2015 mortality investigations at KSP accomplished this. We have since launched both a box turtle ratio-telemetry study and a sympatric amphibian health surveillance program focusing on the recurrent outbreak site. These projects will facilitate the collection of baseline health data and the characterization of future natural mortality events incorporating individual, environmental, and community ecological factors.</p><p>Potential limitations in the present study include small sample size, incomplete hematology data, and reliance upon molecular diagnostics for pathogen detection. Sample size is commonly problematic in wildlife mortality studies, especially for cryptic species [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The use of trained dogs has been proposed as a means to improve carcass recovery, and while we rely upon a canine search team to locate live turtles, their recovery of deceased turtles is limited [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Increasing the number of people involved in human searches, the search frequency, or investing in carcass recovery dogs may improve the number of turtles recovered during future mortality events, though imperfect detection will likely remain a significant hurdle.</p><p>The use of molecular diagnostics for detecting wildlife diseases has rapidly expanded in recent years due to ease of use and affordability, though the use of PCR as a sole diagnostic test for amphibian ranavirus infections has recently been questioned [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, and validated TaqMan primer-probes are quite specific. All qPCR assays used in this manuscript have been validated for use in box turtles, and the risk of non-specific target amplification is considered incredibly low [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Inability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious pathogen presence is the main limitation of a TaqMan qPCR assay, and the possibility of detecting non-infectious pathogen DNA cannot be fully excluded in the present study.</p><p>Confirmatory non-invasive diagnostic tests including virus isolation for the detection of TerHV1, FV3, and BTADV, and culture to confirm the presence of live <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> sp. were either not used or not consistently applied in this study. TerHV1 and BTADV have never been successfully isolated, and Mycoplasma organisms are notoriously difficult to culture [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. An ELISA is available for <italic>Mycoplasma agassizii</italic>, but this test has not been validated for use in box turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Another ELISA is available for FV3, but its sensitivity and specificity have not been objectively assessed during active infections in box turtles [<xref rid="pone.0195617.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Other means of confirming pathogen presence (histopathology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, etc.) require invasive tissue sampling, which was outside the scope of this study. Molecular diagnostics were considered adequate to achieve the study goals given the planned sampling methods, the unpredictable nature of mortality events, and the limited availability of validated methods for minimally-invasive diagnosis of box turtle infectious diseases.</p><p>The present study provides valuable descriptions of four natural mortality events in Eastern box turtles, including the first report of necrotizing bacterial infection in this species. Several predictors for FV3 detection were confirmed over the course of three outbreaks, including use of moist microhabitats, presence of oral plaques and nasal discharge, heterophil count, and the HL ratio. Single and co-pathogen detection was common before, during, and after mortality events. Finally, mortality investigation initiated longitudinal box turtle health surveillance projects at each study site. Successful mortality investigations in free-living chelonians require significant personnel time and financial investment, but the information gained is vital for planning future studies and management interventions. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles and their communities will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195617.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Original data used to generate this manuscript.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195617.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Terri Lloyd and Cari Rassmussen for amphibian collection and box turtle sampling in 2013.
