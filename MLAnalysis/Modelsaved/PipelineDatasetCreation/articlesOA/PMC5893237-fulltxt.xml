Besides that, thiamine has been shown to be involved in plant protection against stress. In this study, the level of expression of THIC and THI1/THI4, the genes for the first two enzymes in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway were observed when oil palm (<italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic>) was subjected to oxidative stress. Primers were designed based on the consensus sequence of thiamine biosynthesis genes obtained from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, and <italic>Alnus glutinosa</italic>. Oxidative stress were induced with various concentrations of paraquat and samplings were done at various time points post-stress induction. The expression of THIC and THI1/THI4 genes were observed via RT-PCR and qPCR analysis. The expression of THIC was increased 2-fold, while THI1/THI4 gene transcript was increased 4-fold upon induction of oxidative stress. These findings showed that oil palm responded to oxidative stress by over-expressing the genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis. These findings support the suggestion that thiamine may play an important role in plant protection against stress.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="ru"><p>Tiamina dikenali sebagai sebatian penting dalam diet manusia dan ia adalah kofaktor yang diperlukan untuk proses metabolisme yang penting seperti biosintesis asetil- CoA, biosintesis asid amino, dan juga kitaran Krebs dan Calvin.

However, the presence of thiamine, in our diet is very important because it acts as cofactor for metabolic processes such as the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA and amino acids as well as the Krebs and Calvin cycles (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b18-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Tunc-Ozdemir <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). The active form is known to be thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b18-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Tunc-Ozdemir <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Thiamine has also been found to play an important role as a stress-response molecule. Upregulation of thiamine biosynthesis genes and overproduction of thiamine have been demonstrated when stress is present, be it abiotic or biotic (<xref rid="b3-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Balia Yusof <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b18-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Tunc-Ozdemir <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress is classified as abiotic and is triggered by environmental factors which can cause a series of changes within plants. It have been observed that oxidative stress negatively affect plant growth, development, and productivity by generating morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes (<xref rid="b9-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Kumar &amp; Venkateswarlu 2011</xref>).</p><p>Oil palm is the main crop of Malaysia and it is the main producer of palm oil and palm kernel oil. Palm oil is versatile since can be used for food and non-food purposes and it acts the cheapest traded edible oil (<xref rid="b12-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Page &amp; Lord 2006</xref>; Oil 2009). In 2014, Malaysia produced about 85% of the world&#8217;s palm oil (<xref rid="b17-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Sime Darby 2014</xref>).</p><sec><title>Thiamine Biosynthesis</title><p>The thiamine biosynthesis pathway in all three kingdoms are highly conserved with two separate branches synthesizing the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties. These moieties are then coupled to form thiamine monophosphate (TMP) and the latter is then phosphorylated to form thiamine diphosphate (TDP), also known as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which acts as an active cofactor (<xref rid="b2-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Bettendorff 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b6-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). However, the precursors for the biosynthesis differ between plants and microorganisms. In bacteria, the precursors are derived from purine and isoprenoid biosynthesis, while in yeast, they are derived from vitamin B<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>6</sub> compounds (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Unlike bacteria and yeast, plant biosynthesis pathway involves the combination of both.</p><p>Thiamine biosynthesis in plants begins with the synthesis of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties from 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) and NAD<sup>+</sup>, glycine, and sulfur respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tlsr-29-1-71">Figure 1</xref>). To synthesise the pyrimidine moiety, AIR is converted to 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine monophosphate (HMP-P) by HMP-P synthase (THIC). This pyrimidine moiety synthesis is similar to the one occurring in bacteria rather than in yeast (Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008; <xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). HMP-P is phosphorylated to 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP) by HMP-P kinase (THID) (Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008). THID is a bifunctional protein which has been characterised in <italic>Zea mays</italic> as THI3 and in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as THI1 (<xref rid="b1-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Ajjawi <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2007; <xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). THID, a single, two-domain protein (Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008) also catalyzes the phosphorylation of HMP-PP to thiamine monophosphate (TMP). The enzyme is also known as TMP synthase encoded by the gene THIE (Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008; <xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Interestingly in plants, the thiazole ring, 4-methyl-5-&#946;-hydroxyethylthiazolephosphate (HET-P), formation is said to be similar in yeast (<xref rid="b4-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008; <xref rid="b5-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Precursors namely NAD<sup>+</sup>, glycine, and sulfur (from a backbone of cysteine in THI4p) were catalyzed by HET-P synthase (THI1/THI4) and subsequently THIM to produce HET-P. THI4p is a HET-P synthase known in yeast (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), while THI1 is a HET-P synthase known in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Rapala-Kozik <italic>et al</italic>. 2008). The THI4 enzyme and its homolog, THI1, has another function other than its involvement in thiamine biosynthesis. It functions as a component involved in mitochondrial DNA damage tolerance (<xref rid="b11-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Machado <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>), against heat stress (<xref rid="b8-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b18-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Tunc-Ozdemir <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), and also disease resistance (<xref rid="b19-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b18-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Tunc-Ozdemir <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). HMP-PP and HET-P are then condensed together by TMP synthase (THIE) to produce TMP. All of these occur in the chloroplast (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).</p><p>TMP is dephosphorylated by the enzyme phosphatase (TPPH) to free thiamine and this reaction takes place in the cytosol (<xref rid="b14-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Pourcel <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). The pyro-phosphorylation of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) occurs by the reaction of thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK). <xref rid="b7-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> stated that prokaryotes could convert TMP to TPP via the <italic>thiL</italic> gene product. However in eukaryotes, dephosphorylation of TMP to thiamine occurs before the phosphorylation of thiamine to form TPP which is catalysed by TPK. Thiamine biosynthesis pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic> have similarities with <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</italic> In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the formation of the thiazole moiety, HET-P from NAD<sup>+</sup>, glycine, and a sulfur donor, is catalysed by THI4 as the first committed step. The pyrimidine moiety, HMP-PP is produced by AIR which is an intermediate in histidine and purine biosynthesis catalysed by THIC and THID enzyme (<xref rid="b7-tlsr-29-1-71" ref-type="bibr">Croft <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Further reaction is the phosphorylation and pyrophosphorylation of TMP to thiamine and finally, TPP by phosphatase and TPK, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant Materials and Stress Treatment</title><p>A total of 12 six-month old commercial Dura &#215; Pisifera (DXP) oil palm seedlings were obtained from Sime Darby, Banting.

The non-treated seedlings act as a control which is presented as value one.

In general, for any given concentration, the expression levels were shown to be increasing up to a point and then started to decrease over time.

The same pattern was observed for PQ 0.006 M. For 30 days post-treatment, a slight upregulation in THI1/THI4 gene transcript was observed for PQ 0.009 and PQ 0.006 M. This could be due THI1/THI4 enzyme having another function other than being involved in thiamine biosynthesis, such as playing a role in DNA damage repair.</p><p>The results obtained showed that there was an upregulation in THIC and THI/THI4 gene transcription in the earlier stage specifically at day one with up to more than 2-fold of increase after the exposure to stress.

However, the decrease of the transcription level of THIC and THI1/THI4 gene transcripts along the period of stress treatment could be due to the fact that the palms are starting to adapt to the stress conditions.

These results suggest that the upregulation of the first two enzymes in thiamine biosynthesis pathway when the plants were subjected to oxidative stress may be due to thiamine&#8217;s function in plant protection. These findings however need to be further verified but it is shedding some light on thiamine&#8217;s role in plant protection against stress in oil palm. Analysis on other enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis pathway will be further elucidated and the total thiamine content will be measured. It is hoped that this work will pave the way in understanding thiamine biosynthesis pathway in oil palm and its role in plant protection against stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was carried out in Lab 230, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti
