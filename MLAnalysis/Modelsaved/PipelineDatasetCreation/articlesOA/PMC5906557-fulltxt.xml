MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have crucial roles in AMD onset and progression. We thus aim to investigate the effects of miRNAs on RPE dedifferentiation and endothelium cell (EC) behavior, and analyze its downstream pathways. We have previously identified miR-302d-3p as the most downregulated miRNA signature along with RPE differentiation. Herein, in vitro study supported that miR-302d-3p induces RPE dedifferentiation typified by reduction of RPE characteristic markers, interrupts its phagocytosis, and promotes its migration, proliferation, and cell-cycle progression. c-Jun was identified as a potential upstream transcript factor for <italic>MIR302D</italic>, which might modulate RPE function by regulating miR-302d-3p expression. P21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor encoded by the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> gene, was identified as a downstream target of miR-302d-3p. Our data suggested that p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup> could promote RPE differentiation, and inhibit its proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression. We also demonstrated that miR-302d-3p suppresses RPE differentiation through directly targeting p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>. In addition, the miR-302d-3p/<italic>CDKN1A</italic> axis was also involved in regulating tube formation of ECs, indicating its potential involvement in CNV formation. Taken together, our study implies that miR-302d-3p, regulated by c-Jun, contributes to the pathogenesis of both atrophic and exudative AMD. MiR-302d-3p promotes RPE dedifferentiation, migration, proliferation and cell-cycle progression, inhibits RPE phagocytosis, and induces abnormal EC behavior by targeting p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>.

The post-mitotic RPE cells are required to cope with high metabolic rates and protein synthesis, digest toxic metabolite generated from photo transduction, and function under highly oxidizing conditions, all of which make RPE cells vulnerable to premature death. Abnormal RPE behaviors have been implicated in causing many retinal disorders, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. AMD is a leading cause for irreversible vision loss in people aged over 55, and can be further categorized into the atrophic and exudative forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. RPE dysfunction and depletion have preliminary causative roles in both forms. Other than abnormal RPE functions, exudative AMD is also typified by choroidal blood vessels growing through the Bruch&#8217;s membrane toward retina (choroidal neovascularization; CNV). Bleeding of these vessels may cause acute vision loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. By far, no efficient treatment has been raised for atrophic AMD. Although therapies targeting neovascularization, like intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and photodynamic therapy (PDT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, have been developed for AMD, treatment resistance, and CNV recurrence have been observed in a non-negligible fraction of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Thus, elucidation of early initiating events originating RPE abnormalities, especially RPE dedifferentiation, could allow the development of clinical preventions and interventions for AMD. However, the precise mechanism underlying RPE dedifferentiation is still poorly understood.</p><p id="Par3">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNA molecules ranging from 19 to 25 nucleotides. miRNAs usually regulate gene expressions by directly binding to particular sites in the 3&#8242;-untranslated region (3&#8242;-UTR) of targeted mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Other factors, including miRNA&#8217;s competition with other miRNAs, their interactions with transcriptional factors and long non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic modifications, like DNA methylation, would further confine a complete elucidation into their clear roles.

These miRNAs are highly conserved, share the same seed region, and only differ from one another by a few nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, other miR-302 members might also be involved in this process, and might have very similar functions with miR-302d-3p due to their high sequential similarity and shared seed regions and binding sites with <italic>CDKN1A</italic> 3&#8242;-UTR. MiR-302s, crucial for regulating self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells, are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSC, and during early embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. MiR-302 is required for embryonic viability, and knocking out of miR-302s would interrupt mammalian embryonic development and cause abnormal eye development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. MiR-302 is also important for neural development, including timing of neural differentiation and neural tube closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, the precious role of miR-302s in modulating RPE function and CNV formation has never been elucidated. We here find that miR-302d-3p contributes to the pathogenesis of both atrophic and exudative AMD by promoting RPE dedifferentiation, triggering abnormal EC behavior, inducing RPE apoptosis, and inhibiting RPE phagocytosis. Our data also reveal that miR-302d-3p triggers RPE proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression. The effects of miR-302s on cell proliferation are variable depending on different cell types. MiR-302s are reported to induce proliferation in hASDCs, and suppress proliferation in various cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The JNK signaling pathway regulates various biological processes like cell proliferation, migration, survival, and cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.
