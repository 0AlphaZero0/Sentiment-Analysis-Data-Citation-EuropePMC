The target genes deregulated in intratumoral T lymphocytes upon genetic ablation of <italic>Nr2f6</italic> alone or together with PD-L1 blockade reveal multiple advantageous transcriptional alterations. Acute <italic>Nr2f6</italic> silencing in both mouse and human T cells induces hyper-responsiveness that establishes a non-redundant T-cell-inhibitory function of NR2F6.

The development of immuno-oncological therapies is likely to revolutionize cancer care in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Particularly, antibodies&#160;blocking cell surface immune system inhibitory receptors, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 and its ligand-1 (PD-1)/(PD-L1), referred to as &#8220;immune checkpoints&#8221;, have been approved for many cancer types including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer and Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, adoptive T-cell transfer and cancer vaccines are also providing more encouraging results, especially when combined with antibodies antagonizing the above-mentioned immune checkpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Even though encouraging, the percentage of patients profiting from these therapies is limited, highlighting the need to further improve immune-activating therapy concepts. Particularly, the identification and validation of alternative and potentially additive or even synergistic immune checkpoint candidates is envisioned to improve immunotherapies and extend their benefits to a larger number of cancer patients.</p><p id="Par4">Pursuing this vision, we considered it reasonable to explore the checkpoints that might be located inside the immune cells, besides those present on the cell surface, and might be suitable targets for future cancer drugs. Following this line of argumentation, we demonstrated the crucial role of the lymphocyte-intrinsic orphan nuclear receptor NR2F6 (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 6; alias Ear2 and COUP-TFIII) as an intracellular checkpoint candidate fine-tuning adaptive immunity. NR2F6 induced an anti-inflammatory signal in the T-cell compartment. Consistent with this observation, <italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient mice spontaneously developed a late-onset autoimmune-type phenotype and were hyper-susceptible to induction of experimental neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, NR2F6 acts as an essential signaling intermediate and sets the threshold of T-cell effector functions by acting as a transcriptional repressor that directly antagonizes the DNA accessibility of activation-induced NFAT/AP-1 transcription factors at key cytokine gene loci such as <italic>Il2</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, it has been shown that the genetic elimination of NR2F6 improves intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration as well as effector functions at the tumor site in transplantable B16-OVA mouse tumor model systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, these tumor growth effects depend primarily on NR2F6 function in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector (but not regulatory) T-cell subsets. However, a rigorous assessment of the physiological relevance of NR2F6 function in clinically relevant mouse cancer model systems as well as in human T-cell biology has not yet been carried out. Employing methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcoma as well as MC38 colon adenocarcinoma model systems and human <italic>NR2F6</italic> knockdown T-cell cultures as well as analyzing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in human NSCLC biopsy samples, we here provide strong pre-clinical evidence that upregulation of NR2F6 at the tumor site renders effector T cells incapable of mounting sufficient anti-cancer immune response. Most importantly, combined genetic ablation of NR2F6 with the established PD-L1 checkpoint blockade is strongly synergistic. Furthermore, these clear anti-tumor immune responses in the <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> therapy groups were not accompanied by any signs of immune-related adverse events (irAE). Thus, our study sets the stage for future clinical validation of NR2F6 targeting as a mechanistically independent and potentially synergistic option to improve the efficacy of immuno-oncology therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Loss of NR2F6 function augments tumor rejection</title><p id="Par6"><italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient mice were significantly more resistant to development of MCA-induced sarcoma than wild-type mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and exhibited reduced tumor growth during challenge with a primary sarcoma cell line derived from MCA-treated wild-type mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>).

Interestingly, PD-L1 expression was increased not only in CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1F</xref>) but also in CD45<sup>&#8722;</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1E</xref>) when comparing wild-type and <italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice on d14 after tumor challenge, suggesting that loss of NR2F6 in T cells overcomes even high expression of these well-known immune-suppressive checkpoint receptors. In order to exclude &#8220;emergency&#8221; granulo-monocytopoesis as a main or contributing factor to the enhanced tumor rejection in <italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient mice, hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitor cells and myeloid cells within the bone marrow were investigated following tumor induction. In line with this observation also no differences between wild-type and <italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient myeloid cells such as neutrophils (CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly-6G<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), eosinophils (CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly-6G<sup>&#8722;</sup>SSC<sup>hi</sup>) or monocytes (CD45<sup>+</sup>Ly-6G<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), within latter population divided into CD115<sup>+</sup>Ly-6C<sup>lo</sup> and CD115<sup>+</sup>Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> cells, were observed (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1J, K</xref>).

Challenging <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice with a high tumor load of 5&#215;10<sup>5</sup> B16-OVA or 7.5&#215;10<sup>5</sup> MC38 colon carcinoma cells, all wild-type mice receiving control IgG injections rapidly developed tumors and had to be sacrificed due to ethical reasons at the latest by d21 post injection. In line with our previous results, tumor outgrowth in IgG2b-treated control group of <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice was significantly delayed even with this high tumor load and was well comparable to the benefit of blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1 in vivo in wild-type mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#8722;d</xref>). As a remarkable result, however, a clear synergistic benefit of PD-L1 blocking in <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> mice could be observed. This combination therapy was clearly more potent than targeting a single immune checkpoint and even led to rejection of tumors upon challenge with such very high tumor cell numbers of both the B16-OVA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>) as well as the MC38 mouse tumor cell line (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A&#8722;E</xref>). Of note, immune infiltration analyses in vivo of the <italic>Nr2f6</italic> knockout group in those high-dose tumors models, in principle, recapitulated the situation of the low dose model (see Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A, B</xref>). This provides strong preclinical evidence that NR2F6 and PD-1 signaling may act together as &#8220;threshold regulators&#8221; in host-protective tumor immunity. Despite the dramatically improved clinical outcome in <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> tumor-bearing mice subjected to PD-L1 blocking (combinatorial NR2F6/PD-L1 inhibition group) when directly compared to wild-type mice under mono-therapy, no exacerbated signs of irAE were observed during a follow-up period of 3 months (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We did not see any significant differences in immune cell infiltrates, colon length or weight gain after anti-PD-L1 treatment in <italic>Nr2f6</italic>-deficient mice, when compared to wild-type mice similarly treated (unpaired Student&#8217;s <italic>t</italic>-test). To evaluate the contribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the observed decreased tumor outgrowth, we challenged <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> subcutaneously with 1&#215;10<sup>5</sup> B16-OVA melanoma cells and treated them with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> depleting antibodies.

The synergistic therapy outcome indicates that NR2F6 blocking is a mechanistically independent option and indicates that inhibitory targeting of NR2F6 may provide novel immunotherapeutic avenues to enhance T-cell checkpoint immunotherapy. Importantly, despite the dramatically improved clinical outcome in <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup> tumor-bearing mice, no exacerbated signs of irAE were observed in the combinatorial NR2F6/PD-L1 targeting group when directly compared to the mono-therapy mice, suggesting that major side effects might not hamper the therapeutic potential of this combinatorial approach.</p><p id="Par20">Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that have been shown to be essential for both pro- and anti-inflammatory T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Of note, nuclear receptors generally regulate gene expression in response to the binding of lipophilic ligands and thus, the nuclear receptor family has a strong history of successful drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. There is as yet no valid information about endogenous ligands for several human nuclear receptors including NR2F6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, although the NR2F family members are classified as orphan receptors, their ligand-binding domain (LBD) is both evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for its transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Mutations within the LBD of NR2F6, reducing the size of the ligand-binding pocket or disrupting co-repressor interactions, have shown to significantly reduce its transcriptional repressor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, indicating that endogenous ligands for NR2F6 may exist and presumably modulate NR2F6 function.</p><p id="Par21">Along this line of argumentation, intriguingly, even heterozygous <italic>Nr2f6</italic><sup>+/&#8722;</sup> mice exhibited the same ability to delay tumor outgrowth of implanted B16-OVA and MC38 tumors as <italic>Nr2f6</italic> knockout mice. Because complete <italic>Nr2f6</italic> deficiency, as in homozygous knockout mouse models, hardly represents the physiological level of inhibition that can be reached during clinical regimens, this observed haplo-insufficiency of the <italic>Nr2f6</italic> gene function in vivo further supports the suitability of NR2F6 as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, not only complete but also partial (50%) NR2F6 deficiency, the latter representing a fairly realistic scenario of therapeutic inhibition, is sufficient to strengthen anti-tumor immunity. In agreement with these observations, acute <italic>Nr2f6</italic> gene silencing in both mouse and human T cells induced hyper-responsiveness, firmly validating a non-redundant T-cell inhibitory function of NR2F6.</p><p id="Par22">Because T lymphocyte-intrinsic NR2F6 acts as a potent and selective repressor of effective cancer immunity, NR2F6 appears to represent a crucial regulator of cancer immune tolerance induction and maintenance. Mechanistically, as examined by RNA sequencing of TILs derived from tumor-bearing mice, NR2F6 appears to set the threshold of T-cell effector functions as transcriptional regulator of critical target genes shaping activation, recruitment, proliferation and homeostasis of tumor-antigen-specific T-cell responses.</p><p id="Par23">It has been shown that T cells in the TME frequently express high levels of inhibitory receptors as a sign of T-cell exhaustion, including PD-1, CTLA-4, as well as impaired effector cytokine production, such as IL-2, TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;. Interestingly, this impairment of cytokine production would correlate with high levels of NR2F6 expression, as IL-2, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; are direct target genes of NR2F6-dependent transcriptional repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Along this line of argumentation, a positive correlation between NR2F6 expression and cancer has been reported; studies have identified NR2F6 to be upregulated in human ovarian cancer, colon cancer and lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, it is not possible from these published data to determine whether the origin of NR2F6 expression is the malignant or the immune cell. Notably, in the tumor-infiltrating T cells of 54% of lung cancer patients, NR2F6 upregulation has been observed within the TME. This suggests that targeting the immune checkpoint NR2F6 in those presumably tumor antigen-reactive but probably exhausted T-cell clones in the patient group with NR2F6<sup>positive</sup> TILs may result in increased anti-tumor effector responses during an envisioned NR2F6-targeted therapy.</p><p id="Par24">According to all our preclinical data, high NR2F6 expression is likely to critically contribute to the immune-suppressed state of tumor antigen-specific TILs, thus limiting the host&#8217;s anti-tumor immune response.
