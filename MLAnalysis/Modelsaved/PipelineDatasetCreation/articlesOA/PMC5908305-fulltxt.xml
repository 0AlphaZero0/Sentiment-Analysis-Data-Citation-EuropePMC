Increased CDX2 expression, which is observed in approximately 90%&#8211;95% of colorectal adenocarcinomas [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], is considered to be a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for adenocarcinomas of intestinal origin [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to its diagnostic utility, CDX2 is reported to exert tumor-suppressor functions by controlling a number of genes involved in proliferation, migration, and carcinogenesis [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, alterations in the CDX2 expression during cancer progression have not been examined extensively. The possibility remains that genetic diversification and clonal selection might result in changes in CDX2 expression status [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Several retrospective studies suggested that the loss of CDX2 expression in colorectal cancers (CRCs) was associated with worse prognosis as well as several adverse prognostic variables, such as high histologic grade, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, and CpG island methylator phenotype positivity [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, in early-stage CRCs, adjuvant chemotherapy could decrease recurrence risk in patients with loss of CDX2 expression, suggesting that this phenotype might be a potential predictive marker for response to chemotherapy [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in metastatic CRCs, the loss of CDX2 expression was reported to be associated with lower chemotherapy efficacy [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the CDX2 expression status represents a chemosensitive phenotype.</p><p>Chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of CRCs. Patients with technically unresectable metastatic CRCs benefit from chemotherapy, which was shown to shift the clinical stage toward a technically resectable condition [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Patients with stage III and high-risk stage II CRCs also benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, as shown by decreased risk of recurrence [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this context, the impact of chemotherapy on CDX2 expression status, which is considered as a promising prognostic marker in CRCs, remains poorly understood, although the expressions of several genes were previously shown to be affected by chemotherapy [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>There is a concern about the presence or absence of heterogeneity of CDX2 expression in CRCs because there are few reports regarding CDX2 expression heterogeneity, and the previous studies [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were conducted using tissue microarrays (TMAs), whose results can be affected by the heterogeneity of the target protein expression.

Additionally, the results revealed the high concordance rate of CDX2 expression between primary CRCs and corresponding liver metastases, which was not affected by chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate potential changes in CDX2 expression during CRC development and chemotherapy.</p><p>Previous reports utilized TMAs to analyze CDX2 expression in CRCs [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One major concern of TMA analysis is that the small core samples may not be representative of the entire tumor [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results demonstrating the heterogeneity of CDX2 expression in primary CRCs raise the possibility that previous studies reporting CDX2 expression using TMAs might not reflect the status of whole CRC sections. Conversely, an optimal cut-off value to determine the CDX2 expression status in whole CRC sections might be necessary if CDX2 expression determined by TMAs is utilized in daily medical practice as a prognostic or predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy.</p><p>We hypothesized that the percentage of the CDX2-negative component in the primary CRC would increase during cancer evolution, based on recent studies showing that the loss of CDX2 expression was associated with worse prognosis [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, our results demonstrated that the differences in CDX2 expression status between primary CRCs and their corresponding liver metastases were minimal. Additionally, the numbers of liver metastases were comparable between the CDX2-positive and -negative groups. These results suggested that while CDX2 might not play an important role in the development of liver metastasis of CRC, and the CDX2 expression status might be useful as a biomarker for the clinical evaluation of both primary CRC lesions and liver metastases.</p><p>The utility of CDX2 expression status as a predictive biomarker for response to chemotherapy remains controversial. In contrast to the suggested benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II and stage III CDX2-negative CRCs [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the benefit of systemic chemotherapy was significantly lower for CDX2-negative metastatic CRCs than for CDX2-positive CRCs [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Generally, in tumors with heterogeneous components exhibiting distinct sensitivities to chemotherapy, the ratio of components conferring chemotherapy resistance increased during treatment [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, we found that the CDX2 expression status in liver metastases changed minimally from that in primary lesions, indicating that the CDX2 expression status might not be directly associated with chemotherapy sensitivity. Our retrospective study assessing the association between CDX2 expression status and chemotherapy sensitivity warrants further validation.</p><p>Our study has several limitations due mainly to its retrospective nature. First, we selected the patients who underwent primary CRC resection and liver metastasectomy in the current study. However, we believe that selection bias was negligible because the comparisons included primary CRC and metastatic samples that were obtained from the same patients, and the prevalence CDX2 expression loss of 4.9% was similar to those reported previously [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Second, long-term storage of samples (3&#8211;10 years) might have affected CDX2 immunoreactivity. However, the year of diagnosis did not have a significant impact on the CDX2 expression (data not shown), suggesting that the storage period did not substantially affect CDX2 immunoreactivity. Third, the number of CDX2-negative CRC patients was relatively small, and information about CDX2 expression alterations in the CDX2-negative CRCs was limited. This is because CDX2-negative CRCs are rare, and only Japanese patients at a single cancer hospital were included in the present study. However, in this study, on an examination of cross-sections, primary CRC revealed heterogenous CDX2 expression, and 21.9% (30/137) of CDX2-positive primary CRCs also had CDX2-negative cancer cells in the tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, the high concordance rate of the CDX2 expression status was achieved through expression consistency in both CDX2-positive and CDX2-negative components of the primary tumor. Although our primary hypothesis regarding the association between CRCs and CDX2 expression status was whether the alterations from CDX2-positive to CDX2-negative during tumor progression or chemotherapy were negligible, the investigation of the opposite situation also yields valuable information. In survival analysis, the number of patients with CDX2-negative CRCs is small, and the results might not be sufficiently powered to detect a difference. Further studies with a large sample size are necessary to elucidate the impact of chemotherapy or tumor progression in CDX2-negative CRCs and confirm our findings.</p><p>This is the first study to demonstrate that the CDX2 expression status in CRCs was highly concordant between primary CRCs and their corresponding liver metastases, independent of chemotherapy, suggesting that the CDX2 expression status in CRC was not affected by metastasis or chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patients and tissue samples</title><p>In this retrospective study, CRC surgical samples were obtained from 144 consecutive patients who underwent colorectal resection with extended lymph node dissection (D2 or D3) and liver resection for CRC at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, between 2006 and 2014.

Patients who received chemotherapy within six months before surgical resection were defined as those with a history of chemotherapy. Patients who did not give written informed consent were excluded from this study. Whole CRC sections were reviewed and confirmed by two of the investigators (Y.S. and K.I.). The study was approved by the committee for ethics at the Cancer Institute Hospital (No. 2016&#8211;1087).</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>IHC was performed using 4-&#956;m thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC sections. Sections of the largest cross-sectional slice of the primary and metastatic lesions were used for the analysis. We used a primary mouse anti-human CDX2 monoclonal antibody (clone DAK-CDX2, 1:100 dilution, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) that was previously validated for diagnostic applications [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All samples were handled in an anonymous fashion. Tissue slides were stained using a Bond-III automatic stainer (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), and antigen detection was achieved using the Bond Polymer Refine detection kit (Leica Microsystems).</p><p>CRC diagnosis was confirmed by two experienced pathologists (Y.S. and K.I.) based on the microscopic examination of hematoxylin-eosin&#8211;stained slides. All cases were scored blindly by two experienced pathologists (Y.S. and K.I.) in an independent fashion. Cases that were difficult to interpret immunohistochemically were discussed with a third experienced pathologist (H.K.). Nuclear CDX2 expression was scored based on the number of CDX2-positive tumor cells.</p><p>In the secondary analysis, 268 matched samples from 134 patients used the following primary antibodies: anti-human CK7 monoclonal antibody (clone OV-TL 12/30, 1:200 dilution, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA), anti-human CK20 monoclonal antibody (clone IT-Ks 20.8, 1:100 dilution, Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-human CEA monoclonal antibody (clone COL-1, ready-to-use prediluted, Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan), and anti-human MUC2 monoclonal antibody (clone Ccp58, 1:200 dilution, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). As for CDX1 IHC, anti-human CDX1 polyclonal antibody (HPA055196, 1:500 dilution, Atlas Antibodies AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (211-005-109, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the association between primary CRCs and corresponding liver metastases based on the CDX2 expression status and to evaluate differences in relative frequencies of clinicopathological parameters between the CDX2-positive and -negative groups. Cohen's kappa index was used to assess the concordance of CDX2 expression status determined by the two investigators [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Differences between mean values of two groups were evaluated by the Mann&#8211;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant. For the survival analysis between the patient subgroups, we used Kaplan&#8211;Meier curve and log-rank test. RFS and OS were calculated from the date of liver metastasectomy to the date of the first recurrence at any site or death.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-09-17056-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1058" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mr. Motoyoshi Iwakoshi and Ms. Tomoyo Kakita for their kind assistance in sample preparation and Drs.
