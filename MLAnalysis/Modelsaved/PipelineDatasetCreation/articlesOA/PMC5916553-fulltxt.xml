The agonism activity of such antibodies depends on crosslinking to Fc gamma RIIB receptor (Fc&#947;RIIB) to enable the antibody multimerization that drives TNFR activation. Previously, Fc engineering was used to enhance the binding of such antibodies to Fc&#947; receptors. Here, we report the identification of Centyrins as alternative scaffold proteins with binding affinities to homologous Fc&#947;RIIB and Fc&#947;RIIA, but not to other types of Fc&#947; receptors. One Centyrin, S29, was engineered at distinct positions of an anti-OX40 SF2 antibody to generate bispecific and tetravalent molecules named as mAbtyrins. Regardless of the position of S29 on the SF2 antibody, SF2-S29 mAbtyrins could bind Fc&#947;RIIB and Fc&#947;RIIA specifically while maintaining binding to OX40 receptors. In a NF&#954;B reporter assay, attachment of S29 Centyrin molecules at the C-termini, but not the N-termini, resulted in SF2 antibodies with increased agonism owing to Fc&#947;RIIB crosslinking. The mAbtyrins also showed agonism in T-cell activation assays with immobilized Fc&#947;RIIB and Fc&#947;RIIA, but this activity was confined to mAbtyrins with S29 specifically at the C-termini of antibody heavy chains. Furthermore, regardless of the position of the molecule, S29 Centyrin could equip an otherwise Fc-silent antibody with antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis activity without affecting the antibody's intrinsic antibody-dependent cell-meditated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In summary, the appropriate adoption Fc&#947;RII-binding Centyrins as functional modules represents a novel strategy to engineer therapeutic antibodies with improved functionalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Antibody engineering</kwd><kwd>agonism</kwd><kwd>ADCP</kwd><kwd>alternative scaffold protein</kwd><kwd>Fc receptor, immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>tumor necrosis factor</kwd><kwd>OX40</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immunotherapies have emerged as promising cancer therapeutics in recent years.

The mAbtyrins with Centyrins fused at the C-termini of light chains had a slightly longer elution time relative to others, likely due to a unique conformation they adopted that favored retention on the SEC column.

These observations revealed that both the antibody portion and the Centyrin portion of the mAbtyrin could function independently without interfering with each other under our engineering scheme.

Although the S29 Centyrins and SF2 antibodies were capable of binding to their respective targets individually, there could be physical hindrances for the mAbtyrins with N-terminal attachment that prevented the optimal interactions with both OX40 receptors and Fc&#947;RIIB needed for functional activation.</p><p>The mAbtyrins demonstrated dose-dependent agonism in T cell activation assays as well as the NF&#954;B reporter assay.

Interestingly, only the mAbtyrins comprising S29 at the C-termini of heavy chains of SF2 antibodies showed agonism in the T cell activation assay, while those with S29 at the C-termini of light chains barely had activities. This could be explained by the lower affinities of SF2IgG1_S29_LC-C and SF2IgG2&#963;_S29_LC-C to Fc&#947;RII receptors. Alternatively, in contrast to the reporter assay, co-stimulating OX40 receptors in the more complex T cell activation assay might have a more stringent requirement for the mAbtyrins to be in a specific configuration to function properly.</p><p>Besides agonism, S29 enabled the SF2IgG2&#963; antibody, which was silent in ADCP, to be potent in phagocytosis activity.

A prominent feature of Centyrins is their specificity in binding and functionality. In this regard, the mAbtyrin approach provides only the intended functionalities, which in this case included agonism and ADCP enhancement due to the specificity of S29 to Fc&#947;RII receptors, without affecting other Fc effector functions such as ADCC and CDC. In contrast, although Fc engineering provided the intended activity enhancement, these were often accompanied with certain liabilities. Specifically, the S267E/L328F and V12 Fc mutations could enhance the agonism of SF2 antibodies due to improved Fc&#947;RIIB engagement, but both engineering approaches affected ADCC owing to disrupted binding to Fc&#947;RIIIA.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15-17</sup></xref> On the other hand, Fc mutations that facilitated antibody multimerization could also enhance the agonism of SF2 antibody, but such multimerized antibodies also had elevation in multiple effector functions.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Another important feature of Centyrins is that they are modular in nature. As a small functional module, they can be engineered onto any antibodies, regardless their IgG subtypes, to provide the intended functionality in a plug-and-play format. Centyrins can also be engineered as bivalent functional modules, which has apparent advantage over a bispecific antibody that targets Fc&#947;RIIB with monovalent activity.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> However, appropriate configurations would need to be evaluated for proper function. In this case, S29 attached at the N-termini of SF2 antibodies enabled only the ADCP activity, while those at the C-termini of antibody heavy chains facilitated both agonism as well as ADCP activities.</p><p>In summary, Fc&#947;RII-binding Centyrins could be used as a novel strategy to improve therapeutic antibodies whose activities depend on the engagements of Fc&#947;RII receptors, including immunostimulatory anti-TNFRSF antibodies such as SF2. Besides therapeutic activities, other aspects of mAbtyrins, including the pharmacokinetics, developability, manufacturability and immunogenicity, must be rigorously evaluated. Nonetheless, use of an alternative scaffold protein to generate multi-specific biologics should be a valuable addition to the toolbox for the engineering of therapeutic antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Selection of high-affinity Centyrins binding to Fc&#947;RIIB by CIS display panning</title><p>A recombinant extracellular domain of Fc&#947;RIIB (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, catalog number 1875-CD) was biotinylated using the SureLINK Biotin Kit (Seracare, Milford, MA) as the antigen to pan against Centyrin libraries diversified in distinct strand and loop regions of the FN3 domain.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The selection of specific Centyrins was done essentially as previously described.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Multiple distinct panning approaches, including excess non-specific competitors and negative selections, were executed and the pannings were performed through five successive rounds using the PCR-amplified positive clones for subsequent rounds.
