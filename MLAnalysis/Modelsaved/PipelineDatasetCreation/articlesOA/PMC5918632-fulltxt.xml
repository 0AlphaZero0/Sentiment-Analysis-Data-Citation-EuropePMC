The molecular mechanisms controlling neurotransmitter signaling in islet &#946; cells and their impact on diabetes development are only partially understood. Using a glucose-intolerant, MafA-deficient mouse model, we demonstrate that MAFA controls ANS-mediated insulin secretion by activating the transcription of nicotinic (<italic>ChrnB2</italic> and <italic>ChrnB4</italic>) and adrenergic (<italic>Adra2A</italic>) receptor genes, which are integral parts of acetylcholine-and monoamine-signaling pathways. We show that acetylcholine-mediated insulin secretion requires nicotinic signaling and that nicotinic receptor expression is positively correlated with insulin secretion and glycemic control in human donor islets. Moreover, polymorphisms spanning MAFA-binding regions within the human <italic>CHRNB4</italic> gene are associated with type 2 diabetes. Our data show that MAFA transcriptional activity is required for establishing &#946; cell sensitivity to neurotransmitter signaling and identify nicotinic signaling as a modulator of insulin secretion impaired in type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="Abs2"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="P4">

Insulin secreted by islet &#946; cells promotes glucose uptake, whereas glucagon from &#945; cells stimulates glucose release. Loss, dysfunction, and dedifferentiation of islet &#946; cells results in a profound imbalance in blood glucose homeostasis (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Halban et al., 2014</xref>), leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. Regulation of physiological insulin and glucagon secretion is achieved by direct sensing of glucose and other nutrients in &#945; and &#946; cells but also indirectly through communication between islet cells and the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (reviewed in <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Thorens, 2011</xref>). Glucose-sensing neurons stimulate sympathetic norepinephrine release to repress insulin secretion and promote glucagon release under physical and mental stress conditions (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Porte and Williams, 1966</xref>). In contrast, parasympathetic acetylcholine signaling through cholinergic muscarinic receptors is critical for the pre-absorptive phase of insulin secretion, prior to the increase in blood glucose levels in response to food intake (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ahr&#233;n and Holst, 2001</xref>). Alleles that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes have been identified in the adrenoceptor <italic>ADRA2A</italic> (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Rosengren et al., 2010</xref>) and the cholinergic muscarinic receptor <italic>CHRM3</italic> genes (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2006</xref>), further highlighting the importance of neurotransmitter signaling in glucose homeostasis.</p><p id="P6">The transcription network regulating neurotransmitter signaling pathways in pancreatic &#946; cells is unknown, making it difficult to assess how sensitivity to neurotransmitter signaling is maintained and adjusted in response to changing physiological conditions. The &#946; cell-enriched MAFA transcription factor activates genes critical for glucose sensing, insulin production, and secretion (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Artner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hang et al., 2014</xref>), and it has been established that MAFA expression is lost in human type 2 diabetes islets most likely contributing to diabetic &#946; cell dysfunction (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that &#946;-cell-specific deletion of the MafA transcription factor in a mouse model, which develops glucose intolerance, leads to a complete loss of insulin secretion in response to stimulation of the ANS in vivo. We show that this defect is most likely caused by MAFA activating transcription of adrenergic and nicotinic neurotransmitter receptor expression including genes encoding CHRNB2 and B4 subunits and ADRA2A. Importantly, this transcriptional regulation by MAFA was conserved between mouse and human &#946; cells. In addition, polymorphisms in nicotinic receptor genes correlated to insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of patients. These findings establish MAFA as a critical regulator of neurotransmitter signaling in &#946; cells and identify nicotinic signaling as a modulator of insulin secretion, suggesting that smoking-induced nicotine exposure may directly affect insulin secretion, thereby linking the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and smoking on a cellular level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Islet &#946;-Cell-Specific Deletion of MafA Results in Impaired ANS-Stimulated Insulin Secretion</title><p id="P7">Loss of <italic>MafA</italic> results in adult &#946; cell dysfunction, which leads to glucose intolerance (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and S1B</xref>). To test whether loss of <italic>MafA</italic> affects the responsiveness of &#946; cells to neurotransmitter signaling, mice wild-type for MafA (<italic>MafA</italic><sup>WT</sup>), completely lacking MafA (<italic>MafA<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic>), and only lacking MafA in &#946; cells (<italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic>) were treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), which stimulates the ANS to induce insulin and glucagon secretion (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 1987</xref>). Both <italic>MafA<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> animals failed to increase insulin secretion in response to 2DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>), whereas insulin secretion increased in <italic>MafA</italic><sup>WT</sup> mice, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>), and glucose was cleared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, no difference in glucagon secretion levels was found between <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> and wild-type animals treated with 2DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that loss of MafA selectively affects ANS-driven insulin secretion.</p><p id="P8">We found that the reduction of insulin secretion was due to loss of MafA in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> &#946; cells, as no changes in the expression levels of <italic>MafA</italic> in the brainstem, hypothalamus, or cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) were found. In fact, in the CNS, <italic>MafA</italic> mRNA levels were 500 times lower than in pancreatic islets and no protein expression was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; data not shown), which suggests that <italic>MafA</italic> function in &#946; cells, and not the CNS, is critical for ANS-driven insulin secretion. <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice also did not express the closely related transcription factor <italic>MafB</italic> in &#946; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F and 1G</xref>), which has been shown to partially compensate for the loss of <italic>MafA</italic> (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Artner et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, there was no reduction in &#946; cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), &#945; cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>), or alterations in islet morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F, 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C, and S1D</xref>) in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice, although such reduction has been previously reported for <italic>MafA<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, islet innervation seemed to be unaffected in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice, as shown by the presence of autonomic nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K, 1J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E&#8211;S1H</xref>) and 2DG-induced glucagon secretion in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that the effects observed in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> are specific to the loss of MAFA function in &#946; cells and not due to reduced &#946; cell area, altered islet morphology, or ectopic MAFB expression. Taken together, our data show that MAFA function in &#946; cells is essential for ANS-driven insulin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Expression of Adrenergic and Cholinergic Nicotinic Receptor Genes Is Affected in MafA<sup>RIP</sup> Islets</title><p id="P9">Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings secret norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides to signal to target cells. Signal reception is mediated by adrenergic (sympathetic nervous system), muscarinic, and nicotinic acetylcholine and neuropeptide receptors (parasympathetic nervous system), whereas monoamine degradation is performed by several enzymes including monoamine oxidases (MAOs). As alterations in adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, as well as parasympathetic neuropeptide receptor expression, affect human and rodent &#946; cell function (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Rosengren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Winzell and Ahr&#233;n, 2007</xref>), we performed mRNA expression analysis to determine whether loss of ANS-mediated insulin secretion in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice was due to deficient neurotransmitter signaling. Expression of the parasympathetic neuropeptide receptor genes <italic>VipR</italic>, <italic>PACAPR</italic>, and <italic>GrpR</italic> was unchanged in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mutant islets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that neuropeptide receptor signaling is not affected in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic>. Expression of the muscarinic receptor genes <italic>ChrM3</italic> and <italic>ChrM5</italic> has been observed in &#946; cells (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Duttaroy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 2014</xref>), and in line with this, we found that <italic>ChrM3</italic> transcript levels were detectable in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets and similar to expression in MafA wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ChrM1</italic>, <italic>ChrM2</italic>, <italic>ChrM4</italic>, and <italic>ChrM5</italic> transcript levels were low in both wild-type and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets. Systematic expression analysis of nicotinic &#945; and &#946; receptor subunits (<italic>Chrn</italic> genes), which form pentameric ion channels consisting of two &#945; and three &#946; subunits, showed that several &#945; (CHRNA3, CHRNA4, and CHRNA5) and &#946; (CHRNB2 and CHRNB4) subunits were produced in islet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). mRNA levels of <italic>ChrnA3</italic> and <italic>ChrnA4</italic> genes were increased, whereas <italic>ChrnB2</italic> expression was unchanged and <italic>ChrnA5</italic> and <italic>ChrnB4</italic> subunit transcript levels were reduced in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated that these changes in expression levels were also present on protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Expression of other CHRN subunits was low and unchanged in MafA<sup><italic>RIP</italic></sup> islets compared with MafA<sup>WT</sup> islets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, transcript levels of <italic>MaoB</italic>, the main MAO enzyme expressed in islets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), were reduced, whereas expression of the adrenoceptor <italic>Adra2A</italic>, which inhibits insulin secretion, was elevated in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This expression analysis shows that loss of <italic>MafA</italic> in &#946; cells selectively affects expression of nicotinic acetylcholine and adrenergic receptor, as well as MAO genes.</p><p id="P10">The sympathetic nervous system inhibits insulin secretion through ADRA2A signaling in islet &#946; cells. However, ADRA2A is also expressed in presynaptic nerve endings as part of a negative feedback loop terminating adrenergic signaling. Previous studies have established that localized accumulation of norepinephrine can lead to upregulation of <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression in nerve endings presynaptically (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gilsbach et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets lack expression of the monoamine-oxidizing enzyme MAOB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which mediates degradation of norepinephrine locally. Thus, we hypothesized that the increase in <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression observed in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets may be due to an increased expression in islet-associated synapses and not in the islet cells themselves. To determine whether the increase in <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression occurred in islet cells or islet-associated nerves, islets were cultured to degrade severed nerve fibers and the effect on transcript and protein levels was measured. We found that <italic>Adra2A</italic> transcript and protein levels were decreased in cultured <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets, albeit changes were only significant on the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the enhanced <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression observed in freshly isolated <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets originated from nerve endings, whereas <italic>Adra2A</italic> transcription was reduced specifically in islet cells. In support of this, ADRA2A protein expression was also reduced in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>). Our data suggest that MAFA is required for <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression in islet &#946; cells whereas elevation of norepinephrine levels in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mutant islets (due to the lack of MAOB) results in upregulation of <italic>Adra2A</italic> in presynaptic nerve fibers associated with pancreatic islets.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Chrn Gene Expression Depends on MAFA in Mouse Pancreatic &#946; Cells</title><p id="P11">We have shown that <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> animals lack insulin secretion in response to autonomic stimulation but that transcription of muscarinic receptor genes, which mediate autonomic stimulation of insulin secretion, is not reduced in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These findings suggest that alternate cholinergic signaling pathways might be present in &#946; cells. As we also observed that expression of some <italic>Chrn</italic> genes changed in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets, we next investigated whether expression of these genes is regulated by MAFA.</p><p id="P12">The CHRNA4 protein was detected in all islet cells by immunohistochemistry, with production enhanced in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). By contrast, CHRNA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>) were detected in all pancreatic cell types, whereas CHRNB2 was predominantly expressed in &#946; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) of <italic>MafA<sup>WT</sup></italic> islets. CHRNA3 protein was not detected by immunohistochemistry. Expression of CHRNA5, CHRNB2, and CHRNB4 was reduced in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D, 3F, and 3H</xref>), suggesting that a reduced amount of functional ion channels (A3/B4 and A4/B2) is present, which could affect nicotinic channel signaling in <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> &#946; cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MAFA selectively bound to upstream regulatory sequences in <italic>ChrnB2</italic> and <italic>ChrnB4</italic>, but not <italic>ChrnA3</italic> and <italic>ChrnA4</italic>, genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>) indicating that only ChrnB2 and ChrnB4 are directly regulated by MAFA. The ability of co-transfected MAFA to stimulate <italic>ChrnB2</italic>- or <italic>ChrnB4</italic>-driven reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>) and reduction of <italic>ChrnB4</italic> transcript levels upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAFA in &#946;TC-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>) provided additional strong support for direct activation of <italic>Chrn</italic> genes in mouse &#946; cells. In summary, these data show that nicotinic subunits are expressed in mouse islets and that MAFA is directly activating expression of <italic>ChrnB2</italic> and <italic>ChrnB4</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CHRN Activity Modulates Acetylcholine-Mediated Insulin Secretion</title><p id="P13">Acetylcholine promotes insulin secretion through activation of muscarinic receptors (reviewed in <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Ahr&#233;n, 2000</xref>), whereas the role of nicotinic signaling in this process has been considered to be minor (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Ohtani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Yoshikawa et al., 2005</xref>). We wanted to investigate whether the MAFA-regulated <italic>Chrn</italic> activity contributes to acetylcholine-stimulated insulin release. Thus, dynamic insulin secretion studies on islets from <italic>MafA<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice were conducted. Nicotine exposure (which selectively stimulates CHRN) resulted in a transient decrease in insulin secretion in wild-type, but not <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic>, islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>). Next, a combined treatment with nicotine and the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine was performed to determine the effect of a simultaneous stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor activity, which resembles the physiological response to acetylcholine. This treatment caused a biphasic insulin response consisting of an initial reduction in insulin release that is then followed by a phase of enhanced insulin secretion in wild-type and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>). However, nicotine and oxotremorine stimulation of insulin release from <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets was muted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>), which is most likely caused by the selective reduction in nicotinic receptor gene expression. In contrast, stimulation of muscarinic receptors was comparable between wild-type and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>), suggesting that CHRN expression in &#946; cells is promoting acetylcholine-mediated insulin secretion. Stimulation of wild-type islets with acetylcholine resulted in a similar biphasic insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M</xref>), as observed for nicotine and oxotremorine treatment, suggesting that activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors is required for physiological insulin secretion. The presence of a biphasic synergistic response to stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors supports the idea that activation of fast-acting nicotinic ion channels is temporarily inhibiting insulin secretion to prime &#946; cells for muscarinic-receptor-induced insulin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Genetic Variants in the CHRNB4 Gene Correlate with Islet Expression and Type 2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Humans</title><p id="P14">The expression and functional analysis of <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic> mice suggest that <italic>Chrn</italic> genes are critical for &#946; cell function in rodent islets.

We identified a cluster of SNPs that was associated with low expression of <italic>CHRNB4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, two copies of the alternate allele (T/T) for the <italic>CHRNB4</italic> SNP rs12910237 resulted in a significant reduction of <italic>CHRNB4</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, this SNP was also associated with patients having high fasted blood glucose levels and low insulin secretion after an oral glucose challenge in the MAGIC and DIAGRAM databases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The SNP was not associated with change in BMI, indicating that this polymorphism does not affect overall food intake and energy expenditure.

Here, we demonstrate that MAFA is essential for the transcription of acetylcholine- and monoamine-signaling genes in mouse and human &#946; cells. These results show that MAFA is key in regulating &#946; cell function by connecting the physiological insulin secretion response to nutrients with neurotransmitter signaling. When these processes are impaired in islets lacking MAFA, glucose homeostasis is disrupted and type 2 diabetes develops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The finding that stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system with 2DG results in insulin secretion in wild-type, but not <italic>MafA<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup></italic> and <italic>MafA<sup>RIP</sup></italic>, animals indicates that this transcription factor is essential for initiating ANS-driven insulin secretion. Other possible explanations are unlikely, as the RIP-Cre mouse line used here (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Herrera, 2000</xref>) does not contain the human growth hormone minigene, which has been associated with numerous &#946; cell defects (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Brouwers et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, RIP-Cre activity in the CNS does not alter <italic>MafA</italic> transcript levels, and changes in islet innervation and ANS-induced glucagon secretion were not observed. So, we conclude that the defects in autonomic signal reception observed in the <italic>MafA</italic> mutant animals are caused by loss of MAFA function in islet &#946; cells.</p><p id="P20">We found that MAFA regulated specific neurotransmitter signaling genes in the sympathetic branch of the ANS, including the adrenergic receptor <italic>Adra2A</italic> as well as the monoamine metabolizing enzyme <italic>MaoB</italic>.

Our results suggest a direct effect of MAFA activity on <italic>Adra2A</italic> transcription, because <italic>ADRA2A</italic> expression was reduced following knockdown of <italic>MAFA</italic> in a human &#946; cell line.

The regulation of <italic>Adra2A</italic> expression indicates that MAFA controls autonomic input of the sympathetic, as well as the parasympathetic, branch of the ANS.</p><p id="P21">Gene expression analysis showed that MafA regulates the expression of several genes that are critical for autonomic signaling. The main group of neurotransmitter receptor genes that are transcriptionally regulated by MAFA encode subunits of the cholinergic nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholine from islet a cells (human) and parasympathetic nerves (mouse and human) has been shown to stimulate the pre-absorptive phase of insulin secretion (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ahr&#233;n and Holst, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). The importance of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in this process has been established in both human and animals studies. However, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity was previously thought to not be significantly involved in this process (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011b</xref>). This is in contrast to previous findings that pre-absorptive insulin secretion is inhibited by the nicotinic ganglionic blocker trimethaphan but only partially impaired by muscarinic antagonists (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ahr&#233;n and Holst, 2001</xref>), which argues for a function of nicotinic receptor activity in human islet cells. Our insulin secretion studies extended these previous observations by showing that nicotine has a dynamic impact on insulin release with transient inhibition of insulin secretion. In addition, co-stimulation with nicotine and oxotremorine, which activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, resulted in synergistic insulin secretion similar to that observed upon stimulation with acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>). This suggests that the physiological acetylcholine response in &#946; cells consists of an initial opening of nicotinic channels that primes &#946; cells for subsequent muscarinic receptor activity. In support of this conclusion, <italic>MafA</italic> mutant islets that had reduced expression of nicotinic, but not muscarinic, acetylcholine receptor expression showed neither transient inhibition of insulin secretion upon nicotine exposure nor synergistic insulin secretion in response to treatment with nicotine and oxotremorine.</p><p id="P22">To establish whether nicotinic receptors are also required for human &#946; cell function and whether MAFA transcription factor activity is regulating <italic>CHRN</italic> transcription, we analyzed RNA-seq and genotyping data from human donor islets.
