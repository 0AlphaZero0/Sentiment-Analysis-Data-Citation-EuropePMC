Efforts in finding new drug targets are hampered by the lack of sufficiently specific tools to provide target validation prior to initiating expensive drug discovery projects. Thus, new approaches that can rapidly enable drug target validation are of significant interest.</p><p>In this manuscript we present the crystal structure of malate dehydrogenase from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH) at 2.4 &#197; resolution and structure-based mutagenic experiments interfering with the inter-oligomeric interactions of the enzyme. We report decreased thermal stability, significantly decreased specific activity and kinetic parameters of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH mutants upon mutagenic disruption of either oligomeric interface. In contrast, stabilization of one of the interfaces resulted in increased thermal stability, increased substrate/cofactor affinity and hyperactivity of the enzyme towards malate production at sub-millimolar substrate concentrations. Furthermore, the presented data show that our designed <italic>Pf</italic>MDH mutant could be used as specific inhibitor of the wild type <italic>Pf</italic>MDH activity, as mutated <italic>Pf</italic>MDH copies were shown to be able to self-incorporate into the native assembly upon introduction <italic>in vitro</italic>, yielding deactivated mutant:wild-type species. These data provide an insight into the role of oligomeric assembly in regulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH activity and reveal that recombinant mutants could be used as probe tool for specific modification of the wild type <italic>Pf</italic>MDH activity, thus offering the potential to validate its druggability <italic>in vivo</italic> without recourse to complex genetics or initial tool compounds. Such tool compounds often lack specificity between host or pathogen proteins (or are toxic in <italic>in vivo</italic> trials) and result in difficulties in assessing cause and effect&#8212;particularly in cases when the enzymes of interest possess close homologs within the human host. Furthermore, our oligomeric interference approach could be used in the future in order to assess druggability of other challenging human pathogen drug targets.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to acknowledge the Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo &#224; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#227;o Paulo (FAPESP, grants 2012/12807-3 and 2016/24790-9 to KAM, 2014/23330-9 to ML, 2013/10288-1 and 2015/26722-8 to CW).

During proliferation of the parasite within the host&#8217;s red blood cell the parasite depends on external nutrients that have to be imported and subsequently metabolized [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This interconversion of nutrients is believed to be essential to provide the metabolic intermediates for the parasite&#8217;s growth. The validation of the druggability of these metabolic steps is highly challenging as the applicability of the probe techniques is limited in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and depends on reverse genetics [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, a possible alternative is offered through the examination of interaction surfaces between subunits of oligomeric proteins.</p><p>In recent publications Panchenko and colleagues summarised the biological importance, physico-chemical properties and evolutionary aspects of protein oligomerisation [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The authors showed that approximately 60% of the non-redundant protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are of dimeric or higher oligomeric order [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Protein oligomerisation is a feature shared by all organisms; oligomerisation is often essential to form functional protein complexes and can provide regulatory, stability, protective, selective, functional diversity or evolutionary benefits to the host organism [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oligomeric interfaces also show extremely high specificity and binding affinity. In the majority of cases, oligomeric proteins can be purified from both recombinant and native sources in a single oligomeric state that show no non-cognate incorporation within the isolated assembly. Specificity of the oligomeric interfaces minimizes the interactions between unwanted partners, such as closely related and similar proteins of different pathways. Disruption of the native oligomeric state of the protein also often leads to the misregulation or the complete loss of function. Nishi and colleagues have shown a number of examples where mutations induce changes in the native oligomeric state, leading to devastating human diseases such as Alzheimer [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The evolutionary diversity of protein:protein interaction interfaces is also a key parameter in the study and treatment of infectious diseases. In many cases the proposed target protein from a pathogen shares function with a homologous protein of the human host. Tool compounds or methods that target the likely conserved active sites of the pathogenic enzymes will almost inevitably interact with the homologous proteins of the host system, as evolutionary constraints will restrict sequence diversity in these regions. Protein:protein interaction surfaces are less restricted by such constraints, as compensatory mutations can return the function of the surface (supporting oligomerisation) more diversely than mutations in an active site that must retain molecular function. This evolutionary diversity is also found in protein:protein interactions within oligomeric protein assemblies. Earlier studies have shown that protein interfaces tend to exhibit slightly higher level of evolutional conservation than the rest of the surface [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but significantly lower than that of active sites. Thus, we believe that oligomeric surfaces offer a potential in selective incorporation that may rival current cutting-edge genetic approaches to validate essential pathways for their druggability.</p><p>Enzymes within <italic>plasmodial</italic> carbon metabolism pathway have previously been suggested as promising targets for drug discovery [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Particularly, our previous research was focused on <italic>plasmodial</italic> aspartate aminotransferase (<italic>Pf</italic>AspAT, <bold>EC</bold>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.6.1.1"><bold>2.6.1.1</bold></ext-link>), an enzyme involved in aspartate metabolism, energy metabolism, pyrimidine biosynthesis as well as supplying the TCA cycle of the parasite with it&#8217;s intermediates [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Malate dehydrogenase (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH, <underline><bold>EC 1.1.1.37</bold></underline>) is located downstream of <italic>Pf</italic>AspAT in the cytosol of the parasite. It catalyzes the reversible reaction from malate to oxaloacetate using the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH, thus aiding in the maintenance of the correct redox environment, crucial for the parasite&#8217;s survival particularly during the blood stages [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Pf</italic>MDH is also involved in the shuttle mechanism of the TCA cycle intermediates (malate/oxaloacetate), necessary for electron transfer from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial electron transport chain [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a validated antimalarial drug target [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These data make <italic>Pf</italic>AspAT as well as <italic>Pf</italic>MDH promising antimalarial drug targets.</p><p>Recently, the crystal structure of the <italic>Pf</italic>AspAT has been solved [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <italic>Pf</italic>MDH has been biochemically characterized and its spatial structure has been modeled [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pradhan and colleagues reported a number of mutagenic experiments aimed at identification and characterization of key substrate and co-substrate binding pockets of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, based on their <italic>in silico</italic> model authors reported analysis of the quaternary structure of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH as well as attempts to disrupt its oligomeric assembly [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite these efforts, neither <italic>Pf</italic>AspAT nor <italic>Pf</italic>MDH has as yet been validated as a drug target. In both cases (as well as in case of other malarial enzymes that possess close homologs in human host) an inhibition tool with sufficient specificity <italic>in vivo</italic> is needed for successful drug target validation.</p><p>Here we report the crystal structure of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH at 2.4&#197; resolution. Based upon an examination of the crystal structure we have identified two major oligomeric interfaces within the tetramer and designed two point mutations (E18W and V190W) aiming at disruption of these interfaces. As anticipated, both mutations distorted the native oligomeric state, resulting in dimeric species with alternated kinetic parameters and significantly reduced specific activity. No evidence of significant misfolding could be derived, as both mutants retained basal activity and the ability to bind to oxaloacetate and cofactor NADH. Alternatively, introduction of additional hydrogen bonds via the E18Q mutation has likely stabilized the respective interface and resulted in increased specific activity of the enzyme (malate formation) at sub-millimolar substrate concentration.</p><p>Furthermore, our co-purification experiments showed that deactivated <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W species were able to incorporate into the native <italic>Pf</italic>MDH assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>. The resulting chimeric protein contained both wild type and mutant copies, as confirmed by western blotting, and possessed no measurable activity.</p><p>These findings show that interference with oligomeric interfaces of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH could be used to modulate its function with high specificity. The structural information on <italic>Pf</italic>MDH has been used to generate recombinantly expressed mutant protein that could incorporate into the native assembly, inhibiting the specific activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Extension of such a method <italic>in vivo</italic> could be used as a general tool approach in drug target validation, especially in challenging cases where the active site of the target protein is highly conserved or no tool compound with sufficient specificity is available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Wild-type malate dehydrogenase (<underline><bold>EC 1.1.1.37</bold></underline>) from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH-WT) was cloned, recombinantly expressed, purified and crystallised, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-WT crystals belonged to P1 space group and diffracted to 2.4 &#197;.

While the majority of MDHs exists in a tetrameric form [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], a number of homologs from other species have been reported to exist in a dimeric form; and the oligomeric assembly of MDH has been suggested to be critical for the enzymatic function [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Each monomeric subunit of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH is comprised of 11 <italic>beta</italic>-sheets and 9 <italic>alpha</italic>-helixes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). Overall the fold of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH is highly similar to those of previously determined MDHs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> section). While enzymes of the malarial carbon metabolism pathway have been suggested to be promising drug targets, the similarity in fold and associated similarity in position of the active site residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t002">Table 2</xref>) provides a further demonstration of the difficulties of validating MDH as a malarial drug target. An insufficiently specific inhibitor of the MDH active site would almost certainly have significant cross-reactivity with the human MDH homologs&#8212;leading to difficulties in deconvoluting the effect of the MDH inhibitor on the parasite in <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Unfortunately, genetic approaches in the malarial parasite are non-trivial and would not necessarily provide a clearer route to the validation of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH as a drug target [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the crystal structure of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH showed that AB assembly is highly similar to that of the active <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g002">Fig 2e</xref>). Interestingly, the disruption of the AC interface via V190W mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</xref>) likely breaks the native tetrameric <italic>Pf</italic>MDH assembly into two inactive dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5a and 5d</xref>), as supported by SLS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>). Previous attempts to interfere with the native tetrameric assembly of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The authors proposed that disruption of a salt bridge near the AC oligomeric interface (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH-R183A/R214G) would cause the splitting of the tetramer into an AB dimer, analogous to the dimeric <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MDH. However, while this mutant retained activity, the investigation of the oligomeric state was performed using size exclusion chromatography rather than direct biophysical measurements. In our study, static light scattering experiments are used to demonstrate the oligomeric states of mutants, highlighting the importance of precise biophysical measurements when estimates of oligomeric state are made. Analysis of our crystal structure of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH also suggests that <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-R183A/R214G could potentially re-assemble into a tetramer in solution at least transiently, thereby retaining activity, as no inter-oligomeric clashes were introduced by these mutations. In contrast, our data demonstrate that the V190W and E18W interface mutations not only cause the breakdown of the native assembly into dimers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>), but also make the transient re-formation of the tetramer unlikely due to steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Significantly reduced specific activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5</xref>), decreased thermal stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and a shift to a lower oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>) observed for <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W and <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-E18W mutants suggest that tetrameric assembly of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH is crucial for its catalytic activity, although the AC and AB interfaces are well separated from the active sites. Furthermore, no obvious electrostatic connection can be observed between AC interface and the closest active site. Our kinetic data suggest that this is not as a result of the V190W or E18W mutations creating misfolded species, as the both mutants were still able to bind cofactor NADH and oxaloacetate, although with significantly altered affinities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, V190W mutation disrupting AC interface resulted in approx. 3x reduced affinity towards NADH and no apparent change in oxaloacetate binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>), while E18W showed approx. 10x reduced affinity towards NADH and 6x increased affinity towards oxaloacetate. These findings suggest different control mechanisms, facilitated by the proper formation of AB or AC interface.</p><p>As anticipated, stabilization of AB interface with additional hydrogen bonds (E18Q) improved NADH and oxaloacetate binding approx. 50-fold and 5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>). None of the <italic>Pf</italic>MDH variants (including wild type) addressed in this study showed measurable binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> or malate, supporting the assumption that malate-forming reaction is more favored under standard conditions [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, no significant thermal stabilization by NAD<sup>+</sup> or malate could be observed by TSA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t003">Table 3</xref>). These finding reflect the changes in catalytic activity, observed for all three mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Indeed, at intracellular malate concentration (approx. 1.6 mM), previously estimated by NMR spectroscopy [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], approx. 30x and 190x reduced specific activity for malate oxidation was observed for V190W and E18W mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). However, while V190W mutation 4x decreased specific activity for oxaloacetate reduction at sub-millimolar oxaloacetate concentration (0.625 mM), E18W mutant was approx. twice more active, compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5d</xref>). Similarly, in the same conditions E18Q stabilized mutant did not show significant changes in forward activity (malate&#8211;oxaloacetate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5c</xref>), while reverse reaction (oxaloacetate&#8212;malate) was 10x more rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5d</xref>).</p><p>These data also correlate with previous studies on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>aurantiacus</italic> MDH, where mutagenic alteration of the electrostatic interactions contributing to both AB and AC interfaces lead to pH-dependent thermal destabilization and up to 4-fold activity loss of resulting mutants compared to the wild type [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, mutagenic disruption of AB interface in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> MDH using steric clashes resulted in monomeric species and dramatically decreased activity [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Our data then show that incorporation of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W into the wild-type assembly is possible <italic>in vitro</italic>, as co-purification using sequential affinity chromatography steps results in a sample that contains both wild-type and V190W <italic>Pf</italic>MDH species, whereas the control experiments did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g006">Fig 6</xref>). No measurable activity could be observed for this chimeric assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g005">Fig 5c and 5d</xref>), demonstrating that incorporation of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W into the wild-type assemblies can provide a mechanism to specifically target the activity of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH. This is highly likely to be due to a perturbation of the oligomeric state through the introduction of a steric clash on the AC interface. Due to the activation effect observed for E18W mutant at sub-millimolar oxaloacetate concentrations we did not attempt to incorporate <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-E18W into the native assembly, as the aim of this study was rather specific inhibition.</p><p>The ability of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W to insert itself into the wild-type assembly and perturb its activity is of key importance for our future experiments, in which we will introduce this mutant as a recombinantly expressed protein within blood stage parasite cultures in order to provide validation of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH as a novel potential antimalarial drug target [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Our approach would potentially bypass the limitations often associated with conventional drug target validation techniques, such as poor inhibitor transportation, degradation, insufficient specificity or uncertainty in essential gene analysis [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

The lysates were separately clarified by centrifugation, mixed and incubated for 2 hours at 277 K [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The subsequent co-purification from the mixed lysates was performed via the Strep-tactin as well as via Ni-NTA agarose (IBA Lifesciences, Qiagen).</p><p>Co-purified <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-WT and <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-V190W were visualized by western blot using a monoclonal Strep-tag II antibody (IBA) or anti-His antibody (Pierce, USA) and a secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase labeled goat antibody (BioRad, Germany) as described in [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195011.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Crystallisation, X-ray data collection and structure determination</title><p><italic>Pf</italic>MDH was purified to homogeneity, concentrated and crystallised as described in [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195011.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The data collection statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195011.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Crystal structure of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH was initially solved by molecular replacement using BALBES software [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] within the CCP4 suite [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] using the data collected on X13 beamline (EMBL, Hamburg). The PDB model of <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> MDH (<underline><bold>2HJR</bold></underline>) [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used as a search model [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], yielding a clear solution for 16 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data from BM14 beamline (ESRF, Grenoble) was subsequently used for molecular replacement using MOLREP [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and confirmed the previously identified solution supporting the presence of four tetrameric <italic>Pf</italic>MDH assemblies in the asymmetric unit. Rebuilding and refinement were carried out using Coot [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Refmac5 [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], respectively. The presence of non-crystallographic symmetry was used as a restraint in refinement at all stages. The final model refined against data to a resolution of 2.4 &#197; and has been deposited with the PDB [<xref rid="pone.0195011.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] under the accession number <underline><bold>5NFR</bold></underline>.
