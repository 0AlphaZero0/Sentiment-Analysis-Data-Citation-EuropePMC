Germline mutations of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene causes AIP. Mutation of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene results into the partial deficiency of the heme biosynthetic enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase. AIP is clinically manifested with abdominal pain, vomiting, and neurological complaints. Additionally, an extreme phenotypic heterogeneity has been reported in AIP patients with mutations in <italic>HMBS</italic> gene. Here, we investigated a Chinese patient with AIP. The proband is a 28-year-old Chinese male manifested with severe stomach ache, constipation, nausea and depression. Proband&#8217;s father and mother is normal. Proband&#8217;s blood sample was collected and genomic DNA was extracted. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous novel single nucleotide deletion (c.809delC) in exon 12 of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene in the proband. This mutation leads to frameshift followed by formation of a truncated (p.Ala270Valfs<sup>&#8727;</sup>2) HMBS protein with 272 amino acids comparing with the wild type HMBS protein of 361 amino acids.

AIP is caused by the germline mutation of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene encoding the heme biosynthetic enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase which is the is the third enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Puy et al., 2010</xref>). In mitochondria, heme is produced by eight evolutionarily highly conserved enzymes by a complex cellular machinery (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka et al., 2006</xref>). Patients with AIP are characterized by the partial deficiency of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase. However, due to extreme phenotypic heterogeneity, the clinical diagnosis and proper treatment of AIP in China is highly challenging (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The clinical diagnosis of AIP has been made according to the clinical symptoms of the patient and biochemical examination. The level of porphobilinogen (PBG) in urine is a biochemical marker for the clinical diagnosis of AIP. Recently, whole exome sequencing is reported to be the best way to unveil the molecular genetic screening of the AIP patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka et al., 2006</xref>). Whole exome sequencing is essential for clinical diagnosis for AIP (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, over 360 <italic>HMBS</italic> gene mutations have been reported to be associated with AIP<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>, rarely been reported in the Chinese population (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Whatley and Badminton, 2013</xref>). Clinically AIP is usually manifested with severe abdominal or stomach ache, accompanied by nausea, constipation, and abdominal distention. Patients with AIP are also presented with several behavioral changes such as irritability, insomnia, and depression (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In our present study, we identified a Chinese patient with AIP. After clinical diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and biochemical test results, we undertaken a whole exome sequencing in order to understand the molecular genetic basis of the disease in this present case. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified, a single nucleotide deletion (c.809delC) in exon 12 of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene followed by the formation of a truncated (p.Ala270Valfs<sup>&#8727;</sup>2) HMBS protein in this proband.</p></sec><sec><title>Case Report</title><p>The proband was a Chinese man of 28 years of age belongs to a non-consanguineous Chinese parent. Two years ago, the proband was visited our hospital with abdominal ache, accompanied by nausea, constipation. Proband has high blood pressure (165/105 mmHg) with a heart rate of 101 beats/min. Proband&#8217;s serum sodium concentration was lower than normal (127 mmol/L), with no other abnormal findings. The result of abdomen X-ray and gastro-endoscopy are also normal. After half a year, he visited the hospital again with the same symptoms but with extremely lower serum sodium concentration (106 mmol/L). Due to the extremely low serum sodium concentration the proband was presented with frequent convulsion. Pathological test showed that there is no abnormality in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) as well as in the function of the endocrine gland. Proband also presented with chronic renal failure (creatinine concentration:155 &#956;mol/l, blood urea nitrogen concentration: 14.7 mmol/l). Blood test identified that the proband had mild anemia (hemoglobin:80 g/L), which is frequently observed in Chinese patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Proband&#8217;s biochemical test showed high level erythrocyte protoporphyrin, urine PBG, and uroporphyrin, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of AIP. We recommended and treated the proband with administration of 250 gm of glucose given as intravenous injection as well as with restricted taking of fluid the proband get better and gained consciousness. After treatment the proband&#8217;s serum sodium concentration level was normal (137 mmol/L).</p><p>In this family, we identified only one patient (Proband) and proband&#8217;s father and mother is normal. Hence, in order to understand the molecular genetic basis of the disease in this family we undertaken a whole exome sequencing and confirmatory Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Whole Exome Sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. All three family members (parents, proband) were subjected to exome sequencing. Sequences were captured by Agilent SureSelect version 4 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocols. The enriched library was sequenced on an Illumina HighSeq2000. The sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh37.p10 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner software (version 0.59). We then performed local realignment and base quality recalibration of the Burrows&#8211;Wheeler aligned reads using the GATK IndelRealigner and the GATK Base Recalibrator, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup>. Single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions or deletions (indel) were identified by the GATK Unified Genotyper (see footnote 2).

Germline mutations in <italic>HMBS</italic> gene causes AIP with partial deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase PBGD. However, AIP also may be life-threatening because of the presence of high level of porphyrin precursors in the nervous systems (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka et al., 2006</xref>). Clinically AIP is extremely heterogenous with a spectrum of disease phenotype which leads to misdiagnosis at the earlier stage.</p><p>Till now, approximately 360 <italic>HMBS</italic> gene mutations has been reported to be associated with AIP<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03">3</xref></sup>. In this study, we identified a novel <italic>HMBS</italic> gene mutation (c.809delC; p.Ala270Valfs<sup>&#8727;</sup>2) in a Chinese family. In China, due to poor awareness, proper and early clinical diagnosis for patients with AIP is very challenging. Moreover, generally, urinary &#948;-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) level and plasma emission peak were playing the key role for clinical diagnosis of AIP (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2013</xref>). But, in China, due to lack of these tests, genetic screening is obvious. Whole exome sequencing is the best possible way to understand the molecular genetics causes of the disease in patients with AIP.</p><p>Here, whole exome sequencing identified a novel heterozygous single nucleotide deletion c.809delC which leads to frameshift followed by formation of a truncated (p.Ala270Valfs<sup>&#8727;</sup>2) HMBS protein product by the formation of a premature stop codon. This report is the first family-based genetic study of Chinese AIP patients with deletion in <italic>HMBS</italic> gene in Mainland China. In this family, we identified only one patient (Proband) and proband&#8217;s father and mother is normal, establishing that the mutation is a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation.</p><p>In addition, here, the identified candidate mutation (c.809delC) causes formation of a truncated HMBS protein (p.Ala270Valfs<sup>&#8727;</sup>2) of 272 amino acids instead of the wild type HMBS protein which consists of 361 amino acids. So, this truncated HMBS protein lacks of 89 amino acid compared to the wild type HMBS protein. Therefore, this truncated HMBS protein will be unstable and causes haplo-insufficiency which finally results into AIP. This is the molecular consequences of this mutation. Hence, this is a <italic>&#8220;loss-of-function&#8221;</italic> mutation. According to the variant interpretation guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), this variant is classified as <italic>&#8220;likely pathogenic&#8221;</italic> variant (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Due to extreme phenotypic heterogeneity of AIP patients with <italic>HMBS</italic> mutations, we are also discussing here the genotype-phenotype correlation. Although, <italic>HMBS</italic> associated AIP cases are very common in western population, but in Chinese population it is very rare. In addition, in Chinese population, AIP associated with mild anemia is rarest. So, drawing the conclusion for the genotype-phenotype correlation is really challenging because phenotype is more population specific rather than mutation type or location. So, comparing between Chinese AIP patients with <italic>HMBS</italic> mutation and AIP patients of Western population are less useful for genotype-phenotype correlation study. In our future study, we are planning to work with a large cohort of Chinese AIP patients with <italic>HMBS</italic> mutations which would have a great sense or scientific significance for genotype-phenotype correlation study.</p><p>Germline mutation in <italic>HMBS</italic> gene leads to partial deficiency of HMBS protein followed by loss of the heme biosynthetic pathway which in turn causes accumulation of ALA and PBG. In AIP patients, consecutive loss of electrolyte balance could lead to brain damage by causing encephaloedema or seizures. Excessive accumulation of ALA and partial activity of heme leads to hypothalamic damage. In AIP patients, anemia, could be caused due to low rate of biosynthesis of heme in erythroid precursor cells from bone marrow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos et al., 2013</xref>). Proper awareness and genetic screening leads to early recognition and clinical diagnosis of AIP and prompt treatment which is important for clinical management. In China, due to unavailability of heme treatment, diet with high carbohydrate and restricted fluid intake causes gradual recovery of the AIP patients. In addition, follow up studies with AIP patients also a key factor for proper clinical management. In addition, our present study established the application of high throughput exome sequencing technology for understanding the genetic cause of the disease in AIP patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Here, we report a clinical case of rare AIP in a Chinese family. This case highlights the importance of whole exome sequencing for proper clinical diagnosis of the AIP associated with germline mutation in <italic>HMBS</italic> gene. Hence, molecular genetic screening of <italic>HMBS</italic> gene should be considered to confirm the patients clinically diagnosed with AIP. Our present study also emphasizes the significance of the high quality genetic analysis by whole exome sequencing in the molecular diagnosis of rare inherited mendelian disorders with extreme phenotypic heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>We obtained written informed consent for genomic analysis of the patient and his family members in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
