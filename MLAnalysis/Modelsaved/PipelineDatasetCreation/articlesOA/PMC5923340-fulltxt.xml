The objective was to identify changes in the levels of metabolites involved in septic shock progression and to integrate this information with the variation occurring in proteins and clinical data. Mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics and untargeted proteomics allowed us to quantify absolute metabolites concentration and relative proteins abundance. We computed the ratio D7/D1 to take into account their variation from day 1 (D1) to day 7 (D7) after shock diagnosis. Patients were divided into two groups according to 28-day mortality. Three different elastic net logistic regression models were built: one on metabolites only, one on metabolites and proteins and one to integrate metabolomics and proteomics data with clinical parameters. Linear discriminant analysis and Partial least squares Discriminant Analysis were also implemented. All the obtained models correctly classified the observations in the testing set. By looking at the variable importance (VIP) and the selected features, the integration of metabolomics with proteomics data showed the importance of circulating lipids and coagulation cascade in septic shock progression, thus capturing a further layer of biological information complementary to metabolomics information.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the last decade, advances in high-throughput proteomic and metabolomic techniques allowed to evaluate the association of genetic and phenotypic variability with disease progression. This aspect is fundamental in case of complex multifactorial syndromes, such as sepsis and septic shock, which are both characterized by a response to treatment different from patient to patient and extremely difficult to predict. Moreover, the same root cause (e.g. source of primary infection or pathogen) may lead to significantly different clinical phenotypes and outcomes.</p><p id="Par3">In recent years, the number of software aiming at integrating multiomics data is increasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The term &#8220;multi-omics data integration&#8221; refers to a new scientific request of combining multiple sources of information (omics) to provide deeper biological understanding. However, the majority of them are mainly devoted for interpreting genomics data and are based on a mechanistic interpretation, as the network-based (NB) approaches that take into account currently known (e.g. protein-protein interactions) or predicted (e.g. from correlation analysis) relationships between biological variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In this class, graph measures (e.g. degree, connectivity, centrality) and graph algorithms (e.g. sub-network identification) are used to identify valuable biological information. A different approach is based on statistical methods in order to find possible associations among variables and outcomes. Many softwares based on mathematical approaches usually adopted for data-mining or machine learning, are now freely available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. They are developed in Matlab<sup>TM</sup> or R environment and perform specific analyses on data given as input without any further constrains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The availability of such software has encouraged this field, but has not solved the problem how to deal with different types of data (e.g. different standards and different normalization approaches) and how to deal with a low number of observations, highly correlated variables, cross-over or longitudinal study. Different type of dataset requires different approaches and strategies. The comparison of the results from different models represents a valuable approach to support any possible associations found among variables.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we examined plasma metabolome, proteome and clinical features in a subset of patients with the most severe manifestation of sepsis, enrolled in the multicenter, randomized clinical trial ALBIOS (Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis study, NCT00707122<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). Patients were divided into survivors (S) and non-survivors (NS) according to 28-day mortality and plasma samples were collected one day (D1) and one week (D7) after diagnosis of septic shock. Integration of metabolomics and proteomics information was aimed at revealing molecular pathways as well as at identifying molecular features decisive in stratifying the patients.</p><p id="Par5">In our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> we found that profiles of specific metabolites, measured separately at D1 and at D7, markedly differed between survivor and non-survivor patients. More precisely, we observed that low unsaturated long-chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) species were associated with mortality together with circulating kynurenine. Therefore, we speculated that lipid homeostasis and tryptophan catabolism might influence mortality in septic shock.</p><p id="Par6">In light of these considerations, the aim of this study is to integrate our previous metabolomics results with the information derived from the proteomics analyses in order to have a more complete picture of the changes occurring during one week of treatment at the molecular level and to gain deeper insights into septic shock progression and individual patient&#8217;s response. Furthermore, as there are no established approaches or guidelines for integrating metabolomics and proteomics data, we adopted different techniques (i.e. regression analysis methods that performs both variable selection and regularization and partial least squares discriminant analysis) so to compare the features selected and their importance in different models.</p><p id="Par7">Our findings confirmed that non-survivors have different trend in plasma levels of lipid species in comparison to survivors, in line with our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The novelty of this study is the integration with proteomics data, which enables to highlight key features associated with the outcome. More precisely, our approach for integrating metabolites and proteins showed that the proteins decisive in stratifying the patients are those related to the inflammatory response and the coagulation cascade, which are known to play an important role in septic shock progression, thus reinforcing the feasibility and robustness of our integrative approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical characteristics of the study population</title><p id="Par8">Patients with severe septic shock enrolled in the multicenter ALBIOS clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria as previously reported, were analyzed.

Our methodology was based on ranking the species which changed from D1 to D7 in order to find the ones most related to the outcome or those that, although not significant alone, could highlight important association to particular pathways.</p><p id="Par20">In this work, our previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and literature findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> were confirmed: lipidome alteration was a prominent component of the metabolic phenotype in non-survivors patients with septic shock. A clear bio-signature characterizing non-survivors was their reduction over time in circulating PC species, containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, such as PC aa C42:6, PC aa C40:6, and lysoPC species (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). As already mentioned in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, such lowered PC and lysoPC species could hamper their protective effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and conceivably their reduction, especially lysoPC species, may also promote an excessive immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We also observed an imbalance in plasmalogens (PC ae) levels over time between NS and S. Plasmalogens serve as endogenous antioxidants, mediators of membrane structure and dynamics, storage for polyunsaturated fatty acids and lipid mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Raising PC ae levels protects human endothelial cells during hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> while their reduction might reflect an increased oxidative imbalance probably due to an excessive systemic inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response in non-survivors would be in accordance with the observed overall increase level of methylarginines (total dimethylarigine, DMA; symmetric dimegthylargine, SDMA; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) reported to impair macrophage functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and to be associated with increased mortality in patients with severe sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Such considerations are in line with proteomics findings. Significant changes in abundance between NS and S mainly involved those proteins which belong to the coagulation, innate immunity and inflammatory response pathways, whose importance has already been recognized in sepsis and septic shock settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Many works in literature have described modulation in plasma proteins in the complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic cascades in sepsis survivors and non-survivors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The interplay between these pathways were further highlighted by our integration analyses where lower over time variation of Complement C1-q proteins (P02745, P02746) and Hemopexin (P02790) were the most relevant features for non-survivors. The classical pathway of complement activation represents a link between innate and adaptive immunity. It is activated when Complement C1-q binds a target cell (apoptotic cell or bacteria) expressing membrane PC or antigen/antibody complexes. The activated complement cascade produces inflammatory mediators that stimulate leukocytes and lymphocytes migration. This set of events lead to the lysis of the target cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It is likely that lower variation of C1 complex proteins over one week may indicate worse pathogen clearance and inflammation control in non-survivors compared to survivors. The integration of omics data with clinical variables reinforced the results that low variation in complement C1 and PC metabolic species are associated with poor outcome.</p><p id="Par24">Similarly, lowered Hemopexin (P02790) could imply difficulties in non-survivors to counteract inflammation. Hemopexin is an heme-binding plasma glycoprotein with anti-inflammatory action probably trough the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Its decrease over time in non-survivors is in accordance with the low hemopexin serum levels related with poor prognosis of septic shock patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Non-survivors were also characterized by an increase in the abundance over-time of Cystatin-C (P01034), whose accumulation in plasma has been related to renal dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A worsening of renal function estimated by enhanced Cystatin-C rather than by creatinine has been recently described in septic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) presenting higher Cystatin C levels than non-AKI septic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Despite we did not observe significant differences in SOFA score for renal function between the two groups, this value increased from D1 to D7 in non-survivors whereas it decreased in survivors (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>)</p><p id="Par26">Integrated models with clinical data are of difficult interpretation, probably due to the fact that we considered a long time interval (7 days). In spite of this, the negative association of MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) with the outcome was expected since the duration of hypotension or a limited recovery of MAP values is an important predictor of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Increase of CVP (central venous pressure) and PEEP (Positive End-expiratory pressure) over time were also indicative of poor outcome in our integrated model. In fact, in the interaction between arterial circulation, organ perfusion and venous circulation, CVP represents the downstream pressure and the increase in downstream pressure may generate congestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Age was not considered in our model as our cohort has a limited range in age. Indeed, no significant age differences were found between survivor and non survivors. The range of age in people affected by sepsis is very wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Consequently, age could be a factor if the cohort under study is very heterogeneous in terms of age and this was not our case.</p><p id="Par28">Importantly, no significant associations between type of fluid administered and mortality was observed in our study population, which is a subset of a larger cohort in the well-defined clinical trial ALBIOS. Indeed, the study on ALBIOS database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> showed that in patients with severe sepsis, albumin replacement in addition to crystalloids, as compared with crystalloids alone, did not improve the rate of survival at 28 and 90 days. Thus our results are in line with what observed for the entire database.</p><p id="Par29">We are aware of the limitations of our study. First of all, the size of the datasets used to build the classification models is small. However, we tried to reduce the confounding factors by focusing on a homogeneous group of patients, i.e. severe septic shock ones. We thus hypothesized that the changes observed are mainly related to shock progression and different prognoses. Moreover, we measured metabolites and proteins at two time points only within one week from the diagnosis of septic shock, and biological features with temporal changes out of this time window might provide a more precise insight for the clinical progression of the disease.</p><p id="Par30">Finally, we are aware that selected features before the multivariate analyses certainly affect the successive analyses, but we think that our methodological pipeline may represent an acceptable trade-off approach. The filter approach was necessary to avoid unreliable results, as the features are highly correlated and the logistic regression applied to such type of dataset may not be consistent. Feature reduction is extremely useful when a model is affected by multicollinearity, as in our case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In fact, if we have high collinearity and a condition where number of feature <italic>p</italic> is much higher than the number <italic>n</italic> of observations, the algorithm for the coefficients estimate can fail, the overall significance of the model is compromised and the estimate of the regression coefficient can be inaccurate. Therefore, our decisions were driven by the characteristics of our data (i.e. strongly correlated features) and by the size of our dataset: low number of observations (patients) with respect to high number of variables (metabolites, proteins, clinical features)</p><p id="Par31">We must also recall that we are not interested in prediction but in the development of an approach to describe the current dataset and to identify the main pathways involved in pathology progression within the studied cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">In conclusion, for the first time in patients with sepsis, our integrative approach was able to capture possible evolution and variations of metabolic and proteomic signatures during a well-established pathophysiologic manifestation of severe septic shock.</p><p id="Par33">Changes in the abundance of metabolites and proteins within seven days from diagnosis could distinguish survivors and non-survivors among severe septic shock patients. Our data reinforced the emerging evidence that lipidome alterations might influence mortality in septic shock, probably by a cross-talk with inflammatory responses. This study also showed that the combination of proteomics and metabolomics data provides a more complete view of mortality orchestrators, interconnecting complement system and inflammation. Although further validations are needed in a bigger cohort, our results may constitute an important step toward the investigation of combined therapeutic strategies targeted at alteration of both inflammation susceptibility and coagulation cascade.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study design, patients and clinical data</title><p id="Par34">This pilot retrospective investigation was an ancillary study of the multicenter, randomized Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) clinical trial.

Written informed consent or deferred consent was obtained from each patient. Patients were managed by the clinical care team according to international guidelines.

In addition, we consider only patients remaining in ICU until 7 up to 14 days from shock onset (until either ICU discharge or death). Exclusion criteria were: presence of active hematological malignancy or cancer, immunodepression, HIV infection, chronic renal failure, or advanced cirrhosis. Such inclusion and exclusion criteria were in accordance with those of the multicenter clinical study, ShockOmics (NCT02141607), and the current study represents a proof of concept study in view of further patient cohort. Only 20 among the 997 patients enrolled in ALBIOS trial and with plasma samples stored in the biobank fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three out of 20 available patients have been excluded from the present study due to technical problems in handling the plasma samples for proteomics analysis.</p><p id="Par37">The following demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were considered: (i) demographic and anamnestic information collected at ICU admission, at day 1 and at day 7: age (years), sex, body mass index, source of infection and type of infection; (ii) hemodynamic parameters: heart rate (bpm), mean arterial pressure (mmHg), central venous pressure (mmHg), daily urinary output (ml/die); (iii) ventilation parameters: positive end-expiratory pressure (cmH<sub>2</sub>0), inspiratory oxygen fraction &#8211;FiO<sub>2</sub> (%); (iv) blood gas analysis: central venous O<sub>2</sub> saturation, venous partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, central venous partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, arterial and venous pH; (v) laboratory and clinical parameters: serum concentrations of creatinine (mg/dL), bilirubin (mg/dL), lactate (mmol/L), platelet count (x10<sup>3</sup> cells/mm<sup>3</sup>); (vi) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) in order to assess daily organ functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, total SOFA score and the sub-scores relating to the respiratory, coagulation, hepatic, cardiovascular, and renal systems; (vii) use of renal replacement therapy (continuous venous-venous hemofiltration), need for ventilatory support.

In particular, the following criteria were used for proteins selection: 1) only proteins identified in all iTRAQ experiments were included; 2) contaminant proteins (i.e. the most abundant proteins that should be previously depleted in the immunodepletion process) were removed; 3) only proteins quantified with at least two unique peptides were included. After this selection, 132 proteins were considered for further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Targeted metabolomics</title><p id="Par40">A targeted quantitative approach using a combined direct flow-injection and liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay (AbsoluteIDQ 180 kit, Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) was applied for the metabolomics analysis of plasma. Methodological details and data preprocessing have been extensively reported in our previous articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and in the Supplemental Information. Briefly, the method combines derivatization and extraction of analytes with the selective mass-spectrometric detection using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) pairs. Isotope-labeled internal standards are integrated into the platform for metabolite absolute quantification. This strategy allows simultaneous quantification of 186 metabolites (40 amino acids and biogenic amines, 40 acylcarnitines, 90 glycerophospholipids, 15 sphingomyelins, 1 monosaccharide). A metabolite was excluded from further analysis if its concentration did not meet all the following criteria: (1) fewer than 20% of missing values (non-detectable peak) for each quantified metabolite in each experimental group (2) 50% of all sample concentrations for the metabolite had to be above the limit of detection (LOD). In total, 137 of the 186 metabolites expressed as pg/ml were considered for statistical analysis. The list of all the measurable metabolites and the plasma concentration of the metabolites for each patient are provided in Supplemental Information (Tables&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Multivariate analysis</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data from targeted metabolomics analyses</title><p id="Par41">The aim of our model was to classify NS patients, in particular to find the species which are mostly associated with the outcome. We built the model on the ratio D7/D1 of metabolite concentrations. Because of the small sample size (17 patients) and the large number of features (137 metabolites), collinearity represents a crucial issue. The method used to reduce the number of features is the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, a filter algorithm based on the mutual information (freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/">http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/</ext-link>). This algorithm ranks features according to their correlation to the outcome (maximum relevance of the feature) and to which information is not explained by the features already selected (minimum redundancy). We considered the first 10, 20 and 30 ranked metabolites to build three different classification models. Data were first normalized (Z score normalization) and the dataset was divided into a training and test set as two third and one third of the observations, respectively.</p><p id="Par42">We adopted two strategies to further select a smaller subset of features. We performed 50 times an elastic net logistic model using a logit function to fit the training set data (<italic>lasso</italic> and <italic>lassoglm</italic> routines in Matlab&#174; enviroment). We decided to use elastic net, as it was proposed to overcome the limits of lasso in cases like our<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Indeed, when the number of observation <italic>n</italic> is much higher than the number of features <italic>p</italic>, the lasso selects at most <italic>n</italic> variables before it saturates, because of the nature of the convex optimization problem. This seems to be a limiting feature for a variable selection method. If there is a group of variables among which the pairwise correlations are very high, then the lasso tends to select only one variable from the group and does not care which one is selected. We decide to use &#120572;&#8201;=&#8201;0.5, i.e. the weight of lasso (L1) versus ridge (L2) optimization, as a good compromise.</p><p id="Par43">We considered a binary classification (S&#8201;=&#8201;0, NS&#8201;=&#8201;1) and the output of the model is a value between 0 and 1, which represents a sort of probability. We then selected the coefficients of the model with the minimal deviance. We also applied another strategy, instead of the coefficients we select the shrinkage parameter &#955;, corresponding to the model with the minimal deviance, and we used it to fit the elastic net model on the training set to obtain the coefficients of the logistic regression. In both cases, the models were then evaluated on the testing set and the performance were assessed by the number of correct imputations.</p><p id="Par44">Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were also used (toolbox freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.libpls.net">http://www.libpls.net</ext-link><underline>)</underline>. More precisely, LDA was performed on the first 10 ranked metabolites and the coefficients for the linear boundary between the first and second classes were retrieved. PLS-DA was performed both on the first 10 and 20 ranked metabolites, considering 3 PLS components. Since the groups are unbalanced, the data matrix was weighted centered in order to avoid having a decision boundary shifted towards the most numerous group. The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores, which represent the weights of each feature in PLS-DA model, and the coefficients of LDA were compared to those of logistic regression. Also in this case, the performance of the classification models was evaluated by considering the number of correct imputations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Integration of targeted metabolomics and proteomics data</title><p id="Par45">We built an integrated model by merging targeted metabolomics and proteomics data.

These proteins were then combined with the first 50 ranked metabolites and the mRMR was performed again on these new features subset composed of 50 metabolites and 50 proteins.
