It was revealed that quercetin possesses good binding affinity to both targets. Quercetin is a major constituent of methanolic extracts of <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> fruit. The antihyperglycemic effect of quercetin in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was examined. The isolated quercetin administered at a dose of 75&#160;mg/kg body weight produced a maximum decrease of 14.78% in blood glucose levels in the diabetic rats after 7 days of treatment. Furthermore, quercetin doses of 50 and 75&#160;mg/kg were shown to significantly improve the profiles of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol at the end of the study in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The administration of quercetin (25, 50, and 75&#160;mg/kg body weight) daily for 28 days in STZ-induced diabetic rats resulted in a significant decrease in blood glucose and urine sugar levels, with a considerable rise in plasma insulin and hemoglobin levels. Therefore, quercetin is a potential drug with antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic action mediated by changes in the levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides as indicated by in silico and in vivo studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioactive molecules</kwd><kwd>Glycogen phosphorylase</kwd><kwd>Molecular docking</kwd><kwd>Phyllanthus emblica</kwd><kwd>Quercetin</kwd><kwd>Albino Wister male rats</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin action, insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, or both <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition, DM is a group of diseases characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to deficiency of insulin action, a common basis of diabetes that leads to characteristic abnormalities in the metabolism of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The total number of diabetic patients worldwide was estimated to increase from 171 million in the year 2000 to 366 million in 2030 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, although the latter level was already attained in 2011 according to the International Diabetes Federation. A major part of this increase occurred in Asia, mainly China and India <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A popular theory on meal-induced insulin secretion (the &#8220;incretin effect&#8221;) states that glucose or any other drug is more effective on the pancreatic cells when administered orally than when given through intravenous or subcutaneous injections <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends plant-based drugs as an alternative medicine <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Renewed attention to alternative medicines and natural therapies has raised researchers' interest in traditional herbal medicine. Because of their perceived effectiveness, with minimal side effects and relatively low costs, herbal drugs are prescribed widely, even when the contents of their biologically active constituents are unknown <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Hence, people are seeking traditional medicines for the management of DM.</p><p id="p0010">Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds widely distributed as secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom. They are recognized for having beneficial clinical properties, such as anti-inflammatory <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, cardioprotective <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer activities <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Quercetin is one of the flavonoids found in the fruits of medicinal plants, such as <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> and <italic>Vaccinium oxycoccos</italic>. We have observed that the tribal people of Pachamalai hills use Amla fruits (<italic>P. emblica)</italic> as a traditional medicine for diabetes. <italic>P. emblica</italic> is referenced in &#8220;Rasayana,&#8221; a branch of the 5000-year-old Indian medical system &#8220;Ayurveda,&#8221; which focuses on enhancing good health, preventing diseases by boosting the immune system, as well as rejuvenating and revitalizing the body and mind <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It is still used extensively not only in India, but also in Iran, Iraq, Thailand, China, Italy, Germany, and other countries as a laxative, diuretic, astringent, and antiemetic. It is also used to treat other ailments, including anemia, jaundice, and tumors <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Computational biology and bioinformatics play an important role in drug design and screening. Molecular docking of a drug molecule with its target molecule can provide vital information about the drug-receptor binding and affinity. Bioinformatics and molecular docking studies helped us determine the efficacy of quercetin<italic>,</italic> found in <italic>P. emblica,</italic> in the treatment of DM. These computational results motivated us to further the study by purifying quercetin from the extract of <italic>P. emblica</italic> fruit.

In the present study, this phytocompound was selected via molecular docking analysis. Quercetin was orally administered at different doses (25, 50, and 75&#160;&#160;mg/kg) in rats with experimentally induced hyperglycemia. The body weights of the rats are shown in <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The baseline weight of the rats at the beginning of the study was similar among all groups. At the end of the treatment (after 4 weeks), the diabetic animals had lost weight due to the catabolism of protein in muscle tissue caused by insulin deficiency <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, the quercetin-treated diabetic rats had not lost body weight (<xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).

Similar results were obtained by another group, and collectively, suggest that quercetin treatment protects against diabetic weight loss <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The use of medicinal plants is increasing due to the extraction and development of many successful drugs and chemotherapeutic agents from plants and their use as traditional rural herbal remedies <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. STZ causes selective destruction of &#946;-cells of the pancreatic islets, which leads to an increase in blood glucose levels. It is evident from the present investigation that STZ administration at a dose of 60&#160;mg/kg causes significant diabetogenic response in the rats (<xref rid="t0040" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). Blood glucose levels were measured randomly at baseline and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of the study. The increased glucose levels in the diabetic control group were found to be significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to that of the normal control group. The elevated blood glucose levels declined sharply after oral administration of quercetin (25, 50, and 75&#160;mg/kg) or metformin (10&#160;mg/kg). When comparisons were made between baseline and the 28th day in the treated groups, there was a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) decline in blood glucose levels. If the decline in blood glucose levels is the only index to be considered, then treatment with quercetin or metformin produced a highly effective antihyperglycemic response in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Considering the relative efficacy, although all tested concentrations of quercetin produced antihyperglycemic activity, quercetin of 75&#160;mg was shown to produce the highest antihyperglycemic activity among all tested agents including metformin (<xref rid="t0040" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The reduction in blood glucose levels is the principal therapeutic goal of diabetes. According to Torres-Piedra et al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, quercetin significantly reduced the glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. The effective control of blood glucose levels by increasing the secretion of insulin and regeneration of &#946;-cells in the pancreas is a vital step in preventing cardiovascular and diabetic complications and improving the quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.
