It is clear that the genome defines species lifespan, but the DNA sequence in itself cannot fully explain the aging process. Analyses of epigenetic phenomena, which affect gene expression and chromatin structure and link environmental and genetic factors, may offer a better understanding of the aging process. DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, and microRNA expression show complex changes during aging (Huidobro, Fernandez, &amp; Fraga, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). For example, DNA methylation is gradually decreased during aging in different species, including humans, but certain genomic regions, such as CpG islands, are known to gain methylation with age. There is an emerging need for deep analyses of the DNA methylome across ages to define the specific patterns and determine whether the changes are uniform across the genome and its regions, and whether they are consistent during aging. Increased mortality with age in humans supports the idea of acceleration, and this is also consistent with the current understanding of the aging process (Gladyshev, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), although experimental analyses are needed to clarify these issues.</p><p>Several earlier studies investigated DNA methylation changes during aging in humans (Horvath et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Johansson, Enroth, &amp; Gyllensten, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Jones, Goodman, &amp; Kobor, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; McClay et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Rakyan et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Sun et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Changes in DNA methylation with age are less clearly understood in mice; yet, mouse studies offer an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of methylome remodeling due to the availability of genetic and dietary models and amenability for whole&#8208;organism experiments. Previous mouse studies revealed age&#8208;related changes in promoters and increasing methylation of development&#8208; and differentiation&#8208;related pathways (Maegawa et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). A global age&#8208;related increase in entropy was also shown (Wang et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and dietary restriction was found to influence hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism&#8208;related pathways (Hahn et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Another advantage of mouse studies is that they allow investigating evolutionarily conserved and species&#8208;specific changes during aging and examining the effects of interventions that extend lifespan. Such studies may broaden our understanding of epigenetic regulation of aging and the molecular basis of lifespan&#8208;extending interventions. In this study, we examined these questions in detail by characterizing highly resolved aging&#8208;related changes in the mouse blood DNA methylome.</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="acel12738-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Global trends in DNA methylation during aging</title><p>We assessed age&#8208;related changes in DNA methylation based on reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of blood of 141 C57BL/6 male mice representing 16 age groups (Petkovich et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Table&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). The youngest mice were 3&#160;months old (young adults), and the oldest 35&#160;months old (corresponding to the survival of the remaining 10% animals). After filtering and preprocessing (see <xref rid="acel12738-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>), the dataset included approximately 800,000 CpG sites present in every sample. We performed multidimensional scaling to investigate global changes in the DNA methylome with age (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>a). The average methylation status of CpG sites was slightly below 0.5 (one sample Student's <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;=&#160;1.99&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;134</sup>; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>b), that is, the genome was slightly hypomethylated. Linear regression was then performed, accounting for every site and possible confounding factors. There was a slight, but significant decrease in the global methylome with age (<italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;=&#160;6.05&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;152</sup>; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>b).</p><p>Linear regression (fraction methylated <italic>vs</italic> age of animal) was further performed in a site&#8208;by&#8208;site manner, again accounting for possible confounding factors, and multiple data transformations were used to investigate nonlinear trends during aging (Table&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), with Akaike information criterion (AIC) indicating the best fitting models. We found that 21.2% of the sites were significantly correlated with age, including 10.2% that gained methylation and 11% that lost it (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>a).

These sites either gained methylation with age (41.6%; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) or lost it (44.3%; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and changed predominantly in late life. In addition, 14% of the sites showed robust changes during early adulthood (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>a,b). We similarly investigated the dataset of 651 human samples from the age of 19 to 101&#160;years (Hannum et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), and the best fitting models were highly consistent with the mouse data (<mml:math id="nlm-math-2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>age</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#8764;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>methylation</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#8722;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math>: 81%, <mml:math id="nlm-math-3"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>ln</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mtext>age</mml:mtext></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>&#8764;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext>methylation</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#8722;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math>: 19% of the significant sites; Figures <xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>; Table&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="acel12738-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Global and region&#8208;specific changes in <styled-content style="fixed-case">DNA</styled-content> methylation with age.

Sites with increasing methylation were characterized by the low methylation status, and those with decreasing methylation by high methylation, compared with the average methylation levels (permutation test, <italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;&lt;&#160;.0001 in both cases). The relationship between the regression slope and the mean methylation fraction for every site was also visualized (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>) revealing a significant negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.384, linear regression <italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;&lt;&#160;2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>). Again, sites with increasing methylation were hypomethylated, and those with decreasing methylation hypermethylated.</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0004"><label>2.2</label><title>Various genomic regions show distinct remodeling patterns in DNA methylation</title><p>In addition to the global trends, we investigated changes in DNA methylation in distinct genomic regions. We performed linear regression analysis for various parts of the genome, following assignment of significant age&#8208;related sites to annotated genomic regions (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The CpG methylation fraction was normalized by extracting the mean and dividing it by the standard deviation. Using this approach, we could examine dominant changes based on the number of changing sites, diminishing the effect of the degree of change for different sites that could potentially bias the results. We observed a strong age&#8208;related gain in methylation in CpG islands (CGIs), 5&#8242;&#8208;UTRs, first exons of genes and gene promoters; a strong increase in methylation could also be observed around the transcription start sites (TSSs; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We observed an age&#8208;related methylation gain in many gene regions, such as exons and exon&#8211;intron boundaries, with the exception of introns and 3&#8242;&#8208;UTRs, which tended to lose methylation with age. More broadly, increasing methylation was observed at the 5&#8242;&#8208;ends and decreasing at the 3&#8242;&#8208;ends of genes. Regulatory elements, such as microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>a), DNase hypersensitivity sites, and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) tended to gain methylation during aging. We also observed increasing methylation in evolutionary conserved regions, core conserved regions, and ultra&#8208;conserved regions. Regions with decreasing methylation included intergenic and repetitive regions (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>b), the latter representing various classes of retrotransposons (Table&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Overall, the mouse blood DNA methylome was characterized by robust remodeling with age, and its patterns and directions of change were dependent on the location of CpG sites within various functional regions of the genome.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="acel12738-fig-0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Genomic regions are characterized by distinct age&#8208;related changes.

Increasing sites tended to be enriched in regions that gained methylation and decreasing sites in regions that lost it with age. After correction for cell type composition changes during aging (Houseman et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), we found somewhat fewer significant sites (7%), revealing a pattern reminiscent of the original regional regression analysis (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). Finally, we compared changes during aging (regression slope) in promoters (Promoters&#8208;Encode), enhancers (Enhancers&#8208;Encode), and TFBS between all sites, sites in regions with human&#8211;mouse homology and sites in mouse&#8208;specific regions (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Sites in homologous regions tended to gain, and sites in mouse&#8208;specific groups to lose methylation during aging compared to all sites in&#160;that region and to each other (Student's <italic>t</italic> test, adjusted <italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;&lt;&#160;.05).</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0005"><label>2.3</label><title>Effects of CGIs, shores, and shelves on methylation trends</title><p>Consistent with previous studies (Florath, Butterbach, Muller, Bewerunge&#8208;Hudler, &amp; Brenner, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Horvath et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Rakyan et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), we found that the distance between the sites and CGIs strongly influenced methylation changes during aging, as CGIs gained and non&#8208;islands lost methylation. CGIs may overlap with other genome regions, and the aging changes in them may be driven by overlapping islands and may be less characteristic of the region itself or non&#8208;island parts of the genome. To examine this possibility, we removed, from every region, sites that could be assigned to (i) CGI, (ii) CGI and CGI shores, and (iii) CGI, CGI shore, and CGI shelves (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). In most regions, CGIs had a strong effect on the overall pattern and mostly influenced regions that gained methylation. Many regions even changed their overall direction of change during aging after the removal of CGIs, but the most increasing regions, such as promoters, 5&#8242;UTRs and first exons, still gained methylation with age. Methylation changes during aging in ultra&#8208;conserved regions tended to be less influenced by the overlapping CGIs than other regions that gained methylation. CGI island shores and shelves showed a minor additional effect.</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0006"><label>2.4</label><title>Pathway enrichment of promoters and genes with age&#8208;associated methylation changes</title><p>To get a deeper understanding of the possible biological impact of methylation changes during aging, we carried out pathway GSEA (Subramanian et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) on promoters (Table&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>).

Thus, most sites with the initial shift following the intervention changed in the same direction as they did during aging.

We also investigated the sites, which change during both IS and TAT (including, but not limited to the sites with age&#8208;related changes), and observed a strong negative correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.988, <italic>p</italic>&#8208;value&#160;&lt;&#160;2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>; Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The data suggest that these sites initially change after the start of the intervention, but then the cumulative effect drives methylation back to the level of the control group.

We observed a significant negative correlation, consistent with the idea that long&#8208;term CR slows down aging of the methylome. We further compared the average methylation difference between every control and CR site in the oldest age group and the age&#8208;related regression slope of every site in all CR samples (four age groups) and observed a significant positive correlation (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>b), showing that the long&#8208;term cumulative changes shifted the methylome toward the direction of the cumulative effect itself.

For this, we examined the relation between the linear model coefficients of significant CR&#8208;related changes in C57BL/6 mice and the same sites in B6D2F1 mice, assessing general relation of trends after CR in the two strains.

To further characterize age&#8208;related methylation changes, we prepared density plots for every age group, including all sites (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) or only the sites that showed significant changes with age (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Methylation levels for most sites were close to either 0 or 1; during aging, these extreme methylation states moved toward intermediate levels. These changes were even more pronounced among the sites that changed with age, pointing out to an age&#8208;related increase in entropy. We quantified these changes by calculating Shannon entropy (Hannum et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) for individual samples and performing linear regression against age and confounders, verifying a significant increase in entropy with age.

Expected slope was then calculated for all sites, based on the intercept of linear regression and fitted values of generalized additive model, and the residual methylation fraction (RMF) was calculated by subtracting age&#160;&#215;&#160;expected slope from the original methylation fractions (OMFs). After normalizing for the average entropy effect, linear regression was calculated for every RMF, accounting for confounding factors, using multiple data transformation, and choosing the best fitting model based on AIC. We found many sites (496,383 sites, 61.9%) without age&#8208;related changes in OMF, but the RMF changed with age (Figure&#160;<xref rid="acel12738-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). These sites had low or high methylation levels and resisted changes during aging. We observed 96,231 sites (12%), where OMF changed with age, but the entropy&#8208;normalized RMF did not. Methylation of these sites changed during aging, but these changes could be explained by the average entropy effect. We also detected 73,895 (9.2%) sites that changed based on both OMF and RMF. These sites showed age&#8208;related changes: 32.8% changed more than the average entropy, 49.5% less than the average entropy, and 17.7% changed in the opposite direction, that is, these sites were already highly methylated, but further increased methylation during aging and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Finally, 16.9% of the sites did not change in either analysis: These sites showed intermediate methylation levels and did not change with age.

The Robust changes were observed in late (86% sites) and early (14% sites) life, whereas few changes were seen throughout middle ages, suggesting that the primary changes during aging are not linear and that they either accelerate or decelerate with age in both mice and humans. Accelerating nature of the majority of CpG changes is consistent with the exponential increase in molecular damage and with the model of the rising deleteriome (Gladyshev, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), whereas developmental processes appear to underlie the decelerating sites during aging.</p><p>We observed strong methylation gain with age at the 5&#8242; ends of genes. In contrast, loss of methylation occurred at the 3&#8242;UTRs and noncoding (introns) and intergenic regions. These findings in mice agree with previous human studies (McClay et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Johansson et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), indicating conservation of age&#8208;related changes in DNA methylation across species. We also observed increasing DNA methylation in other regulatory regions, such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. CGI&#8208;related methylation was previously shown to suppress the expression of microRNAs and contribute to human cancers (Lujambio &amp; Esteller, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). These observations support interactions between different epigenetic mechanisms of aging. Repetitive regions showed decreasing methylation with age. These changes in retrotransposons may promote the expression of these elements and increase damage to the genome in late life (Robertson &amp; Wolffe, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Yoder, Walsh, &amp; Bestor, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>).</p><p>Evolutionarily conserved elements, most notably ultra&#8208;conserved regions (100% sequence identity between human, mouse, and rat) gained methylation during aging. Increasing evidence suggests that these regions may be differentially expressed in human lymphomas and carcinomas (Calin et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). CGI hypermethylation suppresses the expression of the ultra&#8208;conserved regions, which is not uncommon in human cancers (Lujambio et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Human&#8211;mouse homologs seemed to be mostly gaining, whereas mouse&#8208;specific regions losing methylation during aging. Overall, evolutionarily&#160;conserved elements tended to gain methylation during&#160;aging.</p><p>The presence of 5&#8208;methylcytosine at CpG dinucleotides created a fivefold depletion of this sequence during vertebrate evolution, probably due to spontaneous and enzyme&#8208;induced mutations (Bird, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>; Gonzalgo &amp; Jones, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). This may provide an explanation for hypomethylation of evolutionarily conserved regions and suggests that methylation gain during aging may promote mutations in the conserved elements in late life, contributing to the aging process.</p><p>CGIs were found to be among the regions that gained methylation most, similar to the results of human studies (Jones et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), and overlapping CGIs had a strong effect on the increasing regions. Regions with the strongest methylation gain, such as promoters, first exons, and 5&#8242;UTRs, showed a general methylation increase with age even when the overlapping CGIs were removed. Methylation gain in promoters was frequently associated with overlapping CGIs (Saxonov, Berg, &amp; Brutlag, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), although our findings suggest that promoters even without overlapping CGIs gain methylation during aging.</p><p>Pathway enrichment analysis of promoters and genes illuminated the biology behind the changes. Genes and promoters that lost methylation tended to be enriched in pathways that maintain cell homeostasis, for example, DNA repair&#8208;related pathways. These pathways are expected to become more expressed during aging, based on the idea of the inverse relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression (Jones et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Many immunological and inflammation&#8208;related pathways were also enriched, in agreement with the known increase in inflammation in late life (Lopez&#8208;Otin et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The most dominant pathways of genes and promoters gaining methylation during aging were developmental genes (Maegawa et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), which may indicate the decreasing expression of at least a subset of developmental genes during aging. There were also pathways in this group of promoters known to contribute to aging and lifespan&#8208;extending interventions, such as regulation of cell response to growth factor stimulus (Lopez&#8208;Otin et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Heilbronn &amp; Ravussin, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), insulin&#8208;like growth factor and response to insulin&#8208;related pathways (van Heemst, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), response to estradiol (Harrison et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), and ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteolysis (Ott &amp; Grune, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Promoters involved in fatty acid metabolism (Hahn et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and WNT&#8208;, Notch&#8208;, and TGF&#946;&#8208;related pathways also showed changes during aging (Carlson et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Methylation changes in the MAPK cascade were reported previously during aging in mice (Hahn et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). There were pathways gaining methylation in gene bodies that were enriched for regulation of cellular aging and senescence. We also observed methylation&#8208;related pathways enriched in gene bodies gaining methylation. Interestingly, a previous study showed decreased expression of <italic>DNMT1</italic> (Ray et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) in mouse T cells during aging; this is the main <italic>DNMT</italic> expressed in adulthood that maintains DNA methylation of adult dividing cells (Armstrong, Rakoczy, Rojanathammanee, &amp; Brown&#8208;Borg, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). These changes may contribute to misregulation of methylation machinery and a consequent entropy increase during aging. Cancer&#8208;related pathways in promoters and gene bodies gained methylation, supporting the known relation between aging and cancer development (Lopez&#8208;Otin et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These enriched pathways indicate that DNA methylation may have a critical role during aging in mice.</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0013"><label>3.2</label><title>Long&#8208;term CR slows down aging of the methylome</title><p>CR is known to extend lifespan of mice and many other species (Bordone &amp; Guarente, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). We could detect two distinct responses to this longevity intervention. First, our analyses revealed that, initially, CR shifted the DNA methylome in the same direction as aging. This initial shift may be at least partly a response to stress caused by CR. Second, the cumulative change during CR affected the methylation pattern differently (compared to aging and compared to the initial shift by CR), and this cumulative trend seemed to shift the methylome toward a younger state (compared to control) and/or slow down aging of the methylome.</p><p>Cumulative changes may influence the methylome in two different ways. On the one hand, they may affect sites with the initial shift caused by CR; in this case, the cumulative effect counteracts this shift. This effect may be compensatory with regard to the initial shift, as 98.2% of these sites do not differ from control in the oldest age group. On the other hand, the cumulative effect may influence the initially nonchanging sites and slow down the aging process. These sites appear to represent the long&#8208;term, lifespan&#8208;extending biological effect of CR. We observed that, initially, the methylome seemed to become older, whereas in the oldest age group the methylome appeared to be younger in the CR group, suggesting that the cumulative effect has a larger longevity impact following long&#8208;term CR. The cumulative nature of CR is also confirmed by the meta&#8208;analysis of longevity studies in mice, wherein aging rate, but not vulnerability parameter, was shown to be a crucial coefficient of the Gompertz model explaining the CR influence on lifespan (Garratt, Nakagawa, &amp; Simons, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, the earlier start of the treatment strongly increases the degree of lifespan extension via CR in mice (Simons, Koch, &amp; Verhulst, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies are consistent with our findings. Heterozygous <italic>DNMT1</italic> knockout mice are characterized by slower immune senescence (Richardson, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Young <italic>DNMT1</italic> knockout mice feature general hypomethylation, the same trend as control mice during aging. On the other hand, older knockout mice showed hypermethylation and decreased immune senescence. Another study revealed that different sites change in response to CR in young and old mice (Hahn et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). A negative correlation was also shown between the methylation drift during aging and methylation changes following long&#8208;term CR in mice and monkeys (Maegawa et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and the severity and duration of CR may have influenced the resulting methylation patterns. Based on these findings, the cumulative effect of CR seems to slow down the aging pattern of the methylome and it may have a more important role for lifespan extension, compared to the transient initial shift. In addition, the role of the cumulative effect in our and other studies suggests a strong link between DNA methylation and aging. It should also be noted that the pattern of methylome changes following CR was similar in mice in different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0014"><label>3.3</label><title>Increased entropy alters the developmental pattern</title><p>Most CpG sites changed with age toward intermediate methylation states, pointing to altered entropy of the methylome. Previous studies revealed increased entropy in human DNA methylation (Hannum et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and in mouse livers aged 0.2 to 7.1&#160;months old (Wang et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We were able to examine changes in entropy across the whole mouse and human lifespan at a high resolution. Interestingly, we observed acceleration of entropy changes in older ages, in agreement with the rise in accumulating damage and the deleteriome (Gladyshev, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Around 20% of the sites changed during aging, with the nearly equal numbers of those that increased and decreased methylation, but the global trend was associated with slightly decreased methylation with age, suggesting that the hypermethylated sites decrease somewhat more than the hypomethylated sites increase. Interestingly, however, hypomethylated sites that gained methylation were enriched in more pathways, including some with relevance to aging. The data suggest that these sites are more conserved and may underlie the features of aging associated with genetic programs, whereas the highly methylated sites that lost methylation with age may be associated with the more stochastic processes.</p><p>After normalization for the average entropy effect, we observed that many sites fully resisted changes (61.9%), defining the extremes in methylation levels. Some sites changed slower than the entropy changes (4.6%), other sites followed the average entropy effect (12%), but some changed even faster than the average entropy (3%). There were also few sites that changed in the direction opposite to entropy changes (1.6%). A recent study of human aging found that the majority of DNA methylation changes were associated with epigenetic drift and accumulating damage, supporting the disposable soma theory of aging, whereas targeted changes in methylation also exist, as predicted by the mutation accumulation theory, and may mediate the effects of aging&#8208;related genes (Robins et&#160;al., <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Our results agree with these findings as the increasing and accelerating entropy, representing damage accumulation, disrupts the global methylation pattern, whereas fewer entropy&#8208;independent targeted changes were observed in mouse and human samples, which may drive aging&#8208;related biological functions. Interestingly, both entropy&#8208;driven and nonentropy&#8208;driven sites contributed similarly to the pathways changed during aging, indicating that the entropy growth of the methylome may have biological consequences. The early developmental program may define global and region&#8208;specific methylation patterns and segregate functionally relevant CpG sites to fully methylated and unmethylated. This pattern may have multiple regulatory effects, with the respective sites contributing to certain biological functions. Other sites may follow entropy increase, which accelerates in late life and disrupt the developmental patterns.</p><p>Overall, we characterized changes in the blood DNA methylome of mice at unprecedented detail, uncovering nonlinear trends in DNA methylation remodeling during aging. Promoters and genes with significant age&#8208;related changes in methylation turned out to be enriched in many known aging&#8208;related pathways, pointing to an important link between DNA methylation and control of the aging process at the molecular level. In addition, analyses of CR revealed differences between the initial and cumulative effects of the intervention on the DNA methylome, the latter being important for lifespan extension. Analysis of DNA methylation allowed us to quantify entropy that both increased and accelerated with age and altered the developmental methylation patterns, even though many CpG sites resisted these changes. Finally, sites with low methylation levels were more conserved, and associated with biological functions relevant to aging. Taken together, our findings define the biological relevance of DNA methylation to aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0015"><label>4</label><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec id="acel12738-sec-0016"><label>4.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>Mice used in this study were obtained from the NIA Age Rodent Colony.

Methylation fraction was calculated by dividing the number of methylated reads by every read associated with a CpG. Nearly two million CpG sites (1,976,976 sites) were selected, which were present in all samples. We used a soft cutoff to exclude the sites with low coverage. Sites were excluded, which had &lt;10&#215; coverage in more than 50% of samples in any age group and in CR samples. Unlike microarray data, where all CpGs have certain variance, sites detected with RRBS can be either totally methylated or not methylated across all samples or in a group of samples (Sun, Cunningham, Slager, &amp; Kocher, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). To decrease the effect of constant CpGs, we filtered out the sites with smaller standard deviation than the mean of the shortest interval that covers half of the standard deviations (Takeuchi, <xref rid="acel12738-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1973</xref>). We used RnBeads R package to aggregate the measured sites, which belonged to the same CpG, to exclude high coverage outliers and sites that were overlapping with single nucleotide polymorphism. Detailed statistical methods and the genomic databases, used to annotate CpG sites, can be found in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="acel12738-sec-0019"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0001"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0002"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0003"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0004"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0005"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0006"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0007"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-0008"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="acel12738-sup-009"><caption><p>&#160;</p></caption><media xlink:href="ACEL-17-e12738-s009.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="acel12738-sec-0018"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank NIA (Age Rodent Colony) for providing the mice.
