Two Norwegian strains with different susceptibility towards DMT were crossed in the parental generation (P0), females from a sensitive strain were crossed with males from a resistant strain and vice versa. Individual susceptibility towards DMT was assessed in the second filial generation (F2). DMT resistance was only found in F2 descendants when the P0 females were from the resistant strain, pointing to maternal inheritance. Since maternal inheritance might be linked to the mitochondrial (mt) genome, the nucleotide sequences and the gene expressions of mt-genes were analysed. Twenty non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in mt-transcripts from resistant F2 parasites, including SNPs in two cytochrome C oxidase subunits (<italic>COX1</italic> and <italic>COX3</italic>) and two subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (<italic>ND1</italic> and <italic>ND5</italic>) previously linked to DMT resistance in the salmon louse. Differential expression analysis between the sensitive and resistant strain revealed strain effect in seven out of twelve mt-genes. The current study also show that DNA fragmentation (indicating apoptosis) was affected by DMT exposure in skeletal muscle tissue and that resistant parasites undergo less apoptosis than sensitive parasites.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The use of pesticides is important to combat arthropod pests and parasites on terrestrial animals and crops (insects and arachnids), and in the aquaculture industry (crustacean parasites). The same pesticides are also used to reduce the number of vectors for human diseases, such as mosquito species that carry malaria parasites, zika virus and dengue virus. One of the most commonly used classes of pesticides are the pyrethroids, which includes deltamethrin (DMT). Sea lice (Caligidae) are crustacean ectoparasites on marine fish that can have serious consequences for farmed fish. The caligid copepod <italic>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</italic> (the salmon louse) is a major problem in salmonid fish farming in Norway and other countries lining the North Atlantic Ocean, such as Scotland, Ireland, the Faroe Islands and Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although non-pharmaceutical measures are commonly taken, chemical treatments are still necessary to keep lice-counts under regulatory limits (0.5 adult females per fish in Norway). Resistance towards the compounds is widespread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In Chile, the caligid copepod <italic>Caligus rogercresseyi</italic> constitute a similar problem in the salmonid marine aquaculture as <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> does on the Northern hemisphere and the same pesticides are used in the combat against them.</p><p id="Par3">Generally, it is believed that pyrethroids bind to the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) in nerves and causes a prolonged opening of the channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. A continuous excitation results in paralysis and ultimately death of the organism. In insects and arachnids, specific mutations in the gene coding for the VGSC (<italic>Na</italic><sub><italic>V</italic></sub>) protect the animals from pyrethroid toxicity e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The mode of action in crustaceans is assumed similar to other arthropod groups, although poorly investigated.

An overrepresentation of a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <italic>Na</italic><sub><italic>V</italic></sub>, in a pyrethroid resistant <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> population has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> but could not be found in resistant individuals from a different population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Maternal inheritance of resistance in arthropods is rare, previously only described in the two-spotted spider mite (<italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>) against bifenazate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and its cross-resistance to acequinocyl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, two studies suggest that DMT resistance in the salmon louse is maternally inherited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In both crossing studies, only resistant females, and not resistant males, produced resistant offspring. Furthermore, both studies identified SNPs between DMT-susceptible and DMT-tolerant parasites in the mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA). Although natural occurring polymorphisms are expected, especially in the mt-genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, the distinct differences between susceptible and resistant lice from both Scotland and Norway suggest that these SNPs are related to DMT susceptibility. The genes encoded in the mt-DNA are coding for proteins involved in the electron transport chain (ETC), which is the main source for ATP production in the cells. How changes in the ETC complexes may compensate for DMT exposure is not clear. However, the ATP levels have been described to be higher in resistant lice compared to susceptible lice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, further implying that alterations in the ETC are in some way involved in the protection from detrimental DMT toxicity.</p><p id="Par5">Deltamethrin has been demonstrated to induce controlled cell death, apoptosis, in murine thymocytes and human neuroblastoma cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Apoptosis can be induced by low levels of ATP that lead to disruption of the mitochondria membrane potential between the intermembrane space and the cytosol, resulting in leakage of cytochrome C (cytC) into the cytosol. Further downstream effects are caspase3 activation and ultimately DNA fragmentation.</p><p id="Par6">The main aim of this study was to identify differences in the mt-DNA between resistant and susceptible lice (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic>), both in terms of SNPs and expression levels. A fully susceptible strain and a pyrethroid resistant strain, both originating from Norwegian fish farms, were used in this pursuit, in addition to the second filial generation (F2) after crossing them. An additional aim was to investigate whether a link between DMT exposure and apoptosis could be established, and to see if resistant and susceptible lice respond differently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Crossing experiment and bioassays</title><p id="Par7">Two Norwegian strains with different susceptibility towards DMT were batch crossed in the parental generation (P0); Females from a sensitive strain (Ls A) were crossed with males from a resistant strain (Ls V) and vice versa, giving rise to family groups 1 and 2, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was done with ten females and ten males randomly mating in each family group.

In family group 2, where the P0 females were from the resistant Ls V strain, none of the females were immobilized, whereas a low fraction of the males were immobilized (9% and 17% for preadults and adults, respectively) at the lowest concentration (0.2&#8201;&#181;g DMT/L). At the highest concentration (1&#8201;&#181;g DMT/L), there was partial but not complete immobilization of the parasites from family group 2; 28% of the females and 15% of the males were characterized as resistant as described above.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Crossing experiment with one fully sensitive <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> strain (Ls A, light blue) and one DMT-tolerant strain (Ls V, light brown), evaluated on population level (circles&#8201;=&#8201;females, squares&#8201;=&#8201;males).

However, two of the P0 samples (LsAP0_3 and LsVP0_7) clustered together with the opposite group, indicating that these two samples were outliers. This was supported by their individual non-synonymous SNP profile as explained above, as LsAP0_3 carried all SNPs defining the resistant type (Ls V) and LsVP0_7 carried the wildtypes, as the rest of the Ls A parasites. The presence of a SNP associated with resistance to another compound could distinguish a louse from a fully sensitive strain, such as Ls A, from a louse from a multi-resistant strain, such as Ls V.

Two other samples from the Ls V P0 group (LsVP0_2 and LsVP0_5) clustered between the Ls A and Ls V.

A female heterozygous system (ZW/ZZ) has been suggested in the salmon louse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, but a genetic marker for resistance on the female W chromosome would exclude resistance development in males. From this study, as well as previously published bioassay results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, it is evident that males also carry resistance. Thus, maternal inheritance due to alterations on a unique female sex chromosome is less likely. However, the maternal transfer of RNA or protein to the eggs, in which both female and male offspring would receive the maternal effect, cannot be ruled out. Also, resistance transferred by symbiont bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> are less likely to be the mediator of maternal inheritance, since DMT resistance appears to be upheld even when the fish, on which the salmon lice feed, are treated with the broad spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin (personal observation).</p><p id="Par27">The involvement of the mitochondria genes in DMT resistance in the salmon louse has previously been suggested for Norwegian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and Scottish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> populations. In terrestrial arthropods such as insects and mites, resistance mechanisms vary in sub-populations of the same species thus resistance strategies cannot be compared (see reviews on e.g. mites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, bed bugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and mosquitos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). The North-Atlantic population of salmon lice is genetically very homogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as larvae can be dispersed over a large distance before infecting new fish. In addition, wild salmon from all countries lining the North Atlantic feed on the same feeding grounds north of the Faroe Islands and west of Greenland. Homogeneity has also been demonstrated for the resistance towards the organophosphate azamethiphos, another substance used against sea lice, which is caused by a single mutation in the acetylcholine esterase gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The mutation is widely dispersed in the North Atlantic population of salmon lice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Among the 175 SNPs identified in the F2 lice, 20 were non-synonymous (listed in Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The bulk of amino acid changes were found in various subunits in the ETC complex I, namely ND1-ND6. In addition, one non-synonymous SNP was located in <italic>ATP6</italic>, and for genes encoding proteins in complex IV, one SNP was located in <italic>COX3</italic> and one in <italic>COX1</italic>, the latter also reported by Nilsen and Espedal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (<italic>T8605C</italic>). Since the mt-genome in general has a high degree of polymorphism, it is unlikely that all these 20 non-synonymous SNPs are involved in DMT-resistance. A study published after the first submission of the current manuscript described differences in the mitochondrial encoded gene sequences between sensitive and resistant <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> from Scotland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The study was based on progenies from crossing of sensitive and resistant strains, and maternal inheritance was strongly suggested. Four non-synonymous SNPs were identified as unique for resistant parasites from Scotland, identical to SNPs described to cause amino acid substitutions in ND1 (Gly251Ser), ND5 (Leu411Ser), COX1 (Leu107Ser) and COX3 (Gly33Glu) in the current study. As the North-Atlantic population of salmon lice is genetically very homogeneous, the identification of the same resistance-related SNPs in geographically separated strains (from Norway and Scotland) strengthens the assumption that one or more of them are involved in the resistance mechanism, although corroboration from analysis of other strains are needed. Additional SNP analysis of parasites from the P0-generation point in the same direction of an association between the mt-genotype and DMT susceptibility. All individuals from the sensitive Ls A strain shared the same genotype based on the non-synonymous SNPs described in Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. Furthermore, the parasites from the Ls V strain included both parasites carrying all non-synonymous SNPs and two parasites carrying only six of them(LsVP0_2 and LsVP0_5). Since the Ls V strain was an unselected population of mainly resistant but also susceptible parasites, where the DMT-susceptibility had been determined only on a population level, variation in genotype could be expected. Nevertheless, all F2-parasites that were unaffected by the high DMT concentration (1&#8201;&#181;g DMT/L for 24&#8201;hours) and analysed by RNAseq, carried all non-synonymous SNPs. This was further supported by the analysis of the <italic>COX1 T8605C</italic> SNP in additional samples from the F2 generation. In family group 1, all males and females shared the wild type allele. In family group 2, all parasites characterised phenotypically as resistance were carrying the SNP, whereas phenotypically sensitive lice all carried the wild type allele. Although the evidence for direct involvement of <italic>COX1</italic> in the DMT resistance is still lacking, the presence of <italic>8605C</italic> in <italic>COX1</italic> indicates that the lice carry a genotype similar to resistant lice whereas the presence of the wildtype <italic>T8605</italic> indicates a genotype similar to sensitive lice. Taken together with the Scottish data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, this strongly suggests the involvement of one or more of the Gly251Ser, Leu411Ser, Leu107Ser and Gly33Glu in ND1, ND5, COX1 and COX3, respectively, in the resistance mechanism in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic>.

Therefore, <italic>in silico</italic> docking of DMT to complex I and IV was attempted after 3D modelling of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> mitochondria proteins. Unfortunately, the docking was not conclusive for either complexes. However, one striking observation from the 3D modelling was that the positions of the changed amino acids in COX1 and COX3 (Leu107Ser and Gly33Glu, respectively), were located close to each other with a distance of approximately 9&#8201;&#197;. They are both located on the surface of the protein structure, making them available targets for binding with pyrethroids. If or how the amino acid substitutions observed in resistant parasites could alter the binding properties, if such a binding occurs, is not known. In Complex I, only a few of the amino acid substitutions in ND1-6 were located in the transmembrane domains where DMT binding could be expected. However, they can still have a functional effect on the efficiency of electron transfer or proton translocation and ultimately a change in ATP production.</p><p id="Par31">Increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism after pyrethroid exposure, including the <italic>ATP synthase</italic>, has been described in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Sensitive male lice were shown to have decreased whole body ATP after DMT exposure (0.2&#8201;&#181;g/L for 30&#8201;minutes), whereas resistant males upheld the ATP levels after a much higher dose of DMT (2&#8201;&#181;g/L for 30&#8201;minutes).</p><p id="Par32">Low levels of ATP are known to disrupt the mitochondria membrane potential between the intermembrane space and the cytosol, resulting in leakage of cytochrome C (cytC) into the cytosol which further activates downstream effects such as caspase3 activation and ultimately DNA fragmentation. This is the pathway of controlled cell death, also known as apoptosis. It has previously been shown that DMT can induce apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, supporting the findings from the present study. Varying levels of apoptosis were detected in the different tissues, which implies that the levels of apoptosis were correlated to the concentration of DMT in the particular tissue. However, the DMT-distribution to the tissues was not studied. Protection by p-glycoprotein efflux pumps (P-gps) could contribute to the differences observed. Carmona-Anto&#241;anzas <italic>et al</italic>. found 33 genes/transcripts for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, from which 18 could be assigned to ABC subfamilies known to contain drug transporters, in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic>. Differences in P-gp expression pattern in different strains could also influence the distribution of DMT.</p><p id="Par33">From the apoptotic score derived from the TUNEL stained sections in the first experiment, it is obvious that the experimental handling induced apoptosis in subcuticular layers and in the skeletal muscle in non-exposed and DMT-exposed parasites. It is likely that this observed DNA fragmentation was partially induced by stress as the lice were checked every hour during the post-exposure recovery period. Poley <italic>et al</italic>. showed that cypermethrin induced differential expression in proteins related to the stress signalling pathways of <italic>target of rapamycin</italic> (<italic>TOR</italic>) and <italic>forkhead box protein</italic> (<italic>FOXO</italic>) in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

It is therefore likely that strains with different sensitivity towards DMT display different responses to stress. To control for the possible bias from handling stress, the level of apoptosis was assessed on TUNEL stained sections from additionally sensitive (Ls A) and resistant (Ls B) lice after DMT or vehicle exposure (experiment 2). When looking at all parasites, stress-induced apoptosis was plausible, as the fraction of non-exposed parasites with apoptosis was decreased from experiment 1 (stressed parasites) to experiment 2 (non-stressed parasites). There were however variations, as evident from Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Apoptosis could not be detected in the central ganglion in any groups in experiment 1. In experiment 2 however, the median score increased from 1 to 4 in the sensitive strain whereas the resistant strain remained without displaying apoptosis. The discrepancy between the two sensitive strains could be assigned to differences in DMT distribution based on strain characteristics, allowing DMT to reach the central ganglion in one strain and not the other. The lack of apoptosis in experiment 1 excluded apoptosis in the central ganglion as the main mechanism for DMT toxicity in sea lice although DMT clearly could induced apoptosis, as seen in Ls A in experiment 2.</p><p id="Par34">When the median apoptosis scores in non-DMT exposed and DMT-exposed parasites were compared, an increase was observed in subcuticular layer and muscle in both experiments for the sensitive strains (Ls G and Ls A) and also for the resistant strain in experiment 1. For the resistant strain in experiment 2, the median score was equal (muscle) or lower (subcuticular layer) in exposed group versus non-exposed group. After exposure, high levels of DMT would be expected in tissues close to the cuticle, as described by Sevatdal <italic>et al</italic>. who found high levels of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled DMT in subcuticular tissues and around the appendices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The high level of DMT-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle indicates that this tissue is a major target for DMT.</p><p id="Par35">Judging from ours and others micrographs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and the fact that other crustaceans have multinucleated muscle fibres powering their legs during swimming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is likely that the muscle cells in the salmon lice are multinucleated. Whether individual nuclei in syncytia can undergo apoptosis and selectively eliminate nuclei from the cell is a controversial issue. <italic>In vitro</italic>, apoptotic nuclei have been observed adjacent to normal nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, nevertheless it is unclear whether the cells were in the process of dying or survived the apoptotic incidents. In mammals, apoptosis within the intact syncytium is either rare or does not occur at all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. One apoptotic nucleus may affect muscle function, most likely sometime after exposure to DMT. If several nuclei inside one single cell is affected, the cell might die, resulting in reduced muscle strength. From the TUNEL stained sections, it was difficult to assess if the nuclei within the muscle tissue were in fact myonuclei or if they could belong to another group of cells, e.g. nerves which are numerous around muscles. Nevertheless, reduced muscle strength after DMT exposure is supported by the personal observation that chalimus stages of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>salmonis</italic> cannot molt after treatment with DMT although they stay alive for several days. Molting is a process that requires muscular strength of the parasite. Furthermore, DMT-induced effects on muscle activity such as swimming behaviour have been widely described in many species. Swimming velocity was impaired in shrimps exposed to DMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and the equilibrium, coordination and general swimming behaviour of fish larvae and fry were severely affected following exposure to DMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The salmon louse is an ecto-parasite that is stationary on its host. Therefore, a similar effect to altered swimming behaviour would be detachment from the host, which is a profound effect of DMT exposure. These effects could be expected both after neurotoxic effects, i.e. DMT affect sodium currents in nerves, or muscle weakness following mitochondria-induced apoptosis.</p><p id="Par36">Type II pyrethroids, which include DMT, induce a rapid paralysis (within 60&#8201;minutes) of exposed insects, known as the knock-down effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in a controlled treatment test using DMT in therapeutic concentrations on salmon infected with salmon lice, the time at which the probability of 50% detachment of DMT-sensitive parasites was considerably longer, 16.8 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to the effect of another neurotoxic compound, azamethiphos, where the corresponding time for azamethiphos-sensitive parasites was 16&#8201;minutes. The longer detachment time following DMT-exposure demonstrates that the DMT treatment does not have an immediate knock-down effect on susceptible parasites as seen in other arthropods. Consequently, the effect on signal conduction in nerve cells may not be the primary effect of DMT in salmon lice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Results from the current study supports that resistance towards DMT is maternally inherited in the salmon louse. 175 SNPs, of which 20 were non-synonymous and linked to individuals with high tolerance for DMT, were identified. Four of these non-synonymous SNPs have been described on lice geographically separated from the ones included in this study, emphasizing their relevance to DMT resistance. The position of the amino acid changes indicated an involvement in the electron transfer or proton pumping through the respiratory chain in the mitochondria. Finally, DMT induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle tissue, a response that was affected by strain sensitivity towards DMT and directly by DMT exposure, indicating that skeletal muscles are major target tissues for DMT in salmon lice. The results from this study not only provide further insight into the resistance mechanism against DMT in the salmon louse, but also indicates that DMT may have a previously undescribed mode of action that involves binding of DMT (or metabolites) to enzymes in the respiratory chain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par38">All use of fish for salmon lice cultivation was approved by the Norwegian Food Authorities according to the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act (LovData; LOV-2009-06-19-97) and Regulations for the Use of Research Animals (LovData; FOR-2015-06-18-761).</p><p id="Par39">The lice strains used in this study were all laboratory strains reared at either the research facilities of Solbergstrand (The Norwegian Institute for Water Research, NIVA, Dr&#248;bak, Norway) for Ls A and Ls V or at the University of Bergen (Bergen, Norway) for Ls G and Ls B, according to the cultivation protocol by Hamre <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

The presence or absence of non-synonymous SNPs was used to define a genotype representing DMT sensitive parasites (genotype S) and a genotype representing DMT resistant parasites (genotype R).

The lice were exposed to 2&#8201;&#181;g DMT/L or water (0&#8201;&#181;g DMT/L) for 30&#8201;minutes whereupon the water was poured out through a mesh and replaced by fresh sea water. Lice that fell onto the mesh were checked for viability and put back into the glass bottle if they could move. No lice were considered dead or immobilized at this point from either strain. The water containing lice was aerated throughout the exposure period and the consecutive 23.5&#8201;hours. Four hours after exposure, an hourly inspection of the lice were induced to check for dead lice.

Lice that were stuck to the glass bottles were considered to be unaffected by the exposure. Lice that were collected in the mesh were checked individually for viability. They were characterized as moribund if they were unable to move in sea water and unaffected if they attached to the wall of the test box or could swim in a straight line. Following characterization, the lice were put in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and fixated for 24&#8211;48&#8201;hours. Fixated samples were subjected to an automatic paraffin infiltration and subsequently embedded in paraffin wax.

In the last washing step after the labelling of DNA strand breaks (the TUNEL stain), the nucleus stain Hoechst (Hoechst 33342, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (5&#8201;&#181;g/ml) and allowed to work for 15&#8201;minutes. An antifade mounting media (SlowFade&#174; Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI, Invitrogen<sup>TM</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the slides before the sections were covered with a cover slip and sealed with nail polish. The slides were investigated under a fluorescent microscope with excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/615&#8201;nm and 350/461&#8201;nm for TUNEL and Hoechst, respectively. Three areas of interest in the cephalothorax segment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) were chosen for further analysis; (1) the central ganglion (CG); was chosen based on the high content of nerve cells which is thought to be the primary affected tissue by DMT, (2) the subcuticular layer (SL); was chosen due to its close proximity to the entrance surface for DMT into the parasite, and finally (3) skeletal muscle tissue (M); was chosen due to the high content of mitochondria and the immobilizing effect of DMT. An apoptotic score (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) was made for the subcuticular layer and skeletal muscle tissue, to differentiate between low and high levels of apoptosis. In one end of the scale, the score 0 indicated no apoptosis whereas the score 4 on the opposite end of the scale was assigned to the sections with the highest levels of apoptosis. Scoring of the different tissues was done blind. Frequency of the different apoptotic scores and the interaction of dose and strain was subjected to ordinal logistic regression analysis on SL, M and CG separately, with dose and strain as model effects. The combined effect (strain&#8201;*&#8201;dose) was also included in the model. p-values were estimated with effect likelihood ratio test (chi square) with &#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.05 when the overall model test was statistically significant (&#945;&#8201;=&#8201;0.05).
