Currently, there are no approved treatments and very few therapeutic targets are under investigation. Here, we combined 4 high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, 7 days and 8 weeks following clinically-relevant rat SCI to identify proteins with persistent differential expression post-injury. Out of thousands of differentially regulated entities our combined analysis identified 40 significantly upregulated versus 48 significantly downregulated molecules, which were persistently altered at the mRNA and protein level, 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. Bioinformatics analysis was then utilized to identify currently available drugs with activity against the filtered molecules and to isolate proteins with known or unknown function in SCI. Our findings revealed multiple overlooked therapeutic candidates with important bioactivity and established druggability but with unknown expression and function in SCI including the upregulated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), cathepsins A, H, Z (CTSA, CTSH, CTSZ) and proteasome protease PSMB10, as well as the downregulated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), malic enzyme (ME1) and sodium-potassium ATPase (ATP1A3), amongst others. This work reveals previously unappreciated therapeutic candidates for SCI and available drugs, thus providing a valuable resource for further studies and potential repurposing of existing therapeutics for SCI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijms-19-01461"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Severe injury to the mammalian spinal cord causes irreversible tissue damage and in most cases, results in permanent loss of sensorimotor function below the affected site. At the molecular level SCI is characterized by neuronal death and loss of axons, aggressive inflammation, maladaptive tissue remodelling, excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix and scarring [<xref rid="B1-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These events cause permanent pathological changes at the injury site and prevent neuronal regeneration and axonal growth. With the exception of reducing acute inflammation using corticosteroids, a therapeutic approach which remains controversial [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], followed by chronic rehabilitation physiotherapy, there are no approved therapies for SCI and to date, no drugs can reverse tissue damage or facilitate regrowth of surviving axons through the lesion site. There are few experimental therapies currently under investigation, including antibodies against highly neurotoxic myelin debris proteins (i.e., anti-Nogo antibodies [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), stabilization of axonal microtubules using paclitaxel/taxol and epothilone B to facilitate the regrowth of damaged axons [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that digests the growth inhibitory glycosaminoglycan moieties in proteoglycans, which accumulate abundantly in the fibrotic scar that develops after severe SCI and prevent neuronal growth through the injury site [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The complexity of the spinal tissue and the very severe inflammatory, fibrotic and neurodegenerative pathology together with the fact that the SCI patient population is relatively small in comparison to other neurological disorders, make the process of drug discovery difficult.</p><p>One possible approach to facilitate the discovery of novel pathological mechanisms and therapeutic targets is to utilize high-throughput -omics such as transcriptomics and proteomics. Contemporary high-throughput methods allow the interrogation of thousands of differentially regulated transcripts or proteins in multiple biological replicates in single quantitative experiments [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When combined with rigorous computational analysis of the large data that they return, &#8211;omics experiments can provide systems-wide insight into the pathological changes taking place in disease and allow the screening of multi-molecular changes instead of limited focusing towards single genes or proteins.</p><p>In this article, we sought to identify previously unappreciated and potentially promising therapeutic candidates for SCI by combining high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics to profile gene and protein expression changes following clinically-relevant models of rat SCI. To ensure careful filtering of potential therapeutic candidates, we only retrieved molecules that were significantly regulated at the mRNA and protein level in tandem and showed consistent differential expression at 7 days (subacute) and 8 weeks (chronic) post-injury. We subsequently isolated druggable proteins and mined their potential function in SCI. This work could provide the basis for future mechanistic and preclinical studies investigating bioactive molecules with disease-modifying potential in SCI. Importantly, all transcriptomics and proteomics data, as well as the source code for the computational analysis that we developed, are available and freely accessible online via the <italic>Mendeley Data</italic> repository (Elsevier; <uri xlink:href="https://data.mendeley.com">https://data.mendeley.com</uri>) and our analysis is based on highly-cited freely accessible bioinformatics tools.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-19-01461"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-19-01461"><title>2.1. Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis 7 Days and 8 Weeks after Rat SCI</title><p>SCI is a complex disorder which involves multiple different cell types and tissue substrates (neurons and axons, microglia and infiltrating immune cells, astrocytes, vascular cells, meningeal cells and others). It is also affected by the immune privilege of the central nervous system and the vascular limitations of the blood-brain-barrier. Multiparametric high-throughput approaches that examine large-scale transcript and protein changes in tandem can offer a broad understanding of molecular changes in SCI. To this end, we combined high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics and at two different time-points (7 days and 8 weeks) after SCI to capture consistent and persistent molecular changes post-SCI and to identify proteins with important bioactivity and drug-targeting potential.</p><p>First, we performed an intersection of differentially regulated genes identified in a publicly available rat SCI microarray performed recently by Chamankhah and colleagues [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], to identify molecules that were significantly up or downregulated at the mRNA level, both at 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. Injury was performed by clip-compression using a 35 g aneurysm clip for 60 s, producing moderate to severe SCI [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We chose to use this transcriptomics study because it was performed by an experienced group, it had identical time-points to our proteomics analysis (see below) and importantly, compression SCI shares pathological similarities to contusion injury. This transcriptomics analysis compared uninjured (control) T7 spinal cord segments (<italic>n</italic> = 4) versus injured spinal cord, either at 7 days (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or 8 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 4) post-injury. All microarray data was made freely accessible online from the authors [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] via the gene expression omnibus (GEO-NCBI: <uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45006">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE45006</uri>). Moreover, all differentially regulated transcripts from 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI were downloaded from GEO-NCBI and have been publicly deposited as easily accessible excel files in Mendeley Data: control versus 7 days post-SCI microarray: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/XqbbgN">https://goo.gl/XqbbgN</uri>; control versus 8 weeks post-SCI microarray: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/BXYEeT">https://goo.gl/BXYEeT</uri>. Only genes that had adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#8804; 0.05 were accepted in the analysis. 902 were significantly upregulated at both 7 days and 8 weeks versus 835 genes significantly downregulated at both time-points.</p><p>Second, to expand the transcriptomics findings to protein expression post-SCI, we used high-throughput proteomics datasets obtained from spinal tissue LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) performed in our lab. High-throughput analysis at the protein level is biologically important given that transcripts tend to be short-lived in comparison to proteins and mRNA expression does not necessarily reflect protein expression or accumulation at tissue sites, especially given the substantial tissue remodelling that takes place in injured tissues.</p><p>To improve the relative enrichment of different protein species and the depth of protein identifications, we used a solubility-based tissue protein subfractionation method previously developed by us, which allows separate analysis of cellular and extracellular proteins by LC-MS/MS and is based on using 0.08% SDS to isolate cellular proteins followed by 4 M guanidine for extracellular matrix and insoluble proteins [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Control (uninjured) versus injured rat spinal cord proteomics comparisons were made again at 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI, matching the transcriptomics data. Relative estimation of protein abundance in tissue samples by LC-MS/MS was performed using spectral counting [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This comparison returned 115 proteins that were significantly upregulated and 149 proteins that were significantly downregulated in tandem, at both 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. All protein identification datasets, differentially regulated proteins and statistically analysed spectral counts from 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI are publicly deposited as easily accessible excel files in Mendeley Data: 7 days proteomics: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/k93LwN">https://goo.gl/k93LwN</uri>; 8 weeks proteomics: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/qYoTJz">https://goo.gl/qYoTJz</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-19-01461"><title>2.2. Integration of Transcriptomics and Proteomics Datasets to Identify Persistently Differentially Regulated Molecules</title><p>To filter entities with consistent and persistent differential regulation at the mRNA and protein level and at 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI, we integrated the transcriptomics and proteomics datasets described above. To ensure stringent selection, we accepted only molecules that were significantly differentially regulated (control vs. injured; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05) in all 4 high-throughput datasets (transcriptomics and proteomics, 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI). This combined analysis returned a filtered signature of only 40 upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a&#8211;c) and 48 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>d&#8211;f) molecules, at the transcript and protein level and both at 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. These consistent signatures are summarised as heatmaps, which display differential expression from shotgun proteomics (upregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a and downregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) as well as protein-protein interaction networks, which highlight the interconnectivity of the differentially regulated proteins (upregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>b and downregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>e). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>c,f depict 10 upregulated and downregulated proteins respectively, with the highest network betweenness centrality, a measure of how associated and central a protein is in comparison to other network proteins and offers an unbiased assessment of its relative biological importance [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conceivably, proteins with high betweenness centrality and therefore extensive biological association with other proteins, might be considered as good drug targets given that they likely have an important function in the system either in isolation or as part of a functional pathway.</p><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-ijms-19-01461"><title>2.2.1. 40 Persistently Upregulated Proteins</title><p>The network of the 40 upregulated entities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b) contains multiple proteins involved in extracellular matrix metabolism, including minor glycoproteins galectin 3 (LGALS3), lumican (LUM) and decorin (DCN) together with annexin A2 (ANXA2) and both alpha chains of collagen-1 (COL1A1 and COL1A2). The upregulated network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b) also contains cytoskeletal proteins such as LIMA1 (actin-binding), CALD1 (actin-binding caldesmon), AIF1 (microglia/macrophage cytoskeletal protein commonly known as IBA1), LCP1 (plastin-2, T cell actin-binding protein), filamin A (FLNA) and vimentin (VIM) an abundant non-epithelial cytoskeletal protein with key collagen-1 mRNA-stabilising function.</p><p>Consistently upregulated proteins also include 5 cathepsins (lysosomal proteases); A (CTSA), B (CTSB), D (CTSD), H (CTSH) and Z (CTSZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b) covering a large spectrum of cellular and extracellular proteolytic substrates. Cathepsin upregulation, proteolytic activity and lysosomal involvement are often associated with inflammatory tissue remodelling and loss of normal tissue function as well as activation of cell death pathways. Cathepsins are typically associated with activated macrophages and other immune cells [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The multicatalytic proteasome proteinase PSMB10 and dipeptidase PEPD, the latter with an important function in collagen-1 metabolism, are also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b). VIM, CTSD and ANX A2 have high betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>c), followed by FLNA and COL1A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>c), indicating relative biological importance in the system. The persistent upregulation of these proteins highlights the dominance of inflammation and scarring after SCI, driving pathological matrix remodelling and extensive proteolysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-ijms-19-01461"><title>2.2.2. 48 Persistently Downregulated Proteins</title><p>Unsurprisingly, the network of the 48 persistently downregulated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>d,e) contains multiple neuronal proteins with direct involvement in synaptic transmission including CPLX1 (complexin-1) and STX1B (syntaxin-1B) involved in synaptic vesicle function, ABAT (mitochondrial aminobutyrate aminotransferase) and ALDH5A1 (mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase), both involved in the degradation of the neurotransmitter GABA, CPNE6 (copine-6; dendrite formation), HPCA (neuron-specific calcium-binding hippocalcin; regulates calcium channels), ME1 (malic enzyme) and AMPH (amphiphysin; involved in synaptic exocytosis). The persistent downregulation of synaptic-associated proteins is likely the result of neurodegeneration following SCI.</p><p>The downregulated network also contains 7 proteins involved in cholesterol and lipid synthesis and metabolism including MVD and MVK (mevalonate decarboxylase and kinase respectively), FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate/pyrophosphate kinase), HMGCS1 (catalyses synthesis of mevalonate from acetyl-CoA), ACSS2 (acetyl-CoA synthetase), ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) involved in acetyl-CoA metabolism) and SEC14L2 (supernatant protein factor). The central nervous system-specific heat-shock protein 70, 12A (HSPA12A) has the highest betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>f) reflecting the role of chaperone heat-shock proteins in multiple biological functions. Neuron-specific gamma-enolase (ENO2 or NSE) with a catalytic role in the synthesis of pyruvate and CALB2 (calretinin; a neuron-specific calcium-binding protein) follow HSPA12A in betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f001">Figure 1</xref>f). The consistent downregulation of proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism is very interesting and such mechanisms in SCI are not well understood. One likely hypothesis is their involvement in myelin synthesis [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and as such, their restoration might promote myelination after SCI. In contrast, downregulation of cholesterol synthesis has been associated with the highly effective regenerative capacity that is observed in peripheral nerves [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-19-01461"><title>2.3. Identification of Druggable Proteins in SCI</title><p>To examine further the tight list of 40 upregulated and 48 downregulated molecules, we first looked for proteins that could be targeted using currently available, clinically-approved or experimental drugs/bioactive chemicals and second, we asked whether these druggable proteins have been cited in studies related to SCI. Druggable proteins were predicted using DGIdb v3 [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and further validated with StitchDB v5 [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The relevance of druggable proteins to SCI was then examined using an automated PubMed text-mining tool that we developed for this study (source code deposited online: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/vRScJ3">https://goo.gl/vRScJ3</uri>). Druggable proteins were searched in PubMed in conjunction to the terms &#8220;spinal cord injury&#8221; and &#8220;spinal injury&#8221; as well as with the words &#8220;trauma,&#8221; &#8220;contusion&#8221; or &#8220;transection&#8221; replacing &#8220;injury&#8221; in the query.</p><p>DGIdb and StitchDB identified 15 upregulated druggable proteins, 10 of which returned at least one citation in SCI and 19 downregulated druggable proteins, 7 with at least one citation in SCI.

Discussion</title><p>In this manuscript combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and bioinformatics provides a comprehensive overview of proteins with persistent differential expression at the mRNA and protein level and from the subacute (7 days) to the chronic (8 weeks) phase of SCI lesion development. To ensure stringent filtering, we accepted only molecules that were significantly differentially regulated in all high-throughput datasets (transcriptomics and proteomics, 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI). The intersection of transcriptomics and proteomics is useful given that while mRNA screening provides a snapshot of the dynamic gene expression changes following SCI, proteomics confirms functional expression of proteins from regulated transcripts and underscores proteotypic changes in the injured spinal cord. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically analyse the molecular druggability of SCI in high-throughput.</p><p>The intersection of transcriptomics and proteomics at 2 different injury time-points and from 2 independent labs using comparable contusion and compression SCI models in female rats, ensures unbiased validation of the high-throughput data and offers confidence in the filtering of these molecular targets. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the transcriptomics and proteomics data were based on two different SCI models as well as rat strains. More specifically, the transcriptomics analysis by Chamankhah et al. was based on a T7 aneurysm clip (35 g) compression injury (moderate to severe) in female Wistar rats [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while our proteomics analysis was based on automated 150 kilo-dyne (1.5 Newton) spinal contusion injuries (moderate), performed on female Sprague-Dawley rats (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijms-19-01461">Section 4</xref> for more details and [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). It is important to note that different injury models might cause variable tissue pathology and sensorimotor outcomes. Differences and similarities between contusive and compressive injuries have not been studied in detail but both models are considered comparable, as they rely on blunt trauma to the spinal cord and normally involve neither penetration of the meninges, nor sharp severing of axons (as occurs in hemisections and full transections). As a result, they better simulate the biomechanical damage observed in the majority of human injuries (reviewed and summarized in [<xref rid="B57-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Few studies have directly compared contusions with compressions. Pinzon et al., showed that gross lesion pathological features did not appear to differ greatly between contusion and compression injuries [<xref rid="B61-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. More recently, Geremia and colleagues concluded that lesion volumes and gross tissue pathology were not significantly different between contusion (severe T12, 200 kilo-dyne) and clip-compression (moderate to severe T12, 35 g aneurysm clip), albeit clearly increased hematoma formation and spreading in the severe contusion group [<xref rid="B62-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Differences in contusion/compression forces applied in different studies are clearly important in terms of defining injury severity. Comparison between strains has revealed differences in a number of studies not only between strains but even in same strains obtained from different vendors [<xref rid="B63-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. 20 years ago Popovich and colleagues focused on differences in inflammation after SCI. They found that while the basic inflammatory reaction after SCI follows similar patterns in Sprague-Dawley and Lewis rats, differences were observed in the magnitude and duration of macrophage activation and T-cell infiltration in lesions. The authors attributed these differences to strain-specific variations in corticosteroid regulation of inflammation [<xref rid="B64-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Accordingly, using a neuronal-specific gene array, Schmitt et al., showed that the expression of several genes varies between Sprague-Dawley, Long Evans and Lewis rats after contusive SCI [<xref rid="B65-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and in a study focusing on post-SCI sensorimotor function, Mills et al., showed that strain selection significantly affects functional recovery in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats [<xref rid="B57-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, different strains might exhibit pathological or sensorimotor differences. Nevertheless, our focus on proteins that are differentially regulated in both models, both time-points and both at the mRNA and protein level highlights the likely importance of these differentially regulated signatures to SCI.</p><p>Our high-throughput intersection returned 40 persistently upregulated and 48 persistently downregulated proteins. To further narrow down the list of target molecules, we applied two-tier computational protein-protein-drug interaction screening combined with literature text-mining. This analysis isolated previously unappreciated druggable proteins and pharmacological substances that could be examined in future experimental and preclinical SCI studies. Notably, excluding a few proteins that have been studied extensively in SCI (i.e., vimentin, IBA1, decorin, ceruloplasmin, CTSB, CTSD, tubulin beta-3, ENO2/NSE, FGF1, MAP2 and others) many proteins and drugs identified in our comparative analysis have received little to no experimental attention and some might be excellent targets for future investigations.</p><p>While it would be very difficult within the limits of this manuscript to cover in detail the function of each protein and their potential role in SCI, we have made an effort to describe the bioactivity of multiple druggable proteins and put it in the context of SCI where applicable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f002">Figure 2</xref> and associated Results). Given that the majority of drugs are antagonists, inhibitors, or function-blockers, upregulated molecules are excellent primary candidates for drug targeting. In contrast, downregulated entities might be modulated with function agonists or over-expression with more complex molecular tools such as viruses or CrispR/CAS9. </p><p>Based on biological function, druggability and crucially, lack of knowledge with regards to SCI, we could highlight few interesting proteins that are consistently upregulated or downregulated at the mRNA and protein level, at 7 days and 8 weeks individually depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f004">Figure 4</xref>. From the upregulated cohort, PNP (purine nucleoside phosphorylase) is a protein with well-documented involvement in T-cell activity and function and PNP inhibitors exert potent immunomodulatory effects against T-cells, especially in diseases with dominant involvement of adaptive immunity [<xref rid="B32-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].

Thus, given the importance of inflammation in primary and secondary SCI pathology and the importance of T-cells in immune processes, the highly druggable PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f002">Figure 2</xref>c) is a very interesting candidate.</p><p>Similarly, the role of upregulated lysosomal cathepsin A (CTSA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01461-f004">Figure 4</xref>) in SCI is unknown.

It also seems to play an important role in autophagy, which is involved in the regulation of various inflammatory mechanisms including SCI [<xref rid="B69-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Mutations that impair ATP1A3 activity cause rapid-onset dystonia in humans and permanent neurological dysfunction [<xref rid="B71-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The enzyme is also downregulated after neonatal cortical injury in rats [<xref rid="B46-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In summary, by using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and bioinformatics we isolated multiple proteins with drug-targeting potential and unknown function in SCI. While it might be difficult to speculate on the best possible drug target or identify a panacea for SCI, our systematic analysis might stimulate further mechanistic or therapeutic studies in the future. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-19-01461"><title>4.

Rat Transcriptomics&#8212;Microarray Analysis of Rat SCI</title><p>The rat microarray datasets analysed and integrated in this manuscript were recently performed and published by Chamankhah and colleagues. Information about the ethical use of animals in this study and in-depth information about the clinically-relevant compressive SCI model utilised in their study has been published [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, the authors used a clip compression SCI in female Wistar rats using a 35 g aneurysm clip for 60 s producing a moderate to severe T7 SCI. The compression model produces comparable blunt-force gross pathology and lesion characteristics to the contusion model that we used on the thoracic spinal cord (see below). Microarray data is available online via the gene expression omnibus (GEO-NCBI). Microarray data from GEO is qualitatively and statistically curated and MIAME-compliant. Rat T7 spinal clip compression injury microarray <italic>n</italic> = 4 intact versus injured T7 spinal cord samples at 7 days (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and 8 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 4) post-injury.

Additionally, microarray expression data was downloaded and compiled to excel files (.xlsx) to enable uncomplicated examination of differential mRNA expression between control and injured spinal cord specimens at 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI and to allow investigation of individual genes. Due to their excessive size, these excel files have been publicly deposited and are free to download from the Mendeley Data public repository. Control versus 7 days post-SCI microarray comparison can be found here: (7 days SCI microarray: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/XqbbgN">https://goo.gl/XqbbgN</uri>; 8 weeks SCI microarray: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/BXYEeT">https://goo.gl/BXYEeT</uri>).

Spinal Cord Injury Model in Rats for Proteomics Analysis</title><p>We have previously characterised in detail spinal cord contusion in adult rats [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (~200 g) were anesthetised using breathable isofluorane. 5 mg/kg Baytril (antibiotic) and 5 mg/kg Carprofen (NSAID pain and inflammation control) were given subcutaneously at the time of surgery and the morning after surgery. Spinal laminectomies were performed at vertebral level T10, the vertebral column was stabilised using Adson forceps and the rat-specific impactor probe was positioned 2 mm above the spinal cord. An impact force of 150 kilo-dyne (mean 152.3 kilo-dyne; standard deviation 3.2; <italic>n</italic> = 6 contused animals) was delivered to the exposed spinal cord through the intact dura with an Infinite Horizon impactor (Precision Systems Instrumentation) which generates a moderate severity contusion injury according to our Home Office-approved animal licence. This severity mimics more than 50% of human injuries that are &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (i.e., where some white matter tissue is spared) containing uninjured axons and the model is generally considered to be relatively clinically-relevant. After injury, all 6 animals used in the study had full bilateral hind limb paralysis and started exhibiting limited spontaneous recovery typically after the first week. After spinal contusion, the overlying muscle and skin were sutured, anaesthesia was reversed using oxygen and animals recovered in cages placed on heated blankets. Saline and Baytril (antibiotic) were given subcutaneously daily for 7 days, after injury. Bladders were manually expressed twice daily until reflexive emptying returned (typically 6&#8211;9 days after injury). The study has received approval by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (King&#8217;s College London; PPL 70/8032, 14/11/2016) and all surgical procedures were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Surgical Procedures) Act 1996.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-ijms-19-01461"><title>4.3. Shotgun LC-MS/MS Proteomics&#8212;Proteomics Analysis of Rat SCI</title><p>We have recently described in detail and published high-resolution shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis of rat SCI [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Prior to proteomics spinal cord tissue from intact (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or injured T10 spinal cord segments 7 days (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and 8 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 3) post-injury were extracted using a sequential protein extraction protocol previously developed by us [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This approach improves separation of easily soluble cellular proteins (0.08% SDS) followed by isolation of insoluble and cross-linked, extracellular, matrix and matrix-associated extracellular proteins from tissue specimens (4 M guanidine). This method has been published multiple times and is widely used for different tissues including the spinal cord. Following protein extraction shotgun LC-MS/MS was performed as described in depth [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, protein samples were digested by trypsin, tryptic peptides were separated in 2&#8211;35%, 120 min acetonitrile gradient and analysed on Q Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer. Protein identifications were performed using Mascot Version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science). Scaffold [<xref rid="B72-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] (version 4.2.1) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted only if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted only if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 2 unique identified peptides. Scaffold was also used to calculate normalised spectral counts for quantitation. All accepted protein spectra (95% probability plus 2 unique peptides minimum) were included in the analysis and no outliers were removed. Although there are multiple different approaches to achieve relative protein quantitation using LC-MS/MS, spectral counting is very simple and less prone to technical errors in comparison to protein-labelling approaches especially when combined with orthogonal validation of findings [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this manuscript, extra confidence is obtained from the fact that we focus only on proteins that are common across 2 independent transcriptomics and proteomics datasets and across 2 different time-points. Only proteins with <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05 at both 7 days and 8 weeks and concomitant significant differential regulation (<italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05) at the transcript level (from microarrays described above) at both 7 days and 8 weeks were accepted. All proteomics identifications and spectral counting quantitation has been deposited online at Mendeley Data: 7 days proteomics: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/k93LwN">https://goo.gl/k93LwN</uri>; 8 weeks proteomics: <uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/qYoTJz">https://goo.gl/qYoTJz</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-ijms-19-01461"><title>4.4. Computational and Bioinformatics Analysis of High-Throughput Data</title><p>Hierarchical clustering and heat-maps were created in the MeV TM4 platform [<xref rid="B73-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#8804; 0.05; <italic>t</italic>-test) spectral counts were z-normalised (&#8722;3; low to +3; high) to obtain a more linear colour representation of the data. Pairwise similarity in spectral counts between different proteins (rows) was computed using Pearson correlation coefficient. Protein-protein interaction networks were created using StringDB v10 (<uri xlink:href="https://string-db.org">https://string-db.org</uri>) [<xref rid="B74-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] of known and predicted protein-protein interactions and inferring protein associations from multiple databases as well as text-mining. For protein-protein interaction networks, a low threshold of association (0.15) was used to capture the largest possible interaction probability. Network parameters were visualised in CytoScape v2.8 [<xref rid="B75-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which was also used to calculate the betweenness centrality of interacting proteins within networks. Drug candidate analysis was performed using DGIdb (<uri xlink:href="http://www.dgidb.org">http://www.dgidb.org</uri>) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This software is searching multiple different drug databases and uses text-mining to identify drugs matching input proteins. Drug-protein interactions were then validated and filtered using StitchDB v5 (<uri xlink:href="http://stitch.embl.de">http://stitch.embl.de</uri>) [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This step resulted in significant filtering of the drug-protein interaction data. StitchDB also creates organic drug-protein and protein-protein interaction networks, the latter using the StringDB platform and generates interaction scores. For protein-drug interactions, a medium threshold of association (0.40) was used to ensure more stringent filtering of drugs and chemicals. As above, network parameters were visualised in CytoScape v2.8, which was also used to calculate the betweenness centrality of interacting proteins and drugs within networks. Transcription factor analysis was performed using MSigDB (<uri xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb</uri>) [<xref rid="B51-ijms-19-01461" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], transcription factor targets sub-collection. Mammalian transcriptional regulatory motifs were extracted from v7.4 TRANSFAC database. Each gene set consists of all human genes whose promoters contains at least one conserved instance of the TRANSFAC motif, where a promoter is defined as the non-coding sequence contained within 4-kilobases from the transcription start site.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-ijms-19-01461"><title>4.5. Gene and Drug Java Text-Mining Tool</title><p>The custom-made text-mining tool was constructed using Java in IntelliJ IDEA community edition. The code used has been publicly deposited in Mendeley Data for Journals and can be found here together with running instructions to operate the tool in IntelliJ for free (<uri xlink:href="https://goo.gl/vRScJ3">https://goo.gl/vRScJ3</uri>). Firstly, the nomenclature for the text-mined genes is retrieved using the HGNC REST web-service API (<uri xlink:href="https://www.genenames.org/help/rest-web-service-help">https://www.genenames.org/help/rest-web-service-help</uri>). The gene symbol, gene name and synonym identifiers were used in the literature queries. The gene nomenclature is enriched by a set of algorithms that are designed to permute names and omit obsolete name parts. The literature queries are performed using the Europe PubMed Central (EPMC) REST web-service API after nomenclature retrieval. The EPMC database queries are structured into two blocks; the first block contains all gene names, abbreviations, synonyms and accepted protein names from HGNC, whereas the second block contains the keywords of interest including: &#8220;spinal cord injury&#8221; and &#8220;spinal injury&#8221; as well as with the words &#8220;trauma,&#8221; &#8220;contusion&#8221; or &#8220;transection&#8221; replacing &#8220;injury&#8221; in the query. The search clause is structured so that at least one search term belonging to each of the search blocks must be present in the abstract or title of the retrieved articles. All search terms were enclosed in quotations to ensure that the terms are searched as is and that individual words within the term are not matched mistakenly. The retrieved articles were manually verified to satisfy search requirements. Drug text-mining was performed similarly. The drugs for the differentially regulated genes were derived manually with the use of DGIdb and StitchDB. Next, EPMC was queried in the same way as for the genes, where the first block of the query contained the primary drug names instead of gene names. This article set contained no false positives. Please note that different text-mining search engines such as Google Scholar might retrieve more or different studies regarding the usage of certain drugs in SCI but in our experience PubMed is more reliable with regards to peer-reviewed research-based studies and in our experience, retrieves fewer false-positives. A deeper text-mining was then performed using all drug synonyms, chemical names and commercial names to ensure a full, in-depth retrieval of literature. Drug synonyms were retrieved using the PubChem REST web-service APIs. The risk for the retrieval of false positive articles was high in this search due to the extensive variety of drug synonyms stored in the PubChem database. To avoid the retrieval of false positives, the results of the deep text mining were overlaid with the &#8220;drug name only&#8221; results and differences in article numbers between the two datasets were inspected manually and false positives eliminated. URL addresses for all online database queries (PubChem, HGNC, EPMC, UniProt) are output in the console at runtime. The user can verify database query parameters by navigating to these URLs manually. Please not that although every effort was made to minimise retrieval of false-positive associations via text-mining, users must ensure a stringent manual search of target molecules.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was funded by the RoseTrees Trust (M276 and A1384) to Athanasios Didangelos and Elizabeth J.
