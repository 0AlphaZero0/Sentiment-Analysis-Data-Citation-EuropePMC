FFPE and FT samples are histologically heterogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, while tumor-specific DNA contains varying proportions of contaminating DNA from normal cells.</p><p id="Par3">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have the potential to detect variants at low admixture levels, offering a potential solution to this challenging type of analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Because of the poor quality of extracted DNA and to a low sequencing signal, variants in DNA from FFPE and FT sources are difficult to confirm using Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, these types of sources cannot be re-analyzed by NGS because of the small amount of DNA. To avoid considering these variants to be PCR artefacts, it is highly recommended to use alternative methodologies.</p><p id="Par4">In this context, we used high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) as a simple, cost-effective, rapid and sensitive method to confirm a novel somatic <italic>BRCA2</italic> variant (<italic>c.18_28delAGAGAGGCCAA</italic>, p.Lys6Asnfs*4) that was previously identified by NGS in a patient with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).</p><p id="Par5">The present study involved a 72-year-old woman who presented to an oncologist with a complex right ovarian mass and elevated CA-125 level. Her gynecological history was negative. A transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound examination revealed a multilocular solid cyst with &gt;10 locules, papillary projections, and irregular surface with a Color Score of 4. Computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis showed a 10&#8201;&#215;&#8201;5&#8201;cm right ovarian mass and diffuse peritoneal enhancement, consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Ovarian cancer was suspected, and the patient consented to complete surgical staging. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, partial pelvic peritonectomy, and radical omentectomy 2 months after her initial presentation. The surgery was largely uncomplicated, with no significant hemostasis or coagulation issues, and optimal cytoreduction was achieved. Surgery was followed by six cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Written informed consent was obtained to allow <italic>BRCA</italic> testing to be performed after the pathological diagnosis of HGSOC was made.</p><p id="Par6">DNA was extracted from FT HGSOC sections from areas with a minimum neoplastic cellularity of 70% using the MagCore Genomic DNATissue Kit by MagCore HF16 Plus (Diatech Lab Line, Jesi, Italy).

Sequencing reactions were carried out on the MiSeq instrument (Illumina, CA, USA). NGS data were processed using the Amplicon Suite software (SmartSeq s.r.l., Novara, Italy) with the parameters of aligning reads to the HG19 reference genome and to generate run metrics, including the depth of sequencing, total read count, and quality. In addition, <italic>BRCA</italic> large genomic rearrangements were also investigated as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Sanger sequencing and PCR-HRMA were performed on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the LightCycler&#174; 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), respectively.</p><p id="Par9">The WT allele is longer by 11 nucleotides compared to <italic>c.18_28delAGAGAGGCCAA</italic> allele; this DNA size difference allows the allele separation by capillary electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

The nomenclature of the variant is based on the <italic>BRCA2</italic> cDNA sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_000059.3; <italic>GRCh37</italic>) according to the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgvs.org/">http://www.hgvs.org/</ext-link>).

In this context, it is recommended to perform cost-effective, complete, and accurate <italic>BRCA</italic> gene sequencing with a sensitivity, throughput, and sample input that cannot be achieved by Sanger sequencing. In fact, Sanger approaches are not fit for detecting low VAFs, leading researchers to confuse these variants with PCR artefacts, which are indistinguishable from the background sequencing noise, and thus consider them false.</p><p id="Par15">For these reasons, many diagnostic laboratories have adopted NGS technology, which offers the potential for fast, cost-efficient, and comprehensive sequencing-based testing of tumor tissue, enabling the identification of somatic <italic>BRCA</italic> variants.</p><p id="Par16">HRMA represents a high-throughput, rapid, and inexpensive screening test for germline variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and because of its high sensitivity, it has also proven to be effective at identifying somatic variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The aim of this study was to report a combined approach with NGS and HRMA to identify and confirm a novel somatic <italic>BRCA2</italic> variant.

Using HRMA as a confirmatory test allowed us to draw up the final clinical report for this patient.</p><p id="Par18">We suggest that this integrated approach can be used in diagnostic settings to improve the molecular assessment of the somatic <italic>BRCA</italic> status. In fact, our study provides details regarding a rapid and reliable confirmatory assay for low allele-frequency somatic <italic>BRCA</italic> variants that would otherwise be difficult to confirm with other molecular methods.</p><p id="Par19">Best-practice guidelines for the analysis of FFPE and FT samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> recommend that significant NGS findings must be replicated to ensure the reliability of the results before adopting therapeutic decisions in a clinical context.</p><p id="Par20">This study demonstrates that a combined approach with NGS and HRMA allows for the reliable detection of somatic alterations affecting <italic>BRCA</italic> genes in FT samples, improving clinical decision-making for the treatment of HGSOC patients.</p><p id="Par21">Finally, epithelial ovarian cancer treatment, which has historically been based on surgery and platinum doublet chemotherapy, is associated with a high risk of relapse and a poor prognosis for recurrent disease. In this landscape, molecular diagnosis of this somatic pathogenic <italic>BRCA2</italic> variant made our patient eligible for therapeutic treatments based on poly ADP ribose polymerase, which is a valuable option with promising activity in recurrent ovarian cancer patients and at the different stages of this disease.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>HGV Database</title><p id="Par22">The relevant data from this Data Report are hosted at the Human Genome Variation Database at 10.6084/m9.figshare.hgv.1946</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s note</bold>: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nik-Zainal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Breast Cancer Working Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium: the life history of 21 breast cancers</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2012</year><volume>149</volume><fpage>994</fpage><lpage>1007</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cell.2012.04.023</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22608083</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Sudbery</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Ilott</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name><name><surname>Hegar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponting</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sequencing depth and coverage: key considerations in genomic analyses</article-title><source>Nat.
