In mammalian cells active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of Histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals is unclear. In this study, we conducted SILAC Mass-spec experiments with mono-nucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1 associated proteins, including many involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments the association of the chromatin remodeling complex BAF to enhancers <italic>in vivo</italic> and that <italic>in vitro</italic>, H3K4me1 nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex. Crystal structures of BAF component BAF45c reveal that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by BAF45c&#8217;s H3K4 binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 plays an active role at enhancers by facilitating the binding of the BAF complex and possibly other chromatin regulators.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">In cells, cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters can be defined not only by DNA sequence motifs but also by common and predictive patterns of epigenetic modifications<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Active promoters are enriched for H3K4me3, H3/H4 acetylation along with binding of multiple chromatin regulatory complexes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Primed enhancers are marked by H3K4me1 (coupled with a depletion of H3K4me3) whereas active enhancers are enriched for H3K4me1, H3K27ac and sometimes H4K16ac and H3K122ac<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Such epigenetic signatures are commonly used to predict de novo regulatory elements in novel cell types. Numerous studies have demonstrated that H3K4me1 is highly dynamic and correlates well with cell-type specific gene expression profiles, whereas promoter-associated H3K4me3 is more invariant across cell types<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">It has been postulated that specific histone modifications function as binding elements for effector proteins that serve to regulate transcription through manipulation of the chromatin environment or assembly of transcription machinery<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For example, promoter-associated H3K4me3 can lead to recruitment of TFIID (through direct interaction with TAF3) to positively regulate transcription<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the function of H3K4me1 at enhancers has not been well understood. In Drosophila, knockout of the Trithorax-related (Trr) histone methyltransferase results in a global loss of H3K4me1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and a concomitant loss of enhancer function<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, loss of KMT2C/D, the human homologs of Trr, abolishes H3K4me1 and reduces H3K27ac levels as well as binding of Mediator and RNA polymerase II at enhancers<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. KMT2C/D knockout cells exhibited defects in enhancer activation, cell type specific gene expression and differentiation capacities<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. These studies, while supporting a role for H3K4me1 in enhancer function, did not reveal the mechanism of action by this histone mark. It is very likely that H3K4me1 may act by recruiting specific effector proteins.</p><p id="P6">A recent study of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5C revealed that while H3K4me3 positively regulates transcription at promoters, increased H3K4me3 serves to decrease enhancer function<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The correct balance of H3K4me1 and me3 at promoters is equally important for transcriptional regulation. At promoters, a decrease of H3K4me3 and repression of transcription is coupled with an increase of H3K4me1 in many cell types<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, H3K4me1 is known to block binding of H3K4me3-associated factors such as ING1. In fact, H3K4me1 also demarcates the boundaries of active promoters, thus limiting the recruitment of factors and specifying the promoter region<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Clearly these closely related modifications play very distinct roles in gene regulatory networks in cells, depending on localization and differential association with regulatory complexes. This fact underscores the need to identify factors that can specifically bind to H3K4me1, and perhaps distinguish between H3K4me1 and me3, in order to fully understand the role of this histone modification in gene regulation.</p><p id="P7">Peptide or nucleosome pulldown coupled with SILAC mass spec analysis has been utilized to identify factors associating specifically with histone tail modifications<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Such studies have successfully identified proteins associated with H3K9me, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3. However, in all previous studies, binding of complexes to methylated versus unmethylated histone states was compared. In the current study, we designed a screen to identify candidate H3K4me1 binders while simultaneously comparing association of factors with mononucleosomes bearing the H3K4me1 versus H3K4me3 modification. Our approach identified multiple components of the transcriptional regulatory machinery including the BAF complex as enriched for H3K4me1 association. ChIP-seq analysis confirmed that these factors&#8217; binding to putative enhancers correlates with H3K4me1 genome-wide in mESCs. Importantly, binding of these H3K4me1-associating proteins was drastically reduced upon depletion of KMT2C/D and loss of H3K4me1 at enhancers. In addition, loss of H3K4me1 in a mutant mouse ES cell line bearing catalytic site mutations in KMT2C and KMT2D correlates with reduced binding of BAF components SMARCA4 (BRG1) and DPF2 (BAF45d). We characterized the subunit in the BAF complex involved in preferential recognition of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3 by X-ray crystallographic analysis. We further demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic> BAF more efficiently remodels H3K4me1 nucleosomes. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights by which H3K4me1 acts to regulate the function of enhancers.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Identification of potential H3K4me1 binding partners</title><p id="P8">We assembled nucleosomes with chemically modified histone H3 and na&#239;ve H4, H2A, and H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 nucleosomes were used as baits in pulldowns from nuclear extract (NE) prepared from HeLa cells grown in media containing either light or heavy isotope-labeled amino acids as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref><sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Any factor specifically associating with H3K4me1 over H3K4me3 in the forward reaction would be detected by mass spec as enriched in light Lys labeled peptides, and in heavy Lys labeled peptides in the reverse reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Multiple replicates were performed with similar results. For final analysis, 2 replicates were combined and ratios of light peptides to heavy peptides were averaged across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). As we are only assessing H3K4me1 vs me3 affinities we cannot rule out the possibility that factors identified as H3K4me1 binders may also associate with H3K4me2 or me0. Nevertheless, our approach yielded a plethora of putative H3K4me1 associated proteins including many known chromatin regulators and chromatin associated factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Multiple subunits of the BAF (SWI/SNF) complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCC1/2 (BAF155/170), were isolated in the precipitates. Also identified were components of other chromatin remodeling complexes such as BAZ1B from WINAC and WICH, and BAZ1A from ACF. Many factors isolated contain histone-binding domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and, in addition, several of these factors have been found associated with H3K4me1 regions of the genome in cells by ChIP mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two Cohesin subunits were found to be associated with H3K4me1-nucleosomes. Cohesin is known to associate with enhancers and facilitate enhancer-promoter looping<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The results implicate H3K4me1 in many facets of enhancer function from chromatin remodeling to looping of enhancers and promoters. In addition to the H3K4me1 associated factors we identified several novel H3K4me3 associated proteins such as the FACT components SSRP1 and SUPT16H.</p><p id="P9">Our mono-nucleosome pulldowns differed from previous experiments that largely employed methylated histone tail peptides as bait. For the purpose of comparison, the assay was repeated comparing H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 peptides instead of mono-nucleosomes and in this case we observed enrichment of TAF and ING family proteins as observed by other labs<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Notably, there was less enrichment of factors for H3K4me1 in the peptide pulldowns, compared to the use of mono-nucleosome templates. This difference could be due to histone tails adopting a distinct conformation, necessary for substrates to bind, only in the presence of intact nucleosomes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it could be due to additional interactions that exist only in intact nucleosome substrates.</p><p id="P10">To validate association and identity of a subset of the chromatin regulators (CRs) identified in our screen we incubated methylated nucleosomes with HeLa NE and performed western blotting to identify associated factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Target validation was limited by availability of specific antibodies so unfortunately we were unable to conduct further analysis on several interesting candidates. However, we confirmed preferential binding of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3 by a number of known enhancer-associated factors. It should also be noted that some proteins bind to multiple methylation states, such as Sap18 to H3K4me1/me2 and SMARCC2 to H3K4me0/1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). While some factors have domains known to bind methylated Lysine residues, such as PHD domains found in PHRF1, and BAF components, other factors identified in the screen do not have any know histone binding domains. It is clear that complex binding patterns of multiple protein complexes is involved.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>CRs are localized to H3K4me1 rich regions of the genome</title><p id="P11">Next we performed ChIP-seq for 16 CRs and 4 histone modification marks in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to determine the localization of the candidate H3K4me1-binding chromatin regulators (CRs). Clustering analysis of the ChIP-seq profiles of these factors along with three histone H3 lysine 4 methylation states (me1, me2 and me3) showed that nearly all of the CRs tested cluster together with H3K4me1 in a branch separate from H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We further assayed the binding of the CRs to a subset of previously validated enhancers<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and negative control regions by ChIP-qPCR, and found CRs to be enriched at all enhancers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B&#8211;C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1A&#8211;D</xref>). Enrichment of H3K4me1-associated CRs was observed at a previously validated Sox2 enhancer<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, and several factors are also enriched at the Sox2 promoter overlapping with the promoter-flanking H3K4me1 domains. Interestingly we observed consistently higher CR enrichment at regions with both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2C and S2D</xref>). Next we investigated CR association with poised (n=28,008) and active (n=13,811) enhancer regions, defined as H3K4me1-positive regions with or without concomitant H3K27ac signals. For this specific analysis &#8220;active&#8221; enhancers were defined based on H3K27ac signals and not H3K16ac or H3K122ac. We discovered that active enhancer regions tend to be occupied by multiple CRs while poised enhancer regions show individual CR binding patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref> left vs right panel). The majority of CRs tested bound a high fraction of H3K27ac containing enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1E</xref>). That acetylation of H3K27 at enhancers coincides with binding by multiple co-activators implies that binding of multiple CRs might be necessary for full activation of the enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>H3K4me1 dependent association of CRs with enhancers</title><p id="P12">The above results confirmed the association of CR complexes to H3K4me1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To determine if chromatin association of CRs is dependent upon H3K4me1, we carried out ChIP-seq analyses of these protein complexes in mouse ESC deleted of KMT2C/D<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated that KMT2C/D are responsible for H3K4me1 deposition at enhancers in multiple species<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous data from mouse pre-adipocytes and human colon cancer cells, knockout of both of these enzymes in mouse ESCs results in a general decrease in H3K4me1 but has little effect on the global level of H3K4me3<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. We performed H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in mESCs deleted of both KMT2C and KMT2D genes (DKO) and compared the results with the data from WT mESCs. We observed that the majority of H3K4me3 distribution remains unaltered between WT and DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) whereas H3K4me2 levels are mildly effected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A&#8211;B</xref>). Consistent with the previous studies we observed a dramatic reduction in H3K4me1 signal throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A&#8211;B</xref>): 47% of H3K4me1 peaks detected in WT mESCs were lost in DKO mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2C</xref>). The KMT2C/D-dependent H3K4me1 peaks are enriched at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), consistent with previously suggested function of KMT2C/D at these sites<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. KMT2C/D-independent H3K4me1 peaks, on the other hand, overlap not only with enhancers and but also promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). We also detected both KMT2C/D dependent and independent H3K4me2 peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2D</xref>). However, in contrast to H3K4me1 peaks, the KMT2C/D-dependent-H3K4me2 is found at both enhancers and promoters at equal proportions. Additionally, as seen in pre-adipocytes, KMT2C/D dependent loss of H3K4me1 also coincides with a moderate decrease in H3K27ac at the same regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A and S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Both KMT2C/D dependent and independent peaks are bound by CRs but the fraction of associated peaks is highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). CRs should be reduced at KMT2C/D dependent sites in DKO cells if H3K4me1 acts to facilitate or stabilize their binding. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for a subset of the H3K4me1-associated CRs and demonstrate and overlap with H3K4me1 occupancy in the wild-type cells. All CRs tested were reduced at KMT2C/D dependent H3K4me1 sites compared to KMT2C/D independent sites in the DKO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>). We obtained similar results assessing CR association with known mESC enhancers using ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P14">A recent study by Dorighi and colleagues highlights a role for KMT2C/D in transcription regulation independent of H3K4me1 deposition<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Our data suggests that H3K4me1 is important for CR binding, however this new study raised the possibility that loss of KMT2C/D could directly affect binding of CRs independently of H3K4me1 loss. We therefore utilized the KMT2C/D catalytically inactive cell line (dCD) to distinguish between the role of H3K4me1 and KMT2C/D in binding of CRs. We performed ChIP-seq for H3K4me marks, H3K27ac, and BAF complex components SMARCA4 (BRG1) and DPF2 (BAF45d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the dCD cells 38% of the distal H3K4me1 sites had reduced levels of H3K4me1. Interestingly, a small fraction of H3K4me1 sites also gained H3K4me1 signal, which is consistent with the previous data<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and these sites are located closer to promoters than the H3K4me1 depleted regions. As in DKO cells, H3K4me2 and me3 levels were less affected than H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B&#8211;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3B</xref>). At regions where we observed specific loss of H3K4me1 signal we likewise observed a decrease in binding of both SMARCA4 and DPF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E&#8211;F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3C&#8211;D</xref>). Reduced BAF complex binding is specific for sites where H3K4me1 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>) and was not seen at sites where H3K4me1 is unchanged, confirming the role of H3K4me1 in facilitating BAF binding to these regions. Taken together, our data from KMT2C/D KO and catalytically inactive cells supports the hypothesis that H3K4me1 plays an important role in binding of multiple CR complexes to enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BAF complex preferentially binds to and remodels H3K4me1 nucleosomes</title><p id="P15">The BAF complex is known to co-localize with H3K4me1 in the genome<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Our data suggests that H3K4me1 may play a direct role in stabilizing BAF complex binding to chromatin. To confirm that H3K4me1 can indeed serve to facilitate binding of BAF complexes in the absence of other co-factors or transcription factors, we repeated the mono-nucleosome pulldown assays with BAF complex purified from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4A</xref>). We demonstrate that purified BAF complex binds to H3K4me1 with higher affinity than H3K4me3 on mono-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, H3 tail peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4B</xref>). These data demonstrate that protein complexes can recognize and distinguish between closely related H3K4 methylation states, and this could be important for their recruitment to enhancers.

Our data demonstrates that mESC specific DPF2 associates with H3K4me1. To determine if the DPF3 (BAF45c) PHD2 domain could contribute to H3K4me1 recognition as well, we purified the PHD1/2 region of DPF3 of this family of proteins, and used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure its affinity for H3 tail peptides containing H3K14ac plus H3K4me0, H3K4me1, or H3K4me3. Consistent with our biochemical studies, we found that the isolated BAF45c PHD1/2 region strongly preferred H3K4me1 (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 20 &#181;M for H3K4me1/K14ac) over H3K4me3 binding (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 115 &#181;M for H3K4me3/K14ac) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5A&#8211;C</xref>). However, in contrast to our findings with the intact BAF complex and mono-nucleosomes the DPF3 PHD1/2 region bound to the H3K4me0 peptide with slightly higher affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 7.8 &#181;M for H3K4me0/K14ac) than the H3K4me1 peptide. These data suggest that additional factors in the BAF complex and/or nucleosomes may influence H3K4me1 specificity.</p><p id="P17">To reveal the atomic basis of the preferential recognition of DPF3 PHD1/2 for H3K4me1 over H3K4me3, we next determined two high-resolution (1.2 &#197;) crystal structures of the DPF3 PHD1&#8211;2 region bound to H3 tail peptides (residues 1&#8211;18) containing H3K14ac and either H3K4me0 or H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). The two structures show a nearly identical overall structure of DPF3 (&lt;0.04 &#197; overall C&#945; r.m.s.d.), and largely agree with prior structures of this protein, with a 1.5 &#197; overall C&#945; r.m.s.d. to a prior NMR structure (PDB ID 2KWJ) and 0.8 &#197; overall C&#945; r.m.s.d. to a prior X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID 5I3L)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In our two structures, the two PHD domains are intimately associated with one another, with a binding pocket in PHD1 that recognizes H3K14ac, and a pocket in PHD2 that recognizes H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A&#8211;C</xref>) leading to virtually identical bound conformations of the H3K4me0 and H3K4me1 peptides. In both complexes, H3K4 is nestled tightly in a surface cavity made up of the hydrophobic side chains of I314, L331, and F333. In addition, the main chain carbonyl groups of residues 314, 315, and 317 are all close enough to the H3K4 amino group to form hydrogen-bonding interactions. These interactions likely contribute to the preferential binding of unmethylated or monomethylated H3K4, the amino groups of which can form two (K4me1) or three (K4me0) hydrogen bonds, over di-or trimethylated H3K4. In addition, the H3K4 mono-methyl group packs in a preformed cavity that is just large enough for a single methyl group. Hence, these carbonyls may sterically disfavor di- or trimethylated H3K4 binding.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to earlier NMR structures of the DPF3-H3 tail complex<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, but in agreement with a recent crystal structure<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, our structures show that H3 residues 4&#8211;10 adopt an &#945;-helical conformation. Additionally, we find that H3R8 forms a &#8220;lid&#8221; over the binding site, extending directly over H3K4 and forming a hydrogen-bonding network with DPF3 residues E315 and D328 on opposite sides of the H3K4 binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B&#8211;C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S5D&#8211;E</xref>); this residue&#8217;s position was not well-resolved in the previous crystal structure<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Both the &#945;-helical conformation of the H3 tail and the H3R8 &#8220;lid&#8221; most closely mirror earlier observations in crystal structures of the MYST family acetyltransferase KAT6A (MOZ), which possesses a double-PHD finger domain at its N-terminus that recognizes unmodified H3K4 and acetylated H3K14<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> or propionylated/butyrylated/crotonylated H3K14<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. This H3 tail-binding mode may also be shared in other double-PHD finger protein families; for instance, an unpublished NMR structure of KMT2C (PDB code 2YSM) shows that this protein possesses a pair of acidic residues bracketing the H3K4 binding site that could participate in H3R8 binding. This mode of H3K4 recognition may also have functional relevance as it leaves the H3K4me1 group solvent exposed in the complex, creating the possibility that additional factors in BAF or in the nucleosome itself could associate with the composite DPF3-H3K4me1 surface and provide additional specificity for H3K4me1 over H3K4me0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In summary, we carried out SILAC mass spectrometry analysis to systematically identify nuclear proteins that bind H3K4me1. Our experiments uncovered components of multiple chromatin regulatory complexes, including the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as H3K4me1-associating proteins. We further validated the binding of a subset of these complexes to H3K4me1 mononucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> and to genomic regions bearing the histone mark in embryonic stem cells. We showed that deletion of H3K4 methyltransferaseses KMT2C/D leads to a loss of occupancy by these complexes at KMT2C/D-dependent H3K4me1 regions. Importantly, we confirmed that loss of H3K4me1 in both KMT2C/D knock out and catalytically null mutant cells correlated with a decrease in binding of CRs to enhancers, supporting our hypothesis that H3K4me1 plays an important role in binding of key chromatin regulatory factors. We chose to focus on the BAF complex, and obtained strong evidence suggesting that H3K4me1 is directly involved in the association of this complex to chromatin. The BAF complex belongs to the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Containing between 10 to 12 components, BAF complexes are necessary for early embryogenesis, activation of lineage specific genes during cellular differentiation, and maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Genome-wide profiling studies have shown that BAF complexes generally localize to distal enhancers where they are required for histone acetylation during differentiation of ES cells. A recent study involving <italic>in situ</italic> capture of specific genomic regions also identified BAF as an enhancer bound complex<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. However, exactly how BAF complex is recruited to the enhancers has not been fully understood<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Here, we provided multiple lines of evidence that H3K4me1 may play a role in the recruitment of BAF complex to enhancers. BAF complexes fail to localize to promoter-distal enhancers in KMT2C/D double-KO, and in KMT2C/D catalytically inactive mutant cells. Using protein-pull down assays, we showed that the BAF complex interacts directly with H3K4me1 mononucleosome <italic>in vitro</italic> via the PHD2 domain in DPF3 (BAF45c). X-ray crystallography experiments further revealed a surface cavity in the PHD2 domain of DPF3 that readily accommodates monomethylated lysine 4 of histone H3, but not tri-methylation. Finally, nucleosome remodeling assays demonstrated that H3K4me1 facilitates the BAF complex&#8217; nucleosome remodeling activity above all other H3K4me states. These results, taken together, support a model in which the histone modification H3K4me1 directly helps to recruit BAF complex to enhancers, and therefore plays an active role in enhancer function.</p><p id="P20">While this work was under revision, Dorighi and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reported that KMT2C/D promotes RNA synthesis at enhancers and nearby promoters independently of the H3K4 monomethylation activities. While this observation suggests that H3K4me1 may not be necessary for loading of RNA polymerase II at enhancers and subsequent activation of target promoters, it does not rule out other functions of H3K4me1 at enhancers. Another recent study demonstrated that Drosophila bearing catalytically inactive Trr (H3K4me1 histone methyltransferase) survive to adulthood with only subtle gene expression changes. However, if subjected to temperature stress conditions developmental abnormalities were observed<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In addition, this and other studies have found that loss of KMT2C/D in mESCs does not affect self-renewal<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. This can be partially explained by the fact that at poised enhancers in mESCs H3K4me1 is KMT2C/D independent<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, suggesting a role for other methyltransferases in H3K4me1 deposition and enhancer function in higher organisms. This is in agreement with our current study demonstrating that ~50% of H3K4me1 peaks in mESCs are KMT2C/D independent. Therefore, additional experiments are needed to better define the role of H3K4me1 in enhancer function during cellular differentiation and animal development.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Protein Purification</title><p id="P21">Individual histones were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as described by K.

Heatmap and aggregate profile of input normalized ChIP-seq signal were generated by deepTools 2.5.1.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry</title><p id="P36">Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, Protein Analysis Core Facility. Assays were performed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, using an ITC200 calorimeter from Microcal (Northampton, MA). Nineteen 2.0-&#181;l aliquots of solution containing 1.0 mM peptides &#8211; H3K14Ac (ARTKQTRARKSTGGK(Ac)APRK), H3K4me1K14Ac (ARTK(me)QTRARKSTGGK(Ac)APRK), or H3K4me3K14Ac (ARTK(me3)QTRARKSTGGK(Ac)APRK) &#8211; were injected into the cell containing 200 &#181;L of 80 &#181;M BAF45c (residues 254&#8211;368) at 23&#176;C. Data were analyzed using Origin software provided by Microcal. Peptides were synthesized by WuXi AppTec. Single replicate assay performed for each peptide.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Crystallography</title><p id="P37">We obtained BAF45c:peptide crystals by mixing 1:1.2 in a crystallization buffer containing 1.2 M tri-sodium citrate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 and 4% MPD. Despite growing crystals in similar conditions to those reported for an earlier structure of BAF45c bound to H3 tail peptide<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, we obtained crystals in a different space group (P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 versus C222<sub>1</sub>). We flash-froze crystals without additional cryoprotection in liquid nitrogen, and collected diffraction data on beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (support statement below). We processed all datasets with the SSRL autoxds script, which uses XDS<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> for data indexing and reduction), AIMLESS<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> for scaling and TRUNCATE<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> for conversion to structure factors. We determined the structure by SAD methods, with a 1.55 &#197;-resolution single-wavelength dataset collected at the Zn anomalous absorption peak. The Phenix Autosol pipeline<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (HySS<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> for heavy-atom search, PHASER<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> for phasing, RESOLVE<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> for density modification and autobuilding) generated an initial model, which we manually rebuilt in COOT<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We refined this model against high-resolution (1.2 &#197;) datasets for each peptide (with a consistent free-R test set) in phenix.refine<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, using positional and individual anisotropic B-factor refinement for all non-hydrogen atoms, then iteratively rebuilt and refined each model. Both final models are of high quality as judged by refinement statistics and model geometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table 3</xref>).</p><sec id="S22"><title>SSRL Support Statement</title><p id="P38">Use of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515.

After incubation with BAF complex, nucleosomes are slid to the end of the 216-bp DNA fragment resulting in a change in mobility in the gel. Top band is un-remodeled nucleosome, and lower four bands are slid nucleosomes with different positions away from 146-bp Widom601 binding sites in the middle.
