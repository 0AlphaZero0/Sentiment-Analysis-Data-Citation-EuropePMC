In Iran, the prevalence of MetS is rising with age (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>); High triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are the most prevalent risk factors of MetS (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Recent studies have shown that MetS arise from interactions of genetic and environmental factors, particularly dietary factors. The contribution of genetics to the incidence of MetS is estimated to be 10&#8211;30%, and it is possible to override the effects of adverse changes in genetics by changing dietary intakes. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene plays a critical role in determining the plasma lipid profile, especially TG and HDL-C levels. The CETP gene is located in the q21 region of chromosome 16 and spans 25 kilobases genomic DNA encoding 16 exons. This gene yields a protein of 476 amino acids, forming a 74-kDa glycoprotein (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). CETP is a blood glycoprotein that removes cholesteryl esters from HDL towards apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in exchange for TGs. Some studies reported the interaction between CETP genetic variants and dietary variables in relation to lipid profiles. Two meta-analyses found the relationship of CETP polymorphisms with CETP activity inhibition and improving plasma lipid profiles (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several interventional studies have documented that CETP gene variations influence the plasma lipid profile in response to dietary factors, particularly dietary fat intake (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), although these results were not found in other intervention studies (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In observational studies, there were controversial results regarding the interaction between CETP polymorphisms and dietary fats in relation to HDL-C concentration (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Few studies have investigated the possible interaction between CETP variants and macronutrient intakes in Middle-Eastern populations; therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether CETP variants rs3764261 and rs5882 modify the relationship of macronutrient intakes and MetS or its components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Subjects of this nested case-control study were selected from among Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) participants, a population-based prospective study performed to find out risk factors of chronic diseases in a group of residents of District 13 of Tehran, the capital of Iran (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The first survey of the TLGS was done from 1999 to 2001 on 15005 individuals, aged &#8805;3 years, and follow-up surveys were performed every 3 years (2002&#8211;2005; 2006&#8211;2008; 2008&#8211;2011, and 2011&#8211;2014) to determine recently developed diseases.</p><p>The numbers of participants who were aged &#8805;18 years and showed newly developed MetS during the third, fourth, and fifth phases of TLGS were 1019, 940, and 768, respectively, of which 550 cases were randomly selected. After excluding subjects with a history of more than 5 kg weight change in the previous 6 months, pregnancy, lactation, or individuals who took drugs that affect weight, 500 cases were included in the study. Each case was pair-matched with two controls randomly, based on age (&#177;5 years) and sex of those who did not have MetS at the time that the corresponding case developed MetS. Subjects lacking DNA purification in the range of 1.7&lt;A260/A280&lt;2 and those whose reported energy intake divided by the predicted energy intake did not qualify for the &#177;3 SD range were excluded from the study participants; finally data of 441 cases and 844 controls were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a tape measure (model 208 Portable Body Meter Measuring Device; Seca) in a standing position and with shoulders in a normal alignment and without shoes. Waist circumference (WC) was taken at the end of a normal expiration, over light clothing, with the un-stretched tape meter at the level of the umbilicus without any pressure to the body surface; measurements were recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Laboratory assays</title><p>Blood samples were drawn into vacutainer tubes from subjects who were in a sitting position between 7:00 a.m and 9:00 a.m. after a 12&#8211;14 hr overnight fast. Blood samples were centrifuged within 30 to 45 min of collection. All biochemical analyses were performed using a Selectra 2 auto-analyzer at the TLGS research laboratory on the day of blood collection. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration was measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method using the glucose oxidase technique. HDL-C concentration was assessed after precipitation of the apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid. TG level was determined by enzymatic colorimetric tests using glycerol phosphate oxidase and TG kits. Assay performance was monitored once every 20 tests using lipid control serum, Percinorm (normal range) and Percipath (pathological range), where applicable (Boehringer Mannheim; catalog no. 1446070 for Percinorm and 171778 for Percipath). A lipid standard (Cfas, Boehringer Mannheim; catalog no. 759350) was used to calibrate the Selectra 2 auto-analyzer on each day of the laboratory analysis, and all samples were analyzed only when the internal quality control met the standard criteria. Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variations were both 2.2% for serum glucose and 1.6% and 0.6% for TG, respectively (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Genetic analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy-coat of samples using a proteinase K/salting out standard method.

In the case of non-normal nutritional and biochemical variables (TG concentration), log-transformed values were used for statistical analysis. Participants were divided into eight groups based on the macronutrient intakes (carbohydrate, protein, and fats) and harboring of AA/AG+GG (rs5882) or CC/CA+AA (rs3764261) genotypes; intake of the first quartile of macronutrients (as a percentage of energy) and harboring of the AA or CC genotypes were considered as the reference. The multiplicative interaction between polymorphisms (dominant model) and quartiles of macronutrient intakes with the risk of MetS were examined using the likelihood ratio test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to examine the combined role of quartiles of macronutrient intakes and genotypes in predicting MetS risk, which were adjusted for education levels (&gt;14 and &#8804;14 years), smoking (never smoked, ex-smoker, and current smoker), and body mass index (BMI). Logistic regression was performed to estimate the interactions of SNPs with quartiles of dietary macronutrients in relation to components of MetS risk.

The macronutrients did not show an association with CETP genotypes in relation to MetS risk, whereas MUFA and total fat intake showed an association with the rs5882 genotypes in relation to the risk of low HDL-C. A significant association was found between trans-fatty acid intake and the rs5882 genotype in relation to high BP risk.
