However, it is also known that light is a critical factor for the development of frost hardiness in cold tolerant plants. In the present work the effects of light during the cold acclimation period were studied in chilling-sensitive maize plants. Before exposure to chilling temperature at 5&#176;C, plants were cold acclimated at non-lethal temperature (15&#176;C) under different light conditions. Although exposure to relatively high light intensities during cold acclimation caused various stress symptoms, it also enhanced the effectiveness of acclimation processes to a subsequent severe cold stress. It seems that the photoinhibition induced by low temperature is a necessary evil for cold acclimation processes in plants. Greater accumulations of soluble sugars were also detected during hardening at relatively high light intensity. Certain stress responses were light-dependent not only in the leaves, but also in the roots. The comparison of the gene expression profiles based on a microarray study demonstrated that the light intensity is at least as important a factor as the temperature during the cold acclimation period. Differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in most of assimilation and metabolic pathways, namely photosynthetic light capture via the modification of chlorophyll biosynthesis and the dark reactions, carboxylic acid metabolism, cellular amino acid, porphyrin or glutathione metabolic processes, ribosome biogenesis and translation. Results revealed complex regulation mechanisms and interactions between cold and light signalling processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>acclimation</kwd><kwd>chilling</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>low temperature</kwd><kwd>photoinhibition</kwd><kwd>soluble sugars</kwd><kwd><italic>Zea mays</italic> L</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="10237"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low temperature is one of the most important factors limiting the spread and production of plants worldwide. This is especially true for field crops of tropical or subtropical origin. In the case of chilling-sensitive maize plants, temperatures in the 10&#8211;15&#176;C range decrease the capacity for biomass production, while the exposure of plants to still lower temperatures for a prolonged period may lead to irreversible damage and the death of the plants (Bredenkamp and Baker, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Greaves, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Efficient early germination and growth at cool temperatures in the spring is a critical part of resistance to low temperature stress in young maize plants. One of the main aims of breeders is to develop cold-tolerant genotypes, which can be sown either earlier in order to extend the vegetation period, or in cooler geographical zones. Although chilling-sensitive plants are generally considered to lack the ability to develop chilling resistance when exposed to low but non-injurious temperatures, they can also be able to adapt to lower, usually non-freezing temperatures to some extent (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Prasad, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Janda et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of cold acclimation are mainly studied in overwintering cereals, where a certain period of low, non-freezing temperature is necessary to achieve the maximum level of freezing tolerance even in the case of frost-tolerant winter varieties. This process is generally called frost hardening or cold hardening. Cold hardening is the result of various physical and biochemical processes, including the adjustment of membrane composition and the accumulation of certain protective substances, among them stabilising compounds such as polyamines, osmoprotectants or antioxidants (Winfield et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Boldizs&#225;r et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The synthesis of these compounds and the regulation of acclimation mechanisms are mediated by a complex signal transduction network (Van Buskirk and Thomashow, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, it has long been known that light is necessary for the development of freezing tolerance as well as low temperature. Without enough light during the cold hardening period even winter cereals with a potentially high level of frost hardiness are incapable of achieving freezing tolerance (Gray et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Apostol et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Light has been shown to mediate the development of freezing tolerance via several biological processes. These include photosynthesis-related processes, the expression level of stress-related genes and the synthesis of various protective compounds (Janda et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>A strong overlap has been shown between factors involved in sensing and transducing light and temperature in plants (Legris et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Acclimation to low temperatures also respond to light and temperature signals (Catal&#225; et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lee and Thomashow, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In hardy plants light is a critical factor during the low temperature hardening period, but in chilling-sensitive plants light often shows another face during exposure to low temperature inducing photoinhibition, which contributes to the development of chilling symptoms in these plants (Gururani et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Photoinhibition is a light-induced decline in photochemical activity and occurs when the light energy available exceeds the receptive capacity of the photosynthetic processes and the level that can be neutralised via different protective mechanisms (recently reviewed by Posp&#237;&#353;il, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the development of freezing tolerance during the hardening period of model plants, such as Arabidopsis, or cold-tolerant cereal species, such as wheat or oat, have been widely studied, but these results cannot be generalised for the very chilling-sensitive C4 plants. In recent years several cold-responsive genes have been identified in maize, but these studies were usually focused either on the comparison of genotypes with different levels of chilling tolerance (Sobkowiak et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) or on the different phases of cold stress responses (Trzcinska-Danielewicz et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and the role of light has not been discussed.</p><p>In the present work we hypothesised that light, in spite of its photoinhibitory effects, may also have a similar role in the cold acclimation processes in chilling sensitive plants, similarly as it was found in cold tolerant winter cereals or in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Experiments were designed in order to characterise the contribution of light during the cold acclimation period to the development of a certain level of cold tolerance in maize plants. A detailed microarray study was also carried out, and certain physiological, biochemical and genetic factors contributing to cold tolerance were tested. Results may point out the possible involvement of low temperature-induced photoinhibition in the development of cold tolerance as a signal during the cold acclimation period in chilling sensitive plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>In the 1st set of experiments seeds of maize plants (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L. hybrid Norma) were germinated between wet filterpapers for 3 days then grown in a modified Hoagland solution (P&#225;l et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) for a week at 22/20&#176;C at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 180 &#956;mol m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (growth light 1; GL1) with 16/8 h light/dark periodicity (control plants).

Samples were collected from the control and the cold acclimated plants from the 2nd experiment. Two hundred ng of the total RNA was extracted using an RNEasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and pooled from the three technical replicates and used for cRNA amplification. The quality of the extracted RNA was examined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The samples were labelled with Cy3 (Low Input QuickAmp, Agilent), and 1,650 ng cRNA was hybridized to the Agilent Whole Corn Gene Expression Microarray 4 &#215; 44K chip according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent). The array was scanned using an Agilent Scanner, Extended Dynamic Range (100% and 10% laser intensities, 5 micron resolution). Signal intensities and normalization processes were detected with the Agilent Feature Extraction (FE 9.5) and GeneSpring (Agilent) Softwares. The fold change (FC) values of the samples were compared for Control vs. GL2, Control vs. LL3, Control vs. LL4, GL2 vs. LL3, GL2 vs. LL4 and LL3 vs. LL4 in a simple loop design. Genes with logFC &gt; |2| and P &lt; 0.01 were considered as differentially expressed.

All seven genes showed similar expression patterns with quantitative real-time PCR and microarray analysis, demonstrating the reliability of the microarray results (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S1</xref>). Although the fold-change values determined by microarray analysis and RT-PCR were slightly different, the microarray values were generally lower than the qRT-PCR data.

The MDA level was measured to detect the extent of oxidative stress and was found to increase during hardening at GL1 in both leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and roots (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S2</xref>), but did not change at LL1 or LL2. During chilling at GL1 the amount of MDA did not change significantly in the leaves but substantially increased in the roots. In the leaves of plants which were acclimated at low light intensity the chilling-induced increase in the MDA level was more pronounced. Interestingly, the light intensity during the hardening period also affected the chilling-induced MDA levels in the roots, where the lower the PPFD, the lower the MDA level detected (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S2</xref>). This means that not only the leaves, but also the roots exhibited light-dependent cold responses.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>MDA levels <bold>(A)</bold> chlorophyll content represented with SPAD-values <bold>(B)</bold> and membrane damage measured as electrolyte leakage <bold>(C)</bold> in the leaves of plants grown at GL1 before and after cold hardening at 15&#176;C at GL1, LL1, or LL2, and after chilling stress at 5&#176;C at GL1. <sup>*</sup>, <sup>**</sup>, <sup>***</sup>Significant differences compared to the GL1 22&#176;C plants at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 levels, respectively. <sup>#</sup>, <sup>##</sup>, Significant differences compared to the GL1 plants on the same day at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and 0.01 levels (mean &#177; SD, <italic>n</italic> = 5 for MDA, and <italic>n</italic> = 10 for SAPD and electrolyte leakage values).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-00850-g0001"/></fig><p>The effect of light during the hardening period was also monitored by estimating the chlorophyll content. The SPAD values showed that although hardening in the light provided protection against subsequent cold-induced oxidative stress in the leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the chlorophyll content was slightly higher in plants hardened at lower light intensity.</p><p>These results suggest that although light may reduce the chilling-induced oxidative stress in maize, it may also have negative impacts on certain physiological processes indicated by the SPAD and MDA values; and probably photooxidative damage also occurred. Furthermore, loss of photosynthetic pigments may be an adaptive response required to balance the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport with the rate of metabolism. This may also decreased membrane damage in GL1 plants. Therefore the evaluation of the effect of light during cold acclimation in maize was continued by measuring electrolyte leakage. Cold acclimation at GL1 slightly increased the electrolyte leakage from leaf cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, after exposure to severe stress at 5&#176;C this increase was more pronounced in plants acclimated at LL1 and LL2.</p></sec><sec><title>2nd experiment: cold hardening under medium light conditions</title><p>Since, despite its beneficial effects during the cold acclimation period, light may also induce secondary stress (photoinhibition), the 2nd set of hardening experiments was performed at higher light intensities. In this set of experiments plants were originally grown at higher PPFD (GL2 = 387 &#956;mol m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) after the germination period. Since plants were generally adapted to this higher light during their growth period, neither cold acclimation nor chilling at 5&#176;C for 3 days caused substantial decrease in the chlorophyll content estimated with SPAD values (data not shown). However, visual analysis showed that the post-chilling symptoms during the recovery period (4 days at 22&#176;C after 3-day cold treatment at 5&#176;C), such as chlorosis in the distal parts of the leaves, were the most pronounced in un-acclimated plants, being less obvious in plants acclimated at higher light intensities (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S3</xref>).</p><p>The chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction technique provides a valuable tool to detect changes in Photosystem 2, especially under photoinhibitory conditions (Foyer et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Fv/Fm, which represents the maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem 2, did not change significantly after growth at hardening temperature. However, it substantially decreased in a light-dependent manner at 5&#176;C in all the plants. Interestingly, this decrease was more pronounced in plants acclimated at higher light intensities. The decrease in Fv/Fm in non-acclimated plants exhibited values intermediate to those of plants acclimated at GL2 and LL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It seems that the hardening period preconditioned the plants for the subsequent photoinhibitory effect of low temperature. The recovery of Fv/Fm was relatively fast. The quantum yield of Photosystem 2, Y(II), decreased within 3 days at 15&#176;C at GL2. However, at 5&#176;C Y(II) was not better in the non-hardened plants than in those hardened at GL2, and recovery was also slower than in acclimated plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The negative impact of relatively high light intensity on the quantum yield was still detected during the beginning of the recovery period, but the decrease in this parameter was reversible within 7 days. The most significant changes in the regulated non-photochemical quenching, Y(NPQ), could be found in plants acclimated at GL2, where this parameter slightly increased; however, Y(NPQ) substantially decreased in the same plants after exposure to 5&#176;C for 3 days. This parameter recovered rapidly (within 1 day) at 22&#176;C. Non-regulated non-photochemical quenching, Y(NO), showed a similar pattern but with the opposite trend, substantially increasing in a light-dependent manner at 5&#176;C, especially in plants acclimated at GL2.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of cold hardening in maize at 15&#176;C under different light conditions, followed by chilling stress at 5&#176;C and 7-d recovery on the chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction parameters Fv/Fm, Y(II) (the quantum yield of Photosystem 2 estimated as &#916;F/Fm&#8242;), Y(NPQ) and Y(NO) (the regulated and non-regulated non-photochemical quenching).

A notable increase could only be detected after 4 days of recovery, probably due to the post-chilling effect.

Most of the genes significantly differentially up-regulated (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the cold are originated from the cytoplasm (GO: 0005737), cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicles (GO: 0016023) the plastids (GO: 0009536) or in the mitochondria (GO: 0005739). The result of the ontology analysis of gene functions regulated by cold showed the over-representation of ribosome biogenesis (GO: 0042254), hexose biosynthetic (GO: 0046364) and aspartate and serine family amino acid metabolic processes (GO: 000258, GO: 0009069).</p><p>GL2 caused different gene expression as compared to LL4 in the cold in the GL2 vs. LL4 comparison (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S11</xref>). Genes regulated by GL2 mostly expressed in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles (GO: 0043231) such as plastids (GO: 0009536) and the chloroplast (GO: 0009507). Many genes were also expressed in the cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicles (GO: 0016023). The following biological were greatly emphasized under GL2 illumination in the cold, such as chlorophyll biosynthesis (GO: 0015995), cellular nitrogen compound biosynthetic process (GO: 0044271), cellular amino acid biosynthetic process (GO: 0008652), ribosome biogenesis (GO: 0042254). Genes were also associated with the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO: 0034641) and consequently, cellular amino acid metabolic processes (GO: 0006520). Hexose and galactose biosynthetic processes (GO: 0019319, GO: 0006012) were also significantly over-represented under these conditions. Amongst molecular functions, glutathione transferase activity (GO: 0004364) and rRNA binding (GO: 0019843) were over-represented.</p><p>Double factor-regulation, i.e., low light (LL4) illumination in the cold caused higher alterations in the global gene expression than GL2 did that in the cold (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S14</xref>). Genes functions were significantly over-represented of the effect of LL4 in the following cellular components, namely intracellular membrane-bounded organelles (GO: 0043231) and intracellular membrane-bounded organelles (GO: 0043231), such as mitochondria (GO: 0005739) and plastids (GO: 0009536), as well as cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicle (GO: 0016023). Gene functions were highlighted under this light regime are related to the cellular amino acid metabolic processes (GO: 0006520), especially serine amino acid metabolism. On the other hand, gene functions can be mapped to carboxylic acid metabolism (GO: 0019752), gluconeogenesis (GO: 0006094) and galactose metabolic process (GO: 0006012). Secondary metabolism (GO: 0019748) and coenzyme metabolism (GO: 0006732) were less affected. In general, most of the important biological processes of the cell were influenced in Control vs. LL4 comparison. The ribosome biogenesis (GO: 0042254) and consequently, the translation (GO: 0006412) and its regulation (GO: 0006417) were affected. Photosynthesis (GO: 0015979) was also affected by LL4 in the cold. Both the process of light capture via the modification of chlorophyll biosynthesis (GO: 0015995) and the dark reactions (GO: 0019685) changed. The amino acid metabolism were significantly affected, such as serine and glutamine metabolism. The genes in the cofactor metabolic processes (GO: 0051186) were also overrepresented, which either belongs to porphyrin (GO: 0006778) or glutathione (GO: 0006749) metabolic processes. Regarding cellular scenes of these versatile processes mostly found in the plastids (GO: 0009536), including the chloroplast (GO: 0009507), mitochondria (GO: 0005739) and cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicles (GO: 0016023). Ribosome biogenesis and translation are located in the ribosomes (GO: 0005840) or nuclear transcription factor complexes (GO: 0005667). Similarly to GL2 regulation in the cold, molecular functions such as glutathione transferase activity (GO: 0004364) and rRNA binding (GO: 0019843) were over-represented.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathway analysis</title><p>Differentially regulated genes were classified into metabolic pathway groups using the MapMan software.

The amounts of fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose were determined in the leaves and roots after cold acclimation, after chilling treatment and during the recovery period. The highest fructose level was detected in the leaves of GL2 plants during hardening (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S15A</xref>) but dropped to the control level after three days at 5&#176;C and remained at this level on the first day of recovery.

As in the case of fructose, a great increase was detected in the leaves of GL2 plants during hardening, but hardly any change was observed after 3 days at 5&#176;C and only a slight decrease during recovery. A similar change was detected in the amount of maltose during hardening (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S15D</xref>), but its level increased at 5&#176;C even in unhardened plants although the highest amount was measured in the leaves of GL2 plants.

Since it is possible for even chilling-sensitive maize plants to become acclimated to relatively low temperatures (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Janda et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), an analogous experiment was carried out to elucidate how light contributes to the development of cold acclimation processes in maize plants. In the first experiment, maize plants were grown at relatively low light intensity (GL1), which was further reduced during the acclimation period. Measurements of electrolyte leakage from the leaves suggested that, similarly to the frost hardening of winter cereals (Gray et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Apostol et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), cold acclimation was less efficient at low light intensity in maize plants. The MDA level in the leaves after exposure to low temperature (5&#176;C) was also higher in plants cold acclimated at low light intensity than at GL1. Interestingly, the chlorophyll content in the leaves showed an opposite pattern to the MDA content in the roots.</p><p>These results indicated that although light is necessary during the acclimation period to achieve improved chilling tolerance, it may also have various &#8220;side effects.&#8221; Photoinhibition often occurs under stress conditions, when the photosynthetic processes are impaired or negatively affected by unfavourable environmental factors (Long et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Low temperature-induced photoinhibition has been widely studied in a wide range of chilling-sensitive plant species (Janda et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; G&#243;mez et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It has also been shown that upon exposure to low temperature in the light not only photosynthetic processes, but also other stress-related mechanisms are affected, such as the polyamine or free amino acid metabolisms (Szalai et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). To reveal further details of the effect of light during the cold acclimation period, another experiment was designed with higher light intensities. It has been demonstrated in maize plants that several stress symptoms cannot be detected at low temperature. They only appear in the post-chilling period (Szalai et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Fluorescence induction measurements indicated that hardening at higher light intensities reduced the quantum efficiency of Photosystem 2 at low temperatures and also led to the slower recovery of this parameter at normal growth temperature. Interestingly, after exposure to low temperature, plants acclimated at higher light intensities had higher Y(NO), which reflects the fraction of energy that is passively dissipated, and lower Y(NPQ), which represents the regulated non-photochemical quenching, than plants cold acclimated at lower light intensity or not hardened at all. Since the occurrence of high Y(NO) in the light-adapted state is usually thought to indicate the presence of severe stress (Laz&#225;r, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), these results suggest that cold acclimation at high light intensity also stresses plants. However, visual analysis clearly demonstrated that, in spite of the occurrence of photoinhibition, light (GL2) was still beneficial in terms of cold tolerance. These results suggest that the fact that photoinhibition is a possible source of reactive oxygen species may also have useful effects, such as inducing stress acclimation processes in plants (Foyer et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although increasing light intensity itself may also induce cold tolerance to a certain degree, as demonstrated for cereals (Janda et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and although it has been shown that the excitation pressure in the photosynthetic electron transport chain is a critical component of the induction of cold tolerance, it cannot be stated that a high level of cold tolerance can be achieved simply through photoinhibitory treatment. It occurs under various type of stress conditions, such as drought, heat, etc. (whenever carbon fixation is limited), but the plants do not necessarily become cold-tolerant (although cross-tolerance effects have been reported in some cases). Nevertheless, it seems that photoinhibition may function as a signal not only for the development of cold hardiness in cereals but also, as suggested by the present results, for the development of cold acclimation in maize.</p><p>In efforts to understand the genetic basis of cold sensitivity in maize, several genes responding to low temperature have been identified. The recently published results of microarray-based genomic analysis indicated that hundreds of genes were affected by chilling treatment of various durations (Trzcinska-Danielewicz et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Earlier studies showed changes in the expression of various specific genes in maize plants exposed to low-temperature stress. Cold-regulated genes have several functions, influencing transcription factors and genes related to DNA methylation, carbohydrate and secondary metabolism, etc. (Marocco et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Among the transcripts present at higher levels in maize seedlings after cold acclimation were those corresponding to chilling acclimation-responsive genes encoding maize mitochondrial catalase isozymes (Anderson et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). In the cold tolerant Arabidopsis plants it has been shown that the levels an Arabidopsis bZIP transcription factor HY5, which has a pivotal role in light signalling are also regulated by low temperature transcriptionally, via a C-repeat binding factor- and abscisic acid-independent pathway, and post-translationally, via protein stabilization through nuclear depletion of a crucial repressor of light signalling CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1). HY5 also positively regulated the cold-induced gene expression through certain cis-acting elements, ensuring the complete development of cold acclimation (Catal&#225; et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent analyses on the chilling sensitive maize plants indicated three main mechanisms that could be responsible for cold tolerance: the modification of the photosynthetic apparatus, cell wall properties and developmental processes (Sobkowiak et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The regulation of the amount of reactive oxygen species and of redox homeostasis have been demonstrated to be important for cold acclimation processes in various plant species (Fracheboud et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gill and Tuteja, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kocsy, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Boldizs&#225;r et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>). In the present work the comparison of the gene expression profiles in control and acclimated plants demonstrated that the light intensity is at least as important factor as the temperature during the cold acclimation period. The analysis of gene classes with a significant response to the treatments revealed complex regulation mechanisms and interactions between cold and light signalling processes. These results highlight the significance of numerous significantly differentially expressed genes, which are involved in most of assimilation and metabolic pathways, namely photosynthetic light capture via the modification of chlorophyll biosynthesis and the dark reactions, carboxylic acid metabolism, cellular amino acid metabolic processes, such as serine, threonine and glutamine metabolism, cofactor, porphyrin or glutathione metabolic processes as well as ribosome biogenesis and translation. It suggests that light intensity has a fundamental influence on the whole assimilation and metabolism at suboptimal temperature in maize.</p><p>In the present study detailed analysis was carried out focusing on the separate effects of cold and light, with special regard to Control vs. GL2 and GL2 vs. LL4 and Control vs. LL4 comparisons. The pathway analysis of gene functions suggests that both light reactions and Calvin cycle were induced by LL4 and repressed by GL2 at low temperature. It is known, that temperature, including chilling and heat, and light prominently influence chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis, which affect photosynthesis efficiency. Most enzymes involved in the tetrapyrrole pathway significantly differentially expressed in the present experiment. Our results show that the chlorophyll biosynthetic processes were repressed both by the low temperature and GL2. At low light intensity (LL4), however, these genes were up-regulated. In accordance to our findings, chlorophyll biosynthesis was also found to be greatly light-dependent in wheat and cucumber due to a lower activation some key enzymes of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the light at suboptimal temperatures (Mohanty et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthesis is in a strong relation with amino acid biosynthesis. Chloroplasts are able to reduce nitrite to ammonia, and synthesize a number of amino acids (Wallsgrove et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). Not surprisingly, amino acid metabolism is also promoted by low light and not by normal growth light in the cold. The pathway analysis of the gene functions classified into transcription factor families showed that more genes were silenced by GL2 than LL4. This can be related to the higher number of active assimilation processes acting under low light during the cold period.</p><p>In contrast to the amino acid metabolism, besides many pivotal and secondary biological processes, the translation and ribosome biogenesis, the most important influence of cold was found on the cellular carbohydrate metabolism, particularly hexose biosynthetic process. Beside other processes, GL2 had also significant effect on the hexose biosynthesis in the cold. Literature data also show, that cold acclimation is often associated with the accumulation of compatible solutes (sugars, proline, etc.) (Thomashow, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The present work also focused on the involvement of changes in soluble sugars in osmotic regulation. Soluble sugars may function as osmoprotectants, buffering the harmful effect of low temperatures. The accumulation of soluble sugars was found to be correlated with enhanced freezing tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves (Wanner and Junttila, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). An elevated level of sugars was also detected during cold acclimation in tomato plants (Song et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The shoots of a freezing-tolerant pea genotype accumulated three times more sucrose than the shoots of a freezing-sensitive genotype at low but non-freezing temperature (Grimaud et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), suggesting that the exposure of tolerant pea plants to low temperatures activates the gluconeogenesis pathway, leading to the accumulation of soluble sugars. In a similar manner, the highest soluble sugar accumulation during the hardening of plants was detected at relatively high light intensity in the present work. This rise in sugar content may also contribute to the better chilling tolerance of maize plants. Chilling at night also caused a significant increase in the soluble sugar content in <italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic> (Tian et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The present results showed that while acclimation at moderately low temperature (15&#176;C) and low light intensity reduced the level of glucose and sucrose, chilling at 5&#176;C increased the levels of soluble sugars. At gene expression level, the effect of light was more emphasized than the cold itself. In both cases, greater number of down-regulated genes involved in the carbohydrate metabolism were found. There was no overlap found between carbohydrate-related genes induced either by cold or light. On the other hand, the gene expression of alpha/beta-hydrolases and the alpha-galactosidase 3 was silenced both at low temperature and under LL4. Similarly, the alpha-galactosidase proteins from barley and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were described with an important during dark induced senescence and has roles in leaf development by functioning in cell wall loosening and cell wall expansion (Chrost et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily proteins have versatile interactions of G-protein signalling under stress conditions (Khatri and Mudgil, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The light intensity during the cold acclimation period may significantly affect cold acclimation processes in chilling-sensitive maize plants. Although photoinhibition may be dominant even at relatively high light intensity, light nevertheless contributes to the development of cold acclimation in maize. Interestingly, certain stress responses are light-dependent not only in the leaves, which sense the light directly, but also in the roots. As found earlier in frost-tolerant plants, light influences various light-related cold acclimation processes not directly, but at the gene expression and metabolomics levels. The results suggest that the photoinhibition induced by low temperature can be a necessary evil for cold acclimation processes in plants. The avoidance of exposure to high light intensity, especially at low temperature would appear to be required to protect the photosynthetic apparatus, but if the whole plant is to be protected from a subsequent cold shock, it may be necessary to accept the consequences of photodamage in the interests of acquiring cold-acclimated plants.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>GS designed the experiment, measured the sugars, and supervised the work.
