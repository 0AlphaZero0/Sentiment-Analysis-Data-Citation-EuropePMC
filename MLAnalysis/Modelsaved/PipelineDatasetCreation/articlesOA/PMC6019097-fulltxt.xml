We assessed the effectiveness of single-dose oral ciprofloxacin administered to household contacts and in village-wide distributions on the overall attack rate (AR) in an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>In this 3-arm, open-label, cluster-randomized trial during a meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Madarounfa District, Niger, villages notifying a suspected case were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to standard care (the control arm), single-dose oral ciprofloxacin for household contacts within 24 hours of case notification, or village-wide distribution of ciprofloxacin within 72 hours of first case notification. The primary outcome was the overall AR of suspected meningitis after inclusion. A random sample of 20 participating villages was enrolled to document any changes in fecal carriage prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)&#8211;producing Enterobacteriaceae before and after the intervention. Between April 22 and May 18, 2017, 49 villages were included: 17 to the control arm, 17 to household prophylaxis, and 15 to village-wide prophylaxis. A total of 248 cases were notified in the study after the index cases. The AR was 451 per 100,000 persons in the control arm, 386 per 100,000 persons in the household prophylaxis arm (<italic>t</italic> test versus control <italic>p</italic> = 0.68), and 190 per 100,000 persons in the village-wide prophylaxis arm (<italic>t</italic> test versus control <italic>p</italic> = 0.032). The adjusted AR ratio between the household prophylaxis arm and the control arm was 0.94 (95% CI 0.52&#8211;1.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.85), and the adjusted AR ratio between the village-wide prophylaxis arm and the control arm was 0.40 (95% CI 0.19&#8210;0.87, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022). No adverse events were notified. Baseline carriage prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was 95% and of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was &gt;90%, and did not change post-intervention. One limitation of the study was the small number of cerebrospinal fluid samples sent for confirmatory testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Village-wide distribution of single-dose oral ciprofloxacin within 72 hours of case notification reduced overall meningitis AR.

The largest epidemics, sometimes with over 100,000 cases, have been due to <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup A (NmA) [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but sizeable epidemics have also been caused by serogroups W and X. Epidemics of all 3 of these serogroups have been reported in Niger [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The introduction of an effective and affordable conjugate vaccine against NmA, PsA-TT (MenAfriVac, Serum Institute of India, Pune, India), beginning in 2010, dramatically reduced incidence and nasopharyngeal carriage of NmA, virtually eliminating it as a public health problem in the meningitis belt [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In 2013 and 2014, localized epidemics of meningitis due to a novel strain of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> serogroup C (NmC) occurred in northwestern Nigeria, the first outbreaks of NmC described in Africa since 2 small outbreaks in the 1970s [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2015, over 15,000 cases, predominantly of NmC, were reported in Niger and Nigeria [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The emergence of this strain is seen as a natural evolutionary occurrence in the population of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic>, as opposed to PsA-TT-related serogroup replacement [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Response to meningococcal meningitis outbreaks is based on enhanced surveillance and biological confirmation, case management, and reactive vaccination, generally with polysaccharide vaccines, which do not clear nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci and confer protection for only a few years [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. International stockpiles of meningococcal vaccines are dispatched by the International Coordinating Group, a group of intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) whose mission is to supply vaccines in response to disease outbreaks. Nonetheless, there are often significant delays in reactive vaccination, decreasing its potential impact [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Decreasing the time to vaccination would likely be beneficial [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but is logistically difficult in the context of many meningitis belt countries. Further complicating the current situation is a shortage of available vaccines, particularly against NmC.</p><p>Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of meningitis cases has been standard in high-resource settings, with the goal of clearing nasopharyngeal carriage of the meningococcus [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Meta-analysis of data from high-resource settings showed that prophylaxis of household contacts was associated with an 84% reduction in the risk of meningitis [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the meningitis belt, data are scarce, but 1 quasi-randomized study in Sudan in 1953 showed a significant reduction in meningitis incidence after mass prophylaxis with either sulfadimidine or penicillin G [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Historically, as meningococci developed resistance to sulfa derivatives, and as polysaccharide vaccines became available, use of prophylaxis during epidemics disappeared in the meningitis belt. In the most recent WHO recommendations, prophylaxis of household contacts of cases is recommended during non-epidemic periods, but during epidemics, it is not recommended, both because of lack of evidence of benefit and also because of concerns about logistic and operational constraints during the acute phase of an epidemic [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. But given the epidemiology of the meningitis belt, where low humidity, timing of the first rainfall, and highly variable nasopharyngeal carriage rates lead to different transmission dynamics [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], focusing only on households might not change the course of an epidemic.</p><p>After the emergence of NmC, and in the presence of an insufficient quantity of vaccine against this serogroup, a WHO expert panel recommended a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin for household contacts of meningitis cases during an outbreak in the meningitis belt [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The objective of our study was thus to evaluate the effect of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis on overall meningitis attack rates (ARs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design</title><p>A 3-arm, open-label, cluster-randomized trial was designed for implementation during a meningococcal meningitis epidemic to evaluate community-level meningitis ARs, thus justifying cluster-level randomization. Predefined criteria for study launch included having at least 2 health areas (HAs) of a district cross the WHO meningitis epidemic threshold in the same week (see below for description of administrative divisions in Niger). All villages in a HA that had passed the weekly epidemic threshold during any week after study initiation were eligible for inclusion. The threshold was an AR of 10 suspected cases per 100,000 persons per week in HAs with population &#8805; 30,000 or 5 suspected cases per week (total) in HAs with population &lt; 30,000 [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Village chiefs were asked to provide written permission for their village&#8217;s participation in the study, but were not told of the village&#8217;s treatment assignment beforehand.

Prior to the epidemic, it was impossible to know which villages would notify suspected cases, so a full randomization list based on village names was not prepared in advance. In order to ensure balanced randomization over an unknown epidemic length and between different HAs, a random sorting algorithm was used to create lists for each HA, with a 10% maximum allowable deviation between groups at any point. Sealed opaque envelopes were used to conceal group allocation. Reference lists of included villages and their allocations were kept both centrally and in each HC.

A confirmed case was a suspected case with meningococcus detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by PCR. Independent of the trial, all case patients received standard care for meningitis, including a 5-day course of ceftriaxone. When lumbar puncture was performed, CSF was collected in sterile vials at the HC and sent to the district hospital for dispatch to Niamey to the Centre de Recherche M&#233;dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES), the national reference laboratory for meningitis, for PCR testing [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Case notification forms were completed in duplicate and sent with all samples, following national procedures. A third copy of the form was kept on-site for all cases notified from villages included in the study.

A set of contingency tables was prepared, to show necessary sample size assuming 50%, 70%, and 90% AR reduction between each intervention arm and the control arm with 90% power and alpha-error of 5%, given different overall AR values and assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.025 [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

The epidemic had effectively ended 4 weeks after the trial start.</p><p>For the main analysis, to calculate AR, we included the entire population of all included villages, excluding only the index case triggering inclusion in the trial from both the numerator and denominator. Given that the objective of the trial was to test the effectiveness of prophylaxis as a response strategy, taking into account the inherent delay between case notification and interventions, all suspected cases notified after inclusion of a village were included in AR calculations, even if they were notified prior to distribution of ciprofloxacin. We assessed the sensitivity of the primary analysis to exclusion of suspected cases notified between randomization and the study intervention. To assess the difference in meningitis incidence between the 3 arms, we used a cluster-level <italic>t</italic> test of the log-transformed ARs, using inverse variance weights to account for different cluster sizes and numbers of cases. We compared each treatment arm pairwise to the control arm, at a significance level of 5%. After exclusion of index cases, villages with an AR of 0 cases (which could not be log-transformed) were assigned a small number of cases (c &lt; 1) prior to log transformation, and the effect of this parameter was tested in a sensitivity analysis. The validity of the assumptions for the <italic>t</italic> test (in particular, whether log-transformed ARs were approximately normally distributed) was assessed by inspection of a Q-Q plot, and a <italic>p-</italic>value was obtained using the Shapiro&#8211;Wilk test applied to the residual log-transformed ARs [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The following variables were measured and assessed for imbalance between the 3 arms using a <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and a Pearson chi-squared test of independence for categorical variables: proportion of the village under 30 years old, proportion of the village that was male, number of days from inclusion to when the village was targeted for vaccination, number of days between the start of the epidemic and inclusion, and whether inclusion of the village occurred after the first day of rainfall. To control for potential confounders that were imbalanced between the arms, we performed a Poisson regression to estimate AR ratios and 95% confidence intervals associated with each treatment arm compared to the control arm. We corrected the standard errors to account for overdispersion in the data, i.e., when the variance in ARs was greater than the mean. The original study protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002593.s003">S1 Protocol</xref>) stated that the comparison of adjusted ARs would be made with ANOVA or multiple linear regression. During the review process for publication of the study protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it was suggested that the use of Poisson regression with overdispersion would be more appropriate. This change was made in the published protocol and the statistical analysis plan.

Taken together, these 2 findings suggest that offering prophylaxis to household contacts is likely beneficial for an individual, since household contacts are at higher risk of meningitis than the general population during meningitis belt outbreaks [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but that it might not be effective as an outbreak control strategy.</p><p>Our estimates of AR ratios were adjusted for the timing of the first rains, which likely had an effect on the dynamics of the epidemic [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. And although 47 of 49 villages included in this study were eventually vaccinated with an AC polysaccharide vaccine, the timing of vaccination (3&#8211;4 weeks after the study started, depending on the village), combined with the fact that the protective effect is not seen until 7&#8211;14 days post-vaccination [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], makes it unlikely that the vaccination campaign played a major role in ending the epidemic.</p><p>Vaccination remains the only recommended preventive activity during meningitis outbreaks, and has benefits over antibiotic prophylaxis, including conferring protection during subsequent years. On the other hand, oral ciprofloxacin is cheaper than currently available vaccines, is easier to administer, is not stored in a cold chain, and does not involve injections and their subsequent waste management. Meningitis belt countries are currently encouraged to have vaccine stockpiles in-country, but given problems with supply, cost, and storage, this is simply not realistic for most countries. The long shelf life and relatively low price of ciprofloxacin mean that it could conceivably be stockpiled in-country for rapid deployment.</p><p>The high levels of fecal carriage of ciprofloxacin-resistant and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are concerning. Previous data from the study area showed carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 31% of malnourished children on admission to hospital [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To our knowledge, the highest prevalence of ESBL carriage in healthy individuals in sub-Saharan Africa is 59%, reported in Central African Republic [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While we did not show that village-wide distributions of ciprofloxacin led to any significant increase in the prevalence of carriage of resistant Enterobacteriaceae, our study was underpowered to show any changes given the higher-than-expected baseline prevalence. Future evaluations of large-scale ciprofloxacin prophylaxis should continue investigating antimicrobial resistance among respiratory and gastrointestinal bacteria in other settings across the meningitis belt, and routine surveillance of resistance patterns, including among strains isolated from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, should be reinforced in settings where the strategy has been used.</p><p>No CSF samples from the epidemic were inoculated in trans-isolate medium, so meningococcal culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were not performed in case patients, but we are reassured that ciprofloxacin is not used for the treatment of meningococcal meningitis. Meningococcal resistance to ciprofloxacin has not been commonly reported [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but clusters of resistant strains, both in case patients and among nasopharyngeal carriage samples in asymptomatic individuals, have been reported in India and China [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This underscores the importance of continued investigation of antimicrobial resistance patterns among meningococci during future research on the use of large-scale prophylaxis.</p><p>Another limitation of this study was the small number of PCR-confirmed cases, though this is common in the meningitis belt, where during the period 2011&#8211;2013, only 7% of all suspected cases were eventually confirmed for any pathogen by PCR [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We also note that the proportion of suspected case patients who benefitted from confirmatory testing was comparable to that in previous epidemics in Niger [<xref rid="pmed.1002593.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, the patterns seen among confirmed cases reinforce the primary results, and sensitivity analyses looking at ARs post-intervention (not simply post-inclusion, which was the prespecified primary analysis) did not show differences in the primary outcome. The lack of specificity of the standard case definitions used in the trial likely means that some suspected cases did not actually have meningitis, but we expect these cases to have been equally distributed among study arms. We did not include the use of a placebo for the control group, so our study could not be masked. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the effect seen may have been due to a perceived benefit by persons receiving ciprofloxacin, leading them to be less likely to seek care. However, we believe that cluster randomization of discrete villages provided a realistic view of what would happen if a village-wide prophylaxis strategy were adopted. We do note that there was some spillover of treatment groups (2 suspected cases from the control arm reported having taken ciprofloxacin). This is an inherent difficulty of conducting this type of research in an epidemic, particularly with a well-known and widely available drug. The use of passive, facility-based surveillance could have introduced a reporting bias, but this bias should not have differed among study arms, as randomization occurred at the village level.</p><p>It will be important to evaluate the use of large-scale prophylaxis in an urban area, where high population density and different patterns of human movement may lead to different effectiveness. Several aspects of organizing ciprofloxacin distributions in a large urban center could prove challenging, such as crafting social mobilization messaging, delineating areas to receive distributions, and ensuring use of quality drugs, especially since ciprofloxacin of unknown quality is commonly available in markets without prescription. Furthermore, giving a large group of people ciprofloxacin at the same time would likely be key to success in an urban area, but even small neighborhoods of a large city would be larger than the villages included in this study. The duration of the impact of distributions of ciprofloxacin should also be investigated if they occur early in the meningitis season, especially since the strategy could be used as a stopgap measure until reactive vaccination begins. Evaluation earlier in the season may also provide information about the length of protection from a single dose of ciprofloxacin, which may be limited. Indeed, if multiple doses of ciprofloxacin were necessary to provide protection over the course of a longer epidemic, this could impact the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is no plausible biological reason to believe that ciprofloxacin prophylaxis would not be as effective in outbreaks of other meningococcal serogroups. Given that there is no vaccine available against <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> serogroup X, prophylaxis seems to be the only potential response strategy available against an outbreak of this serogroup.</p><p>The persistence of seasonal meningococcal meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt can ultimately be broken only with an effective and affordable conjugate vaccine covering all serogroups of epidemic potential. A pentavalent vaccine for the African market against serogroups A, C, W, Y, and X is currently under development but will not be available for several years. In the interim, large-scale prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin as an epidemic response could be a valuable tool, and should continue to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002593.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002593.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002593.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Ciprofloxacin coverage versus attack rate.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002593.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002593.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the impact of ciprofloxacin for contact cases of meningococcal meningitis as an epidemic response.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002593.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002593.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Ciprofloxacin dosing.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002593.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002593.s005"><label>S1 Timeline</label><caption><title>Protocol/statistical analysis plan timeline.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002593.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We offer sincere thanks to the village chiefs and residents of the 49 villages included in the study; we would also like to thank the members of the scientific committee and the field, laboratory, administrative, logistics, and data management staff of Epicentre in Niger, who made tremendous efforts to successfully implement the study.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p>attack rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSF</term><def><p>cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESBL</term><def><p>extended-spectrum beta-lactamase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HA</term><def><p>health area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HC</term><def><p>health center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>intra-cluster correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NmA</term><def><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NmC</term><def><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> serogroup C</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pmed.1002593.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lapeyssonnie</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>. <article-title>La m&#233;ningite c&#233;r&#233;brospinale en Afrique</article-title>. <source>Bull WHO</source>. <year>1963</year>;<volume>28</volume>:<fpage>53</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>114</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pmed.1002593.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Greenwood</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Meningococcal meningitis in Africa</article-title>. <source>Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg</source>. <year>1999</year>;<volume>43</volume>:<fpage>341</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>53</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0035-9203(99)90106-2">10.1016/S0035-9203(99)90106-2</ext-link></comment></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pmed.1002593.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Boisier</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nicolas</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Djibo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Taha</surname><given-names>M-K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jeanne</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ma&#239;nassara</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
