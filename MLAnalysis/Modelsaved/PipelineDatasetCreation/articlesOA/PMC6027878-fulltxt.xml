The measurement of morphological form in adults is now beginning to be combined with comparable measurements of form during development. Here we compare the shape of the developing wing to its adult form in a holometabolous insect, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We used protein expression patterns to measure shape in the developing precursors of the final adult wing. Three developmental stages were studied: late larval third instar, post-pupariation and in the adult fly. We studied wild-type animals in addition to mutants of two genes (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0003390.html">shf</ext-link></italic> and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic>) that have known effects on adult wing shape and size. Despite experimental noise related to the difficulty of comparing developing structures, we found consistent differences in wing shape and size at each developmental stage between genotypes. Quantitative comparisons of variation arising at different developmental stages with the variation in the final structure enable us to determine when variation arises, and to generate hypotheses about the causes of that variation. In addition we provide linear rules allowing us to link wing morphology in the larva, with wing morphology in the pupa. Our approach provides a framework to analyze quantitative morphological variation in the developing fly wing. This framework should help to characterize the natural variation of the larval and pupal wing shape, and to measure the contribution of the processes occurring during these developmental stages to the natural variation in adult wing morphology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>dachsous</italic></kwd><kwd>Geometric Morphometrics</kwd><kwd>Organ shape</kwd><kwd><italic>shifted</italic></kwd><kwd>Wing morphogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Those studying the evolution of development have long sought to identify the genes and the cellular processes that give rise to alternative developmental outcomes. Traditionally, the focus of such studies has been on large qualitative differences between species or higher taxonomic entities, or macro evo-devo. However, there is growing interest in complementing such studies with measurement of the quantitative effects of variation at both the genetic and the morphological level within a single species or population (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Nunes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Parsons &amp; Albertson 2013</xref>). A particularly striking example is <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Young <italic>et al.</italic>&#8217;s (2010)</xref> investigation of the relationship between sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and quantitative variation in facial shape in the chicken, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>. Previous work in mammals had generated the hypothesis that disease phenotypes were the result of altered Shh activity. To test this hypothesis, Young <italic>et al.</italic> engineered both high and low Shh expression in the chicken. The estimated dose-response curve confirmed that facial shape in both the embryo and the adult is quite sensitive to Shh variation.</p><p>A number of other studies have implicated particular genetic variants as potential causes of quantitative morphological differences using correlative approaches in fish, Lepidoptera, mammals and birds (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Mallarino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Nijhout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Ciudad &amp; Jernvall, 2010</xref>, additional cases reviewed in <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Parsons &amp; Albertson 2013</xref>). To date, such approaches have usually been applied to organisms with direct development, where the identification of homologous structures across developmental stages is straightforward. By contrast, we study a holometabolous insect, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, that undergoes a complete metamorphosis between larval and adult structures.</p><p>Addressing the question of how changes in development result in quantitative variation of morphology requires quantitative comparisons of the morphology of the developing structures between individuals and between developmental stages (including the adult stage). These comparisons enable us to identify the developmental stage at which morphological variation first appears, and perhaps the developmental mechanism involved.</p><p>Flies of the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic> are model examples of a species with a metamorphic event. Like most holometabolous insects, the external structures of the adult are largely formed during larval development, then reshaped during the pupal stage to their final form. In most cases, the precursors of the adult structures, such as legs, eyes or wings are internalized in the larvae, making them difficult to observe. As a result, although the external morphology of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a model for the study of morphogenesis, the relationship between the form of adult organs and the form of their precursors in the larva has rarely been investigated in a quantitative way. One example is <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arif <italic>et al.</italic>, (2013)</xref>, who studied when during development the differences in eye size in relation to face size arose in two Drosophila species; eye size differences arise after the larval stage, but the ratio of eye to face area was established in the larval stage.</p><p>In this contribution, we are concerned with the development of the wings of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Critical to this study, the genetics of wing development has been extensively studied, and the processes that influence wing shape determination are, in principle, relatively well known (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Matamoro-Vidal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This knowledge suggests that the patterns of protein expression during the larval and pupal phases may mark areas homologous to the structures readily measured in the adult (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Blair 2007</xref>). Despite this possibility, natural variation in the shape of the wing disc has not been characterized. As a result, it is not known how changes in the larval wing disc shape relate to variation in the adult wing shape, which has been well characterized at the intra and inter-specific levels (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Houle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The fly wing goes through three main developmental stages, represented schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. First, in the larval stages, the wing tissue is a mono-layered epithelium of cells, the wing imaginal disc, which undergo extensive cell division and tissue patterning. During this period, the number of cells goes from &#8764;50 to &#8764;50000, and the major compartments of the wing (ventral, dorsal, anterior, posterior, proximal, distal) are defined. In addition, the tissue is divided into four intervein regions, separated from each other by the provein domains, which are groups of cells expressing a specific set of genes that mark the precursors of the adult wing veins L2 to L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, during metamorphosis, the wing imaginal disc is folded such that the dorsal and ventral compartments, which were on the same plane, are now apposed on each other ending up on different planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, the tissue expands in the proximo-distal axis giving the tissue a wing-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Third, during the late pupal period, the wing hinge contracts while the distal tip is attached to a stiff cuticle, elongating and reshaping the wing along the proximo-distal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of Drosophila wing development. a. 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larval disc. b. 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval disc with compartments defined by the dorsal/ventral (D/V) and anterior/posterior (A/P) boundaries, provein domains (L2, L3, L4, L5) and morphogen gradients of Dpp, (produced by cells at the A/P boundary &#8211; light blue shading) and Wg, (produced by cells at the D/V boundary &#8211; green shading). c.

At this stage the shape of the wing blade is similar to adult shape.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2399f1"/></fig><p>Variation in these morphogenetic events must be the source of the natural variation of the adult wing shape but the contribution of each of them is unknown. In this work we provide the first quantitative measurements of the developmental transformation of the late larval wing imaginal disc to the early pupal and adult wing shapes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We compare shape variation for wing imaginal discs and early pupal wings between wild-type and two mutants in the genes <italic>shifted</italic> (<italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic>) and <italic>dachsous</italic> (<italic>ds<sup>1</sup></italic>/<italic>ds<sup>05142</sup></italic> ). The developmental effects of the studied alleles are well known (see below), providing an <italic>a priori</italic> expectation of the timing and nature of the effects that these mutations should have on the larval and pupal wing shapes. If we observe shape changes consistent with these expectations, this suggests that measurements of the quantitative effects of genetic variants with unknown developmental roles would help to generate hypotheses about their causal origins.</p><p>The <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0003390.html">shf</ext-link></italic> gene codes for a protein involved in the stabilization and diffusion of Hedgehog (Hh) in the larval wing disc. The boundary of Hh signaling in the anterior compartment defines the position of the longitudinal vein L3 along the A-P axis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Blair 2007</xref>). In <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic>, Shifted fails to properly stabilize Hh, thus shifting posteriorly the Hh signaling boundary and the position of vein L3. In addition, <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> wing discs have a reduced expression domain of Dpp, which is a wing growth factor (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Glise <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gorfinkiel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We thus expect to observe effects of <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> on vein patterning and tissue size in the larval wing disc, which is the stage when Hh signaling is active.</p><p><italic>Dachsous</italic> makes an important contribution in orienting cell division during larval development by forming a protein gradient that polarizes the atypical myosin Dachs at the apical cell membrane (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baena-L&#243;pez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Such polarization orients growth in the direction perpendicular to the dorso-ventral boundary. We thus expect to observe effects of <italic>ds<sup>1</sup></italic>/<italic>ds<sup>05142</sup></italic> on larval wing disc shape and size. In addition, the Dachsous protein gradient mediates cell rearrangements and orientation of cell divisions in response to global tissue stress during pupal development in wing and notum epithelia (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bosveld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

The morphological markers were the first fold of the wing pouch, the margins of the pupal and adult wings, and the veins of the adult wings.</p><p>For the wing discs, four landmarks (1, 3, 5 and 7) were placed in the distal part of the tissue, at the intersections of the DV boundary with the proveins L1, L3, L4 and L5, respectively. Four other landmarks (2, 4, 6 and 8) were placed at the distal tips of the proveins 1, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, which coincide with the intersections of these proveins and the first fold of the pouch. Note that the position of vein L4 coincides with the end of the anterior compartment (shown by Ci expression). In addition, two sets of semi-landmarks were placed on the DV boundary. The first set (9-14) was placed along the portion of the DV boundary contained within proveins L1 and L3, and the second (15-17) was placed along the curve connecting L4 and L5. Data were initially collected for ventral and dorsal compartments of the wing disc. However, the ventral compartment was found to be quite variable because this part of the disc starts to evert very early. Thus only the data for the dorsal disc were considered.</p><p>For the pupal wings, four landmarks (1, 3, 5 and 7) were placed at the intersections of proveins L1, L3, L4 and L5 with the wing margin, and four others (2, 4, 6 and 8) at the proximal tips of proveins L1, L3, L4 and L5. As in the larval wing discs, two sets of semi-landmarks were placed along the wing margin between L1 and L3 and between L4 and L5.</p><p>For the adult wings, four landmarks (1, 3, 5 and 7) were placed at the intersections of veins L1, L3, L4 and L5 with the wing margin.

Procrustes superimposition scales forms to the same size, translates their centroids to the same location, and rotates them to minimize the squared deviations around each point. This separates the useful size and shape information from the nuisance parameters introduced by the arbitrary location and rotation of the specimens within the images. The positions of the semi-landmarks were slid along each dorsal-ventral boundary segment defined by the boundary landmarks to minimize deviation along the segment using the standard model in tpsRelw. After registration and sliding, the resulting shape data have 18 degrees of freedom.</p><p>Analysis of shapes using tpsSmall (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/index.html">http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/index.html</ext-link></underline>) shows that Euclidean distances were extremely highly correlated with Procrustes distances (r = 0.999964), despite the wide differences in shapes of larval, pupal and adult forms. We performed a principal component analysis on the shape data, retaining 18 PC axes for further analyses.</p><p>Traditional outlier detection using distance from the mean is challenging in multivariate space, as undetected outliers will alter the mean and inflate the covariance structure that is used to calculate the distance of each observation from the mean. We diagnosed the presence of outliers using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) approach (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Rousseeuw &amp; Van Driessen 1999</xref>) which uses a random subset of data that minimizes estimated covariance. This procedure was implemented using the Diagnostics option in the Robustreg procedure in SAS employing a dummy dependent variable (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wicklin 2012</xref>).</p><p>We performed outlier detection for the first 5 shape principal component axes within each genotype and stage. Specimens more than 3 S.D.s away from the robust means (<italic>i.e.</italic>, estimated with MCD approach) were identified as outliers. Images of putative outliers were re-examined to determine the source of the unusual measurements. For adult wings, wings with relatively extreme <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> and <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> phenotypes were identified as outliers. We retained these in the data, as the deviations were relatively modest. For larval wings, one <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> outlier appeared to have a damaged disc, and was omitted. Four pupal outliers (two <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic>, and two <italic>yw</italic>) greater than 6 S.D. from the robust mean were omitted because of unusual staining patterns, or distortions of the epithelia. The final shape data set consists of 108 specimens.

In this context, the Drosophila wing model can help us move toward identification of the mechanistic causes of natural organ shape variation, by exposing the relative contributions of cell proliferation, cell death, cell shape, cell size, oriented division or cell polarity to organ shape variation. In Drosophila, cutting-edge tools allow live imaging developing tissues, and quantitative measurement of the dynamics of cellular processes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Etournay <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Guirao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Such tools can readily be used to study the cellular bases of natural wing shape variation. However, in order to use these tools at the right time during development, it is important to identify the developmental stage at which the morphological variation appears. Thus, following the rationale of studies characterizing organ shape variation during ontogeny in vertebrates (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#237;nez-Abadias <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Young <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Zelditch &amp; Carmichael 1989</xref>)&#8288; and in Lepidoptera (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Nijhout <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), we have used a framework based on geometric morphometrics that allows us to quantify wing shape and size variation during development. By narrowing the time frame when differences arise, we can reduce the number of candidate developmental processes that potentially cause genotypic differences.</p><p>We tested this approach by studying wing shape variation during development in three genotypes (<italic>yw</italic>, <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic>) that differ in their adult wing shape, and for which there is <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge regarding the developmental causes of the variation, as well as regarding the developmental time during which the variation should be apparent. Our findings are consistent with this prior knowledge, suggesting that our approach can be used to identify the relevant developmental stage in cases where we have no <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about the mechanisms involved in wing shape variation.</p><p>In the language of geometric morphometrics, features sharing identity or homology among specimens are referred to as landmarks. We used the relative positions of landmarks to compare changes in size and shape between developmental stages and genotypes. Both genotype to genotype and stage to stage homology assumptions could be distorted by variation in developmental timing between genotypes. The fact that we found genotypic differences consistent with <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge on the developmental effects of the studied alleles (see below) indicates that such artifacts, if present, did not strongly impact our analyses. However, if applied to cases where the causes of the developmental variation is unknown, special care must be taken to stage the individuals carefully to avoid this problem.</p><p>Landmark homology is not always clear when comparing specimens at different developmental stages. These uncertainties urge some caution in interpreting our results. For example, the dorsal-ventral (D-V) boundary in the larval disc is undoubtedly homologous with the wing margin in pupae and adults. On the other hand, the position of landmarks along the D-V boundary defined by Delta expression (landmarks 1, 3, 5 and 7) may be shifted along that boundary relative to those visible in the adult wing. The homology of the other four landmarks (2, 4, 6 and 8) is less assured across developmental stages, particularly when compared to the adult wing. However, it seems likely that discrepancies in the placement of these landmarks will be consistent among genotypes. If this assumption is met, differences among genotypes in how these landmarks are displaced from one developmental stage to another reflect developmental differences.</p><p>Our results could be improved through the use of more sources of data on the locations of proveins and compartment boundaries early in development. For example, staining of the Wingless expression domain in the larval and pupal wings would allow adding new landmarks by visualization of the hinge/blade boundary in the larval and pupal wings, as well as the anterior and posterior proximal margins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kolzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, staining L2 vein domain with antibodies against p-Mad or Srf (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cordero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) would also add a new landmark and improve wing shape measurement.</p><p><xref rid="t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that our analysis did not detect shape variation due to sex differences at any stage, although our statistical power may be low due to low sample size, and stage-to-stage variation in the the sex ratio of the samples (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Such variation in sex ratio between stages and genotypes could, in principle, affect our genotype to genotype comparisons. However, since our data are consistent with existing knowledge on the effect of the studied alleles on wing shape, such potential bias does not seem to have a strong impact on our results.</p><p>The developmental stage at which differences between the control (<italic>yw</italic>) and the two mutant genotype (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> and <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic>) varied. In the case of <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic>, the major pattern of variation between the adult <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> wings and the <italic>yw</italic> adult wings was evident at the earliest stage studied. Larval, pupal and adult <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> wings all had reduced spacing between veins L3-L4 and reduced area compared to <italic>yw</italic>. This suggests that the developmental processes causing this pattern of variation act early in larval development. Our findings are consistent with our <italic>a priori</italic> expectations based on previous studies (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Glise <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gorfinkiel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), showing that the effects of <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic> on morphogenesis occur during larval development by affecting vein patterning and tissue proliferation.</p><p>In contrast, we found that the size and shape difference between <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> and <italic>yw</italic> have a more complex developmental trajectory. Changes at all the developmental stages we studied contribute to the overall pattern of adult wing shape and size variation between <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> and <italic>yw</italic>. Some shape differences between <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> and <italic>yw</italic> appear early during larval development, others during the larval to pupal eversion, and still others during pupal development. For size, the differences appeared during pupal development. As in the case of <italic>shf<sup>2</sup></italic>, these findings are consistent with known roles of Dachsous in epithelial morphogenesis, but they also reveal some unexpected effects. Dachsous plays an important contribution in orienting tissue growth in the direction perpendicular to the D-V boundary during larval development (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baena-L&#243;pez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, our data show that <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> larval wings are slightly shorter along this axis than the wild-type. Our data are also consistent with the known effects of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0284247.html">ds</ext-link></italic> on pupal development (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bosveld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the fact that additional differences become apparent during the larval to pupal transition suggest an as-yet-unidentified role for Dachsous during this transition, as well as for tissue growth during pupal development.</p><p>Our work allows us to investigate both the magnitudes of differences in shape and size, and the direction of these changes between the developmental stages studied. Consistent with the visually apparent differences in shapes among stages (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the relatively dramatic folding and eversion that takes place during pupariation, larval wing shape differs more dramatically from pupal shape than does pupal shape from adult shape. Differences among individuals with the same genotype at the same developmental stage are noticeably smaller than those differences among genotypes. While the differences among stages and genotypes are clear, it is nevertheless apparent that the transformation that each shape undergoes during development is rather similar. This is confirmed by the relatively small angles between developmental trajectories of different genotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s23"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our approach successfully identified the developmental stage at which variation appears in two cases for which the developmental causes of the variation were known. This suggests that morphometric studies of wing shape transformations in genotypes with an unknown developmental basis could provide useful hypotheses about the developmental events involved. Our approach may have particular promise when applied to natural variation in wing development, where we usually lack candidate genes to structure further investigations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Jinghua Gui for technical assistance.
