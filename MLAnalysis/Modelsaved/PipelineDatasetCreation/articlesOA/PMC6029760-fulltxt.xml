To characterize the H9N2 variant viruses from 2011 to 2014, 28 H9N2 influenza viruses were isolated from live poultry markets in China from 2011&#8211;2014 and were analyzed by genetic and biological characterization. Our findings showed that 16 residues that changed antigenicity, two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and one amino acid in the receptor binding site of the HA protein changed significantly from 2011&#8211;2014. Moreover, the HA and NA genes in the phylogenetic tree were mainly clustered into two independent branches, A and B, based on the year of isolation. H9N2 virus internal genes were related to those from the human-infected avian influenza viruses H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8. In particular, the NS gene in the phylogenetic tree revealed genetic divergence of the virus gene into three branches labeled A, B, and C, which were related to the H9N2, H10N8, and H7N9 viruses, respectively. Additionally, the isolates also showed varying levels of infection and airborne transmission. These results indicated that the H9N2 virus had undergone an adaptive evolution and variation from 2011&#8211;2014.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>31672516, 31172300, and 30670079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4128-329X</contrib-id><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Huoying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31672516, 31172300, and 30670079) to HS, Grant No. BE2016343 from Jiangsu province, the Jiangsu University and College Natural Science Foundation (12KJA230002), the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20133250110002), and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

H9N2 viruses can cause great economic losses to the domestic poultry industry when co-infected with H5 or H7 influenza viruses or other pathogens including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>, <italic>Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus paragallinarum</italic> and others [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Aside from waterfowl and poultry, different mammalian hosts, including humans, have been infected with H9N2 influenza viruses [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, H9N2 viruses also contribute to the reassortment of other virus subtypes, such as the human-infected H5N1 and H7N9 viruses and the emerging avian influenza viruses H6N1 and H10N8 [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, H9N2 viruses have become a potential threat to public health.</p><p>Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important surface protein that plays a vital role when influenza viruses are introduced into host cells. According to epidemiological and genetic studies, the HA genes in H9N2 viruses can be divided into three distinct lineages in China including A/chicken/Beijing/1/94-like (H9N2, BJ/94-like), A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like (H9N2, G1-like), and A/duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97-like (H9N2, Y439/97-like) [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since 2010, most H9N2 isolates have clustered into genotype 57 (G57) in the BJ/94-like lineage. G57 strains have been predominant in China since 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has been recently reported that approximately 18 residues are antigenically relevant: 66, 90, 127, 145, 153, 164, 167, 168, 181, 198, 200, 201, 216, 220, 235, 254, 256, 283. These are present in the HA protein from the H9 subtype avian influenza virus, almost all of which are located in the HA globular domain [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199260.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The antigenic residues in H9 are scattered throughout the globular domain instead of the five typical antigenic epitopes in H3 HA [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The H9N2 virus has undergone significantly antigenic drift over the past two decades, and the three commercial H9N2 vaccine strains isolated in the 1990s A/chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (H9N2, SH/F/98), A/chicken/Shandong/6/96 (H9N2, SD/6/96) and A/chicken/Guangdong/SS/94 (H9N2, GD/SS/94) cannot effectively protect poultry from the current field strains [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>To understand the evolutionary characteristics of the H9N2 avian influenza viruses from 2010&#8211;2014, molecular changes, the antigenic residues, potential glycosylation sites, and receptor-binding sites in HA from 28 H9N2 strains isolated from 2011 to 2014 were analyzed.

The other half of the tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 mm, and processed for staining with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. These experiments were repeated three times.</p><p>For studying the viral transmission, fifteen 3-week-old SPF chickens were divided into five groups: (i) inoculated group (three chickens), (ii) direct contact group (three chickens), (iii) airborne contact group (three chickens), (iv) PBS control group (three chickens), (v) inoculated group for sera (three chickens). To prevent cross-contamination, the chickens from the experimental groups (inoculated group and direct contact group were in the same poultry isolator) were housed in a separated poultry isolator after fumigation with the formaldehyde-potassium permanganate. The infected group was inoculated orally, intranasally, and intratracheally with 10<sup>6</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> of the indicated virus. The airborne contact group was placed in a poultry isolator adjacent to the infected group with a distance of 50 cm between poultry isolators. At day 3 and 5 post-inoculation, tracheal and cloacal swabs from chickens were collected in 1 mL of PBS containing antibiotics and, following one freeze-thaw cycle, were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Of the resulting supernatant, 0.2 mL were taken, and the EID<sub>50</sub> titers of the tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from the indicated passaged virus were determined by serial titration of viruses in SPF embryonated chicken eggs using the Reed &amp; Muench method [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Sera collected from each experimental bird at 21 dpi were tested by HI assay to check the antibody in the serum against the indicated viruses [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The EID<sub>50</sub> results from the tracheal and lung homogenates on 3 and 5 dpi showed that all isolates replicated better in tracheae than in lungs. In particular, the JS/JT12/11, ZJ/618/12, JS/YZ640/12, JS/TM58/13, and JS/JT95/13 strains reached higher EID<sub>50</sub> on 3 and 5 dpi than other strains in the tracheae. The AH/WB/14 and JS/TM71/14 strains reached lower EID<sub>50</sub> on 5 dpi in the tracheas than on 3 dpi, while no SD/C9QH/11 virus was detected on 5 dpi in the trachea. Only the ZJ/618/12 strain was detected in lung homogenates on 3 and 5 dpi, and the JS/TM58/13 or JS/JT95/13 viruses were detected in lung homogenates on 3 dpi or 5 dpi, respectively, while little or no virus was detected in the lung homogenates on 3 and 5 dpi in the groups infected with the rest of the isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199260.g007">Fig 7b</xref>). These results showed that the isolates could replicate better in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract. The results from the viral pathogenicity testing in chickens showed that different degrees of lesions were observed in the lungs and tracheae of chickens infected with the isolates. Severe lesions were still observed in trachea infected with the ZJ/618/12, JS/YZ640/12, and JS/TM58/13 strains on 5 dpi, while more severe lesions were observed in tracheae infected with the JS/JT12/11, SD/C9QH/11, ZJ/618/12, JS/JT95/13, JS/TM71/13, and AH/WB/14 strains on 3 dpi than on 5 dpi.

The H9N2 virus is recognized as a donor for internal genes to other AIV subtypes, including the H5N1, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which can infect humans, causing a potential threat to public health. The H9N2 virus contains a negative, single-stranded RNA molecule that is susceptible to mutation and reassortment during the replication process, and its surface and internal proteins are divided into distinct lineages [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on HA, the H9N2 AIVs in Eurasia include the following three lineages: BJ/94-like, G1-like, and Y439/97-like. BJ/94-like and G1-like viruses have become the predominant strains in mainland China since the mid-1990s [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, from 2010&#8211;2013, a fittest genotype (G57) containing a PB2 gene from dk/ST/04, which is clustered closely to an H7N7 human isolate, A/Netherlands/219/2003 [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], an M gene from the quail origin qa/HK/G1/97, which was closely related to the emerging H7N9 virus [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199260.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], an HA gene from ck/JS/00, and the remaining genes from SH/F/98 emerged with changed antigenicity and improved adaptability in chickens [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Currently, the G57 virus is the predominant strain in China since 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, 28 H9N2 strains were isolated from live poultry markets in China, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Fujian, from 2011 to 2014. Three G57-type H9 viruses isolated in different years (ZJ/HJ/07, SD/sd01/10, and WZ/614/13) and some field strains isolated in recent years were selected for phylogenetic analysis. The HA segment of the 28 isolates belonged to G57-like viruses. Additionally, the locations of all the strains in the phylogenetic tree are closely related to the year of isolation, and the later the isolation, the farther they are located from the original G57 ZJ/HJ/07 strain in the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, the NA gene has gradually evolved into an undefined lineage. In comparison to other lineages of each gene, the fittest and most advantaged one of each gene may help H9N2 viruses to survive easily in hosts. Additionally, our findings also showed that 16 antigenic residues, two PNLGSs, and one RBS residue changed significantly from 2011&#8211;2013, which might be related to the emergence of the G57 lineage. It is generally believed that the RSSR sequence at the HA cleavage site is a characteristic of low-pathogenic AIVs [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, we found that the KSSR sequence at the HA cleavage site is also characteristic of low-pathogenic AIVs. The R or K residue at position 335, both of which are alkaline amino acids, may be involved in HA cleavage. Changes in the HA receptor-binding site and its nearby potential glycosylation sites also affect the binding of the virus to host cells and therefore the pathogenicity of the influenza viruses [<xref rid="pone.0199260.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although some PNLGSs in isolates potentially have HA sequences increased or decreased from 2011&#8211;2013, most published sequences still possessed eight PNLGSs, suggesting that the eight glycosylation sites may be more stable in current H9N2 viruses. The changes in the PNLGSs are closely related to the year of isolation, which is similar to the antigenic residues. Monitoring PNLGSs sites and antigenic residues in circulating viral isolates may facilitate the prediction of mutants with epidemic potential.</p><p>The virulence, infectivity, and transmission of the H9N2 virus are affected by multiple factors, particularly genetic factors. In this study, most isolates possessed residues in critical sites that increase the infectivity and transmission. Subsequently, animal experiments showed that the isolates caused different degrees of histopathological changes concerning host tissue tropism and better replication in the upper respiratory tract. Better airborne transmission and replication in the host can create an opportunity for H9N2 viruses to survive easily.</p><p>Currently, H9N2 viruses are circulating in China without an effective vaccination strategy. H9N2 viruses escape selection pressure from virus-host interactions by evolution, which may have directly resulted in the emergence of an epidemic G57 virus. To understand the evolution of the H9N2 virus from 2011&#8211;2013 when the G57 virus became predominant, we performed a molecular analysis of H9N2 isolates in this study. From 2011&#8211;2013 changes in antigenic residues, PNLGSs, and some critical residues might have contributed to the increased H9N2 virus survival and evolution. These changes might help the G57 virus to become the predominant strain and could potentially cause enhanced infectivity and transmission by the circulating H9N2 virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our findings suggest that the H9N2 virus surface glycoproteins have undergone evolution and variation from 2011&#8211;2014, which might be related to the G57 virus outbreaks and emergence since 2013. The H9N2 virus internal genes were closely related to those from the human-infected avian influenza viruses H5N1, H7N9, and the emerging influenza virus H10N8. In particular, some NS genes from H9N2 viruses were closely related to the H10N8 and H7N9 viruses, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31672516, 31172300, and 30670079), Grant No. BE2016343 from Jiangsu province, the Jiangsu University and College Natural Science Foundation (12KJA230002), the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20133250110002), and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).
