How activation of the FGF19 receptor at the membrane is transmitted to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of BA levels and whether FGF19 signaling posttranslationally modulates FXR function remain largely unknown. Here we show that FXR is phosphorylated at Y67 by non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in response to postprandial FGF19, which is critical for its nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation of BA levels. Liver-specific expression of phospho-defective Y67F-FXR or Src downregulation in mice results in impaired homeostatic responses to acute BA feeding, and exacerbates cholestatic pathologies upon drug-induced hepatobiliary insults. Also, the hepatic FGF19-Src-FXR pathway is defective in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients. This study identifies Src-mediated FXR phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for BA-related enterohepatic diseases.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">FXR plays an important role in bile acid homeostasis by transcriptionally modulating several enterohepatic genes, including intestinal FGF19, that repress hepatic bile acid synthesis.

Although the other Src family kinases could be functionally redundant with Src, the nearly complete block of the FGF19-induced increase in FXR phosphorylation by downregulation of Src, together with our findings from biochemical analyses including direct FXR interaction with Src, suggests that this is not the case.
