Oral, live attenuated RV vaccines have significantly reduced RV disease, with worldwide deaths due to RV among children having decreased from 528000 in 2000 to 215000 in 2013 [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, vaccines are only half as effective in low-income countries (LICs), where child mortality is high and disease burden is greatest, compared with high-income countries [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;5</xref>]. Efforts to close this gap in vaccine efficacy (VE) are hindered by incomplete understanding of the factors mediating vaccine immunogenicity and lack of a reliable correlate of protection (CoP) for RV.</p><p>The standard measure of RV vaccine immunogenicity is serum RV-specific immunoglobulin A (RV-IgA), which correlates with VE at the population level, especially in high-income countries [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Factors proposed to impact RV-IgA responses include maternally derived antibodies, breast milk antibodies, micronutrient deficiencies, and enteric coinfections and enteropathy [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Effective interventions to address these factors remain elusive, indicating the need for improved understanding of their contributions to vaccine immunogenicity.</p><p>A separate matter is whether RV-IgA can serve as a CoP for RV and predict protection from RV diarrhea (RVD) at the individual level, particularly in LICs. A CoP would greatly accelerate vaccine research by obviating the need for clinical endpoints (ie, RVD) in future trials. RV-IgA has been proposed as the best candidate [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, few studies have investigated RV-IgA as a CoP specifically in LICs, where a CoP is most needed [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Improved knowledge of RV-IgA responses at both the population and individual level is thus mandatory to maximize reductions in the global burden of RV disease. Therefore, in a randomized trial of monovalent oral RV vaccine (Rotarix) VE performed in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, we identified factors that significantly impacted vaccine immunogenicity, determined the correlation between RV-IgA and protection from RVD at the individual level, and evaluated RV-IgA as a CoP using Prentice criteria [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s6"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s7"><title>Study Design</title><p>The Performance of Oral Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) study was a birth cohort study performed from 2011 to 2014 in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, that included a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a delayed Rotarix schedule.

In brief, 700 infants were randomized 1:1 to receive Rotarix or no Rotarix at 10 and 17 weeks of life and followed by active diarrheal surveillance. Standard vaccines were administered according the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule.

Plasma RV-IgA, plasma RV-specific immunoglobulin G (RV-IgG), and breast milk RV-IgA were measured by EIA: 96-well microtiter plates were coated with anti-RV rabbit hyperimmune serum raised against a pool of RVs (strains SA-11, RV3, RV4, RV5, and ST3), and simian SA11-strain RV added as antigen, as previously described [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

When evaluated by these methods, RV-IgA seropositivity explained 7.8% and RV-IgA concentration explained 13.2% of the vaccine effect (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Percentage of Rotarix Vaccine Effect Explained by Rotavirus-Specific Immunoglobulin A on Rotavirus Diarrhea, Weeks 18&#8211;52</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="fn-13"><p>Covariates included in each model: week 18 serum zinc concentration, exclusive breastfeeding at week 18, and treated water.</p></fn><fn id="fn-14"><p>Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; RV-IgA, rotavirus-specific plasma IgA.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In infants from an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, we detected weak population-level RV-IgA responses following vaccination and determined that RV-IgA was a suboptimal CoP for RV. Twenty-seven percent of infants seroconverted and 32% were seropositive postvaccination, lower frequencies than previously reported from the region [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19&#8211;22</xref>]. GMC among vaccine recipients was 21 U/mL, compared with 13 U/mL among unvaccinated children, a clinically insignificant difference considering that postvaccination GMC is &gt;200 U/mL in low-child-mortality countries and that durable protection may require GMC &gt;90 U/mL [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This population demonstrated qualitative and quantitative defects in RV-IgA response: Few children responded, and those who did had relatively weak responses that were often short-lived. Bangladesh applied for Gavi approval in 2016, but Rotarix is not yet publicly available. Under current conditions, clinical effectiveness may fail to reach full potential.</p><p>The most important factor associated with impaired RV-IgA response in this study was maternally derived RV-IgG, supporting previous findings [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. All vaccinated infants in the top decile for week 6 RV-IgG failed to seroconvert, suggesting that maternal antibodies must wane below a specific threshold for successful vaccination. Our study utilized delayed dosing; if these infants received Rotarix on the EPI schedule at 6 and 10 weeks, RV-IgA responses may have been further diminished. Most studies using delayed dosing vaccinated before 16 weeks, yielding modest results [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Delaying vaccination further may be necessary to improve immunogenicity [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further efforts to identify the optimum timing of vaccination are warranted; our data suggest initiating vaccination no earlier than week 10 and completing vaccination after week 17 as a possible starting point. This approach must be balanced against the challenge of altering established immunization schedules, and may be country-specific due to regional differences in age of peak RVD incidence [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Vaccination must be initiated early enough to induce protection prior to peak risk. In some regions, this approach may still fail: in Vellore, India, Rotarix dosing through 22 weeks of life did not improve seroconversion [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Increased age at vaccination may increase risk for intussusception [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, as the number of deaths likely prevented by delayed immunization far exceeds intussusception risk, the World Health Organization has removed age restrictions for RV vaccines in LICs [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; we believe that concern for intussusception should not hinder efforts to optimize dosing schedules.</p><p>A unique strength of this study is that we could evaluate RV-IgA and RVD risk at the individual level. Among seroconverters, risk was reduced but not eliminated, as 15% still experienced RVD by 1 year even at RV-IgA concentrations &gt;1000 U/mL. RV-IgA in this population would underestimate protection, as VE in the parent cohort was 51% [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These findings support previous observations that population-level associations between RV-IgA and VE weaken in LICs [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In India, RV-IgA did not correlate with protection from RVD, and a threshold concentration that defined protection could not be identified [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Reanalysis of 2 seminal birth cohort studies from Mexico and India demonstrated that RV-IgA was not associated with RVD risk after controlling for age [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Surprisingly, 15% of vaccinated infants seroreverted between weeks 18 and 24, suggesting rapidly waning immunity in some children, which may help explain the discrepancy between postvaccination RV-IgA seroconversion and risk of future RVD.</p><p>For VE trials, the Prentice method is frequently employed to define the relationship between a surrogate endpoint and clinical outcome [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. According to Prentice criteria, RV-IgA only explained up to 13.2% of vaccine effect. In comparison, analysis of a Rotarix trial in South Africa and Malawi found that seropositivity explained 43.6% of vaccine effect against any RVD [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and meta-analysis of 8 trials demonstrated a significant association between clinical VE and VE as predicted by RV-IgA [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The authors concluded that RV-IgA may be a useful correlate of VE for Rotarix trials. We also detected associations between RV-IgA and RVD, but the discordance between RV-IgA and population-level VE, RVD at the level of the individual child, and the scant proportion of vaccine effect explained suggests that RV-IgA is a poor CoP for RV in this setting at both the population and individual level. Our results underscore that RV-IgA is a nonmechanistic measure of immunogenicity that fails to capture other biologically relevant effects. For example, serum zinc is associated with protection from RVD [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but was not associated with RV-IgA, suggesting mechanistic pathways for RV immunity that RV-IgA fails to reflect. Further efforts to identify alternate CoPs are therefore needed [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Other factors may contribute to reduced oral RV vaccine immunogenicity. Interference from oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is well documented and is greatest when the first doses of Rotarix and OPV are given concomitantly (typically at week 6), when OPV replication is highest [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In PROVIDE, infants received the first dose of Rotarix at week 10 with the second OPV dose, reducing potential interference, an added benefit of delayed dosing. Interference from nonpolio enteroviruses has also been described in this population [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but is unlikely to be an easily modifiable risk factor. Levels of blood and stool biomarkers suggesting systemic and gut inflammation have been associated with Rotarix vaccine performance [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but we were unable to model all variables because few infants had complete biomarker results. Breastfeeding was associated with impaired immunogenicity; others have demonstrated impacts of breast milk on vaccine infectivity and immunogenicity, but interventions addressing these factors (ie, withholding breastfeeding) have been unsuccessful [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Given its important health benefits, breastfeeding is an unattractive target for future interventions.</p><p>There are several limitations to this work. The EIA used in this study potentially underestimated RV-IgA concentration, likely due to antigen mismatch [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, as 87.5% of tested specimens were concordant for serostatus when measured by both PROVIDE and Cincinnati EIA, the effect on seroconversion or seropositivity was likely minimal. We could not account for lack of natural RV exposure, which could help explain the discordance between lack of seroconversion but protection from RVD. However, Dhaka has among the highest rates of RV infection in the world [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], so the force of infection in this study was high. Neutralizing antibodies may have contributed but, due to limited specimen volume, could not be measured. The timing of antibody measurement likely impacted results. Asymptomatic infections after week 18 might increase RV-IgA, but this effect would be missed. However, week 24 RV-IgA results suggest that this was not a significant factor. Plasma collection at week 18, 1 week following the second Rotarix dose, may have been too early to reflect its full effect. The reason for blood draw at this time point was due to logistical constraints regarding frequency and timing of blood draws due to overall study design. Our results more accurately describe RV-IgA following the first dose. In phase 2 trials in high- and middle-income countries, seroconversion following 1 dose was 38%&#8211;88% [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36&#8211;40</xref>], much higher than in our population. RV-IgA concentration was likely unaffected, since the major role of the second dose is for &#8220;catch-up&#8221; response among infants who did not initially respond, rather than boost antibody levels [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although sample size was limited, this is supported by week 24 results among vaccinated infants. Seroconversion was modestly increased, but no differences were seen in RV-IgA concentration. Seroconversion at week 24 was still well below the 87% rate observed in high-income countries [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated poor RV-IgA responses in a birth cohort from urban Dhaka, Bangladesh. Increased maternally derived RV-IgG significantly decreased Rotarix vaccine immunogenicity and remains a potential target for population-level intervention. RV-IgA is a suboptimal CoP for RV in the developing world. Vaccine recommendations in regions with poor population-level RV-IgA responses must consider this limitation and should be based on efficacy data whenever possible. Further efforts to identify a reliable CoP for RV in LICs are needed to assist in future endeavors to improve vaccination strategies and evaluate next-generation vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
