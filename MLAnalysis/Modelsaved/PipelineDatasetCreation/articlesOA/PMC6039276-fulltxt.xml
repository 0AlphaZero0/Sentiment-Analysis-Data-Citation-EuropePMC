Here we explore a secondary means of <italic>KRAS</italic> activation in cancer, focal high-level amplification of the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene in the absence of coding mutations. These amplifications occur most commonly in esophageal, gastric and ovarian adenocarcinomas<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified gastric cancer models possess marked overexpression of KRAS protein and are insensitive to MAPK blockade due to their capacity to adaptively respond by rapidly increasing KRAS-GTP levels. We demonstrate that inhibition of guanine exchange factors SOS1/2 or protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, can attenuate this adaptive process and that targeting of these factors, both genetically and pharmacologically, can enhance sensitivity of <italic>KRAS</italic>-amplified models to MEK inhibition both in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. These data demonstrate the relevance of copy number amplification as a mechanism of KRAS activation, and uncover the therapeutic potential for targeting of these tumors through combined SHP2 and MEK inhibition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P33"><italic>KRAS</italic> is justifiably renowned as the most commonly mutated oncogene across human cancers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Research on RAS-driven cancers has focused almost exclusively on RAS coding mutations. However, recent studies have noted genomic amplification of <italic>KRAS</italic> without canonical mutations<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. For example, our characterization of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) across gastric, esophageal and colorectal adenocarcinomas found <italic>KRAS</italic> to lie at the peak of the most significant amplification, events nearly exclusive to gastroesophageal tumors with exome sequencing demonstrating that the majority of these tumors lack detectable <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification was similarly noted in ovarian and endometrial cancers, where their presence was associated with enhanced rates of metastasis or poor survival<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In retrospect, early <italic>KRAS</italic> studies noted <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification. In 1985, Barbacid and colleagues reported <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification in cancer and that overexpression of wild-type KRAS transformed NIH-3T3 cells<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. While several recent studies have identified <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification as a mechanism of acquired resistance to targeted therapies, the amplifications observed in gastroesophageal and ovarian cancers were detected in <italic>de novo</italic>, untreated cancers<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These results suggest amplification of wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> to be an alternative means of activating this oncoprotein in cancer and raise key questions about its activity and the potential vulnerabilities of these tumors relative to those with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>.</p><p id="P34">We first systematically evaluated the frequency of wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification across cancer using existing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large-scale genome efforts. Using data with matched SCNA profiling and exome analysis, we identified <italic>KRAS</italic> amplifications without coding mutations in esophageal adenocarcinoma (17%), the CIN-variant of gastric cancer (13%) and serous ovarian cancer (10%) with smaller frequency of events in endometrial and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These data are consistent with genomic characterization in these diseases, which identified significant focal amplification peaks at the <italic>KRAS</italic> locus<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, visual inspection of SCNA profiles on chromosome 12 demonstrates the focality of amplification at the <italic>KRAS</italic> locus in gastric cancer, events notably absent in colorectal cancer where <italic>KRAS</italic> is recurrently activated by canonical mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We next evaluated the relationship between <italic>KRAS</italic> copy-number and expression. Analyses from gastric cancer TCGA demonstrated that <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification is commonly at high levels, exceeding 25 estimated copies of the gene (saturating the discriminant capacity of the array-based copy-number platform) and accompanied by marked elevation of <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P35">We confirmed high KRAS expression and amplification in primary gastroesophageal tumor samples using FISH and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To examine the relationship between <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification and impact on clinical outcomes, we first compared cause-specific survival of patients harboring <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification to patients lacking the amplification in a series of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas from a Japanese cohort. In a Kaplan-Meier five-year survival analysis from this Japanese cohort, patients with a <italic>KRAS</italic> positive status (n=30, 38.4%) had significantly poorer survival compared with patients with non-amplified <italic>KRAS</italic> status (n=97, 69.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). An independent analysis from the TCGA cohort of mixed Eastern and Western gastric adenocarcinoma, found that <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified tumors had significantly decreased disease-free survival and a trend towards decreased overall survival compared to patients without <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We also evaluated a Western cohort of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma for KRAS protein expression via mass spectrometric analysis of paraffin-embedded samples, which confirmed marked KRAS overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This observation was correlated with a significantly decreased five-year survival in patients whose tumors harbored KRAS protein overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P36">To evaluate the function of amplified wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> in gastric cancer (GC), we utilized the availability of cellular models with amplification (YCC1, KE39, HUG1N) and mutation (G12D) (GSU, SNU-1; both G12D) and a control cell line that is neither amplified nor mutant for <italic>KRAS</italic> (IM95). Amplified <italic>KRAS</italic> GC cell lines displayed strikingly elevated total KRAS levels, quantified via immunoblot densitometry to be 45&#8211;300-fold the levels present in IM95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). We performed siRNA-mediated <italic>KRAS</italic> silencing, finding significant reduction in cell proliferation in all cell lines except IM95, indicating that mutant and amplified cell lines are dependent on <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P37">We next evaluated potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in <italic>KRAS</italic>-amplified and mutant GC models. Directly targeting KRAS has been challenging due to the difficulty in disrupting the nucleotide-binding pocket and the marked affinity of KRAS for GTP<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Since targeting downstream effectors in the PI3-K and MAPK pathways have been proposed for RAS-driven cancers, we examined the effect of MEK and PI3-K inhibitors in gastric cancer lines. While AKT or PI3-K inhibitors MK2206 and GDC0941 showed equivalent modest effects on viability in mutant and amplified models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), we found discrepant responses to MEK inhibition. Compared to <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant cell lines, <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified models demonstrated intrinsic resistance to MEK blockade using either AZD6244 or GSK1120212 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Following 72-hour treatment with GSK1120212, the more potent of the MEK inhibitors, we observed less apoptosis in amplified <italic>KRAS</italic> as measured by Annexin V staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We confirmed that the relative failure of MEK inhibition was not attributable to inadequate target engagement, finding stable inhibition of pERK following treatment with GSK1120212 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P38">We next asked if <italic>KRAS</italic>-amplified cells showed adaptive compensation to MEK inhibition. We found that MEK inhibition in amplified <italic>KRAS</italic> cells led to strong induction of pAKT after 1, 6 and 24 hours, an effect not observed in control or mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We confirmed that these <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cell lines lack somatic <italic>PTEN</italic> inactivation or activating <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. To evaluate if these effects were specific to MEK inhibition or more generalizable to blockade of the MAPK pathway, we tested ERK inhibitor SCH772984, again finding adaptive increases in pAKT in amplified but not in mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). These results suggested an adaptive response to loss of ERK-mediated negative regulation of upstream cell signaling. Indeed, we confirmed the transcriptional repression of <italic>SPRY4, FOS, DUSP4</italic> and <italic>DUSP6</italic>, indicative of effective blockade of the MAPK pathway and attenuation of expression of mediators of ERK-mediated negative feedback (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Additionally, we observed that ERK signaling was still inhibited at 72 hours, suggesting that the adaptive effects of MEK blockade in <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cells do not include evident pERK reactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that differential adaptive capabilities of <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified tumors may serve as a barrier to effective therapy with MAPK inhibition, a focus of many therapeutic strategies for <italic>KRAS</italic>-driven cancers.</p><p id="P39">To evaluate adaptation to MEK inhibition, we first confirmed that MEK inhibitor-mediated activation of pAKT in <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cells was dependent upon PI3-K by demonstrating that co-inhibition of PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) and GSK1120212 blocked pAKT induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Furthermore, PI3K blockade sensitized <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cells to GSK1120212 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), suggesting that blockade of adaptive physiology could facilitate development of therapeutic combinations for these cancers. Since co-administration of effective doses of PI3K and MEK inhibitors in patients has been greatly limited by the toxicity of these combinations<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, we next sought to define the etiology of this adaptive resistance and identify measures to inhibit this adaptation in order to potentiate MAPK inhibition in <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cancers.</p><p id="P40">We first asked if the adaptation to MEK inhibition was stimulated by enhanced activation of other signaling pathways, specifically receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We examined changes in cell signaling using a phospho-tyrosine RTK signaling antibody array that detects phosphorylation of 28 RTKs and 11 key signaling nodes. After 6 hours of exposure to GSK1120212, all the <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified lines but none of the <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lines showed increased AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). ERBB3 was the only other RTK whose phosphorylation was upregulated, present in one of the three <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified cell lines, HUG1N, and validated using immunoblotting analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>).

SHP2 has been proposed as a mediator of RAS/MAPK pathway activation by diverse mechanisms and at distinct points of RAS regulation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Candidate mechanisms of SHP2 include promoting recruitment of GAB2/GRB2/SOS complex to the plasma membrane, direct dephosphorylation of tyrosyl phosphorylated RAS for RAS activation as well as indirect endomembrane RAS activation via SYK<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SHP2 has also been implicated in regulation of KRAS activation via modulation of activity of RAS GTPase proteins<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Since we were able to phenocopy our results with genetic SOS targeting with SHP2 inhibition, we next asked if we could rescue the inhibitory effect of SHP099 on GSK1120212 mediated adaptive responses in <italic>KRAS</italic> amplified GC via SOS. We engineered cells expressing ectopic wildtype SOS1 or an active variant expressing only the catalytic domain of SOS (SOS-cat) but lacking the C-terminal GRB2 interacting domain or N-terminal Dbl-homology and pleckstrin homology domains<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. We found the SOS-cat but not wild-type SOS could rescue the inhibition of cell viability, adaptive RAS-GTP increases as well as the adaptive pAKT induction that we observed with addition of SHP099 to GSK1120212 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a-c</xref>).

We further evaluate the effects of SHP2 inhibition upon SOS function by utilizing confocal fluorescent microscopy to evaluate localization of endogenous SOS1 in response to inhibitor treatment in KRAS amplified and mutant GC cell lines. With MEK inhibition in the amplified KE39 line but not the mutant GSU model, we observed a shift in SOS1 localization that was abrogated with co-administration of SHP099 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11d</xref>), again consistent with a role of SOS in mediating adaptive KRAS activation with <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification.
