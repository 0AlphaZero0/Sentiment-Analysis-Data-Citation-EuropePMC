The marine mollusk <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> can be used to study transcriptional changes that occur with age in identified neurons of the brain, because its simplified nervous system allows for more direct correlations between molecular changes, physiological changes, and their phenotypic outcomes. Behavioral deficits in the tail-withdrawal reflex of aged animals have been correlated with reduced excitation in sensory neurons that control the reflex. RNASeq was used to investigate whole-transcriptome changes in tail-withdrawal sensory neurons of sexually mature and aged Aplysia to correlate transcriptional changes with reduced behavioral and physiological responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Paired-end sequencing resulted in 210 million reads used for differential expression analysis. Aging significantly altered expression of 1202 transcripts in sensory neurons underlying the tail-withdrawal reflex, with an approximately equal number of these genes up- and down regulated with age. Despite overall bidirectionality of expression changes, &gt;&#8201;80% of ion channel genes that were differentially expressed had decreased expression with age. In particular, several voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were down regulated. This marked decrease in ion channel expression may play an important role in previously observed declines in aged sensory neuron excitability. We also observed decreased expression of genes and pathways involved in learning and memory. Genes involved in the stress response showed increased expression in aged Aplysia neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Significantly altered expression of many genes between sexually mature and aged Aplysia suggests large molecular changes that may impact neuronal function. Decreased ion channel mRNA observed could mean fewer receptors present in aged neurons, resulting in reduced excitability of PVC sensory neurons, ultimately leading to reduced tail-withdrawal reflex observed in aged Aplysia. Significant changes in other genes and pathways, such as stress response and learning and memory, have previously been shown to occur with age in many vertebrate organisms. This suggests that some effects of aging are common across many animal phyla.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-4909-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Pleural ganglion</kwd><kwd>NMDA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40 OD010952</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">Aging changes at the cellular and molecular levels result in declines in learning and memory, locomotion, and reflex systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (Aplysia), the California sea hare, is a marine mollusk that has been used extensively in research correlating physiological and behavioral declines with gene expression changes in neuronal circuits during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], due to a less complex nervous system than vertebrates. Changes in behavior with age can be studied at the physiological and molecular level in individual neurons that control the behaviors. Additionally, an annual lifespan allows these studies to be completed in a relatively short period of time.</p><p id="Par23">Previous studies in Aplysia have shown that reflex impairments in aged animals corresponded to declines in neuronal excitability in the neurons that underlie the behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Physiological aging, such as reduced motoneuron excitability, has also been correlated with transcriptional changes such as reduced expression of membrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and changes in cellular pathways that ensure normal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, alterations in acetylcholine-induced action potentials in the R15 neuron during aging occurred in conjunction with reduced expression of some acetylcholine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Biological pathways for cell signaling, cellular function, and neurological diseases are also altered in aged R15 neurons in Aplysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Aging in sensory neurons is understudied, despite their role in responding to external stimuli to coordinate voluntary movements, some of which show stereotyped changes in aging animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To better characterize sensory neuron aging in Aplysia, we identified molecular changes with age in the pleural ventral caudal (PVC) sensory neurons located in the pleural ganglia. PVC sensory neurons are of particular interest due to their involvement in the tail-withdrawal reflex (TWR). Direct tail stimulation initiating TWR activates PVC sensory neurons, which make monosynaptic connections to three motoneurons of the pedal ganglion (P7-P9) and trigger movement of the tail muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Aplysia can be classified as Mature (M, ~&#8201;8&#160;months) or Aged II (AII, ~&#8201;12&#160;months) based on diminished TWR behavior, as well as physiological changes in the underlying neural circuits. Predictable increases in TWR time occur in AII compared to M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and these declines are associated with reduced excitability in both PVC sensory neurons and pedal motoneurons underlying TWR, as well as reduced conduction velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our laboratory has also described declines in glutamatergic neurotransmission in sensory and motoneurons of TWR with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Reduced excitability of each of the constituents of the TWR suggest synaptic transmission is negatively affected by age, and contributes to increased reflex completion times in AII animals.</p><p id="Par26">The cause of altered PVC function is a critical question that can provide insights into aging of TWR, and sensory neuron aging in general. In this study, we characterized the molecular correlates of altered PVC function in aged animals using RNASeq. First, behavioral experiments were conducted in mature and aged animals to confirm aging of TWR. Then, whole-transcriptome changes in PVC sensory neurons were assessed using the same animals assessed for reflex behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal rearing and behavioral assessments of aging</title><p id="Par27">Two cohorts of Aplysia that originated from differently parented egg masses of wild-caught animals were reared at the University of Miami National Resource for Aplysia. Both cohorts were maintained at a maximum of 5 per cage and fed an ad lib diet of <italic>Agardhiella subulata</italic> throughout their life as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Sexual maturity (M) occurred at 8&#160;months in both cohorts, and Aged II (AII) occurred at 12&#160;months. Behavioral assessments were executed beginning at M, defined as the day the first egg mass was found, on 6&#8211;8 randomly selected animals from each cohort. Assessments were continued monthly on randomly selected animals from each cohort through the end of life, age ~&#8201;12.5&#160;months in both cohorts. Each monthly measurement of a reflex consisted of 3 repetitions on each animal, with a minimum of 5&#160;min between trials.</p><p id="Par29">Behavioral assessments were carried out using previously described protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Briefly, TWR was initiated by pressing a blunted 21-gauge needle to the tip of the animal&#8217;s tail by approximately 1/2 the tail thickness for approximately 1&#160;s to initiate withdrawal of the tail. Time was recorded from the initiation of tail withdrawal until the animal had relaxed the tail approximately 30%.</p><p id="Par30">The righting reflex also exhibits declines in performance with age, and was chosen as a second measure of aging reflexes. Righting was recorded by picking an animal up and releasing it by tilting the palm of the hand at the top of the water column. Time for the reflex was recorded starting when the animal reached the cage bottom and ending when it took its first crawling step after righting itself, and adhered to the bottom of the cage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RNA extraction and sequencing preparation</title><p id="Par31">RNA was extracted from PVC neurons from six animals from each cohort at M and six animals from each cohort at AII. The animals chosen for dissection of ganglia and RNA extraction from neural clusters were a randomly selected subset of the animals tested for TWR and righting at M and AII. This allowed for direct correlation of an individual animals&#8217; behavioral assessments with its expression profile.</p><p id="Par32">To remove PVC neurons for RNA extraction, animals were first anesthetized by injection of 1/6th body weight of isotonic MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The central nervous system (CNS) was then removed by severing the connectives and removal of all nervous system ganglia. PVC neurons were separated from the remainder of the pleural ganglion by pinning the pedal and pleural ganglia tightly in a sylguarded 35&#160;mm plastic dish filled with artificial sea water (417&#160;mM NaCl, 10&#160;mM KCl, 10&#160;mM CaCl2, 55&#160;mM MgCl2, and 15&#160;mM HEPES-NaOH, pH&#160;7.6). PVC neurons were peeled away from the remainder of the pleural ganglion with a pair of fine forceps after removal of the surrounding connective tissue. PVC neurons from each hemiganglion were pooled as a single sample.</p><p id="Par33">Total RNA was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit (Cat. #74004) following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Samples were treated with DNase to remove any contaminating DNA.

The highest quality RNA samples were defined as having sufficient RNA quantity and 260/280&#160;nm ratio ~&#8201;2 to ensure no DNA or protein contamination. Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Low-Throughput Library Prep Kit (Cat. #RS-122-2201) following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Following library preparation, samples were assessed on the bioanalyzer for quantification and to verify 200-300&#160;bp fragment sizes. Libraries were sequenced as 100&#160;bp paired-end reads by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, CA) in one lane on a HiSeq 2500 high-throughput sequencer (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data processing</title><p id="Par35">Raw reads were quality filtered using the fastaxtoolkit (&lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/%3e">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/&gt;</ext-link>). When a base pair quality score of &lt;&#8201;20 was encountered in a read, the remainder of the read was cut off and removed. Reads shorter than 20 base pairs after trimming and removal of barcodes were also removed.

In order to assess an accurate number of total reads used for downstream analysis, rRNA reads were removed from all samples prior to analysis by mapping all reads to the Aplysia rRNA annotation with the STAR aligner (parameters described below) and discarding reads that aligned to the rRNA annotation. Therefore, downstream analysis did not contain rRNA reads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Mapping reads to the genome and differential expression analysis</title><p id="Par37">Aplysia exon information (ref_AplCal3.0_gnomon_scaffolds.gff3) and genome annotation (version AplCal3.0 from July, 2015), from the NCBI ftp server database, were used for genomic mapping.

Genome index files for use with STAR were generated using the --runMode genomeGenerate option using both the Aplysia AplCal3.0 genome and the ref_AplCal3.0_gnomon_scaffolds.gff3 transcript annotation. Quality controlled reads were aligned using the STAR aligner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The --quantMode Genecounts option was utilized to count the number of reads uniquely mapping to each transcript using the HTSeq-count program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Data were normalized using the regularized log transformation for principal component analysis (PCA).</p><p id="Par39">Of the top 50 most significantly DE genes, 17 were classified as uncharacterized proteins. Each uncharacterized protein was analyzed in a BLAST search against human proteins and for conserved domains in InterPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to attempt to annotate these genes. Three genes were annotated in this way: CCAP1, DNA ligase-like, and glycine N-acyltransferase-like.

This allowed for mapping of DE genes to the better-studied and annotated human GO pathways. For each gene, GO annotation terms with E-value&#8804;1.0E-6 were used in downstream enrichment analysis. This process was repeated for the full Aplysia transcriptome as a reference set for enrichment analysis.</p><p id="Par41">GO terms of protein translations from DE transcripts were tested against the reference set of GO terms for the full Aplysia genome annotation to test for biological processes and molecular functions that were over-represented (enriched) in the DE proteins.

Functional analysis in IPA was conducted using the core analysis feature to identify the pathways most affected during aging. For the confidence parameter, only experimentally observed relationships were used. This analysis also calculated directionality from log-fold changes to identify pathways that are up or down regulated via a z-score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>qPCR validation of selected genes</title><p id="Par43">qPCR was used to verify the expression status of selected genes identified from the RNASeq analysis.

Four animals at M and four animals at AII, thus 8 total animals, were tested for righting and TWR, then sacrificed for RNA extraction as previously described for RNASeq. RNA was quantified on a Nanodrop (model ND-1000), and 100&#160;ng of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System with random hexamer primers (Invitrogen).

Thus, it was unsurprising that aging of PVC neurons exhibited bidirectional changes in gene expression, with ~&#8201;55% of DE genes displaying increased expression in AII. This is approximately the same percentage of genes up regulated in the R15 bursting neuron of the Aplysia abdominal ganglion during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">The AII animals used for RNASeq in this experiment showed significant behavioral deficits in TWR compared to M animals. Reduced excitability of PVC sensory neurons to both tail taps and intracellular current injection has been proposed to significantly contribute to reduced TWR in AII Aplysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. GO analysis showed DE of genes and gene ontology categories that would coincide with the reduced excitation observed in aged PVC neurons compared to mature. Ion channel associated GO categories were among the most significantly enriched categories in Blast2GO. When ion channel categories were combined, 65 out of the 425 identified genes exhibited altered expression in AII, with 82% of the 65 genes downregulated, suggesting reduced function with age. Ten DE ion channel associated genes encode for voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup>&#160;and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel proteins, all of which were downregulated in AII. The loss of functional gated K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may be a crucial molecular mechanism underlying reduced excitability previously demonstrated in AII PVC neurons, leading to subsequent declines in TWR during aging. Reduced excitability during aging has been described in many other parts of the Aplysia nervous system as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and is correlated with memory declines in the aging mammalian hippocampus and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Three iGluR subunits, GluR2, GluR3, belonging to the AMPA subtype, and KA2, a kainate subunit, showed significantly reduced expression in AII PVC neurons compared to M via RNASeq. This suggests reduced L-Glu current amplitude in AII PVC sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] may be due to decreased expression of iGluR. However, the differentially expressed subunits were not highly expressed. The most highly expressed subunits (Grin1, GluR5, and GluR7) were not DE. Therefore, reduced L-Glu current amplitude in AII PVC sensory neurons may be due to aging changes at the protein level, for example, in PKA or PKC-mediated modulation of iGluR currents.</p><p id="Par67">IPA identified aging-related decreases in both CREB signaling and PKA signaling, which play large roles in learning and memory and maintenance of iGluR signaling via receptor phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], respectively. The adenylate cyclase gene also had decreased expression. Its activation of PKA phosphorylates CREB, to increase synaptic strength by inducing the transcription of many genes necessary for facilitation. All would likely be impaired by the reduced expression of these genes observed in aging, and are consistent with impaired learning and memory, as well as neurophysiology, noted in aged Aplysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Stress response is an evolutionarily conserved feature of aging, occurring in countless species from roundworms to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and has previously been noted in Aplysia abdominal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging results in oxidative damage that induces DNA mutations detrimental to cell survival, including altering the structure and function of many macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and repressed transcription of neuronal genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Oxidation of ion channels due to ROS is wide spread during aging, and can modulate functional changes in voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to bind DNA promoters and increase transcription of stress response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) also were predicted by IPA, another inducer of stress response that is implicated to promote brain aging via such diverse actions such as inhibition of cell proliferation, DNA damage, apoptosis, aggravation of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, neurotoxicity, and impaired cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Additional genes with increased expression in AII PVC neurons that have been implicated in stress, chemoprotection, and cell survival include heat shock proteins, major vault protein, and multi-drug resistance protein.

Increased expression of these genes in AII PVC neurons may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain proper homeostasis by preventing ROS and other oxidative damage accumulated during aging.</p><p id="Par71">Another important neuronal pathway with increased activity during aging was nerve growth factor signaling. NGF signaling includes processes necessary to maintain proper neuronal function and maintenance of neural connections, further suggesting altered neural function occurs in aged sensory neurons of Aplysia.

Huntingtin is a protein critical for induction of learning in Aplysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and expression of mutant huntingtin induced neurological deficits in Huntington&#8217;s disease mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
