In this study, we determined the genetic mechanism underlying fluorescent polymorphisms in <italic>A. digitifera</italic>. Using a high-throughput sequencing approach, we found that <italic>FP</italic> gene sequences in <italic>FP</italic> multigene family exhibit presence&#8211;absence polymorphism among individuals. A few particular sequences in short-to-middle wavelength emission and middle-to-long wavelength emission clades were highly expressed in adults, and different sequences were highly expressed in larvae. These highly expressed sequences were absent in the genomes of individuals with low total <italic>FP</italic> gene expression. In adults, presence&#8211;absence differences of the highly expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences were consistent with measurements of emission spectra of corals, suggesting that presence&#8211;absence polymorphisms of these <italic>FP</italic> sequences contributed to the fluorescent polymorphisms. The functions of recombinant FPs encoded by highly expressed sequences in adult and larval stages were different, suggesting that expression of <italic>FP</italic> sequences with different functions may depend on the life-stage of <italic>A. digitifera</italic>. Highly expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences exhibited presence&#8211;absence polymorphisms in subpopulations of <italic>A. digitifera</italic>, suggesting that presence&#8211;absence status is maintained during the evolution of <italic>A. digitifera</italic> subpopulations. The difference in FPs between adults and larvae and the polymorphisms of highly expressed <italic>FP</italic> genes may provide key insight into the biological roles of FPs in corals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>reef-building corals</kwd><kwd>copy number variation</kwd><kwd>multigene family</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">SOKENDAI</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Center for the Promotion of Integrated Sciences</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reef-building corals (Scleractinia) show diverse coloration (<xref rid="evy122-B17" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et&#160;al. 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that fluorescence is a major determinant of color in corals (<xref rid="evy122-B7" ref-type="bibr">Dove et&#160;al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B12" ref-type="bibr">Kelmanson and Matz 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B21" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et&#160;al. 2007</xref>). The sources of fluorescence in corals are fluorescent proteins (FPs), which emit visible light, and chlorophyll-a from symbiotic dinoflagellate algae, which emit near infrared light (<xref rid="evy122-B20" ref-type="bibr">Moisan and Mitchell 2001</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B18" ref-type="bibr">Mazel and Fuchs 2003</xref>). FPs are excited by environmental light and emit a longer wavelength than the excitation spectrum (<xref rid="evy122-B11" ref-type="bibr">Johnsen 2012</xref>). The color of an FP is determined by its amino acid sequence (<xref rid="evy122-B8" ref-type="bibr">Field et&#160;al. 2006</xref>). The center of the region determining light emission in FPs comprises the tripeptide &#8220;&#8211;X&#8211;Y&#8211;G&#8211;&#8221; (termed a chromophore), where the first peptide X varies among FPs (<xref rid="evy122-B10" ref-type="bibr">Henderson and Remington 2005</xref>). Based on the emission spectra, FPs are classified into four groups: cyan (CFP), green (GFP), yellow (YFP), and red (RFP) (<xref rid="evy122-B15" ref-type="bibr">Labas et&#160;al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alieva et&#160;al. 2008</xref>). Nonfluorescent chromoprotein (CP) is also classified as an <italic>FP</italic> gene family member based on its amino acid sequence similarity (<xref rid="evy122-B15" ref-type="bibr">Labas et&#160;al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>FP</italic> genes show signatures of diversifying selection, suggesting that FPs with different spectral ranges may have distinct roles in corals (<xref rid="evy122-B8" ref-type="bibr">Field et&#160;al. 2006</xref>). Although many biological roles of FPs have been predicted, the biological roles of FPs with different spectral properties remain unclear. Originally, a photo-protective role of FPs was proposed (<xref rid="evy122-B27" ref-type="bibr">Salih et&#160;al. 2000</xref>), and roles in photo-protection in algal symbionts have subsequently been proposed for RFP (<xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>) and CP (<xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). An antioxidant role has been suggested for CFP, GFP, RFP, and CP; however, FP mutants lacking a chromophore show greater antioxidant activity than that of wild-type FP (<xref rid="evy122-B22" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et&#160;al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Acropora</italic> is one of the most abundant coral genera in coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region (<xref rid="evy122-B34" ref-type="bibr">Veron 2000</xref>) and the whole genome of <italic>Acropora digitifera</italic> has been decoded (<xref rid="evy122-B28" ref-type="bibr">Shinzato et&#160;al. 2011</xref>). The natural variation of FPs provides an opportunity to analyze the biological role of FPs. FP-mediated color polymorphisms within <italic>Acropora</italic> species have been reported. For example, the photo-inhibitory effect is thought to be substantially weaker in <italic>Acropora palifera</italic> individuals with the fluorescent phenotype than in those with the nonfluorescent phenotype (<xref rid="evy122-B27" ref-type="bibr">Salih et&#160;al. 2000</xref>). <italic>A. aspera</italic> with the blue phenotype is less sensitive to changes in light than <italic>A. aspera</italic> with the light blue or cream phenotype at normal temperatures, but <italic>A. aspera</italic> with the blue phenotype is more sensitive to increases in temperature (<xref rid="evy122-B6" ref-type="bibr">Dove 2004</xref>). In <italic>A. nobilis</italic>, individuals with the blue phenotype show greater zooxanthellae and photosynthetic pigment concentrations than those of individuals with the brown phenotype (<xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). In <italic>A. valida</italic>, individuals with the purple phenotype show a weaker photo-inhibitory effect than individuals with the brown phenotype (<xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). In vitro analyses have demonstrated that CP affects the algal chlorophyll excitation spectrum, supporting a role for CP in the photo-protection of zooxanthellae (<xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). However, CP expression is not vital for shallow-water corals, as evidenced by the adjacent growth of individuals with different color phenotypes in a shallow-water reef (<xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>). In <italic>A. millepora</italic>, a fluorescence polymorphism has been observed in both larval and adult stages (<xref rid="evy122-B13" ref-type="bibr">Kenkel et&#160;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B32" ref-type="bibr">Strader et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). Redder <italic>A. millepora</italic> larvae exhibit diapause-like physiological characteristics and are less responsive to settlement cues than greener larvae, suggesting that red fluorescence might be a marker of long-range larval dispersal (<xref rid="evy122-B13" ref-type="bibr">Kenkel et&#160;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B32" ref-type="bibr">Strader et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). Adult <italic>A. millepora</italic> exhibit high, medium, and low redness levels under the same light levels in shallow water, and the expression levels of RFP are correlated with reduced photo-damage of zooxanthellae under light stress (<xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). These expression levels are correlated with the number of particular <italic>RFP</italic> sequences with a particular promoter type (<xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). Although color polymorphisms mediated by different FPs have been reported in many <italic>Acropora</italic> species, the genetic differences have only been analyzed for <italic>RFP</italic> sequences in <italic>A. millepora</italic>.</p><p>Several <italic>FP</italic> sequences have been reported for a single species in the genus <italic>Acropora</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alieva et&#160;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B2" ref-type="bibr">D&#8217;Angelo et&#160;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). In <italic>A. digitifera</italic>, the <italic>FP</italic> multigene family has been comprehensively described. More than 30 <italic>FP</italic> gene copies per individual have been reported in <italic>A. digitifera</italic>, and these copies can be separated into short-/middle-wavelength emission (S/MWE including CFP and GFP), middle-/long-wavelength emission (M/LWE including GFP and RFP), and chromoprotein (CP) clades (<xref rid="evy122-B33" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi-Kariyazono et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). All known FPs from <italic>Acropora</italic> species belong to one of these three clades in the <italic>FP</italic> multigene family (<xref rid="evy122-B33" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi-Kariyazono et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). Although <italic>FP</italic> gene copy numbers and several <italic>FP</italic> sequences have been reported in <italic>A. digitifera</italic>, the sequences in this family have not been comprehensively identified. It is necessary to determine all <italic>FP</italic> gene sequences in each individual to understand the genetic basis of fluorescence polymorphisms and the biological roles of FPs.</p><p>In this study, we focused on exon 3 of the <italic>FP</italic> gene, because it is the longest exon and contains nucleotides coding for a chromophore.

The e3 contigs in which at least two reads covered the full length were identified as e3 sequences, those containing insertions or deletions that cause frameshifts and/or premature stop codons were regarded as pseudogene (pseudo-e3) sequences. Among all e3 sequences isolated from 11 individuals, identical sequences were removed. The phylogenetic tree of e3 sequences was constructed using the maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter mode with gamma distributed rates and invariant sites using MEGA ver. 7 (<xref rid="evy122-B14" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#160;al. 2016</xref>).

Short DNA sequences (paired-end, 125&#8201;bp) were determined from these three and from the DNA libraries of eight <italic>A. digitifera</italic> samples (sample ID: S1602, S1604&#8211;5, S1607&#8211;8, and S1610&#8211;S1612) described under Materials and Methods (DNA extraction and preparation of DNA libraries for hybridization) by the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. The nucleotide sequences were deposited in the DDBJ Sequenced Read Archive under accession numbers DRR108003&#8211;DRR108012 and DRR108024. To verify for the absence of the highly expressed sequences in the genomes of individuals in which these sequences were not isolated, short reads from the genomes of each individual were mapped to all isolated e3 sequences. Short DNA reads showing similarity (100%) with 80% read lengths were mapped to e3 sequences using CLC Genomics Workbench. When the full length of e3 was covered, with at least one coverage without any mismatches, the e3 sequence was regarded as positive in the genome of the individual. When any reads mapped to the e3 without any mismatches, the e3 sequence was regarded as negative in the genome of the individual. If a few or several reads were mapped to e3, but the full length of e3 was not covered, the e3 sequences were classified by the second mapping condition. The second mapping was performed under the same criteria as the moderate mapping condition (similarity 100% with 40% of read length) using the same short DNA reads and e3 sequences. When the full length of e3 was covered without any mismatches under the moderate mapping condition, the e3 sequence was regarded as positive.

This natural variation raises questions about the importance of FPs for photo-protection. To address this question, it is necessary to determine the mechanism that generates the intraspecific fluorescence polymorphism.</p><p>The expression of <italic>FP</italic> genes in adult <italic>Acropora</italic> individuals is influenced by external stimuli, such as light, heat, and injury.

Heat stress down-regulates GFP (<xref rid="evy122-B24" ref-type="bibr">Roth and Deheyn 2013</xref>). The expression of CFP increases in response to injury (<xref rid="evy122-B3" ref-type="bibr">D&#8217;Angelo et&#160;al. 2012</xref>). However, these factors cannot explain variation in fluorescence in corals living in the same environment, without injury.</p><p>Previously, we reported variation in the sequences and total copy number of particular <italic>FP</italic> genes in <italic>A. digitifera</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B33" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi-Kariyazono et&#160;al. 2016</xref>); therefore, we analyzed copy number variation in 11 adult individuals of <italic>A. digitifera</italic>, living in the same light environment in shallow water. We detected copy number variation for <italic>FP</italic> genes from each of three clades (S/MWE, M/LWE, and CP). The numbers of e3 sequences and the e3 sequence repertories in each of three clades also differed among individuals. The numbers of e3 sequences were generally higher than the estimated gene copy numbers in the S/MWE and CP clades, suggesting that <italic>FP</italic> genes in these clades exhibit high allelic diversity. Hence, there were large genetic differences in <italic>FP</italic> genes in each of two clades among individuals of <italic>A. digitifera</italic>.</p><p>In each of three clades, we detected variation in the total expression levels of <italic>FP</italic> genes among 11 adult individuals. In the S/MWE clade, one sequence (<italic>S/Me3_a_hi1</italic>) showed a presence&#8211;absence polymorphism, and high expression of this sequence contributed to the total expression levels in the individuals with the top three overall expression levels of <italic>FP</italic> sequences in the S/MWE clade. In this clade, four individuals possessed <italic>S/Me3_a_hi1</italic>, but the expression levels were lower than those of the other three individuals with high expression. This lower expression may be due to differences in gene regulation or promotor sequence differences. In the M/LWE clade DYG-type, expression differences among 11 adult individuals were explained by the expression of one sequence (<italic>M/L-De3_a</italic>) in three individuals that possessed this sequence. These results suggest that particular <italic>FP</italic> sequences contribute to differences in total <italic>FP</italic> gene expression among individuals. In the CP clade, we did not observe a highly expressed sequence in adult samples. A comparative analysis of the emission spectra and expression of <italic>FP</italic> sequences indicated that fluorescence emission and nonemission of corals were consistent with high expression of <italic>S/Me3_a_hi1</italic> and the absence of <italic>S/Me3_a_hi1</italic> in the genome, respectively.

<italic>FP</italic> Gene Expression Differences between Adults and Larvae</title><p>The overall expression of <italic>FP</italic> genes in each clade differed substantially between adults and larvae, especially for both DYD- and TYG-type in the M/LWE clade and in the CP clade. High expression of the M/LWE clade in larvae was consistent with the high proportion of RFP in the larval transcriptome of <italic>A. millepora</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B19" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et&#160;al. 2011</xref>). These results suggest that FPs in the M/LWE and CP clades have important roles in larvae. However, several adult individuals did not possess the <italic>FP</italic> sequences with high expression in larvae in the M/LWE and CP clades. This result suggests that the individuals without highly expressed sequences in larvae did not express these sequences when they were larvae. In other words, the intensity of fluorescence and the expression of <italic>FP</italic> genes by highly expressed sequences might be different among larvae. Indeed, a difference in fluorescence has been reported among larvae of <italic>A. millepora</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B13" ref-type="bibr">Kenkel et&#160;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B32" ref-type="bibr">Strader et&#160;al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the S/MWE clade, the expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences were different between adults and larvae. In the S/MWE clade, the FP sequence with high expression in larval stage was absent in several adult individuals, suggesting that the expression of this <italic>FP</italic> gene might differ among larval individuals. Hence, the expression of FPs was different between adults and larvae.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothetical Biological Roles of FPs in <italic>A. digitifera</italic></title><p>The biological roles of FPs have been proposed based on natural variation in fluorescence in corals (<xref rid="evy122-B27" ref-type="bibr">Salih et&#160;al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). However, observed fluorescence variation can be explained by genetic differences or by differences in the regulation of gene expression among individuals. In this study, we demonstrated <italic>FP</italic> genetic variation among individuals of <italic>A. digitifera</italic>. Based on genetic differences, it was possible to separate individuals into different groups. Therefore, we examined two proposed biological roles of FPs using genetic differences and RNA-seq data containing reads from algal symbionts.</p><p>FPs in adult <italic>Acropora</italic> species have a proposed role in the photo-protection of algal symbionts (<xref rid="evy122-B27" ref-type="bibr">Salih et&#160;al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B31" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#160;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B9" ref-type="bibr">Gittins et&#160;al. 2015</xref>). A supportive role in photosynthesis by algal symbionts has also been proposed (<xref rid="evy122-B27" ref-type="bibr">Salih et&#160;al. 2000</xref>). These two biological roles predict that algal photosynthesis for individuals with high <italic>FP</italic> gene expression is more active than that for individuals with very low expression. In cultured symbiotic algae (genus <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>), up-regulation of a transcript encoding intrinsic membrane-bound light harvesting proteins is caused by the high intensity of light illumination, although most of transcripts encoding genes related to photosynthesis did not show light intensity-regulated expression (<xref rid="evy122-B35" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et&#160;al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>We compared the expression of symbiotic algae within a coral host (<italic>in hospite)</italic> with respect to the presence and absence of highly expressed genes in the S/MWE and M/LWE (TYG- and DYG-type) clades in their genomes. In the case of CP, the groups were categorized by their expression values. In comparisons of S/MWE, M/LWE DYG-type, and CP clades, no gene related to algal photosynthesis showed differential expression, suggesting that <italic>FP</italic> gene expression in the S/MWE, M/LWE DYG-type, and CP clades observed in this study did not have strong effects on transcriptional regulatory processes of genes related to algal photosynthesis. A contig annotated as cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 4 was significantly more highly expressed (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 with FDR correction) in individuals without M/LWE TYG-type expression than in individuals with M/LWE TYG-type expression. However, genes encoding the other subunits of cytochrome b6-f complex did not show differential expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Therefore, we could not conclude the effects of M/LWE TYG-type on algal photosynthesis based on the differential expression of only one subunit of the cytochrome b6-f complex. In this study, we only studied 11 individuals; thus, it is possible that RNA-seq analysis with larger data sets might detect some more subtle differences.</p><p>One finding in our study was that there was a difference in FP function between adults and larvae. Adult individuals with fluorescence emission mainly expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences of the S/MWE clade excited by short wavelength light, including UV light, and emitted fluorescence with a peak under 490&#8201;nm. Larvae mainly expressed <italic>FP</italic> genes in the S/MWE clade excited by short wavelength light (visible light, no UV) and emitted fluorescence with a peak at a longer wavelength (519&#8201;nm). Among the FP recombinants that we analyzed, both the excitation and emission spectra of larval FPs had longer wavelengths than those of adult FPs. The same shift in fluorescence has been observed in <italic>Seriatopora hystrix</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B25" ref-type="bibr">Roth et&#160;al. 2013</xref>), suggesting that FPs may have similar roles in adults and larvae of distantly related coral species. In addition to the S/MWE clade, larvae mainly expressed <italic>FP</italic> genes in the M/LWE and CP clades. The excitation and emission wavelengths were middle (TYG-type) and long (DYG-type) in the M/LWE clade. CPs absorbed long wavelength light. In summary, it is possible to hypothesized that adults utilized UV to short wavelength light and larvae utilized middle to long wavelength light via FPs, based on the functions of the highly expressed sequences in adults and larvae. These different light usages may provide insight into the biological roles of FPs.</p><p>The other key feature of <italic>FP</italic> genes in <italic>A. digitifera</italic> was the pattern of polymorphisms. The highly expressed sequences (<italic>S/Me3_a_hi</italic>1 and <italic>M/L-De3_a)</italic> in adults from the S/MWE and M/LWE clades were presence&#8211;absence polymorphisms in three <italic>A. digitifera</italic> subpopulations in the southern Ryukyu Archipelago with one exception, <italic>M/L-De3_a</italic>, in Yeyama-North. In addition, two highly expressed sequences in larvae from the M/LWE clade were presence&#8211;absence polymorphisms in all subpopulations, and polymorphisms in fluorescence in larvae were predicted. These polymorphisms suggest that the presence&#8211;absence status of highly expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences has been maintained in <italic>A. digitifera</italic> subpopulations, at least in the southern Ryukyu Archipelago. In other words, the presence and absence of fluorescence emission in adults (short wavelengths) and in larvae (middle to long wavelengths) has persisted throughout the evolution of <italic>A. digitifera</italic> subpopulations. This polymorphic status may be beneficial for the survival of immobile adult corals in various environments, for example, different light conditions, depths, currents, and attached substrates. In larvae, the polymorphic status may be beneficial for different dispersal distances, as suggested in <italic>A. millepora</italic> (<xref rid="evy122-B13" ref-type="bibr">Kenkel et&#160;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy122-B32" ref-type="bibr">Strader et&#160;al. 2016</xref>). In summary, the presence&#8211;absence polymorphisms of highly expressed <italic>FP</italic> sequences were a notable feature and will be key to unraveling the biological roles of FPs in corals.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the genetic basis of differences in fluorescence among individuals in <italic>A. digitifera.</italic> Comparisons between <italic>FP</italic> genotypes and the habitats or external environments of corals will provide a basis for understanding the biological roles of FPs in corals in the near future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
