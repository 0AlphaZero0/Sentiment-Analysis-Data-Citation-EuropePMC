a random assignment rate set at 50% per arm. This study was performed at the
Laboratory of the Integrated Research-Assistance Programme (Pipa), Anna Nery School
of Nursing, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (EEAN/UFRJ), the coordinating
center of the study; and at the family health units linked to the Municipal Health
Secretariats of the city of Maric&#225;, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and the city of
Vit&#243;ria, in the State of Esp&#237;rito Santo. This study was funded by the Ministry of
Science, Technology and Innovation/National Council for Scientific and Technological
Development/Ministry of Health (MCTI/CNPq/MS), Public Notice number 007/2013, of the
Unified Health System (SUS), specific for studies using integrative and
complementary health practices, contributing to the displacement of the research
team and for the purchase of equipment and inputs for the development of this
study.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on the results of the meta-analysis on the
subject<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>, which found a difference of 5.72&#177;14.1 in BP values after the application of
AP protocols, with a 95% confidence level and 80% power.</p><p>The sample consisted of 102 participants with SAH, regardless of hypertension stage,
of both sexes, who met the following inclusion criteria: age between 30 and 75
years, undergoing drug treatment for SAH for a year or more, with difficulty to
control blood pressure and maintaining the readings performed by health
professionals in the clinic above 140x90 mmHg. Patients with physical activity
habits or on weight loss diets, patients undergoing treatment with integrative and
complementary health practices (acupuncture, Reiki, auriculotherapy, yoga,
meditation, among others) were excluded. Patients with upper or lower limb
amputations or amputations in areas located at acupuncture points, patients with
cardiovascular complications or lesions in target organs due to hypertension or
ongoing oncologic diseases, smokers, alcoholics and pregnant women were also
excluded.</p><p>Nurses and other professionals from the health teams linked to the participating
centers performed the recruitment and selection of participants based on the
mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, and referred the patients cared for by
them to the research team. Once the criteria for inclusion in the study were met,
participants were referred to a nursing consultation with a nurse who was part of
the research team, trained to obtain and register the variable under analysis. This
professional provided guidance on the objectives of the study, risks, benefits,
probability of participant being included in the intervention or simulation arm,
through their expressed agreement. The participant then read and signed the Informed
Consent Form (ICF) with the appropriate explanations when necessary. At the end of
the consultation, each participant was given a registration number in the survey and
was referred to the random assignment carried out by another team member,
specifically designated to this purpose. </p><p>The random assignment was performed by block in a ratio of 1:1, using an outsourced
service for the random assignment through the internet
(http://www.sealedenvelope.com).</p><p>The number assigned to the participants was entered into the system that
automatically generated their assignment in one of the study arms, without the
interference of participants, ensuring equal and independent inclusion chances, that
is, both in Arm A - Intervention (acupuncture) and in Arm B - Control (simulation).
Only the research assistant responsible for the random assignment was not blinded,
being aware of the assignment groups of each participant and being responsible for
the confidentiality of the random assignment sequence, as well as the preparation of
the equipment for intervention and simulation throughout the study. Blinding of
participants, evaluator nurse responsible for the initial and final nursing
consultation, and acupuncturist nurse were ensured during the entire course of the
research process. For this purpose, an equipment was used that had the same physical
and structural characteristics of the equipment used for intervention, except for
the absence of the internal device emitting infrared laser. The random assignment
groups were revelead to the participants, the evaluator nurse and the acupuncturist
nurse only after completion of all research steps (initial assessment, intervention,
final assessment).</p><p>Nursing consultation and monitoring of blood pressure levels were carried out during
the entire period of the study for the operationalization of the nursing care of
participants in both arms. The nursing process guided the nursing consultations,
with Martha Elizabeth Rogers&#8217;s (1970) science of unitary human beings as theoretical
basis. At the end of the intervention period, all participants received guidelines
aimed at improving adherence to drug treatment, non-drug treatments (meditation,
yoga, acupuncture) and changes in lifestyle.</p><p>The same protocol was adopted for arms A and B, which was developed based on
systematic review studies and specific literature on acupuncture, taking into
account the inharmonic patterns related to SAH, according to the TCM/AP. All
participants, regardless of the assignment arm, underwent six non-needle
interventions, using only a gallium-aluminum-arsenide (Ga-Al-As) low-power infrared
laser-acupuncture equipment, with a Nogier frequency of 6 MW, for 24 minutes and an
interval of one week between the interventions. The selected acupoints, located in
the head (frontal and occipital regions), upper (hands and arms) and lower (feet)
limbs, received the direct application of the equipment on the skin. The order of
application, points, anatomical presentation and approach (unilateral or bilateral)
and the dwell time on each acupoint are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>The expected outcome was reducing SBP to levels below 140 mmHg and reducing DBP to
levels below 90 mmHg after six sessions. For this purpose, BP was measured before
and after each intervention, following a universal measurement protocol: sitting
position, 30-minute rest time before interventions, using the indirect oscillometric
method, with a precision digital monitor registered at the National Health
Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), at the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and
Technology (Inmetro), and recommended by the <italic>British Hypertension
Society</italic> (BHS). The results were entered into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, being under the responsability of the research assistant responsible
for the random assignment and subsequently exported to the statistical analysis
<italic>software</italic>.</p><p>Statistica<sup>&#174;</sup>
<italic>software</italic>, version 12.0, was used for data analysis. Descriptive and
association analyzes between variables were used, with a significance level set at
5% (p&lt;0.05). The normal distribution of variables was assessed by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S); the comparison between the results of the pre and
post-exposure blood pressure measurements was performed using the Student&#8217;s t-test
for paired samples and Anova was used to assess the different measurements of
systolic and diastolic pressures at each moment of the intervention.</p><p>The Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the Ana Nery School of Nursing/S&#227;o Francisco
de Assis Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro approved this study, with

December 2014, at the research-coordinating center and at the health units of the
participating center in the city of Vit&#243;ria, ES. At the participating center in the
city of Maric&#225;, RJ, recruitment was carried out from March to May 2015. The six-week
follow-up period took place following the recruitment phase, and the study was
completed in September 2015, due to the results. In that month, previous analyzes of
the data were performed and the results showed a significant difference between the
control and intervention arms. A power of around 100% was found for the sample in
the comparison between the moments in both arms. Based on these results, it was
decided to discontinue the study, not including any other participants.</p><p>Women comprised the majority of the sample, representing 66.7% (n=34) of the
participants assigned in arm A and 70.6% (n=36) in arm B. Males represented 33.3%
(n=17) of those assigned in arm A and 29.4% (n=15) in arm B.</p><p>The mean and median ages of participants were 55.4-53.5 years, respectively, for
women and 55.5-55.0 years for men.</p><p>The mean BP of study participants was 158.8 mmHg (Standard Deviation - SD=17.4) for
SBP and 95.8 mmHg (SD=7.7) for DBP, confirming the difficulty in controlling blood
pressure in the sample.</p><p>The length of drug treatment of participants was classified into three inclusion
ranges: from 1 to 4 years, 36.3% (n=37), from 5 to 10 years, 37.2% (n=38) and
from&gt;10 years, 26.5% (n=27).</p><p>The use of monotherapy for the treatment of blood pressure of participants was not
identified, with combination therapy being the predominant treatment method. The
most frequent medications used by participants in both groups were thiazide
diuretics (61.8%, n=63), angiotensin II receptor blockers (56.9%, n=58) and the
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (29.4%, n=30).</p><p>The association between angiotensin II receptor blockers and/or angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors and thiazide diuretics was identified in 72.5% (n=74)
of participants.</p><p>Throughout the study period, some participants did not attend the visits without
removal of their ICF, justifying the participants dropping out due to various
reasons such as the need for frequent travel, new job and change of address. This
resulted in loss of follow-up in both arms of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

totaling a loss of 22.3% (n=23).</p><p>There was a higher reduction of the sample among women in arm B (simulation), which
had a reduction of 33.3% (n=12) when compared to the same gender in arm A

considering 79 participants in total. On that occasion, 23 losses were observed in
total, which did not compromise the reliability of the results, as demonstrated by
the K-S test for normality, since the null hypothesis (p&gt;0.05) was not rejected
in the normal probability distribution.</p><p>Although six exposures were scheduled and performed in each arm, considering the
non-attendances, the median varied from 5 to 6 exposures, being more regular in arm
A, with an average of 5 exposures and SD=1.4&#177;1.3 for the sexes, respectively. These
results are summarized in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>

mmHg in the pre- and post-intervention moments. In arm A, significant differences
were observed in BP levels at different moments of observation, with a trend of
constant reduction, reaching a plateau of 128x80 mmHg (at moment 6 in the

efficacy in the acute control of BP in patients with difficulty controlling their
blood pressure levels. In the intervention arm, blood pressure dropped to levels
below 140x90 mmHg, which may contribute significantly to the non-aggravation of the
disease, as demonstrated in studies using other therapies for BP control<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The technique proposed in this study, combined with drug treatment strategies,
complemented the conventional treatment, confirming the potential of AP as an
integrative and complementary health therapy, not as a substitute or alternative
method to the current treatment models.</p><p>It is considered that nurses specialized in AP, by incorporating it as a nursing care
technology, may help hypertensive patients to effectively control their BP, since
its use helps to achieve the therapeutic goal for BP. This favors the minimization
of risks and comorbidities, since the effective control of BP levels helps reducing
cardiovascular risk, especially in non-diabetic hypertensive patients without renal
disease<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. It is believed that this may be related to the posture adopted by the
participants during the course of the research, by assuming a commitment with the
treatment, especially those with failures in the drug treatment due to low adherence
or forgetfulness. The care component, provided in the relationship between the
health and research team and the patient, may also have had an impact. </p><p>It seems reasonable to consider that the strengthening of the patient/health
professionals bond is favored because of the need for weekly attendance at the
health unit to perform the procedure. In addition, there has been a significant
increase in BP monitoring, making it possible the early recognition of the need for
adjustments in the medication doses and other non-drug interventions. This favors
health promotion and prevention of diseases on which nurses have a significant
contribution and participation, as observed in the conversations on arterial
hypertension that occurred throughout the study. </p><p>It should be noted that longitudinal effects, after discontinuation of therapy, have
not yet been addressed, which is a limiting factor of this research for generalizing
the results, a similar situation also found in other studies on the efficacy of the

group with predominance of SAH, without complications, undergoing the recommended
drug treatment, who do not participate in special programs of physical activity or
diets and with difficulty in controlling their blood pressure levels, may benefit
from this type of intervention. It is worth stressing that this clientele profile is
very common, especially in the area of basic health care.</p><p>Another relevant aspect is the use of protocols in health practices aimed at a single
and holistic care, as is the case of AP, inserted in the list of Integrative and
Complementary Health Practices (CIP). It is noteworthy that the adoption of
predefined terapy protocols with the use of AP in its different techniques is an
important limitation to be overcome, especially in clinical studies, given the need
to prove the efficacy of these techniques. </p><p>In this context, in order to overcome the aforementioned limitation and, at the same
time, contemplate the fundamental characteristics of the RTC method and the
theoretical-philosophical principles of the TCM/AP, the protocol elaborated in this
study was developed based on the human processes frequently affected in people with
SAH, according to the different interpretations of SAH by the TCM. Therefore, it is
inferred that the reasoning used for the development of this protocol has positively
favored the achievement of the results.</p><p>When participants with physical activity habits and on programmed diets for weight
loss were considered as exclusion criteria, a possible bias in the reduction of BP
produced by physical activity habits and weight loss was avoided. Similar strategies
were observed in clinical trials analyzed in systematic review studies that
investigated the use of AP for the treatment of SAH<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

nursing consultations and no significant changes were observed that could contribute
to BP alterations. The same reasoning was used for the exclusion of smokers and
alcoholics, considering that possible interruption of smoking and alcohol
consumption could interfere in the reduction of blood pressure levels.</p><p>The exclusion of the use of other CIP by participants during the intervention phase
was also considered in order to avoid possible bias, as the use of other CIP,
concomitant with drug treatment, may also influence the BP levels, just like LA<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

proposed therapy as the only CIP.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the difficulty in controlling participants&#8217;
lifestyles, the sample losses that occurred throughout the study related to personal
issues of participants, the non-measurement of responses to therapy in a longer time
interval and/or less regularity in the performance of the interventions, and the
effectiveness of the results achieved after therapy discontinuation. However, these
limitations did not compromise the quality of the study and the obtained
results.</p><p>Therefore, it is considered that the results observed here contribute to the
improvement of scientific knowledge in Nursing since they show a new therapeutic
possibility for intervention and care of people with arterial hypertension, to be
performed by acupuncturist nurses or recommended by non-acupuncturist nurses who
recognize this practice as a possible method for the care of their patients. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the results, it was possible to confirm the efficacy of the protocol. There
was an acute reduction and a significant BP control in all participants of arm A
during the intervention period, indicating the possibility of using this technology
in the care of hypertensive patients. In order to further deepen and better
understand the results of the protocol in a long term, as well as the improvement of
BP levels after its discontinuation and other clinical benefits, it is recommended
that further studies be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p> Paper extracted from Doctoral Dissertation &#8220;Acupuncture as technology applied to
