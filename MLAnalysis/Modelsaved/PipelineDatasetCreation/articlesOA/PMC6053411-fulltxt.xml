In general, diatoms have higher growth rates than haptophytes, whereas haptophytes tend to have higher nutrient uptake affinity. However, precise linkages between their ecological traits and geographical distributions remain poorly understood. Herein, we examined the basin-scale variability of the abundance and taxonomic composition of these two phytoplankton groups across 35 sites in the Pacific Ocean using DNA metabarcoding. The diatom community was generally dominated by a few genera at each sample site, whereas the haptophyte community consisted of a large number of genera in most of the sites. The coexistence of various haptophyte genera might be achieved by diversification of their ecophysiological traits such as mixotrophy. On the other hand, the diatom community might experience greater inter-genus competition due to the rapid uptake of nutrients. Our data further supports the notion that their distinct ecological strategies underlie the emergence of contrasting diversity patterns of these phytoplankton groups in the central Pacific at a basin scale.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>JST | Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR11A5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24121004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The largest habitat on Earth is the pelagic region of the Pacific Ocean, which covers approximately half of the global ocean. Biological characterization of such large oceanic provinces is essential to assess the productivity and stability of marine ecosystems and to predict the anthropogenic effects on these systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The biogeography of phytoplankton is of primary interest because these organisms regulate the primary productivity of oceans, and therefore, the global nutrient cycles and fishery production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Numerous studies have examined the spatial contrasts in community composition and diversity of phytoplankton using field observations, satellite remote sensing, and ecological modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, most of these studies have assessed communities at the phylum or functional group level despite the large diversity of phytoplankton species. Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing (i.e., the next-generation sequencing; NGS) technologies now allow us to analyze a large number of samples in parallel at the DNA sequence level, and consequently, large-scale community data sets can be relatively easily generated at a finer scale than before. Using these technologies, global surveys of marine plankton (e.g., the <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans expedition) have revealed much higher diversity of phytoplankton than previously recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Among the oceanic phytoplankton groups, diatoms and haptophytes have been particularly well investigated. Diatoms are distributed ubiquitously in the aquatic environment and are thought to be responsible for approximately 40% of the total oceanic primary production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and particulate carbon exported to depth as part of the biological pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Haptophytes are also ubiquitous in the euphotic layers of the world oceans and are important contributors to marine primary production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. de Vargas <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> revealed that diatoms and haptophytes have particularly high richness in operational taxonomic units among phytoplankton groups using ribosomal DNA metabarcoding. It is also noted that diatoms and haptophytes are experiencing competitive interactions in natural environments, and the results of competition between the two algal groups can potentially influence the biogeochemical processes in the ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Despite the comparable importance of diatoms and haptophytes in biogeochemical and ecological processes, these phytoplankton probably adopt different strategies for growth. Ecologically, diatoms are generally <italic>r</italic>-strategists, characterized by rapid growth rates under suitable conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. By contrast, haptophytes are likely <italic>K</italic>-strategists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which are characterized by slow growth rates, although some species, such as <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> and <italic>Phaeocystis antarctica</italic>, can form blooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In general, <italic>r</italic>-selected taxa allocate larger proportion of resources to reproduction, whereas <italic>K</italic>-selected taxa allocate less resources to reproduction and more to other activities that ensure the survival of individuals, resulting in maintaining a constant population size. Consequently, the former have competitive advantage in changing (less stable) environments, whereas the latter favor habitats with a long durational stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">A clear separation of <italic>r</italic>- and <italic>K</italic>-tradeoffs between diatoms and haptophytes was also observed in a metatranscriptomic study in an oligotrophic ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, where diatoms were found to increase growth-related transcriptional activity with nutrient enrichments, whereas the activity of haptophytes was decreased. The difference in ecological strategies between diatoms and haptophytes may also affect their global distribution and diversity patterns. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined how the distinct ecological strategies contribute to the shaping of their biogeography on a large scale.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we conducted field sampling at 35 sites, covering a wide area of the central Pacific Ocean and the Bering and Chukchi Seas (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

These distribution patterns were consistent with those estimated on the basis of phytoplankton pigment signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It is known that the abundance of 18S rDNA fragment correlates significantly with the biovolume across a wide variety of eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, our results can be indicative of resource competition between diatoms and haptophytes. According to the theory of <italic>r-K</italic> selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, diatoms evolved as <italic>r</italic>-strategists, which specialize with maximum growth rates under nutrient-replete and highly disturbed environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This trait would enable diatoms to dominate in high-latitude ecosystems. To the south of 40&#176;N, the abundance of diatoms and haptophytes was relatively low, and the contribution of haptophytes tended to increase slightly. These regions are characterized by low macronutrient availability (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which is caused by strong stratification in the water column. Because haptophytes, especially in small cells, are generally expected to have higher affinity for nutrients (<italic>K</italic>-strategist)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, they might be more adapted to low nutrient and turbulent conditions.</p><p id="Par22">The latitudinal trend in the abundance of diatom and haptophyte was fairly consistent between the surface and DCM layers. In most of the stations, the DCM layers were found around the depth of euphotic layer, and those were usually deeper than the mixed layer depth (MLD) (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Additionally, a strong correlation was detected between the depths of the DCM and euphotic layers (Fig S7), whereas there was no significant correlation between the DCM depth and MLD. These results suggest that light availability was a key determinant for the DCM layer depths at a wider scale. However, the depths of the DCM layer were much shallower than those of the euphotic layer around the subarctic stations along the 170&#176;W transect (40&#176;&#8211;50&#176;N), and the chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> biomass in these regions were relatively low despite the high levels of nutrient availability. This suggests that the water masses at these stations would be characterized as high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters, likely because of the low availability of iron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, iron might be an important element for the competition of diatoms and haptophytes at the south of the Aleutian Islands, although iron data are unavailable in this study. Assuming that diatoms have higher Fe cellular quota and Fe half saturation constants than haptophytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, haptophytes may have a competitive advantage in low iron waters over diatoms (especially, the centric species). The different iron uptake can also explain the positive correlation observed with nitrate for haptophyte abundance but not for diatoms (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Additionally, the intracellular nitrate pools in diatoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> might mask the correlation between the abundance of diatoms and nitrate concentration in seawater. In other words, since there is a two-way feedback relationship between phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration, the lack of correlation with macronutrients could be due to the rapid nutrient uptake in diatoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Differential loss rates due to top-down zooplankton grazing or viral attack might also be an important factor affecting the relative abundance of diatoms and haptophytes.

Therefore, zooplankton grazing can significantly control the abundance and community composition of phytoplankton via selective feeding. There is also growing evidence suggesting that viral infection can control phytoplankton population size, although only limited studies have been reported to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Diatom assemblages in the Bering and Chukchi Seas (Groups D1, D5, and D6) were substantially different from those in the other study sites and consisted primarily of centric diatoms, such as <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira</italic> (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

An important source of nutrients for these regions is likely the nutrient-rich waters upwelled onto the Bering Sea shelf, which are transported through the Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea shelf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, it has been reported that most nutrients in this region are exhausted due to the phytoplankton bloom composed mainly of diatoms and haptophytes during late spring and early summer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

The ordinations of RDA in our study showed that the high latitude community groups, D1 and D5, were positively correlated with ammonia concentrations in both the surface and DCM layers, suggesting that regenerated nutrients contributed to the phytoplankton productivity.

At most of the sample sites, the diversity of diatoms was lower than that of haptophytes because diatom communities tended to be dominated by one or a few genera (i.e., lower evenness). The implication of this structure is that the most successful genera outcompeted the others due to intra-phylum competitive exclusion. It would also be caused by the ecophysiological traits of diatoms, which were developed to maximize their growth rates (i.e., <italic>r</italic>-strategists). For example, diatoms possess the efficient carbon fixation enzyme, Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), and carbon concentration mechanisms (CCMs) for higher CO<sub>2</sub> fixation capacity relative to other phytoplankton groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Another important trait for the success of diatoms is that large diatoms tend to have large vacuoles for the storage of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. As a consequence of these specializations, diatoms might have overlapping niches within a habitat with high water-column stability, which result in competitive exclusions within the group.</p><p id="Par30">In contrast to diatoms, the haptophyte diversity remained fairly constant at most of the stations regardless of the sampling depth. The high levels of diversity were attributed to the coexistence of various taxa (i.e., high genus level evenness) rather than to high phylogenetic richness. The cluster analysis also revealed that the community compositions of haptophytes were relatively stable across the sampled sites, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The diversity of haptophytes was negatively correlated with their biomass and nutrient concentrations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), suggesting that the haptophyte diversity might increase in low productive environments. Moreover, haptophytes are likely well-adapted to conditions of intermediate or low nutrient and turbulence (i.e., <italic>K</italic>-strategists)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Many haptophyte species have adopted a mixotrophic lifestyle, and they are responsible for a large proportion of bacterivory in the ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. According to a theoretical study, mixotrophy is beneficial in oligotrophic environments, whereas specialization as autotrophs and heterotrophs is advantageous over mixotrophs in eutrophic environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Furthermore, some coccolithophores adapt to various nutritional conditions by possessing a heteromorphic life cycle, in which they alternate between a motile haploid and a non-motile diploid stage based on whether the environment is nutrient-limited or nutrient-replete, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrated that diverse non-calcifying haptophyte genera specialized as <italic>K</italic>-strategists were largely responsible for the abundance and diversity of haptophyte assemblages in the open ocean, although ecological success of the non-calcifying haptophyte groups has been poorly documented. Therefore, haptophytes might access multiple niches by diversifying the mode of nutrition and other aspects of physiology to reduce intra- and inter-phylum competition, and consequently, various haptophytes coexist in an environment. Overall, our study suggests that the difference in the ecological traits between diatoms and haptophytes, previously demonstrated at individual and metabolic levels, significantly affects the biogeography and diversity patterns of these phytoplankton.</p><p id="Par31">The contrasting diversity pattern between diatoms and haptophytes changed in the subarctic and arctic regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Thus, preferential growth of various fast-growing diatom genera could contribute to the increased diversity. Similarly, higher diatom diversity was also observed around the equator, likely resulting from the nutrient enrichment by upwelling. On the other hand, the diversity of haptophytes decreased to some extent in the subarctic and polar ecosystems due to the preferential growth of specific genera, such as <italic>Phaeocystis</italic> and <italic>Gephyrocapsa</italic>/<italic>Emiliania</italic>.

The sequence regions between 18 and 270&#8201;bp for diatom libraries and between 18 and 440&#8201;bp for haptophyte libraries were used for downstream analysis.
