However, reports about glycosyltransferases (GTs) responsible for aurones glycosylation are limited. Here, the transcriptome-wide discovery and identification of an aurone glycosyltransferase with glycosidase activity is reported. Specifically, a complementary DNA (cDNA), designated as OsUGT1, was isolated from the plant <italic>Ornithogalum saundersiae</italic> based on transcriptome mining. Conserved domain (CD)-search speculated OsUGT1 as a flavonoid GT. Phylogenetically, OsUGT1 is clustered as the same phylogenetic group with a putative 5,6-dihydroxyindoline-2-carboxylic acid (<italic>cyclo</italic>-DOPA) 5-<italic>O</italic>-glucosyltransferase, suggesting OsUGT1 may be an aurone glycosyltransferase. The purified OsUGT1 was therefore used as a biocatalyst to incubate with the representative aurone sulfuretin. In vitro enzymatic analyses showed that OsUGT1 was able to catalyze sulfuretin to form corresponding monoglycosides, suggesting OsUGT1 was indeed an aurone glycosyltransferase. OsUGT1 was observed to be a flavonoid GT, specific for flavonoid substrates. Moreover, OsUGT1 was demonstrated to display transglucosylation activity, transferring glucosyl group to sulfuretin via <italic>o</italic>-Nitrophenyl-&#946;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (<italic>o</italic>NP-&#946;-Glc)-dependent fashion. In addition, OsUGT1-catalyzed hydrolysis was observed. This multifunctionality of OcUGT1 will broaden the application of OcUGT1 in glycosylation of aurones and other flavonoids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aurones</kwd><kwd>sulfuretin</kwd><kwd>glycosyltransferase</kwd><kwd><italic>Ornithogalum saundersiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-genes-09-00327"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Aurones, represented by sulfuretin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>, 1) and sulfurein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>, 1c), are minor tricyclic flavonoids that consist of a benzofuranone ring linked through a carbon-carbon double bond to a phenyl moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B1-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides lending flowers a bright yellow pigment, aurones function as phytoalexins against infections [<xref rid="B2-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Aurones distribute widely among the plant kingdom and two aurone types can be distinguished, 4-hydroxyaurones and 4-deoxyaurones [<xref rid="B1-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Aurones show a remarkable spectrum of biological activities, like antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities, making them interesting scaffolds for the design of potential therapeutic agents [<xref rid="B1-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, many efforts have been made for synthetic modifications of aurone scaffolds, such as glycosylation, hydroxylation and methoxylation [<xref rid="B1-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Among these modifications, glycosylation of aurones have attracted much interest because these resulting glycosylated aurones display enhanced and advantageous properties, like neuroprotective [<xref rid="B4-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antioxidant [<xref rid="B5-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="B10-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and leishmanicidal activities [<xref rid="B11-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Theoretically, glycosylations of aurones may be achieved by chemical or enzymatical syntheses. Chemical approaches generally require multiple protection and de-protection steps in order to achieve regio- and stereo-selectivity. Moreover, chemical glycosylations involve the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals, which may pose potential environmental and biological risks. For such reasons, glycosyltransferases (GTs)-catalyzed glycosylations become increasingly important enzymatic synthesis due to its high regio-selectivity without the need of any protecting groups. The enzymatic glucosylation of 4-deoxyaurones was firstly achieved by Halbwirth et al., 1997 [<xref rid="B12-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sulfuretin 6-glucoside, namely sulfurein (1c), was yielded after incubation of sulfuretin (1) with enzyme preparation from <italic>Coreopsis grandiflora</italic>. However, the biocatalyst used in this glucosylation reaction was enzyme extract of <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> but not a purified glucosyltransferase [<xref rid="B12-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sakakibara et al. provided a gene encoding an aurone glycosyltransferase with an activity of transferring a glycosyl group to an aurone [<xref rid="B13-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this aurone GT required expensive uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar as the sugar donor for glycosylations of aurones, which limited its extensive applications [<xref rid="B13-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Herein, the transcriptome-wide discovery and identification of an aurone glycosyltransferase OsUGT1 with glycosidase activity was described, which meant OsUGT1 was able to glycosylate aurones using either expensive UDP-sugars or the cheap alternatives as sugar donors. Specifically, a complementary DNA (cDNA), designated as OsUGT1, coding for an aurone GT was firstly isolated from <italic>Ornithogalum saundersiae</italic> based on transcriptome mining. The recombinant OsUGT1 was then determined to have the ability to glucosylate sulfuretin (1) to form three monoglucosides using UDP-<sc>d-</sc>glucose (UDP-Glc) as a sugar donor. In addition, OsUGT1 displayed catalytic promiscuity, transferring sugar group to diverse flavonoids from UDP-Glc. Besides being a glycosyltransferase, OsUGT1 was demonstrated to display transglycosylase activity, forming sulfuretin glucosides using cheap aryl glycosides as sugar donor by transglycosylation. Moreover, OsUGT1-catalyzed hydrolysis activity was observable. This multifunctionality thus broadened the potential applications of OsUGT1 in glycosylation of aurones and other flavonoids. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-genes-09-00327"><title>2.

Together, we can basically speculate that OsUGT1 is a flavonoids glycosyltransferase based on the CD prediction results.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-genes-09-00327"><title>3.3. OsUGT1 was Clustered Phylogenetically to a New Group of Flavonoid Glycosyltransferases</title><p>Phylogenetic tree analysis is an effective means for functional prediction, enabling us to suggest a particular activity simply based on sequence information prior to exactly functional characterization of a new GT gene. Thirty GTs, including OsUGT1, were therefore used to build a phylogenetic tree that allowed the understanding of substrate specificities of OsUGT1. Firstly, these GTs were aligned by the Clustal X program. Subsequently, a neighbor-joining tree was derived from the multiple sequence alignment, using five sterol GTs as an outgroup. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, these GTs are divided into two distinct branches. Five sterol GTs are clustered into one branch, while other flavonoid GTs are clustered into another branch. This divergence may reflect the substrate difference of GTs contained in the two branches. OsUGT1 is clustered into the same group with flavonoid GTs, suggesting OsUGT1 may be a flavonoid GT. This notion is consistent with the prediction result of CD-search program (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figure S2</xref>). The flavonoid GTs were further divided into three distinct clusters, 3-<italic>O</italic>-G, 5-<italic>O</italic>-G and 7-<italic>O</italic>-G clusters based on their regioselectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). 3-<italic>O</italic>-G, 5-<italic>O</italic>-G and 7-<italic>O</italic>-G groups include the enzymes preferably catalyzing glycosylation at the C-3, C-5 and C-7 positions of flavonoids, respectively. OsUGT1 is clustered to 7-<italic>O</italic>-G group, suggesting that OsUGT1 may attack the hydroxyl group at C-7 position of flavonoids. On the other hand, OsUGT1 is clustered as the same phylogenetic group with a putative 5,6-dihydroxyindoline-2-carboxylic acid (<italic>cyclo</italic>-DOPA) 5-<italic>O</italic>-glucosyltransferase (KP174811.1), suggesting OsUGT1 may act on the flavonoids showing similar structure with <italic>cyclo</italic>-DOPA [<xref rid="B26-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. <italic>Cyclo</italic>-DOPA has a bicyclic structure consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). In flavonoids, aurones have a skeleton similar to <italic>cyclo</italic>-DOPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Cumulatively, we inferred that OsUGT1 was likely to be able to glycosylate aurones. Thus, the representative aurone sulfuretin (1) was selected as the substrate to incubate with the purified OsUGT1 for exactly functional characterization.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-genes-09-00327"><title>3.4.

OsUGT1 is an Aurone Glycosyltransferase</title><p>To verify this speculation that OsUGT1 may be an aurone glycosyltransferase, a representative aurone sulfuretin (1) was used as the sugar acceptor to react with the sugar donor UDP-Glc in the presence of the purified OsUGT1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the enzyme assay using purified OsUGT1 with sulfuretin (1) and UDP-Glc yielded three peaks, 1a, 1b and 1c.

The ultraviolet (UV) spectra of these three products were the same as that of sulfuretin (1), indicating that they had similar structural skeleton with that of sulfuretin (1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f004">Figure 4</xref>). These metabolites were collected and then subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.

To further clarify the exact structures of these metabolites, NMR analysis was carried out (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S5&#8211;S10</xref>).

The glucosyl moiety from the significantly downshifted signal of C-3&#8242; (<italic>&#948;</italic> 145.6) and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) between H-1&#8243; and C-3&#8242; (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figure S6</xref>), suggested that the <italic>O</italic>-glucose moiety was attached to C-3&#8242;. In the HMBC spectrum of compound 1b, long-range correlations between H-1&#8243; and C-4&#8242; (<italic>&#948;</italic> 147.4), demonstrated that the glucosyl group was located at C-4&#8242; (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figure S8</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, of the three newly formed sulfuretin glucosides, sulfuretin 4&#8242;-glucoside (1b) is a new compound [<xref rid="B1-genes-09-00327" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These data indicated that OsUGT1 had a broad regioselectivity, attaching sugar moiety to the hydroxyl group at C-3&#8242;, C-4&#8242; or C-6 position of sulfuretin (1). Overall, OsUGT1 was identified exactly to be an aurone glycosyltransferase, converting sulfuretin (1) to form three monoglycosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-genes-09-00327"><title>3.6.

OsUGT1-containing crude extract was used as a biocatalyst for glycosylation reaction due to its simple preparation. Each member of 41 compounds was incubated with UDP-Glc in the presence of 20 &#956;L OsUGT1-containing crude extract (derived from 1 mL cell). Of the 41 compounds, only 6 flavonoids, including luteolin (2) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S11 and S12</xref>), 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (3) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S13 and S14</xref>), 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (4) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S15 and S16</xref>), 6-hydroxyflavone (5) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S17 and S18</xref>) and 3,2&#8242;-dihydroxyflavone (6) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S19 and S20</xref>), were found to undergo measurable glucosylation with UDP-Glc. On the other hand, OsUGT1 displayed no observable activity towards other 35 compounds including 5-hydroxyflavone (7), anthraquinones (8), steroids (9&#8211;25), terpenoids (26&#8211;28), phenolic acids (29&#8211;33) and alkaloids (34&#8211;41). These data collectedly indicated OsUGT1 was a flavonoid glycosyltransferase specific for flavonoid acceptors.</p><p>Under the action of OcUGT1, luteolin (2) was glycosylated to form three glucosides (2a&#8211;2c). Mass spectrum analyses and their co-elution with standard on reverse HPLC revealed that these three products were luteolin 3&#8242;-glucoside (2a), 4&#8242;-glucoside (2b) and 7-glucoside (2c), respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figure S12</xref>). This result suggested that OsUGT1 preferred to attack the hydroxyl groups at C-3&#8242;, C-4&#8242; and C-7 positions but not C-5 position. This notion was further confirmed by the glucosylation results of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (4) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S15 and S16</xref>) and 5-hydroxyflavone (7). After incubated with the purified OsUGT1, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (4) was glucosylated to form one glucosylated product, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone 7-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside (4a). On the other hand, the incubation of 5-hydroxyflavone (7) with the purified OsUGT1 resulted in no any glucosylated products. Both indicated that OsUGT1 was able to attach sugar moiety to C-7 position but not C-5 position of flavones.</p><p>Also, OsUGT1 was able to glycosylate 3,2&#8242;-dihydroxyflavone (6) to form two corresponding monoglucosides (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S19 and S20</xref>). In addition, OsUGT1-catalyzed glucosylation of 6-hydroxyflavone (5) was observable (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-09-00327">Figures S17 and S18</xref>).

Hence, OsUGT1 was determined to be a flavonoid glycosyltransferase with broad regio-specificity, attaching sugars to C-2&#8242;, 3&#8242;, 4&#8242;, 3, 6 and 7 positions of flavonoids.</p><p>The sugar donor specificity of OsUGT1 was also investigated.

The transglycosylation capability of OsUGT1 on sulfuretin (1) and <italic>o</italic>NP-&#946;-Glc was firstly explored. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-09-00327-f006">Figure 6</xref>, when sulfuretin (1) was incubated with <italic>o</italic>NP-&#946;-Glc, an intermolecular transglucosylation occurred between sulfuretin (1) and <italic>o</italic>NP-&#946;-Glc.
