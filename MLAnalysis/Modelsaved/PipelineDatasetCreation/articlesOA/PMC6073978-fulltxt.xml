To date, the biosynthetic pathway of 20E, especially the downstream pathway, remains largely unknown. To identify candidate genes involved in 20E biosynthesis, the comparative transcriptome of <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> leaf and root was constructed. In total, 86.5 million clean reads were obtained and assembled into 79,835 unigenes, of which 39,425 unigenes were successfully annotated. The expression levels of 2427 unigenes were up-regualted in roots with a higher accumulation of 20E. Further assignments with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways identified 49 unigenes referring to the phytoecdysteroid backbone biosynthesis (including 15 mevalonate pathway genes, 15 non-mevalonate pathway genes, and 19 genes for the biosynthesis from farnesyl pyrophosphate to cholesterol). Moreover, higher expression levels of mevalonate pathway genes in roots of <italic>C. arachniodea</italic> were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Twenty unigenes encoding CYP450s were identified to be new candidate genes for the bioreaction from cholesterol to 20E. In addition, 90 transcription factors highly expressed in the roots and 15,315 unigenes containing 19,158 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified.

Rich phytoecdysteroids, including 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), dihydroxyrubrosterone, rubrosterone, poststerone, and cyanosterone B, were found in this plant [<xref rid="B1-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 20E was reported to have agricultural applications in enhancing the synchronous development of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, elevating silk yield [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and reducing the time of the molting cycle of <italic>Alpheus heterochelis</italic> [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 20E and its derivatives exhibited a wide variety of pharmacological effects, including anti-depression, antioxidation, anti-diabetes, and neuron protection [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 20E is primarily obtained from ecdysteroid-rich plants, such as <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic>, <italic>Ajuga turkestanica</italic>, and <italic>Serratula wolffi</italic> [<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Dried roots and aerial parts from <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> have been reported to contain 20E at 5.50% and 0.52%, respectively [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, due to the limitation of the wild resources for <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic>, the supply of 20E is in great shortage and its application is always restricted [<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Originally, the ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway has been described as a cytosolic pathway, starting from mevalonate (MVA) as a precursor [<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequently, it has been proven that isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) required for the triterpenoid synthesis can be produced not only from the MVA pathway in cytosol but also the 2-<italic>C</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids [<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the studies to date on phytoecdysteroid biosynthesis are limited to the parts mediated by the MVA pathway [<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In many plants, ecdysteroids were synthesized from cholesterol [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, Adler and Grebenok [<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] identified lathosterol as a precursor of 20E in spinach. It is obviously controversial whether cholesterol or lathosterol is the preferred substrate for phytoecdysteriod biosynthesis [<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conversion of a sterol to ecdysteroid requires several structural modifications, such as the hydroxylation of the sterol nucleus and side chain [<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In insects, cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (CYP450s), which catalyze the bioreaction from cholesterol to 20E, have been cloned and identified. However, only one CYP450 enzyme in plants has been identified to be involved in 20E biosynthesis in the hairy roots of <italic>Ajuga reptans</italic> [<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To date, the biosynthesis of 20E, especially the origin of the precursor IPP and its downstream pathway, remains largely unknown.</p><p>The accumulation of 20E in <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> was different among various tissues. Mu et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that the 20E content in roots was 4&#8211;20 times higher than that in leaves. Biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites are often tissue-specific [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Tom&#225;s et al. [<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the ecdysteroid content was related to organized structures of whole plants and in vitro propagated plantlets in <italic>A. reptans</italic>, while calluses from leaves or roots could not produce ecdysteroids [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The cultured plantlets of <italic>A. reptans</italic> produced seven ecdysteroids with the tissue differentiation. Tomas et al. has revealed that ecdysteroid production is root-specific in <italic>A. reptans</italic> [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In recent years, comparative transcriptome analysis has been applied to investigate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Yang et al. compared the transcriptome of leaves and roots from <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and identified candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of tanshinones [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Biosynthesis of withanolide A, a medicinal component synthesized specifically in roots of <italic>Withania somnifrea</italic>, was also investigated by comparative transcriptome analysis [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the important pharmacological value of 20E, there is little genetic information revealing the biosynthesis of 20E in <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic>. Thus, as a follow-up to our previous works on the biotechnological production of 20E [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and cloning of key enzyme genes in 20E biosynthesis [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of the leaves and roots of <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> to identify genes putatively involved in 20E biosynthesis. As we know, this study reported the de novo sequencing of <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> for the first time. Meanwhile, transcription factors (TFs), which have been found to regulate the secondary metabolism in plants, were also searched for in the transcriptome database. Furthermore, we provided valuable information for developing the important molecular marker of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). This study was designed to characterize the transcriptome of <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> and provide a valuable basis for further elucidating the biosynthetic pathway of 20E.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-19-01885"><title>2.

Identification of Unigenes Related to 20E Biosynthesis</title><p>20E is an isoprenoid-derived compound using five-carbon building units of IPP or its possible isomer, DMAPP, which can be synthesized by both the MVA and MEP pathway in plants. Previous reports showed that phytoecdysteroid biosynthesis is limited to parts mediated via the MVA pathway [<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> transcriptome, unigenes encoding all the known structural enzymes in the upstream pathways up to IPP were found, including 11 unigenes for six enzymes in the MVA pathway, 15 unigenes for seven enzymes in the MEP pathway, and four unigenes for isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) (Step 1 in <xref rid="ijms-19-01885-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01885-f002">Figure 2</xref>). According to the FPKM value, unigenes involved in the MVA pathway mostly showed higher expression levels in <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> roots, such as <italic>AACT</italic> (comp70319_c0_seq8), <italic>PMK</italic> (comp65552_c0_seq7), and <italic>PMD</italic> (comp59477_c0_seq1). On the contrary, unigenes involved in the MEP pathway had higher expression level in leaves, such as <italic>DXR</italic> (comp47417_c0_seq1, comp74054_c0_seq1), <italic>MCS</italic> (comp30840_c0_seq1), <italic>HDS</italic> (comp33211_c0_seq1, comp67980_c0_seq1), and <italic>HDR</italic> (comp73401_c0_seq1). Moreover, the expression profile of unigenes involved in the MVA and MEP pathways were validated through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01885-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Unigenes with the |relative expression level| &#8805; 2 were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-01885-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. The expression level of <italic>IDI</italic> was up-regulated 3.82-fold in roots. Expression of <italic>ACTT</italic> was up-regulated in roots by 3.80-fold. Additionally, unigenes encoding HMGR, HMGS, PKM, and PMD involved in the MVA pathway all had relative higher expression levels in <italic>C. arachniodea</italic> roots than in leaves.

Because 20E is highly accumulated in roots, the genes encoding enzymes involved in 20E biosynthesis are expected to show a root-preferential expression pattern.

In order to identify the possible involvement of CYP450s in 20E biosynthesis, up-regulated CYP450s unigenes in roots were selected from DEGs.

Furthermore, 90 TFs were up-regulated while 58 TFs were down-regulated in <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> roots. Among the up-regulated TFs, MYBranked the highest (15), followed by bHLH (13), and WRKY (10). In plants, TFs have been found to regulate secondary metabolism pathways [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, an ERF transcription factor named JRE4 stimulates the biosynthesis of steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs), cholesterol-derived metabolites, through activating the transcription of SGA biosynthetic genes, such as <italic>HMGS</italic>, <italic>HMGR</italic>, <italic>IDI</italic>, and <italic>SQS</italic> [<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Considering the root-preferential accumulation of 20E, these up-regulated TFs were worth further investigating for their function in 20E biosynthesis.</p><p>SSRs are one of the most important molecular markers and have various applications in genetics and plant breeding [<xref rid="B25-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, SSRs in <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> were analyzed in our present study. Out of 79,835 unigenes, 15,315 unigenes containing 19,158 SSRs were identified (<xref rid="ijms-19-01885-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Within these SSRs, 1194 SSRs presented in a compound formation. Mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant (14,598), followed by tri-nucleotide repeats (2270), and di-nucleotide repeats (2100). Penta-nucleotide repeats were the least (17). We also checked the SSRs in unigenes involved in 20E biosynthesis. Unigenes comp68996_c0_seq2 (<italic>HMGR</italic>) and comp63129_c0_seq5 (<italic>ERG26</italic>) contained compound SSRs. Comp71987_c0_seq5 encoding <italic>DXR</italic> had a di-nucleotide repeat. Additionally, the eight unigenes encoding AACT, HMGS, DXS, DXR, MCT, HDS, DHCR24, and EBP contained mononucleotide repeats. SSRs at different positions in a gene can help determine the regulation of gene expression and the function of the protein produced [<xref rid="B25-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sharopova [<xref rid="B26-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that genes containing five or more SSRs had the highest average level of expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In rice, amylase content was correlated with a variation in the number of SSRs in the 5&#8217;-untranslated region of the waxy gene [<xref rid="B27-ijms-19-01885" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These SSRs identified in the <italic>C. arachnoidea</italic> transcriptome were valuable genetic resources for future studies of this species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-19-01885"><title>3.

Conclusions</title><p>Our research established the transcriptome database of the important medicinal plant, <italic>C. arachniodea</italic>, for the first time. In total, 79,835 unigenes were assembled and 39,425 unigenes were successfully annotated. The comparative analysis of the <italic>C. arachniodea</italic> leaf and root transcriptome demonstrated that the expression levels of 2427 unigenes were up-regulated in roots with a higher accumulation of 20E. Forty-nine unigenes encoding enzymes in the MVA and MEP pathways and in the downstream of phytoecdysteroid backbone biosynthesis were identified. The higher expression levels of MVA pathway genes in roots of <italic>C. arachniodea</italic> implied that 20E biosynthesis could be mainly mediated by the MVA pathway. Moreover, twenty unigenes encoding CYP450s were identified to be the new candidate genes for the bioreaction from cholesterol to 20E. In addition, 90 TFs up-regulated in roots and molecular marker SSRs were analyzed for further research on gene regulation and plant breeding. Our work will be helpful in understanding phytoecdysteroid biosynthesis and providing important genetic information on <italic>C. arachniodea</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-19-01885"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/7/1885/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/7/1885/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-19-01885-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-19-01885-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>X.Y.L. and J.X. undertook experiments and transcriptomic analysis.
