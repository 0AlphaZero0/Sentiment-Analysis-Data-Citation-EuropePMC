Loss of Rbm24 in mice disrupts cardiac development by governing a large number of muscle-specific splicing events. Since Rbm24 knockout mice are embryonically lethal, the role of Rbm24 in the adult heart remained unexplored. Here, we used adeno-associated viruses (AAV9) to investigate the effect of increased Rbm24 levels in adult mouse heart. Using high-resolution microarrays, we found 893 differentially expressed genes and 1102 differential splicing events in 714 genes in hearts overexpressing Rbm24. We found splicing differences in cardiac genes, such as PDZ and Lim domain 5, Phospholamban, and Titin, but did not find splicing differences in previously identified embryonic splicing targets of Rbm24, such as skNAC, &#945;NAC, and Coro6. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related and immune response genes. Moreover, we found increased expression of Tgf&#946;-signaling genes, suggesting enhanced Tgf&#946;-signaling in these hearts. Ultimately, this increased activation of cardiac fibroblasts, as evidenced by robust expression of Periostin in the heart, and induced extensive cardiac fibrosis. These results indicate that Rbm24 may function as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis, potentially through the regulation of Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2 expression.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>AMC PhD Fellowship</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-821.02.021</award-id><award-id>NWO-836.12.002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto</surname><given-names>Yigal M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Creemers</surname><given-names>Esther E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002996</institution-id><institution>Hartstichting (Dutch Heart Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CVON-ARENA-2011-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto</surname><given-names>Yigal M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Alternative splicing, a process to generate multiple mRNA transcripts from a single gene, underlies many developmental processes and can contribute to disease progression and severity in the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Several pivotal splicing factors, such as RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), RNA-binding motif protein 24 (RBM24) and Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1), have been identified in the heart, and we are only just beginning to understand the function of specific protein isoforms, induced by these splicing factors, for cardiac physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, mutations in RBM20 lead to an early onset dilated cardiomyopathy through missplicing of multiple cardiac genes such as Titin, CamkII&#948;, and RyR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. SF3B1 is an HIF-1&#945; driven splicing factor which is required for proper cardiac metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, cardiac-specific loss of SF3B1 protects against pathological hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction, due to splicing regulation of ketohexokinase, a key metabolic enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The RNA-binding protein Rbm24 is a critical regulator of cardiac lineage differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and heart development. It has recently been shown that Rbm24 is upregulated during cardiac differentiation of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, where it regulates alternative splicing of pluripotency and sarcomeric genes during differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Specifically, Rbm24 overexpression promotes, whereas Rbm24 knockdown inhibits cardiac lineage differentiation in human embryonic stem cells, by regulating over 200 alternative splicing events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Along the same lines, knockdown of Rbm24 in the developing zebrafish heart results in compromised cardiac contractility, attributed to impaired sarcomere formation and decreased expression of sarcomeric genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, targeted disruption of Rbm24 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, due to cardiac malformations and impaired sarcomerogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In the developing mouse heart, Rbm24 regulates at least 68 alternative splicing events, mostly by promoting muscle-specific exon inclusion. Several of these Rbm24-mediated splicing events, e.g. Naca, Fxr1, or Abcc9, have been reported to underlie cardiac development, sarcomere formation and cardiomyopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, apart from regulating mRNA splicing, it is known that Rbm24 can stabilize mRNA targets, such as p21 and myogenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For myogenin, it has for example been shown that Rbm24 increases the half-life of the myogenin mRNA transcript by binding to its 3&#8242;UTR, and thereby promoting myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. In line with its multiple functions, Rbm24 is localized both in the nucleus, where it can influence alternative splicing, and the in the cytoplasm, where it can stabilize mRNA targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Overall, Rbm24 is well established as a pivotal RNA-binding protein and splicing factor in cardiac and myogenic differentiation and in the developing heart.</p><p id="Par3">The role of Rbm24 in the postnatal and adult heart, however, is yet unknown. We have recently shown that Rbm38, a closely related family member of Rbm24, is dispensable for normal cardiac function, both at baseline and after pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Rbm24 and Rbm38 share 68% of sequence identity, which suggests they could be genetically redundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that, since Rbm38 is dispensable for proper cardiac structure and function, Rbm24 might be more important in the adult heart. Therefore, we used adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of Rbm24, to examine its role in the early postnatal and adult mouse heart. We found that overexpression of Rbm24 increases cardiac fibrosis. We suggest that Rbm24 overexpression in the mouse heart increases the expression of Tgf&#946;- and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, such as Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2, and thereby activates collagen synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>AAV generation</title><p id="Par4">A flag-tagged (N-terminal) open reading frame of mouse Rbm24 (ENSMUST00000037923;NCBIm37) was cloned into the pZac2.1 vector (under control of a CMV-promotor) and was subsequently used for AAV generation.

It has previously been shown that the AAV9 serotype preferentially infects cardiomyocytes, where it induces strong expression of the packaged genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We injected one-week-old wildtype mice intraperitoneally with a single bolus injection (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>12</sup> vg (low dose) or 4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>12</sup> vg (high dose)) of either AAV9-GFP or AAV9-flag-Rbm24, and analyzed 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or 8 weeks later (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Both the low dose and the high dose resulted in an approximately ~15-fold upregulation of Rbm24 mRNA in the heart, and Western blotting using an Rbm24 antibody showed that Rbm24 protein was efficiently produced in the hearts of animals that were transduced with AAV9-Rbm24 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). We next examined the cellular origin of AAV9-induced flag-Rbm24, by co-immunohistochemical stainings with antibodies raised against flag and &#945;-actinin, and revealed recombinant Rbm24 expression in ~13% of cardiomyocytes throughout the whole heart (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D,E</xref>). Mice injected with the low dose showed no obvious abnormalities or signs of heart failure, but injection of the high dose caused mortality in 3 out of 6 mice after 3 to 4 weeks. Therefore, surviving mice injected with the high dose were sacrificed 4 weeks after injection, and mice injected with the low dose were sacrificed 8 weeks after injection. Mice sacrificed after 4 weeks or 8 weeks still overexpressed Rbm24, even though Rbm24 expression was less increased after 8 weeks than after 2 or 4 weeks after injection (Supplemental Figs&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratios were not different at 2 weeks after injection of the low dose of AAV9-Rbm24, but were slightly increased at 8 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). After injection of the high dose, HW/BW ratios showed a trend towards an increased HW/BW ratio, both at 2 and 4 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). It must be noted, however, that after injection of the high dose only mice that survived the first 4 weeks were analyzed, meaning that these results are biased towards mice that were least affected. Gross cardiac morphology was not different between AAV9-GFP and AAV9-Rbm24 at 2 weeks after injection of the low or high dose, as shown by H&amp;E stainings (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). However, injection of the high dose resulted in severe cardiac dilatation and wall thinning at 4 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Even though we did not observe overt cardiac changes at 2 weeks after injection, we did find the stress marker Anf (or Nppa) to be upregulated, which was even further increased at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after injection, in the hearts of AAV9-Rbm24 injected mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). In conclusion, we generated an AAV9 virus encoding flag-Rbm24, which adequately induced Rbm24 expression throughout the heart. Injection of the low dose of AAV9-Rbm24 did not result in an overt cardiac phenotype at 2 or 8 weeks after injection, but did increase the stress marker Anf. Injection of the high dose of AAV9-Rbm24 did not result in an overt phenotype at 2 weeks after injection, but caused severe cardiac dilatation and mortality after 4 weeks.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>AAV9 injections in wildtype C57/Bl6 mice.

We used the AffyMetrix Mouse Transcriptome Array 1.0, since this microarray platform contains approximately four probes per exon as well as probes that span exon-exon junctions, and roughly 40 probes per gene, and as such enables for high resolution gene expression and alternative splicing analysis. We first analyzed differential gene expression and found a total number of 646 genes to be at least 1.5-fold upregulated, of which 186 were protein coding. 247 genes were at least 1.5-fold downregulated, of which 54 were protein coding (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, Supplemental File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis using PANTHER revealed an enrichment of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, immune response genes, and genes involved in cellular proliferation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Since Rbm24 is also known as a splicing factor, we further analyzed the micro-array results for differential splicing events. Using a stringent cut-off of at least a 2-fold difference of in- or exclusion of an exon, we identified 1102 differential splicing events in 714 genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, Supplemental File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We did not observe splicing differences in the known Rbm24-splicing targets skNAC, &#945;NAC, and Coro6, which were recently identified in embryonic Rbm24 knockout hearts (Supplemental Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This is, however, not surprising, as these splice isoforms are induced by Rbm24 in the developing heart, and remain to be expressed during adulthood. Increasing expression of Rbm24 postnatally does therefore likely not add to the induction of these splice isoforms, since the switch in splice isoform has already taken place. We noticed that some of the genes with the largest splicing differences (i.e. the highest splicing index) were pivotal cardiac genes, such as Pln, Pdlim5, and Ttn, that have all been implicated in cardiac disease. We could validate these splicing differences with RT-PCR in hearts with increased Rbm24 expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Recent reports have shown that Rbm24 controls mRNA expression of multiple genes such as p21, Bcl2, and Smad5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To investigate whether these previously identified targets were also regulated in our model, we analyzed the mRNA expression of these genes. We found that p21 and Bcl2, but not Smad5, were upregulated in the AAV9-Rbm24 hearts at 2 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), which is in line what has been found previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, the expression of p21 and Bcl2 was also increased at 4 or 8 weeks after AAV9-injection (Supplemental Figs&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Transcriptome analysis of hearts of AAV9-Rbm24 injected mice.

We validated two of these genes using qPCR, and indeed found an increase in Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2 expression, two weeks after AAV9-Rbm24 injections (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). After 4 and 8 weeks, the expression of Tgf&#946;R1 remained high, while the expression of Tgf&#946;R2 returned to control levels (Supplemental Figs&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Increased expression of Tgf&#946; receptors could lead to enhanced Tgf&#946; signaling, which, in turn, could contribute to increased expression of ECM genes. Since we found ECM genes to be enriched in the AAV9-Rbm24 hearts in our microarrays, we next aimed to validate the expression of a set of ECM genes by qRT-PCR. Indeed, we confirmed increased expression of a wide range of ECM and fibrotic genes already at 2 weeks after injection, and these genes were even further upregulated 4 and 8 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, Supplemental Figs&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). One of the upregulated genes, periostin (Postn), marks activated fibroblasts, which are crucial in the fibrotic response. Since Postn mRNA is upregulated in the AAV9-Rbm24 injected hearts, we performed co-immunohistochemistry with a Postn and &#945;-actinin antibody, and found Postn protein expression markedly enhanced in the AAV9-Rbm24 injected hearts, indicating an active fibrotic response after Rbm24 overexpression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The increased expression of Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2, and of ECM-related genes in the hearts of AAV9-Rbm24 injected mice point towards an activated fibrotic response. Therefore, we stained cardiac sections with Picrosirius Red, and found extensive fibrosis in the hearts of AAV9-Rbm24 injected mice, but not in the AAV9-GFP injected mice. Quantification of these Picrosirius Red stainings revealed a ~2-fold increase in collagen content 2 weeks after injecting the low dose and a ~10-fold increase in mice 8 weeks after injection of the low dose (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,B</xref>). Mice injected with the high dose of AAV9-Rbm24 showed a ~3-fold increase at 2 weeks after injection, and a ~7-fold increase at 4 weeks after injection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C,D</xref>). Overall, we show that increased expression of Rbm24 in the early postnatal and adult mouse heart increases cardiac fibrosis.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Expression of extracellular matrix genes.

We found that AAV9-mediated overexpression of Rbm24 in the mouse heart increases the expression of Tgf&#946;- and ECM-related genes. We observed increased activation of cardiac fibroblasts, as evidenced by robust expression of Postn in the heart, and extensive cardiac fibrosis in AAV9-Rbm24 injected mice. These results suggest that Rbm24 may function as a novel regulator of cardiac fibrosis, potentially through the regulation of Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2 expression. It is intriguing that only injection of the high dose causes lethality, while the overexpression of Rbm24 is similar at 2 weeks after injection. It is not clear what underlies the lethality, but it may be possible that the high dose leads to higher Rbm24 levels at later time-points. Another possibility is that injection of the high dose of AAV9-RBM24 triggers an immune response to the AAV vector capsid or to the transgene product, leading to release of inflammatory cytokines, cell death, and cardiac dilation. However, the induction of the pro-fibrotic program seemed independent of the lethal cardiomyopathic phenotype, as this was consistent across dosages and time-points.</p><p id="Par17">Extensive cardiac fibrosis directly hampers cardiac function, since the deposition of extracellular matrix stiffens the ventricular wall and reduces compliance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, extensive cardiac fibrosis is also pro-arrhythmic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. One of the major drivers of cardiac fibrosis is Tgf&#946; signaling, which can work via canonical (Smad-dependent) and non-canonical (Smad-independent) pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the canonical pathway, activation of Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2 by Tgf&#946; instigates phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which subsequently translocate to the nucleus together with Smad4, to induce gene expression of Tgf&#946;-responsive genes such as Col1a1, Col3a1, and fibronectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In the non-canonical pathway, activated Tgf&#946; receptors directly activate Smad-independent signaling pathways, such as the MAPK cascade and Erk signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, both cardiomyocyte specific knockout of Tgf&#946;R2, and fibroblast specific knockout of Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2, are protective against pressure-overload induced cardiac fibrosis, albeit through different mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the cardiomyocyte, Tgf&#946;R2 deficiency inhibits both canonical and non-canonical Tgf&#946; signaling, but non-canonical signaling through TAK1 is necessary for the protective effect against cardiac fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In the cardiac fibroblast, on the other hand, canonical Tgf&#946; signaling through Smad2/3 underlies cardiac fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">The observation that overexpression of Rbm24 in the mouse heart increases the expression of Tgf&#946;- and ECM-related genes is in line with the study of Poon <italic>et al</italic>., who showed that knockdown of Rbm24 in HL-1 cardiomyocytes decreases the expression of several Tgf&#946;- and ECM-related genes, such as Timp1, Ctgf, and Tgf&#946;2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that Rbm24 regulates ECM synthesis, but the exact molecular mechanism underlying this function of Rbm24 remains to be determined. It is possible that Rbm24 increases the expression of Tgf&#946;-genes, such as Tgf&#946;R1 and Tgf&#946;R2 directly, for example by binding to and stabilizing its mRNA transcript, and thereby enhancing Tgf&#946; signaling, or by regulating the expression of an upstream regulator of Tgf&#946; signaling. It could also be that Rbm24 acts in its function as a splicing regulator, and regulates the expression of specific isoforms of profibrotic proteins, or it may lead to nonsense mediated decay of spliced targets. Finally, since Rbm24 overexpression is limited to cardiomyocytes, it is also possible that Rbm24 overexpression induces a paracrine factor that, in turn, activates cardiac fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. Many factors secreted from cardiomyocytes, such as Tgf&#946;, IL-1&#946;, or CTGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, have been described to activate cardiac fibroblast, but it remains to be determined if that is the case here. Future studies are important in addressing how Rbm24 regulates the activation of cardiac fibroblasts and the expression of these ECM genes.</p><p id="Par19">Although fibroblasts have long been considered the main effector cells for fibrosis in the heart, it is increasingly clear that cardiomyocyte Tgf&#946; signaling also contributes to the fibrotic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As AAV9 preferentially infects cardiomyocytes in the heart, it seems that Rbm24 overexpression in our study causes cardiac fibrosis by affecting the Tgf&#946; pathway in cardiomyocytes. There is emerging evidence that, apart from canonical Tgf&#946; signaling, other pathways contribute to the (cardiac) fibrotic response as well. Small <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that Tgf&#946; also induces Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) expression in cardiac fibroblasts, which in turn mediates myofibroblast activation and fibrosis, in part by directly activating Col1a2 via a CArG element in its promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Yet another pathway that is sufficient to induce myofibroblast activation is the TRPC6-dependent calcineurin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Tgf&#946; and angiotensin II induce TRPC6 expression via a non-canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway involving serum response factor (SRF). Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPC6 then activates calcineurin and NFAT, which promote a myofibroblast activation gene program. Overall, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of multiple pathways in the fibrotic response and it will be interesting for future studies to identify the specific pathways that are affected by Rbm24.</p><p id="Par20">Another set of genes we found to be regulated after Rbm24 overexpression are immune response genes (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Also with respect to these immune response genes, there is overlap with the genes that are regulated after knockdown of Rbm24 in HL-1 cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Several TNF&#945;-related genes as well as several integrins are regulated both after Rbm24 overexpression and Rbm24 knockdown. Since it is known that cardiac fibroblasts can also be activated through increased expression of inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, it is possible that Rbm24 regulates the fibrotic response indirectly, by increasing expression of these cytokines.</p><p id="Par21">Rbm24 is not the first RBP to be involved in regulating the fibrotic response. It has recently been shown that the RBP Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) promotes myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. MBNL-1 is normally very lowly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts, but its expression increases after MI or profibrotic agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. MBNL-1 then directs myofibroblast differentiation and the fibrotic response through regulation of a network of differentiation and ECM-related genes. The fact that MBNL1 plays such a pivotal role in the fibrotic response opened the door to investigate other RBPs in this entirely new regulatory mechanism of cardiac fibrosis.</p><p id="Par22">It would be of great interest to study the effect of decreased Rbm24 expression, for example in a conditional Rbm24 null mouse. We hypothesize that loss of Rbm24 in the adult heart could attenuate the fibrotic response, for example after pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. However, since the Rbm24 null mouse is embryonically lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, a conditional knockout model to circumvent the embryonic lethality is necessary to examine loss of Rbm24 in a postnatal or adult heart.</p><p id="Par23">AAV vectors have been used extensively for gene delivery in the last decades, and hold promise as a vehicle for human gene therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In mice, specifically AAV serotype 9 is suitable for infection of the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and has, for example, been used to deliver factors to the heart to reduce infarct size after MI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, rescue age-related cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, or protect against viral myocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">However, it must be noted that overexpression studies have their limitations, and in that sense also the results from this study need to be interpreted with care. In this regard, it is for example known that high levels of exogenously expressed proteins can lead to non-specific and cardiotoxic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In our case, we found a ~15-fold increase in total Rbm24 mRNA levels, while only a subset of cardiomyocytes were infected. This could potentially lead to an 80 to 100-fold increase in Rbm24 mRNA in infected cardiomyocytes. It must be noted, though, that we used immunohistochemistry to calculate the percentage of infected cardiomyocytes. Since this technique lacks sensitivity in detecting low protein levels we may easily have easily underestimated the percentage of infected cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="Par25">Despite concerns of non-specific effects of protein overexpression, we did find an overlap in regulated genes in our study and a previous report describing knockdown of Rbm24 in HL-1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This strongly suggests that at least part of the regulated genes are specific to Rbm24 overexpression. However, to ascertain that increased expression of Rbm24 is causal for the gene regulation and fibrotic effects we see, these data should be complemented with <italic>in vivo</italic> loss-of-function models and molecular analysis of potential targets.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, we show that AAV9-mediated overexpression of Rbm24 in the mouse heart increases the expression of Tgf&#946;- and ECM-related genes and induces cardiac fibrosis. Whether this is through direct regulation of Tgf&#946; signaling, through cardiac fibroblast activation via increasing inflammatory cytokines, through yet another molecular mechanism, or a combination of these processes remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
