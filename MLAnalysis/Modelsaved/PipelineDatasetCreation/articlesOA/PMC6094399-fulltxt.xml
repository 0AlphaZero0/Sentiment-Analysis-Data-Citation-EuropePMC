Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans control physiological functions ranging from blood coagulation to cell proliferation. HS biosynthesis involves membrane-bound Golgi sulfotransferases, including HS 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfotransferase (HS2ST), which transfers sulfate from the cofactor PAPS (3&#8242;-phosphoadenosine 5&#8242;-phosphosulfate) to the 2-<italic>O</italic> position of &#945;-<sc>l</sc>-iduronate in the maturing polysaccharide chain. The current lack of simple non-radioactive enzyme assays that can be used to quantify the levels of carbohydrate sulfation hampers kinetic analysis of this process and the discovery of HS2ST inhibitors. In the present paper, we describe a new procedure for thermal shift analysis of purified HS2ST. Using this approach, we quantify HS2ST-catalysed oligosaccharide sulfation using a novel synthetic fluorescent substrate and screen the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set, to evaluate compounds that inhibit catalysis. We report the susceptibility of HS2ST to a variety of cell-permeable compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>, including polyanionic polar molecules, the protein kinase inhibitor rottlerin and oxindole-based RAF kinase inhibitors. In a related study, published back-to-back with the present study, we demonstrated that tyrosyl protein sulfotranferases are also inhibited by a variety of protein kinase inhibitors. We propose that appropriately validated small-molecule compounds could become new tools for rapid inhibition of glycan (and protein) sulfation in cells, and that protein kinase inhibitors might be repurposed or redesigned for the specific inhibition of HS2ST.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd><kwd>heparin</kwd><kwd>inhibitor</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>sulfotransferase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological sulfation is a widespread reversible covalent modification found throughout nature [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The regulated sulfation of saccharides is critical for cellular signalling, including regulatory interactions between extracellular glycoproteins that control signal transduction and high-affinity interactions between different cellular surfaces [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to providing mechanical strength, the sulfate-rich extracellular matrix also represents a hub for sulfation-based communication through growth factor signalling [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, FGF&#8211;receptor interactions and intracellular signalling to the ERK pathway are blunted in the absence of appropriate 2-O sulfation driven by heparan sulfate (HS)-modifying enzymes [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while sulfation of the tetrasaccharide Sialyl Lewis<sup>X</sup> antigen on glycolipids controls leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium during inflammation [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inappropriate glycan sulfation can therefore underlie aspects of abnormal signalling, infection, inflammation and, increasingly, human neuropathies [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that targeting of carbohydrate sulfation dynamics using small-molecule enzyme inhibitors may be of value in both basic and translational research [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, the current limited chemical toolbox to rapidly modify and study glycan sulfation is based around small-molecule inhibitors of sulfatase-2 (Sulf-2), such as OKN-007 [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or heparanase inhibitors and HS mimics, including roneparstat and PG545, which have been employed for basic and clinical investigation [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Glycan sulfotransferases (STs) can be classified into several families depending on the positional substrate specificity of enzymes for their respective sugar substrates [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HS 2<italic>-O</italic>-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) is required for the generation of HS, which is an abundant unbranched extracellular glycosaminoglycan with key roles in a range of physiological functions, most notably growth factor-dependent signalling related to development, cell migration and inflammation [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. HS2ST is a transmembrane protein whose catalytic domain faces into the lumen of the Golgi compartment, and catalyses the sulfation of iduronic acid and, to a lesser extent &#946;-<sc>d</sc>-glucouronate (GlcA), during the enzymatic assembly of secretory HS proteoglycans [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HS2ST transfers the sulfo moiety from PAPS (3&#8242;-phosphoadenosine 5&#8242;-phosphosulfate) sulfate donor to the C2 hydroxyl of IdoA that lies adjacent to an <italic>N</italic>-sulfated glucosamine residue, generating a 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated saccharide unit [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Removal of the sulfate by endosulfatases such as Sulf-2, or more general HS processing by heparanase, also contributes to the complex physiological patterns of carbohydrate editing found <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of murine models lacking HS2ST reveals central roles for 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated HS in kidney development and neuronal function, and for signalling through WNT- and FGF-dependent pathways [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in order to carefully control and examine the dynamics and structural heterogeneity of 2-O sulfation patterns in HS, which are the consequences of nontemplate-based synthesis of HS and complex dynamic sulfation patterns, new small-molecule approaches for the direct, reversible inhibition of sulfotransferase enzymes are urgently required. In particular, these need to be deployed using chemical biology strategies to overcome deficiencies associated with genetic disruption approaches relevant to development and/or compensatory glycosylation or signalling mechanisms [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Mechanistic parallels between the enzymatic pathway of biological sulfation by sulfotransferases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and phosphorylation by protein kinases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] are apparent since both enzyme classes transfer charged chemical units from an adenine-based nucleotide cofactor to a (usually) polymeric acceptor structure. The biological analysis of protein kinases, which are thought to employ a similar &#8216;in-line&#8217; enzyme reaction as the 2-<italic>O-</italic>sulfotransferases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] when transferring phosphate to peptide targets [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], has been revolutionised by the synthesis and wide availability of small-molecule inhibitors [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Many of these compounds were originally discovered in screens with ATP-competitive inhibitor libraries using oncology-associated target enzymes [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Protein kinases have proved to be exceptional targets for the development of therapeutic agents in humans, and &#8764;50 kinase inhibitors have been approved, or will soon be approved, for cancer and anti-inflammatory indications [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To help diversify and accelerate this process, validated open-source panels of such inhibitors, such as the Public Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), have been assembled for screening purposes, constituting a variety of chemotypes for unbiased small-molecule inhibitor discovery, which can be applied to a diverse range of protein targets [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of carbohydrate sulfation currently relies heavily on genetic, biophysical (NMR) and combinatorial organic chemistry and enzymatic analysis, with only a handful of low-affinity inhibitors of carbohydrate sulfotransferases ever having been disclosed [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. More recently, a relatively potent inhibitor of the related type IV aryl sulfotransferase [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and much lower affinity oestrogen sulfotransferase inhibitors [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were reported. Owing to a lack of any selective chemical tool compounds, cellular glycan sulfation remains understudied, relying on non-specific cellular methods such as chlorate exposure [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and the field remains ripe for technological innovation and new chemical biology approaches. Early attempts to discover such molecules among small, relatively unfocussed, kinase-based libraries led to the discovery of low-affinity purine and tyrphostin-based inhibitory compounds, which are well-established chemical classes of protein kinase inhibitor [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This raises the question as to whether PAPS-dependent sulfotransferases are general inhibitory targets for new or repurposed small molecules that target nucleotide-binding sites, especially broader families of compounds originally developed as protein kinase inhibitors. However, the low throughput nature of radioactive (<sup>35</sup>S-PAPS) TLC or HPLC-based assays typically used for sulfotransferase analysis [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the relatively low potency of current hits, argues for new approaches to assay and screen more diverse selections of focused or larger chemical libraries.</p><p>In the present paper, and in a related study employing tyrosyl protein sulfotranserases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we describe novel <italic>in vitro</italic> methods for assaying recombinant HS2ST, one of which employs a fluorescent-based detection system with a hexasaccharide substrate. PAPS-dependent sulfation of the substrate at the 2-O position of the IdoA residue leads to a change in substrate chemical properties, which can be detected as a real-time mobility shift in a high-throughput microfluidic assay format originally developed for the analysis of peptide phosphorylation [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We exploit this assay alongside differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to screen a small-molecule PKIS library, characterising HS2ST susceptibility towards a variety of cell-permeable compounds. We propose that appropriately validated small-molecule ligands might become invaluable probes for rapid cellular inhibition of HS2STs, and that further iteration could lead to the discovery and synthesis (or repurposing) of small molecules, including compound classes currently employed as kinase inhibitors, to probe cellular HS2ST function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Chemicals and compounds</title><p>Porcine intestinal heparin was from Sigma, oligomeric saccharide standards, termed dp2-dp12, where dp&#8201;=&#8201;degree of polymerisation [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], were from Iduron (Manchester, U.K.).

Subsequently, we explored the potential of this assay to detect binding of a putative IdoA-containing oligosaccharide substrate for HS2ST, confirming dose-dependent effects of this polymeric glycan over a range of concentrations, consistent with binding and conformational stability. Similar to PAPS, detection of binding was observed in the low micromolar range, equivalent to a molar ratio of &#8764;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 HS2ST&#8201;:&#8201;glycan (Supplementary Figure S1B). We also evaluated binding of a panel of adenine-based cofactors (PAP and ATP), which suggested the binding of divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in an EDTA-sensitive manner (Supplementary Figure S1C), inducing a &#916;<italic>&#932;</italic><sub>m</sub> of &#8764;3&#176;C, similar to that observed with the HS2ST cofactor PAPS.

Neither PAP nor PAPS binding required Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, although the effect on stabilisation with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions was additive (Supplementary Figures 1C and 2A). The non-functional enzyme cofactor APS, in which the 3&#8242;-phosphate group of adenine is absent, did not induce HS2ST stabilisation, confirming a requirement for this charged modification (Supplementary Figure S2A). We also established that CoA and acetyl CoA, which both contain a 3&#8242;-phosphoadenine moiety, clearly induced thermal stabilisation of HS2ST; loss of the 3&#8242;-phosphate group in dephospho-CoA abolished this effect (Supplementary Figure S2A). Finally, we demonstrated that ATP, GTP and ADP, but not AMP or cAMP, were all effective at protecting HS2ST from thermal denaturation, suggesting that they are also HS2ST ligands (Supplementary Figure S2A).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Analysis of human HS2ST glycan binding using TSA</title><p>To extend our HS2ST thermal analysis to identify potential glycan substrates, we evaluated enzyme stability in the presence of synthetic glycan chains of different lengths and sulfation patterns (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of particular interest for further assay development, thermal shift (stabilisation) was detected in this assay when hexasaccharide (dp6) or a higher degree of polymerisation oligosaccharide was incubated with the enzyme (Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting that a dp6 glycan might represent the shortest potential partner suitable for HS2ST binding, a prerequisite for enzymatic modification. Interestingly, many of the chemically modified heparins tested served as efficient HS2ST-binding partners relative to the heparin control. The fully chemically sulfated I<sub>2s,3s</sub>A<sup>6s</sup><sub>3s</sub>Ns hexamer induced a similar HS2ST stability shift to heparin, whereas the singly and doubly desulfated hexamers induced slightly smaller stability shifts (Supplementary Figure S2C). Moreover, a putative I<sub>2OH</sub>A<sup>6OH</sup>Ns substrate, which contains a 2-O moiety that is predicted to be the substrate for 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfotransferases, also led to marked thermal stabilisation of HS2ST, suggestive of productive binding to HS2ST that might permit it to be sulfated in the presence of PAPS (Supplementary Figure S2C).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>A novel microfluidic kinetic assay to directly measure oligosaccharide sulfation by HS2ST</title><p>To quantify the effects of various ligands on HS2ST enzyme activity, we sought to develop a new type of rapid non-radioactive solution assay that could discriminate the enzymatic incorporation of sulfate into a synthetic oligosaccharide substrate.

Importantly, we next tested whether a version of an I<sub>2OH</sub>A<sup>6OH</sup>NS containing a hexasaccharide substrate coupled to a linker and fluorescein at the reducing end, which interacts with HS2ST (Supplementary Figure S2C), could also be enzymatically sulfated by HS2ST using &#8216;gold-standard&#8217; NMR-based sulfation detection [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

Purified H142A MBP-HS2ST appeared to be appropriately folded, and although it bound to PAPS and heparin (Supplementary Figure S6A&#8211;C), it was unable to efficiently catalyse sulfation of the fluorescent I<sub>2OH</sub>A<sup>6OH</sup>NS hexasaccharide substrate, possessing &lt;1% of the activity observed with wild-type MBP-HS2ST (Supplementary Figure S6D).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Screening for small-molecule inhibitors of HS2ST using DSF and microfluidic technology</title><p>The discovery of HS2ST inhibitors is hindered by a lack of a rapid and quantifiable assay for the facile detection of sulfate modification using a close mimic of a physiological substrate. Our discovery that a synthetic HS2ST glycan substrate could be readily sulfated and detected by enzymatic assay in solution, without the need for HPLC, NMR or radioactive procedures, meant that this approach might now be optimised for the discovery of small-molecule HS2ST inhibitors. We first evaluated the ability of an unlabelled (non-fluorescent) heparin glycan substrate that lacked sulfate at the 2-O position, or a non-substrate heparin that was fully sulfated at all potential sites, to act as HS2ST inhibitors in our fluorescent glycan sulfation assay. As detailed in <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, the fully sulfated glycan was a potent inhibitor, interfering with HS2ST-dependent sulfation of the substrate with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &lt;10&#8197;nM, consistent with tight binding to the enzyme, as previously established using DSF (Supplementary Figure S2C).

However, to our knowledge, the inhibition of carbohydrate sulfotransferases by such compounds has not been reported.

Similarities between ATP and PAPS (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), and the finding that ATP can both bind to, and inhibit, HS2ST activity (Supplementary Figure S2A and <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) raised the possibility that other ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitors might also interact with HS2ST. To exploit our screening capabilities further, we established a 384-well assay to evaluate inhibition of PAPS-dependent glycan sulfation by HS2ST. The Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) is a well-annotated collection of 367 high-quality ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor compounds that are ideal for compound repurposing or the discovery of new chemical ligands for orphan targets. We screened PKIS using DSF and enzyme-based readouts (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>, respectively).

We focussed on compounds inducing HS2ST &#916;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values between +0.5&#176;C and &#8722;0.5&#176;C, and re-screened each &#8216;hit&#8217; compound using ratiometric HS2ST enzyme assays at a final compound concentration of 40&#8197;&#956;M. We reported the enzyme activity remaining compared with DMSO, with rottlerin (IC<sub>50&#8201;</sub>=&#8201;&#8764;8&#8197;&#956;M), suramin (IC<sub>50&#8201;</sub>=&#8201;&#8764;20&#8197;nM) and aurintricarboxylate (IC<sub>50</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;&#8764;90&#8197;nM) as positive controls (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figures 7 and 8). We also included the compound GW406108X in our enzyme assay since it was structurally related to several &#8216;hit&#8217; compounds from the DSF screen. As shown in <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, the three PKIS compounds with the highest inhibitory activity (red) exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of between 20 and 30&#8197;&#956;M towards HS2ST in the presence of 1&#8197;&#956;M PAPS, similar to inhibition by rottlerin.

Subsequently, one other related indole RAF inhibitory compound from PKIS, GW305074, was also shown to be a mid-micromolar HS2ST inhibitor, whereas the related oxindole GW405841X (Supplementary Figure S8) did not inhibit HS2ST at any concentration tested (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we used combined DSF and enzyme assays to evaluate a broader panel of well-characterised kinase inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S9). Interestingly, neither the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine nor several FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors caused thermal stabilisation of HS2ST at any concentration tested. Moreover, chemically diverse RAF inhibitors, including clinical RAF compounds such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib, were unable to inhibit HS2ST in our sensitive HS2ST enzyme, even at concentrations as high as 400&#8197;&#956;M (Supplementary Figure S9B).

The 3&#8242;-phosphoadenine moiety of PAP also helps anchor the nucleotide in an appropriate position. A molecular docking protocol for PAP in HS2ST was developed that matched the crystallographic binding pose of PAP extremely well (RMSD 0.31 &#197;, <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). By comparing a crystallised ligand (PAP) with docked rottlerin, suramin and GW407323A, we confirmed that compounds could be docked into the active site of HS2ST broadly corresponding to either the PAPS-binding region (rottlerin and GW407323A, <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>) or bridging both the substrate and cofactor-binding sites (suramin, <xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).

The chemical similarity between ATP, a universal phosphate donor, and PAPS, a universal sulfate donor, led us to investigate whether enzymatic glycan sulfation could be detected using a high-throughput kinetic procedure previously validated for peptide phosphorylation by ATP-dependent protein kinases. We focussed our attention on HS2ST, which transfers sulfate from PAPS to the 2-O position of IdoA during heparan sulfate biosynthesis in the secretory pathway.</p><p>To facilitate rapid purification of recombinant HS2ST, the enzyme was expressed as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein, and we confirmed that it was folded, and could bind to a variety of known exogenous ligands including PAPS and PAP, the end-product of the sulfotransferase reaction. Protein kinases are also known to bind to their end-product (ADP), and kinase structural analysis has long taken advantage of the stability of kinase and ATP analogues, or ADP-like complexes, for protein co-crystallisation. Similar co-crystallisation approaches revealed the structure of HS2ST, and related sulfotransferases, in complex with PAP and model saccharide substrates [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and our study extends these approaches, by revealing a competitive mode of HS2ST interaction with a variety of 3&#8242;-phosphoadenosine-containing nucleotides, including CoA.

Standard assays for carbohydrate sulfation utilise HPLC-based detection of <sup>35</sup>S-based substrate sulfation derived from <sup>35</sup>S-labelled PAPS, requiring enzymatic cofactor synthesis and time-consuming radioactive solid-phase chromatography procedures [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While enzymatic deconvolution, MS and NMR-based procedures remain useful for mapping sulfation patterns in complex (sometimes unknown) glycan polymers, these procedures are very time-consuming and relatively expensive. In contrast, our finding that sulfation can be detected using a simple glycan mobility shift assay, and then quantified in real time by comparing the ratio of a sulfated and non-sulfated substrate, is rapid, reproducible and relatively inexpensive. Our kinetic assay makes use of a commercial platform originally developed for the analysis of peptide phosphorylation or peptide proteolysis, which allows for the inclusion of high concentrations of non-radioactive cofactors, substrates and ligands in assays [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

In the course of our studies, we developed several new reagents, including a hexameric fluorescent substrate in which the central IdoA residue was replaced by a GlcA residue (Supplementary Figure S5). Interestingly, a decreased rate of substrate modification was observed using this oligosaccharide substrate, consistent with the ability of HS2ST to sulfate either IdoA or GlcA [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but with a marked preference for the former. Previous HPLC-based studies identified an N-sulfo group in the oligosaccharide substrate as a prerequisite for catalysis, with subsequent preferential transfer of sulfate to the 2-O position of IdoA [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; these published observations are entirely consistent with our findings using a hexameric fluorescent substrate.</p><p>In the future, it might be possible to quantify other site-specific covalent modifications in complex glycans using fluorescent oligosaccharides that contain distinct sugar residues, and by employing mobility-dependent detection in the presence of a variety of enzymes.

During the course of our studies screening a panel of kinase inhibitors, we found that the non-specific kinase compound rottlerin is a micromolar inhibitor of HS2ST <italic>in vitro</italic>, with inhibition dependent on the concentration of PAPS in the assay, suggesting a competitive mode of interaction. Rottlerin (also known as mallotoxin) is a polyphenolic compound from <italic>Mallotus philippensis</italic> and, although originally identified as an inhibitor of PKC isozymes [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], possesses a wide variety of biological effects likely due to its non-specific inhibition of multiple protein kinases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This lack of specificity prevents exploitation of rottlerin in cells as a specific probe, although our finding that HS2ST is a target of this compound opens up the possibility that this, or other, protein kinase inhibitors might also possess inhibitory activity towards HS2ST, either due to an ability to target the PAPS or oligosaccharide-binding sites in the enzyme. To evaluate these possibilities further, we screened PKIS, a collection of drug-like molecules with broad inhibitory activity towards multiple protein kinases. Interestingly, only three compounds (&lt;1% of the library) consistently showed marked inhibitory activity at 40&#8197;&#956;M in our HS2ST enzyme assay (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A&#8211;C</xref>, red). Remarkably, all three compounds belonged to the same benzylidene-1H-inol-2-one (oxindole) chemical class, which were originally reported as potent ATP-dependent RAF kinase inhibitors that block the MAPK signalling pathway in cultured cells [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Retrospectively, of all the related chemotypes present in the PKIS library, we confirmed that GW305074X (but not GW405841X) was also a micromolar HS2ST inhibitor, consistent with the broad sensitivity of HS2ST to this optimised class of RAF inhibitor.</p><p>Although limited structure&#8211;activity relationships can be derived from our initial studies, these findings demonstrate that HS2ST inhibitors can be discovered, and that several of these inhibitors could be of broad interest to the sulfotransferase (and protein kinase) fields. An additional outcome of our work is that pharmaceutical companies might conduct more extensive high-throughput screens using much larger libraries of kinase inhibitors to identify distinct, and more potent, leads. Our study also validates previous observations from the turn of the century, in which carbohydrate inhibitors of NoDH sulfotransferase were reported from a low diversity kinase-directed library [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Surprisingly, this early breakthrough did not lead to the development of any glycan sulfotransferase tool compounds for cell-based analysis. However, our discovery that oxindole-based RAF inhibitors are also HS2ST inhibitors could provide new impetus for the design and synthesis of much more specific and potent HS2ST inhibitors from this class of RAF kinase inhibitor, especially if issues of specificity can be evaluated using mutagenic target-validation approaches previously validated for various protein kinases [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>A requirement for rapid progress during this process will be structure-based analysis of HS2ST in the presence of compounds, in order to determine mechanism and mode(s) of interaction. Our initial docking studies suggest similar binding modes for both rottlerin and the oxindole-based ligand GW407323A (<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), with the potential for cross-over between PAPS and substrate-binding sites present on the surface of HS2ST. It will be intriguing to explore these binding modes by structural analysis and guided mutational approaches [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], in order to evaluate potential drug-binding site residues in HS2ST and to tease apart requirements for enzyme inhibition. It will also be important to assess whether compounds identified as <italic>in vitro</italic> HS2ST inhibitors, including previously reported RAF inhibitors, can also interfere with HS sulfation and downstream signalling in cells. Interestingly, suramin is a potent anti-angiogenic compound and is reported to have cellular effects on FGF signalling [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], whereas aurintricarboxylate has multiple cellular effects currently attributed to nucleotide-dependent processes. Attempting to link some of these cellular phenotypes to the inhibition of 2-<italic>O</italic> glycan sulfation is a worthy future experimental strategy, although success with PAPS-competitive compounds is likely to depend on the concentration of PAPS in the Golgi network and the relative rate of, minimally, 2-<italic>O-</italic>sulfate turnover (sulfation versus desulfation) among physiological HS2ST substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work raises the possibility that HS2ST inhibitors could be developed strategically following the successful blueprint laid down for protein kinase inhibitors in the previous decades. Dozens of sulfotransferases are found in vertebrate genomes, and the development of chemical biology approaches to rapidly inactivate Golgi membrane-bound sulfotransferases and induce targeted inhibition of sulfation has been stymied by a lack of tool compounds, whose exploitation has the opportunity to revolutionise cell biology when properly validated [<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="BCJ-475-2417C80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We propose that if such compounds can be developed, perhaps through high-throughput screening and discovery of new inhibitors, or even via chemical manipulation of the leads reported in the present study, then a new era in sulfation-based cell biology might be on the horizon. By generating tools to chemically control glycan sulfation modulated by HS2ST directly, inhibitor-based interrogation of sulfation-dependent enzymes could also have significant impact in many active areas of translational research.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list list-content="abbreviations"><def-item><term id="uid1">DSF</term><def><p>differential scanning fluorimetry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid2">GlcA</term><def><p>&#946;-<sc>d</sc>-glucouronate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid3">HS2ST</term><def><p>heparan sulfate 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid4">IdoA</term><def><p>&#945;-<sc>l</sc>-iduronate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid5">MBP</term><def><p>maltose-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid6">PAPS</term><def><p>adenosine 3&#8242;-phosphate 5&#8242;-phosphosulfate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid7">PKIS</term><def><p>Published Kinase Inhibitor Set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid8">POMK</term><def><p>protein-<italic>O</italic>-mannose kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid9">RAF</term><def><p>rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid10">ST</term><def><p>sulfotransferases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid11">TPST</term><def><p>tyrosyl protein sulfotranferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="uid12">TSA</term><def><p>thermostability assay</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>P.A.E. obtained BBSRC grant funding with D.G.F. and E.A.Y.
