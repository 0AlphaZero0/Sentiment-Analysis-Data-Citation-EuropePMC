In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of <italic>Alv</italic> and the functional analysis of Alv protein during shell formation were explored. The deduced protein (Alv), which has a molecular mass of 24.9&#8201;kDa and an isoelectric point of 11.34, was characterized, and the functional analyses was explored <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>Alv</italic> gene has high expression in mantle and could response to notching damage. The functional inhibition of Alv protein <italic>in vivo</italic> by injecting recombinant Alv (rAlv) antibodies destroyed prism structure but accelerated nacre growth. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed that native Alv exists in the EDTA-insoluble matrix of both prismatic and nacreous layers and has different distribution patterns in the inner or outer prismatic layer. Taken together, the characterization and functional analyses of matrix protein Alv could expand our understanding of basic matrix proteins and their functions during shell formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31502139</award-id><award-id>31372502</award-id><award-id>31572594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Rongqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biomineralization is a process during which minerals are regulated in an organized way by living organisms. Mollusc shell is one of the most typical objects to study biomineralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For the pearl oyster <italic>Pinctada fucata</italic>, the shell is composed of three layers: the outer periostracum, middle prismatic and inner nacreous layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the shell of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fucata</italic>, organic macromolecules compose only 5% of the weight but play an important role in organizing well-ordered and solid structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although organic macromolecules consist of proteins, lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and polysaccharides, it is thought that matrix proteins are the major components that regulate the biomineralization process, including crystal nucleation, polymorphism, crystal orientation and crystal morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

However, the molecular mechanism of shell formation is still unclear. Traditionally, acidic proteins (pI&#8201;&lt;&#8201;7) are thought to have more functions in the prismatic layer rather than the nacreous layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and basic proteins (pI&#8201;&gt;&#8201;7) play roles in the nacreous layer other than in the prismatic layer. In fact, most of the reported matrix proteins are acidic or alkalescent proteins, and basic proteins are rarely reported. Until now, only few proteins, that is, the Shematrin family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, tyrosinase-like protein 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, KRMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, Prisilkin-39<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and PfN23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, have all been demonstrated to play important roles in the process of shell formation.</p><p id="Par4">The valine-rich matrix protein, referred as Alveoline-like protein (Alv)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, is a typical extreme basic protein with a predicted pI of 11.34. Alv was found via new proteomic approaches with the third abundance in matrix proteins of the prismatic layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this study, Alv was proven to have opposite functions in the prismatic and nacreous layers, which is a unique matrix protein with dual roles.

The amino acid composition of Alv is VP-rich, with 23.0% Val and 12.9% Pro, but has low Asp and Glu content which are rich in many other shell matrix proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, there are 12.0% lysine residues, 8.3% arginine residues, and 7.8% histidine residues, which are basic amino acids (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the extrapallial fluid (pH 7.4), these residues are liable to be positively charged; therefore, they are able to interact with negative ions, such as carbonate ions, and negatively charged amino acid residues from acidic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The isoelectric point of the Alv protein is 11.34, which is different from most other matrix proteins that are acidic. The Alv protein has five predicted phosphorylation sites, including one Ser and four Thr, which are related to protein functions during biomineralization. The first 16 amino acids are predicted to be a signal peptide, and there is no transmembrane domain predicted in the Alv protein, which is consistent with the secretion character of matrix proteins. The predicted secondary structure of the Alv protein without signal peptide has almost 80% beta strands (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), which is unique compared with other proteins. There are Alv homologous proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>maxima</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>margaritifera</italic> with high conservation, indicating that Alv protein might serve important roles in biomineralization (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Hence, the detection of Alv in the whole shell could enrich matrix protein detection and the location study. The discovery of different immunofluorescence distributions of Alv in the inner and outer prismatic layers provides clues on the formation of the prismatic layer. Prior to this, scientists proposed many hypotheses about the relationship between the prismatic sheath and prismatic lamellae.

As the prismatic layer grew, the Alv protein was squeezed and was distributed into the prismatic sheath (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This presume could be supported by Erben&#8217;s model and Checa&#8217;s model and could enrich the assembly of macromolecules and the formation of the prismatic layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.
