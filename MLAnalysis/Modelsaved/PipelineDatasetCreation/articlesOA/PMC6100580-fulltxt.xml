Type I IFN (IFN-I) therapy is an important therapeutic option for HBV patients. The antiviral effect of IFN is mainly mediated <italic>via</italic> upregulation of the expressions of the downstream IFN-stimulated genes. However, the mechanisms by which IFN induces ISG production and inhibits HBV replication are yet to be clarified. TRIM14 was recently reported as a key molecule in the IFN-signaling pathway that regulates IFN production in response to viral infection. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanisms by which IFN restricts HBV replication. We confirmed that TRIM14 is an ISG in the hepatic cells, and that the pattern-recognition receptor ligands polyI:C and polydAdT induce TRIM14 dependent on IFN-I production. In addition, IFN-I-activated STAT1 (but not STAT3) directly bound to the TRIM14 promoter and mediated the induction of TRIM14. Interestingly, TRIM14 played an important role in IFN-I-mediated inhibition of HBV, and the TRIM14 SPRY domain interacted with the C-terminal of HBx, which might block the role of HBx in facilitating HBV replication by inhibiting the formation of the Smc-HBx&#8211;DDB1 complex. Thus, our study clearly demonstrates that TRIM14 is a STAT1-dependent ISG, and that the IFN-I&#8211;TRIM14&#8211;HBx axis shows an alternative way to understand the mechanism by which IFN-I inhibits virus replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>type I IFN</kwd><kwd>STAT1</kwd><kwd>TRIM14</kwd><kwd>hepatitis B virus X protein</kwd><kwd>hepatitis B virus replication</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="8468"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The induction of <italic>TRIM14</italic> by IFN-I is STAT1-dependent, but STAT3-independent.</p></list-item><list-item><p>STAT1 directly binds to the TRIM14 promoter.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The TRIM14 SPRY domain interacts with the C-terminal of HBx and inhibits the formation of Smc-HBx&#8211;DDB1 complex.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S2"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activation of members of the type I interferon (IFN) family (i.e., IFN-&#945;, -&#946;, -&#949;, -&#954;, and -&#969;)&#8212;one of the earliest transcriptional responses&#8212;is perhaps the most important innate immune response to viral infection. Most nucleated vertebrate cells are capable of both producing and responding to type I IFN (IFN-I). The antiviral function of IFN-I is effected <italic>via</italic> its binding to the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1), activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway, and subsequent induction of approximately 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which can inhibit different stages of viral life cycle (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Currently, IFN-I is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and IFN-&#945; has been shown to inhibit HBV replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, these treatment strategies are associated with poor response rates and substantial side effects, which impact their clinical utility. Many reports have shown that HBV infection inhibits the production of IFN-I (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which suggests an antagonistic action of HBV to IFN treatment. Therefore, unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between IFN and HBV during the course of viral infection is a key imperative that may help improve the efficacy of IFN therapy.</p><p>Hepatitis B virus is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic> family (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On entry into host cells, the viral genome translocates to the nucleus and is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is the transcription template for all HBV viral RNAs. The HBV-encoded regulatory protein&#8212;hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein&#8212;stimulates HBV gene expression from the cccDNA template. HBx is a 154-amino acid protein with an N-terminal negative regulatory domain and a C-terminal transactivation/coactivation domain; it interacts with several cellular proteins, and its role in viral replication may be mediated through these interactions. The interaction between HBx and damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) is conserved among HBx proteins from all mammalian <italic>hepadnaviruses</italic> and the woodchuck HBx protein (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This binding is essential for HBV replication (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Smc5/6 form the foundation of a multi-subunit DNA-repair complex, and function as a restriction factor by causing selective blockade of extrachromosomal DNA transcription (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A recent report indicated that the HBx-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ligase complex targets the SMC5/6 complex to enhance HBV gene expression from episomal cccDNA (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Members of the TRIM family are well known for their ring finger E3-ubiquitin ligase activity&#8212;comprising a RING domain, 1 or 2 B-box domains, and an associated coiled-coil domain in the amino-terminal region (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As reported by other researchers and ourselves, most TRIMs are IFN-inducible genes, and play a critical role in controlling viral infection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We found that TRIM25 was induced by IFN in an IL-27-dependent manner, and it inhibited HBV replication by amplifying IFN signaling (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Among TRIMs, TRIM14 has recently been recognized as an important molecule that regulates IFN signaling; it was shown to facilitate the activation of IFN-I signaling by recruiting USP14 to cleave the lysine 48 (K48)-linked ubiquitin chains of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) at K414, thereby inhibiting p62-mediated autophagic degradation of cGAS (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, TRIM14 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-365 and recruits an NF-&#954;B essential modulator to the MAVS signalosome, which leads to activation of both the IFN-regulatory factor 3 and NF-&#954;B pathways and results in an enhanced innate immune response (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, TRIM14 is required for RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral immunity through the formation of a WHIP&#8211;TRIM14&#8211;PPP6C mitochondrial signalosome (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, the mechanism by which IFN-1 induces TRIM14 in response to viral infection is not well characterized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the function of TRIM14 and the mechanism by which it regulates HBV has not been reported. This study aims to clarify the mechanisms involved in the induction of TRIM14 and the inhibition of HBV replication by TRIM14.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3-1"><title>Samples</title><p>In this study, we enrolled 16 HBV-infected patients who were treated with IFN-&#945; (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).

As expected, TRIM14 was significantly upregulated in the PBMCs of patients following IFN-&#945; treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). As a validation of TRIM14 induction in hepatic cells, we found that IFN-&#945; induced both protein and mRNA expressions of TRIM14 in HepG2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Previous results from our experiments and those of other researchers showed that polyI:C or polydAdT promotes IFN-I production (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

Therefore, 293 T cells KO for STAT1 or STAT3 were used. Interestingly, TRIM14 was not induced by IFN-&#945; in STAT1 KO cells, but was upregulated in STAT3 KO cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A,B). In addition, by transfection of polyI:C or polydAdT into cells that would result in IFN-I induction, we confirmed that STAT1, but not STAT3, played a role in TRIM14 induction (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C,D). In the canonical IFN-signaling pathway, all types of IFNs produce transcriptionally active STAT1 through JAK-mediated phosphorylation at Y701 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).

Conservation analysis of the TF-binding sites among the mammalian species was analyzed and viewed by a UCSC genome browser (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</uri>). Four potential STAT1-binding sites were observed in the TRIM14 promoter region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A); 820&#8201;bp of the promoter, including these four sites, was amplified and cloned into a pGL4.1 luciferase reporter vector to generate WT-luc and Site Deletion-luc reporter constructs. Our results showed that both IFN-&#945; treatment and transfection of polyI:C or polydAdT significantly induced WT-luc activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B), whereas this induction was blocked in the STAT1 KO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). This suggests that STAT1 is the activator of TRIM14 gene promoter luciferase activity. To further confirm the binding site, potential sites were deleted individually, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D. Interestingly, luciferase reporter assay indicated that only Site #4 was required for TRIM14 transcription upon IFN-&#945; treatment or polydAdT transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D).

The pHBV1.3 plasmid can be used to transfect HepG2 cells and create an infectious HBV virus. This plasmid was co-transfected with HA-tagged TRIM14-expressing plasmids to evaluate the possible effects on viral replication. Cells and supernatants were collected at 72&#8201;h after transfection. Levels of HBV DNA, HBV pgRNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg were quantified through qRT-PCR and ELISA analysis. Notably, HBV DNA, pgRNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg were significantly reduced after TRIM14 overexpression, and significantly increased in TRIM14 KO HepG2 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A,E), which suggests an inhibitory effect of TRIM14 on HBV replication. In addition, Western blotting analysis showed that the protein levels of HBs and HBc were reduced by TRIM14; in addition, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that HBs expression was decreased by TRIM14 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref> in Supplementary Material). To further confirm the role of TRIM14 in IFN-I-mediated HBV inhibition, HepG2 WT or TRIM14 KO cells were pretreated with IFN-&#945; for 24&#8201;h and transfected with pHBV1.3 plasmids. We found that the inhibitory effect of IFN-&#945; on HBV replication was significantly attenuated in TRIM14 KO cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B,E). The induction of other classical ISGs (e.g., IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5) was not affected by TRIM14 KO after IFN treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref> in Supplementary Material). In addition, we generated a TRIM14 KO HepG2-NTCP cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 technology; we treated the cells with IFN-&#945; for 24&#8201;h and subsequently infected them with HBV.

In order to verify if the TRIM14-mediated inhibition of HBV replication was type I IFN-dependent, pHBV1.3 plasmid was co-transfected with HA-tagged TRIM14-expressing plasmids into WT or IFNAR1 KO HepG2 cells; we found that HBV replication in IFNAR1 KO HepG2 cells was still inhibited by TRIM14 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S5</xref> in Supplementary Material). The results indicate that TRIM14 may inhibit HBV replication, at least partially, in an IFN-I-independent manner. Protein&#8211;protein interaction is perhaps the most direct pattern seen in the gene biologic function (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Based on this premise, we investigated whether TRIM14 could interact with HBV proteins. Five HBV proteins&#8212;HBV core, small S, middle S, large S, and X&#8212;were co-transfected individually with TRIM14 expression plasmids into 293 T cells. Results suggested that TRIM14 interacted with HBx, rather than with the other HBV proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A), and the interaction of TRIM14 and HBx was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S6</xref> in Supplementary Material). Given that HBx mediates viral replication through cellular protein interactions, we further created four HBx mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B) to identify the interaction region of TRIM14 and HBx. As surmised, TRIM14 bound to the 100&#8211;128 amino acid region located at the C-terminal of HBx (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C), which suggests that the interaction might inhibit the role of HBx in HBV replication. To verify whether TRIM14 inhibited HBV replication through HBx, pHBV1.2 WT or &#916;X (without HBx expression) was cotransfected with TRIM14 or empty vector into HepG2 cells; 72&#8201;h later, ELISA and qRT-PCR were performed to quantify protein levels of HBeAg, HBV DNA, and HBV pgRNA. The results indicated that HBV replication was largely inhibited in pHBV1.2&#916;X-transfected cells as compared to that in pHBV1.2WT-transfected cells; these findings suggest an important role of HBx in promoting HBV replication. Furthermore, the effect of TRIM14 inhibition on HBV replication in pHBV1.2&#916;X-transfected HepG2 cells was much less significant than that in pHBV1.2 WT-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D). This demonstrates that TRIM14 inhibited HBV replication at least partially by targeting HBx. In addition, we sought to determine whether the binding of TRIM14 has any impact on the function of HBx. Interestingly, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E, HBx and Smc5/6 significantly interacted with DDB1 in the CoIP assay; however, after co-transfection with TRIM14 plasmids, the interaction was almost blocked, which indicated that TRIM14 inhibited the formation of Smc-HBx&#8211;DDB1 complex. In addition, we found that TRIM14 significantly inhibited the degradation of Smc5/6 by HBx (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>F), and this result was similar to that obtained with the HepG2-NTCP infection system (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref> in Supplementary Material).

Therefore, characterization of the underlying mechanism of IFN-&#945;-mediated inhibition of HBV replication is a key imperative. In this study, we identified TRIM14&#8212;a molecule that appears to play a key role in the regulation of IFN signaling&#8212;as a STAT1-dependent ISG. STAT1 directly binds to the TRIM14 promoter, which is responsible for IFN-&#945;-induced TRIM14 induction. The TRIM14 SPRY domain interacts with the C-terminal of the HBx protein, and this interaction might inhibit the role of HBx in HBV replication.</p><p>IFN-Is (IFN-&#945;, -&#946;, -&#949;, and others) have been recognized as the major antiviral cytokines in vertebrates (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and constitute one of the most important innate immune responses to viral infections, including HBV infection (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). IFN-I signaling is mediated through the heterodimeric transmembrane receptor composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2; crosslinking of IFNAR1/2 results in the activation of JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2, which further induces phosphorylation of members of the STAT family, thereby facilitating their dimerization and nuclear translocation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This results in the subsequent induction of approximately 300 ISGs, which can inhibit different stages of the viral life cycle. Rapid and robust induction of IFN-I is a critical event in the host innate immune antiviral response, and the antiviral function of IFN-I is effected <italic>via</italic> the induction of these approximately 300 downstream ISGs. TRIM14 was shown to regulate IFN production and play an important role in the innate immune response (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the present study, we found that TRIM14 was induced by IFN-I in a STAT1-dependent (but not STAT3-dependent) manner, and that STAT1 directly bound to the TRIM14 promoter which activated the transcription of TRIM14. Our results clearly demonstrate the mechanism of TRIM14 production after IFN-I stimulation. We had earlier reported that IL-27 plays an important role in IFN-I-induced upregulation of TRIM25 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); however, it is interesting to note that the induction of TRIM14 by IFN-I is not IL-27-dependent. Nonetheless, IL-27 was shown to activate STAT1 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which in turn promotes the production of TRIM14.</p><p>As a positive regulator of IFN-I signaling, TRIM14 may inhibit HBV replication <italic>via</italic> amplification of IFN-I signaling (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, it is easy to understand the significant inhibitory effect of TRIM14 on HBV replication in pHBV1.2&#916;X-transfected HepG2 cells. Here, we identified TRIM14 as an IFN-I-inducible gene and showed that STAT1 (but not STAT3) was essential for the production of TRIM14. STAT1 promotes TRIM14 expression by directly binding to the promoter region of TRIM14, and overexpression of TRIM14 inhibits HBV replication. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C, the induction of TRIM14 by polyI:C is very weak; this is likely attributable to the different induction kinetics in response to different stimuli. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, TRIM14 induction was quicker in response to polydAdT. In addition, we found that TRIM14 played an important role in IFN-&#945;-mediated inhibition of HBV; however, IFN-&#945; still inhibited HBV replication in TRIM14 KO cells by inducing some other ISGs that may restrict HBV (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref> in Supplementary Material). Interestingly, HBV replication in IFNAR1 KO HepG2 cells was subdued as compared to that in WT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref> in Supplementary Material). Further investigations are required to explore the exact mechanism.</p><p>Some ISGs have already been shown to inhibit HBV replication. For example, <italic>APOBEC3A/B</italic> was shown to play a critical role in the degradation of nuclear HBV cccDNA (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and <italic>TRIM22</italic> was shown to confer antiviral immunity against HBV <italic>via</italic> its inhibitory effect on viral core promoter activity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). TRIM14 was reported to inhibit HCV replication (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); however, there are only a few reports about the function of TRIM14 in HBV replication. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that TRIM14 is a STAT1-dependent ISG and that overexpression of TRIM14 inhibits HBV replication. Our results indicated that TRIM14 interacts with the C-terminal of the HBx protein, which plays an important role in HBV replication; the C-terminal transactivation domain of HBx was adequate for a stimulation effect on HBV transcription and replication (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), which suggests that the interaction of TRIM14 and the HBx C-terminal may inhibit HBx-mediated activation of HBV gene expression from the cccDNA template (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, we found that the inhibitory effect of TRIM14 on HBV replication was much less significant in the pHBV1.2 &#916;X plasmid-transfected cells, when compared with that in pHBV1.2 WT plasmid-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A); this indicated that HBx was indeed the target of TRIM14. Several reports have shown that the HBx-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ligase complex targets the SMC5/6 complex to enhance HBV gene expression from episomal cccDNA (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). DDB1 is the best-characterized HBx-binding partner (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and their interaction is essential for HBV replication. SMC5/6 forms the foundation of a multi-subunit DNA-repair complex, and functions as a restriction factor that selectively blocks extrachromosomal DNA transcription (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the interaction of TRIM14 and HBx inhibits the formation of the HBx-DDB1&#8211;Smc5/6 complex. As expected, we found that TRIM14 interacted with the C-terminal of HBx, which inhibited the formation of Smc-HBx&#8211;DDB1 complex. DDB1 was earlier shown to stabilize HBx (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and we found that the binding of TRIM14 to HBx blocked this function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E). In addition, we observed a weak interaction of HBx with HBV core and large S protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A); this suggests that TRIM14 may play multiple roles <italic>via</italic> its interactions with other HBV proteins, and that it may influence the HBV life cycle at multiple stages. Here, we focused on HBx owing to its strong interaction with TRIM14. Our study clearly demonstrates that TRIM14 is a STAT1-dependent ISG, and that the IFN-I&#8211;TRIM14&#8211;HBx axis may explain the mechanism of IFN-induced inhibition of viral replication. Nevertheless, more research is needed to further clarify the mechanism underlying the TRIM14&#8211;HBx interaction and the role of TRIM14 in HBV infection and replication.</p><p>Based on the findings from this study, we propose a working model for IFN-I-induced TRIM14 inhibition of HBV replication by interacting with HBx (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Model depicting TRIM14 as an IFN-I-stimulated gene which controls the replication of hepatitis B virus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-09-01872-g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TRIM14 is an ISG, and the direct binding of STAT1 to the TRIM14 promoter is responsible for IFN-I-mediated TRIM14 induction. TRIM14 interacts with the C-terminal of HBx, and this interaction may inhibit HBx activity by inhibiting the formation of the Smc-HBx&#8211;DDB1 complex. Thus, an increase in TRIM14 expression may benefit HBV treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>In this study, we enrolled 16 HBV-infected patients who were treated with IFN-&#945; (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).
