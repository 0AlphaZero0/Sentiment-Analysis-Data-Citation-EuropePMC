It is well known that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are innate immune cells infiltrating inflammatory sites that are dependent on the expression of C&#8211;C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) for emigration from bone marrow. Importantly, humans with PBC have a circulating monocyte pro-inflammatory phenotype with macrophage accumulation in portal tracts. We have taken advantage of an inducible chemical xenobiotic model of PBC and recapitulated the massive infiltration of monocytes to portal areas. To determine the clinical significance, we immunized both CCR2-deficient mice and controls with 2OA-BSA and noted that CCR2 deficiency is protective for the development of autoimmune cholangitis. Importantly, because of the therapeutic potential, we focused on inhibiting monocyte infiltration through the use of cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual chemokine receptor CCR2/CCR5 antagonist shown to be safe in human trials. Importantly, treatment with CVC resulted in amelioration of all aspects of disease severity including serum total bile acids, histological severity score, and fibrosis stage. In conclusion, our results indicate a major role for Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and for CCR2 in PBC pathogenesis and suggest that inhibition of this axis by CVC should be explored in humans through the use of clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd><kwd>primary biliary cholangitis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Israel Science Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003977</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">2226/14</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100006221</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">2013297</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn03">DK067003</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="6399"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease with a female predominance characterized by nonsuppurative lymphocytic cholangitis causing immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to progressive cholestasis, biliary fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The etiology of PBC is unknown, but it is believed that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are dually involved. Hence, environmental, infectious, genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and immunological factors may account for the breakdown of immunological tolerance, and a number of xenobiotic and infectious agents have been proposed to induce the disease in genetically predisposed individuals (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), which specifically target lipoyl domain of the E2 subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC-E2), as well as PDC-specific T cells are found in 95% of the patients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Mapping of the epitopes recognized by the cellular and humoral immune response against PDC-E2 led to the observation that these sites are highly conserved molecular sequences flanking lipoic acid-binding sites (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Of note, anti-PDC-E2 antibodies from PBC patients recognize xenobiotic modified PDC-E2 peptides that mimic lipoic acid and results in higher titer reactivity than the native autoantigen. Importantly, detailed quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis identified 2-octynoic acid (2OA) as an even better xenobiotic candidate for antigenic modification of the PDC-E2 peptide (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In this respect, we have established a murine model for PBC based on immunization of mice with 2OA conjugated to bovine serum albumin (2OA-BSA) resulting in the appearance of anti-PDC-E2 antibodies and histological lesions typical of autoimmune cholangitis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Accumulative data suggest involvement of the innate immune system in PBC pathogenesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The comprehension of liver macrophages has been revolutionized by the delineation of heterogeneous subsets of these cells exhibiting functional plasticity. Kupffer cells (KCs) are a self-sustaining, liver-resident population of macrophages and can be distinguished from the recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs), which arise from circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes that rapidly accumulate in the diseased liver (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). With respect to the latter, monocytes are members of the mononuclear phagocyte system and constitutes a critical effector component of the innate immune arm. Classical Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes originate from a common myeloid progenitor cell in the bone marrow, emigrate from the bone marrow in a C&#8211;C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent manner, and released into the bloodstream as non-differentiated cells that circulate in the blood for 1&#8211;3&#8201;days (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Following their recruitment to tissues, monocytes undergo differentiation into tissue macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Following arrival to their destination, monocyte or cells differentiated from monocytes conduct versatile functions including initiation and progression of inflammation, homeostasis maintenance, host defense, and tissue remodeling and repair, depending on specific environmental signals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Several studies have suggested altered monocyte/macrophage function in PBC and accumulation of these cells in the livers of PBC patients (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Mononuclear cells expressing the low-density lipoprotein binding glycoprotein CD68 were detected in the biliary epithelial layer and periductal tissue of PBC patients, whereas in patients with viral hepatitis, these cells were scattered, and in normal livers were rarely seen around bile ducts (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These studies suggest involvement of monocyte-derived cells in PBC pathogenesis; however, solid data evaluating the importance and function of these cells in the <italic>in vivo</italic> context were missing so far.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate, by using a xenobiotic murine model of PBC, that infiltrating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are massively recruited into the portal zone of livers in a CCR2-dependent fashion. CCR2-deficient mice subjected to this model exhibit milder disease phenotype. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of monocyte infiltration by blocking CCR2/CCR5 with Cenicriviroc attenuated disease severity as assessed by serum bile acids, histological severity scoring, and liver fibrosis quantification. Our results indicate a major role for monocyte-derived cells in PBC pathogenesis and proved that targeted inhibition of these cells significantly ameliorated both liver inflammation and fibrosis. These results reinforce further investigation of this therapeutic option in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Female C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from ENVIGO. <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>gfp/+</sup>, Ccr2<sup>&#8722;/&#8722;</sup>Cx3cr1<sup>gfp/+</sup></italic> mice were kindly provided by Prof. Steffen Jung, the Weizmann Institute of Science and maintained in the animal facility of the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

We showed that these cells massively infiltrate the liver to become the dominant hepatic macrophage population in the setting of chronic cholangitis. Inhibition of the recruitment of these cells either by genetic deficiency in CCR2-deficient mice or by pharmacological inhibition of this pathway resulted in amelioration of all aspects of the pathology including portal inflammation, biochemical markers, and fibrosis.</p><p>In the setting of acute and chronic inflammation, monocyte infiltrate has the potential to aggravate the pathology by various mechanism including antigen presentation and secretion of various mediators including pro-inflammatory cytokine and factors supporting angiogenesis and fibrosis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The mechanism Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and cells derived from these cells contribute to autoimmune cholangitis is probably multifactorial and has not been elucidated in this study. Future studies utilizing <italic>in vivo</italic> tools that target-specific functions of these cells are warranted and might discover new targets to treat this pathology. Of note, other murine models of hepatic fibrosis uncovered opposing functions of hepatic macrophages during progression and regression of fibrosis. Therefore, depletion of macrophages could not only prevent fibrosis development but also delayed repair processes after cessation of the injury (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It has been suggested that fibrogenic macrophages can switch their phenotype toward restorative macrophages, which are characterized by high expression of anti-inflammatory mediators and matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thus, the overall effect of long-term inhibition of monocyte recruitment to the liver in PBC will have to be evaluated in appropriate clinical trial.</p><p>Cenicriviroc (CVC) is an orally available, dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). CVC treatment has been recently shown to ameliorate disease severity in experimental models of liver disorders including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and paracetamol induced liver injury (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). A phase 2b trial of CVC in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) showed improved fibrosis with safety and tolerability comparable to placebo (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and a phase 3 study for the treatment of liver fibrosis in adults with NASH is currently recruiting (NCT03028740). We have shown here that CVC efficiently blocked the infiltration of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to the liver in a model of autoimmune cholangitis; however, CVC inhibits also CCR5 and potentially can affect other CCR5-expressing leukocytes. We have found no effect on the hepatic recruitment of T cells, and actually the proportion of hepatic T cells out of all hepatic leukocytes increased in CVC-treated mice without affecting the ratio between hepatic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). This increase in T cell proportion is most probably due to the significant effect of CVC on monocyte and monocyte-derived cells infiltration. Of note, two recently published studies showed no effect of CVC on the hepatic recruitment of other CCR5-expressing lymphocyte populations in experimental model of acute liver injury and NASH (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). To exclude that CVC has additional effects on monocyte function, we have exposed LPS-activated THP-1 monocytic cells to various concentration of CVC and found no effect on TNF&#945; secretion (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material), corroborating previous results that demonstrated no effect of CVC on bone marrow-derived macrophage polarization (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Primary biliary cholangitis is a classic autoimmune disease characterized by the existence of antigen-specific antibodies as well as antigen-specific T cells with an identified self-antigen expressed specifically by the target tissue&#8212;the biliary epithelium (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Genome-wide association studies suggest a role for innate immunity and in particularly for mononuclear phagocytes in this pathology as manifested by polymorphism in key genes known to be expressed specifically by myeloid cells and having the potential to generate or augment immune response, e.g., <italic>Il12a, Irf5, cd80, Tnfrsf1a</italic>, and <italic>Tnfaip2</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We have previously observed an increase in the frequency and absolute numbers of circulating monocytes in patients with PBC compared with sex-matched controls of similar age (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). More important, we have demonstrated that CD14<sup>pos</sup> monocytes, the human parallel to the mice Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, isolated from patients with PBC are more sensitive to signaling <italic>via</italic> selected toll-like receptors stimulation, resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). All of the above suggested an important role for monocyte or monocyte-derived cells in PBC development; however, evidence so far was correlative. Here, we have demonstrated for the first time in the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting the crucial role of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the development of this pathology, and by inhibiting the hepatic recruitment of these cells ameliorated all aspects of the disease.</p><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the mainstay of therapy for PBC for more than two decades. However, about one-third of patients has persistent elevation of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin and considered as inadequate responders (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, was recently conditionally approved as an add-on therapy in patients with PBC who are inadequate responders to UDCA or who cannot tolerate this drug. However, about 50% of patients with PBC still lack an adequate response to a combination of UDCA and obeticholic acid (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and therefore, there is still a substantial medical need to develop new therapies for PBC.</p><p>In conclusion, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte and their progeny critically contribute to the pathogenesis of PBC and inhibition of their recruitment constitutes an attractive therapeutic avenue in patients non-responding to current available medications.
