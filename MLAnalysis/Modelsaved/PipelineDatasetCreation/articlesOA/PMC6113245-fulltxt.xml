Lack of these ligands due to genetic polymorphisms is associated with resistance to gastroenteritis caused by P[8] genotype RVAs. With the aim to delineate the contribution of HBGAs in the process, we analyzed the glycan specificity of VP8* proteins from various P genotypes. Binding to saliva of VP8* from P[8] and P[4] genotypes required expression of both FUT2 and FUT3 enzymes, whilst binding of VP8* from the P[14] genotype required FUT2 and A enzymes. We further defined a glycan motif, GlcNAc&#946;3Gal&#946;4GlcNAc, recognized by P[6] clinical strains. Conversion into Lewis antigens by the FUT3 enzyme impaired recognition, explaining their lower binding to saliva of Lewis positive phenotype. In addition, the presence of neutralizing antibodies was associated with the presence of the <italic>FUT2</italic> wild type allele in sera from young healthy adults. Nonetheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of transformed cell lines was independent of HBGAs expression, indicating that HBGAs are not human RV receptors. The match between results from saliva-based binding assays and the epidemiological data indicates that the polymorphism of human HBGAs controls susceptibility to RVAs, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation (RSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-50-00131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bovin</surname><given-names>Nicolai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsr&amp;amp;#x00E5;det (Swedish Research Council)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Svensson</surname><given-names>Lennart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GASTROVIM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Pendu</surname><given-names>Jacques</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants and children less than 5 years of age. It is a non-enveloped virus belonging to the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family. Its genome consists of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encoding six structural and five non-structural proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Structural proteins (or viral proteins VP1 to VP7) constitute the three concentric protein layers of the icosahedral capsid. The VP6 protein, forming the intermediate layer, is used for strain classification and enables the serogroup definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among the eight serogroups (A to H), only serogroups A, B and C are pathogenic for humans. However, serogroups B and C do not seem to be of epidemiological importance outside China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Two other structural proteins are used for strain classification: VP7 (G - Glycoprotein) and VP4 (P - Protease Sensitive) found on the outmost surfaces of the virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Genes encoding these proteins enable the definition of G and P genotypes respectively. Thus, 27&#8201;G genotypes and 37&#8201;P genotypes have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the majority of human cases is due to infections by G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G9P[8] genotypes of RVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. VP4 proteins form spicules which bind to molecules from the surface of enterocytes allowing entry of the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Virus infectivity is activated by proteolytic cleavage of VP4 and thus of the outer layer of the capsid, generating the VP5* and VP8* proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The VP8* protein, the globular head of the spike, is believed to be involved in the attachment of virions to host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and the VP5* protein, the stalk of the spike, in the translocation of the double-shelled particles into the cytoplasm through conformational rearrangements and membrane fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Based on a sensitivity test to sialidase, cell attachment and entry of RVs have long been considered to be dependent or independent on the presence of sialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates such as gangliosides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that only a few P genotypes of animal strains are &#8220;sialidase-sensitive&#8221; whereas human strains and the majority of animal strains are &#8220;sialidase-insensitive&#8221;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, most sialidases cleave only terminal sialic acids on glycoconjugates, without affecting sub-terminal sialic acids and more recent studies concluded that the sialic acid-independent human strains may recognize sialic acids internally located in the glycan chain like on the ganglioside GM1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. RVs may also interact with other cell surface molecules including integrins and the heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc70)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Recent studies also suggested that the cell attachment protein VP8* can interact specifically with Histo-Blood Group Antigens (HBGAs), namely the ABH and Lewis antigens. These are complex carbohydrates found on the surface of many cell types, including epithelial intestinal cells and as free molecules in biologic fluids, such as saliva and milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The biosynthesis pathway of HBGAs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) starts with a disaccharide precursor followed by sequential additions of monosaccharides catalyzed by glycosyltransferases encoded by three major genes, the <italic>ABO</italic>, secretor (<italic>FUT2</italic>) and Lewis (<italic>FUT3</italic>) genes. Each comprises silent alleles, leading to null phenotypes in the homozygous state. An initial study showed a specific binding of recombinant VP8* proteins from clinical and cell culture-adapted strains with human saliva, milk or synthetic HBGA oligosaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Human strains of P[4] and P[8] genotypes showed a specific binding to H type 1 and Lewis b antigens whereas P[6] strains recognized H type 1 only.

Other studies also documented that P[9], P[14] and P[25] strains interact with the A antigen and that this interaction is involved in the infection <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Biosynthesis pathway of HBGAs. HBGAs are synthesized by sequential addition of a monosaccharide to the terminal disaccharide of a precursor glycan. The synthesis pathways with type 1 and 2 precursors are considered here. Glycosidic linkages are separated by a forward slash to specify the pathway for different chains. The FUT2 and FUT3 fucosyltransferases drive the biosynthesis of secretor (Se) and Lewis (Le) antigens respectively by catalyzing the linkage-specific addition of &#945;-fucose residues. Enzymes A and B catalyze the linkage-specific addition of N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose, respectively. Additions of glycans by enzymes A, B and FUT2 to the galactose residue of the precursor result in ABH HBGAs. Addition of &#945;-fucose to the N-acetylglucosamine residue by FUT3 enzyme yields Lewis antigens (Lewis a/x, Lewis b/y, A Lewis b/y, B Lewis b/y).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_31005_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e458"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">H type 1, Lewis b and A antigens have in common a fucose residue, &#945;(1,2)-linked onto a galactose residue. This fucose is added by the &#945;(1,2)-fucosyltransferase enzyme encoded by the <italic>FUT2</italic> gene, responsible for the &#8220;secretor&#8221; phenotype (SE). Lewis antigens also present a fucose residue, &#945;(1,3/4)-linked onto a N-acetylglucosamine residue. It is added by the &#945;(1,3/4)-fucosyltransferase enzyme encoded by the <italic>FUT3</italic> gene, responsible for the &#8220;Lewis positive&#8221; phenotype (Le<sup>+</sup>).</p><p id="Par6">Mutations in <italic>FUT2</italic> or <italic>FUT3</italic> lead to a total absence or a severe decrease of the corresponding fucosyltransferase activity, ultimately causing the absence of &#945;(1,2)- or &#945;(1,3/4)-fucosylated antigens in mucous membranes and secretions. This determines the &#8220;non-secretor&#8221; (se) phenotype (or FUT2<sup>&#8722;</sup>) and the &#8220;Lewis negative&#8221; phenotype (or FUT3<sup>&#8722;</sup>). In a previous study, our team documented that the &#8220;non-secretor&#8221; phenotype was associated with resistance to severe gastroenteritis caused by P[8] human strains of RVA, which are predominant in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, the results of the study suggested that the recognition of &#945;(1,2)-fucosylated antigens by the VP8* protein could be essential for symptomatic infection by P[8] strains. Other epidemiological studies confirmed and completed these results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Recent studies further underscored the importance of the secretor status by showing elevated RV specific antibodies in the serum and saliva of secretor individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Only one study performed in Tunisia showed some discrepancy with these findings for P[8] strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Currently, two live-attenuated vaccines are licensed and available in many countries. Since their introduction, the number of deaths associated with RV infection has decreased from 450,000 to about 200,000 in 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The monovalent Rotarix<sup>&#174;</sup> vaccine (Glaxo-SmithKline) is derived from an attenuated human strain of G1P[8] genotype and the pentavalent RotaTeq<sup>&#174;</sup> vaccine (Merck) uses a bovine strain as genetic basis for five reassortants with human G1, G2, G3, G4 and P[8]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. According to recent studies, currently licensed vaccines are very effective (from 70 to more than 90% of protection) in high-income countries, but much less (20 to 30%) in low-income countries, which are the most affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Reasons for this lack of efficacy are not fully understood yet and probably multifactorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, since both vaccines include a live-attenuated RV of P[8] genotype, the fact that Lewis negative children are resistant to P[8] strains could contribute to explain the reduced efficacy of vaccines in countries where the frequency of Lewis negative individuals is greater, such as Africa.</p><p id="Par8">In light of these results, we make the hypothesis that RVA would first bind to fucosylated structures through their VP8* protein and secondly to sialic acids residues on gangliosides or to other cell surface receptors such as integrins or hsc70<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which would mediate virus entry. This hypothesis accounts for the fact that fucosylated structures are accessible in the glycocalyx thick layer, which length is around 500&#8201;nm on small intestine enterocytes, far more than gangliosides that extend no more than a few nanometers above the lipid bilayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. With the aim to delineate the relative contribution of HBGAs in the infection process and to explore the consequences of HBGAs polymorphism on the virus transmission and efficacy of the available vaccines, we investigated the HBGA specificity of VP8* proteins from strains of various P genotypes, including the vaccine strains and the effect of HBGAs synthesis blockade on the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of susceptible cells. We further analyzed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera from young healthy adults of known HBGA types.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>P[8] and P[4] VP8* proteins bind to difucosylated structures</title><p id="Par9">We started by studying the binding of recombinant VP8* proteins from human strains to HBGAs by saliva-based binding assay since human saliva contains mucins that bear HBGAs, similar to those present at the surface of the small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. VP8* proteins from vaccine strains (Rotarix P[8] and RotaTeq P[8]), cell culture-adapted strains (Wa P[8] and DS-1 P[4]) and three representative P[8] clinical strains (287, 183 and 134) were tested for binding to a panel of previously well-defined A, B, O, secretor and Lewis types saliva samples. The binding profile of VP8* proteins to HBGAs was identical for all the P[8] and P[4] strains tested, regardless of whether they were cell culture-adapted, vaccine or recent clinical strains (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We observed a binding to mucins from secretor and Lewis positive (SE/Le<sup>+</sup>) individuals significantly greater than the one observed with mucins of individuals either secretor but Lewis negative (SE/le<sup>&#8722;</sup>), or non-secretor regardless of their Lewis phenotype (se/Le<sup>+</sup> and se/le<sup>&#8722;</sup>) for which there was little or no binding at all (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 or p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). Thus, the combination of SE and Le<sup>+</sup> phenotypes appears to be the minimum requirement for P[8] and P[4] VP8* proteins to bind to human salivary mucins. SE/Le<sup>+</sup> samples specifically contain the Lewis b difucosylated epitope (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Furthermore, direct binding of P[8] and P[4] VP8* to the difucosylated A Lewis b heptasaccharide was observed, whilst no binding occurred to related monofucosylated or non-fucosylated immobilized oligosaccharides, indicating requirement of the difucosylated Lewis b motif for binding (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Additionally, within the SE/Le<sup>+</sup> group, the ABO phenotype showed an effect with a significantly greater binding to O blood group mucins compared to B blood group mucins (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01 or p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Most P[8] VP8* proteins (Rotarix, RotaTeq, Wa, 287 and 134) showed an enhanced recognition of A blood group mucins as compared to B blood group mucins (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 or p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Two P[8] VP8* proteins (287 and 183) revealed a stronger binding to O blood group mucins than to A blood group mucins (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01 and p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Binding of the DS-1 P[4] strain to the A blood group antigen was previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Yet, we failed to reveal a higher binding to saliva from the A blood group secretor phenotype as compared to O or B phenotypes. Consistently, no binding to the monofucosylated A blood group antigen by the P[4] DS-1 was observed using neoglyconjugates (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Moreover, saliva samples from the A SE/le<sup>&#8722;</sup> subtype were hardly recognized, unlike those from the A SE/Le<sup>+</sup> subtype, indicating that the difucosylated motif, not the A epitope by itself, is the dominant binding epitope for the DS-1 strain, similar to the P[8] strains (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that expression of difucosylated structures, requiring both FUT2 and FUT3 enzymes for their expression, is essential for efficient attachment of P[8] and P[4] VP8* proteins. The effect of the ABO phenotype, with a binding to saliva samples from blood group O&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;A&#8201;&gt;&#8201;B, suggests hindrance of the difucosylated ligand by addition of the galactose and for some strains of the N-acetylgalactosamine residues that constitute the B and A antigens respectively.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Binding of human strains VP8* to HBGAs measured by saliva-based binding assay.

We observed a preferential binding to Lewis negative saliva samples, irrespective of the secretor status (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). As this binding was not correlated with expression of the previously suggested H type 1 ligand (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), we performed a synthetic oligosaccharide-based binding assay. This showed that P[6] VP8* proteins could bind to the Tk antigen, Le<sup>c</sup> 3&#8242;-LacNAc and GlcNAc3&#8242;-LacNAc6&#8242;-LacNAc (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref> and Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

Substitution of its terminal N-acetylglucosamine at position 4, giving either a type 2 precursor or the Lewis antigen, was not tolerated.

Branching of the glycan chain generated by addition of an N-acetylglucosamine residue in &#946;6 linkage did not appear to influence the binding either. Overall, these data strongly suggest that precursor structures, including the extended type 1 precursor Gal&#946;3GlcNAc&#946;3Gal&#946;4GlcNAc-R constitute the ligand of P[6] VP8* proteins. This motif is available in the highest amounts on mucins from Lewis negative individuals since it is not masked by addition of the &#945;1,4-linked fucose by the FUT3 enzyme.

First, the expression of HBGAs on susceptible cells (HT-29, MA-104, Vero and Caco-2) was blocked using 2F-fucose, a metabolic inhibitor of fucosylation. Treatment efficacy was controlled by assessing expression of various HBGAs by flow cytometry. Control HT-29 cells, cultured in the presence of DMSO, express H, A and Lewis antigens. Expression of these structures on 2F-fucose-treated HT-29 cells was fully or substantially suppressed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

Infection by the sialic acid-dependent SA11 animal strain of P[2] genotype was used as control. It confirmed that fucosylation was not needed for infection by this strain since no significant decrease in infection was detected (Figs&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). For the P[14] HAL1166 strain, there was a significant decrease in infection of 2F-fucose-treated HT-29 cells compared to control cells.

Finally, no matter what strain was used, 2F-fucose treatment of other susceptible cell lines (MA-104, Vero and Caco-2) had no effect on infection (Figs&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).

However, in accordance with a previous study showing abrogation of virus infectivity in HT-29 cells by anti-A type antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, our data indicate that fucosylation and more specifically synthesis of the A antigen is essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> infection by the P[14] HAL1166 strain.

Additionally, the study conducted in Burkina Faso, showed that no Secretor/Lewis negative child with gastroenteritis was infected by P[8] strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, the same study indicated that in case of infection by P[6] strains, Lewis negative children were at a greater risk of being among patients than Lewis positive children, regardless of their secretor status. These concordant data provide strong evidence that <italic>FUT2</italic> (secretor) and <italic>FUT3</italic> (Lewis) genetic polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to major strains of RVs and therefore that HBGAs are involved in the infection process. Nonetheless, how and where in the body this takes place remains unclear.</p><p id="Par15">In the present study, we produced VP8* proteins from clinical, vaccine and cell culture-adapted strains of several P genotypes, looking for relationships between their epidemiological profiles and their binding patterns to saliva samples of different HBGA types. There was no difference between the HBGA binding profiles of clinical and cell culture-adapted P[8] strains, indicating that HBGA binding was not a cell culture adaptation. We documented that all P[8] and P[4] VP8* proteins require both the secretor and Lewis fucosyltransferases (FUT2 and FUT3) for binding to saliva, indicating recognition of difucosylated structures. This is consistent with earlier results showing binding of P[8] and P[4] VP8* proteins to the Lewis b antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and to saliva samples from secretor individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> observed a binding to the H type 1 antigen for P[8] and P[4] strains. However, saliva samples of secretor Lewis negative individuals (expressing the H type 1 antigen, but not the Lewis b antigen) were not recognized in our study. It is important to note that in the same study Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> observed specific binding of purified Wa triple layer particles to secretor Lewis b positive, but not to secretor Lewis b negative saliva samples, suggesting that binding to synthetic oligosaccharides may not perfectly mimic the natural ligands found on mucins. Regardless, the match between the results from the saliva binding assay and the epidemiological data suggests that the difucosylated Lewis b antigen may be a functional ligand <italic>in vivo</italic> for P[8] strains. P[8] and P[4] strains are the most commonly encountered worldwide and among the HBGA subgroups, the secretor and Lewis positive subgroup, which is preferentially recognized by P[8] and P[4] VP8*, is the most common (around 72&#8211;76% of the population in Europe). Behind P[8] and P[4], the P[6] genotype constitutes the third major P genotype of human RVs. Hence, we then investigated the binding of VP8* from two P[6] strains isolated in Burkina Faso. We observed that P[6] VP8* proteins bind preferentially to Lewis negative saliva samples, irrespective of the secretor status. This is consistent with findings of the epidemiological study conducted in Burkina Faso which showed that these same P[6] strains caused disease among Lewis negative children mainly, independent of their secretor status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, again illustrating the match between the saliva binding assay and epidemiological data. We observed that the glycan motif recognized by these clinical P[6] strains is a precursor structure comprised in the type 1 precursor Gal&#946;3GlcNAc&#946;3Gal&#946;4GlcNAc, although the terminal galactose does not appear to contribute much to the binding. Conversion into Lewis antigens by the FUT3 enzyme, as occurs in Lewis positive individuals, impaired recognition, explaining the lower binding to saliva of this phenotype. Our results are also compatible with those of previous studies showing binding to a group of long glycans containing the type 1 precursor HBGA terminal sequences, with or without the H epitope, but without the Lewis epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Another previous study reported binding of the VP8* from a P[6] strain to A blood group oligosaccharide in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> which contradicts the epidemiological data where a lower frequency of the A blood group was found among ill children infected by P[6] strains in comparison with the O blood group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This discrepancy may be due to the use of an oligosaccharide in solution or of a cell culture-adapted strain. P[6] strains that have been most frequently found in individuals of the Lewis negative phenotype are seldom encountered in Europe where this phenotype represents only 5&#8211;10% of the population. Interestingly, its frequency can be as high as 30% in some Latino-American and African populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> where those strains are more common. Since mucins from Lewis positive individuals also contain the un-substituted type 1 precursor, albeit in lower amount than Lewis negative individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, Lewis positive children may also be infected, although less frequently, increasing to some extent the pool of susceptible individuals in the population.</p><p id="Par16">We then extended the study to the binding of VP8* proteins from two cell culture-adapted strains: the HAL1166 sialidase-insensitive human strain of P[14] genotype and the SA11 sialidase-sensitive animal strain of P[2] genotype. We found that the HAL1166 VP8* proteins exclusively recognize mucins expressing the A antigen. This is in agreement with other studies showing that P[14] VP8* proteins recognize the type A HBGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As previously suggested by Liu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the fact that P[14] strains recognize the A antigen, which is a common carbohydrate shared between species, could explain why they are capable of causing disease to both human and other mammals. P[9], P[14] and P[25] strains exclusively recognize A blood group individuals who represent between 8&#8211;35% of the population depending on geographical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Although, as yet, there is no epidemiological evidence indicating that only A blood group secretors are susceptible to disease due to these strains, it is likely that the limited frequency of this phenotype is too low to sustain transmission in humans, therefore explaining why they are seldom encountered. Collectively these observations point to a relationship between the frequency of genetically susceptible individuals in the population and the circulation of the viral strains.</p><p id="Par17">VP8* from the SA11 sialidase-sensitive animal strain did not bind to human salivary mucins. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the most common sialic acid family members with Neu5Gc differing from Neu5Ac by an additional hydroxyl group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a previous study showed that Triple-Layered Particles (TLPs) from the SA11 strain strongly bind to the ganglioside NeuGc-GM3, while they do not bind to NeuAc-GM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, the lack of binding to human saliva could be due to the absence of NeuGc, which is not expressed in normal human tissues but can be found in most mammalian tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. This could explain why P[2] strains can infect a wide variety of animal species, whilst the lack of binding to human saliva is associated with the lack of human infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">In addition to the glycan specificity of P[8] and P[4] strains VP8*, we also investigated the relationship between the RV-specific neutralizing antibodies in sera from healthy French blood donors and their <italic>FUT2</italic> genotype. The presence of neutralizing antibodies is the result of previous infections and constitutes an indirect marker of virus susceptibility. Here, we showed that the probability of having neutralizing antibodies was associated with the presence of the <italic>FUT2</italic> wild type allele. This is concordant with results of previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> suggesting that individuals with a secretor phenotype might be more susceptible to disease caused by RV infections as compared to non-secretors. Nonetheless, the fact that non-secretor individuals also exhibited neutralizing antibodies suggests that children with this HBGA phenotype might be somewhat susceptible to infection by P[4] or P[8] strains that constitute the vast majority of strains circulating in France<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, or they might have been infected by strains of other P types that generated heterotypic antibodies. An alternative explanation for the observed relationship between the <italic>FUT2</italic> polymorphism and the RV-specific neutralizing antibodies levels might stem from the impact of the <italic>FUT2</italic> polymorphism on the microbiota composition that in turn would influence the antibody response to RV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Several reports described associations between the <italic>FUT2</italic> genotype and the gut microbiota composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Yet, recent studies performed on large cohorts failed to confirm these associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the microbiota composition of our cohort of 75 volunteers was determined. No significant association was found with the <italic>FUT2</italic> genotypes, ruling out this possibility (to be published elsewhere).</p><p id="Par19">The fact that the HBGA recognition is conserved between recent (clinical strains) and older (Wa and vaccine strains) P[8] strains suggests that HBGAs polymorphism may contribute to explain the modest efficacy of vaccines in areas where the frequency of FUT2 negative (non-secretor) and/or FUT3 negative (Lewis negative) individuals is high since these are areas where strains of other P types such as P[6] circulate most readily, as discussed above. It is also interesting to note that within the secretor/Lewis positive subgroup, we observed an effect of the ABO phenotype on binding to saliva samples of all P[8] strains. These results are in agreement with a previous study showing a lower binding of P[8] VP8* to blood type B saliva samples, suggesting also hindrance by addition of the galactose residue constituting the B antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two recent studies conducted in Pakistan and Nicaragua, reported lower seroconversion rates after vaccination in nonsecretors as well as in non-blood group O secretors or B blood group secretors respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The concordance of these new observations with the HBGA specificity of the vaccines VP8* strongly suggests that the <italic>FUT2</italic> and <italic>ABO</italic> gene polymorphisms might impact the quality of immunization. Further epidemiological studies would be necessary to confirm these results and clarify whether the combinations of <italic>ABO</italic>, <italic>FUT2</italic> and <italic>FUT3</italic> subtypes and their variable frequencies among populations can contribute to explain the lower efficacy of RVA vaccines in some countries.</p><p id="Par20">Since as described above, multiple studies point towards an essential role of HBGA-binding in the infection process, we studied the effect of fucose synthesis blockade on <italic>in vitro</italic> infection. That led us to conclude that fucosylation is essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of HT-29 cells by the P[14] HAL1166 strain but it is not a requirement for infection of various cell lines by P[8] and P[4] strains. These findings suggest that HBGA-binding could be an early event which is not involved in the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of poorly differentiated cells. Alternatively, the presence of HBGAs might enhance viral replication and development of the disease but not be essential for infection in the strict sense. The use of more sophisticated cellular models such as Human Intestinal Enteroids (HIEs), will be necessary to clarify this point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, our findings further indicate that human HBGAs expressed on host cells or digestive tissues may be used by the major P genotypes of circulating RVs as attachment factors or receptors. Alongside epidemiological data, this suggests that genetically controlled polymorphic human HBGAs affect the phylogeographic distribution of these viruses. Differential expression or frequency of HBGAs could also be of major importance in the host tropism and transmission of RVs between human and animal species. More experimental data are required to elucidate the mechanisms whereby HBGAs impact RV infection and disease. These data would be of primary interest for optimization of current vaccines or development of new vaccine strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Production of VP8* proteins</title><p id="Par22">Plasmids expressing the gene encoding the VP8* core proteins were synthesized by GeneART (Rotarix (P[8]), RotaTeq (P[8] strain) and SA11 (P[2])), cloned from cell culture-adapted virus (HAL1166 (P[14]), DS-1 (P[4]) and Wa (P[8])) or directly isolated from clinical stool samples (French isolates 134, 183, 287 (P[8]) and Burkinabe isolates 225 and 268 (P[6])) (see supplementary methods for GenBank accession numbers) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In brief, complementary DNA produced from viral dsRNA by reverse transcription was used as template for PCR with specific primers to produce the VP8* gene fragment. VP8* gene fragments were cloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) between the SalI and BamHI sites. The final expression plasmid encoded for amino acids 46 to 224 of the VP4 protein fused to an N-terminal GST protein. After confirmation of the inserts through DNA sequencing, protein expression was performed mostly as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Expression of recombinant proteins by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was induced at 22&#8201;&#176;C overnight by isopropyl &#946;-D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4&#8201;mM. Frozen cell pellets were thawed in PBS. GST fusion proteins were sequentially extracted/purified from cells as follows: sonication/chemical lysis (1% Triton X-100), centrifugation, GSTrap column capture and ion exchange chromatography purification. The possible high-molecular weight (MW) complex formation was examined using size exclusion gel filtration (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fractions of intermediate size were used for further work and kept at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The concentration of the purified VP8* was determined by measuring absorbance at 280&#8201;nm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>VP8* binding to HBGAs</title><p id="Par23">The binding of VP8* to HBGAs was measured by saliva- and synthetic oligosaccharide-based binding assays. A panel of previously well-defined A, B, O, secretor and Lewis types saliva samples was used as source of HBGAs (see supplementary methods for more information) in the saliva-based binding assays which were performed mostly as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Briefly, boiled saliva samples were diluted at 1:1,000 in 0.1&#8201;M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 and coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC MaxiSorp) at 4&#8201;&#176;C overnight.

After blocking with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, GST-VP8* protein at 5 to 20&#8201;&#956;g/ml was added and incubated at 4&#8201;&#176;C overnight. The bound VP8* proteins were detected using a rat anti-serum to VP8* (see supplementary methods and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref> for more information) at 1:500 followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:5,000. In each step, the plates were incubated for 1&#8201;h at 37&#8201;&#176;C and washed three times with PBS &#8722; 0.05% Tween 20. The signal intensities were displayed using a 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-Tetramethylbenzidine kit (BD OptEIA, BD Biosciences) and the absorbance was measured at 450&#8201;nm using a microplate absorbance reader (iMark, Bio-Rad). For the saliva-based binding assays, raw absorbance data are shown and background noise was comprised between 0.05 and 0.1. For the synthetic oligosaccharide-based binding assays, background noise was subtracted from raw data and was around 0.1. Saliva samples collection was approved by the Nantes University Hospital Review Board (study no.
