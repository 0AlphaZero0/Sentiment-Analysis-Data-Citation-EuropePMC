Integrin inactivation plays a major role in the process but the exact signalling pathway is ill-defined. Here we identify an anoikis pathway using gliotoxin (GT), a virulence factor of the fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, which causes invasive aspergillosis in humans. GT prevents integrin binding to RGD-containing extracellular matrix components by covalently modifying cysteines in the binding pocket. As a consequence, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is inhibited resulting in dephosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, allowing activation of RhoA. Sequential activation of ROCK, MKK4/MKK7 and JNK then triggers pro-apoptotic phosphorylation of Bim. Cells in suspension or lacking integrin surface expression are insensitive to GT but are sensitised to ROCK-MKK4/MKK7-JNK-dependent anoikis upon attachment to fibronectin or integrin upregulation. The same signalling pathway is triggered by FAK inhibition or inhibiting integrin &#945;V/&#946;3 with Cilengitide. Thus, GT can target integrins to induce anoikis on lung epithelial cells.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Gliotoxin (GT), produced by the pulmonary pathogen <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, induces detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) of lung epithelial cells and likely promotes invasion.

Lack of anoikis is a hallmark of cancer progression as cells that continue to survive in suspension are prone to metastasise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Originally described by Frisch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, anoikis is typically induced by detaching cells with trypsin and preventing their re-attachment to polyHEMA-coated plates. However, this system is artificial as trypsin inappropriately modifies adhesion molecules leading to the activation of signalling pathways that may not reflect physiological ways of anoikis.</p><p id="Par4">Cells attach to the extracellular matrix via integrins. Integrins consist of transmembrane &#945; and &#946; chains, which form at their extracellular N termini an interaction interface with the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif of matrix components such as fibronectin or vitronectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. On the intracellular side integrins recruit components that link adhesion signals to cell survival, cell cycle control and cytoskeletal rearrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Key players are focal adhesion kinase (FAK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, integrin-linked kinase (ILK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and Src tyrosine kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. FAK is autophosphorylated at Y397 upon integrin activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and subsequently phosphorylates adapter molecules such as paxillin, vinculin and Rho-, Rac- and Cdc42 GTPase-modulating proteins to regulate the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

Alternatively, so called BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family sense apoptotic signals and convey them to Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The subsequent release of cytochrome c induces the formation of the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome, which results in caspase-3 activation. Although evidence was initially presented that death receptor signalling via FasL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and/or FADD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> plays a role in anoikis induction, this could not be confirmed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. By contrast, several cellular processes seem to block mitochondrial apoptosis signalling in adherent cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Activation of AKT, elicited by integrin engagement, leads to the phosphorylation of the BH3-only proteins Bad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and Bim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which are sequestered and inactivated by 14-3-3 proteins. AKT also inhibits Forkhead transcription factors (FOXOs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which are responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of the BH3-only proteins Bim, Puma and Bmf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, both ERK-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and PI3K/AKT-mediated phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> of Bim lead to its proteasomal degradation. However, it has been unclear if activation of these BH3-only proteins during anoikis is indeed linked to AKT and/or ERK inhibition.</p><p id="Par6">The mould <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> causes a severe pulmonary disease termed invasive aspergillosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Under healthy conditions, airborne conidia released by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> are successfully eliminated from the pulmonary cavities by alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and leucocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

The breakage of the epithelial barrier is the most likely cause for the invasive property of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role of the major virulence factor gliotoxin (GT) in this process because fungi lacking GT production are much less virulent than wild-type (WT) strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

However, when the cells were treated with 10&#8201;ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), they largely upregulated active integrins &#945;V, &#946;1 and &#946;3 on their surface (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c&#8211;e</xref>) and became sensitive to GT-induced cell detachment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), MKK4, JNK and Bim phosphorylation and caspase-3 processing (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>) and activation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Similarly, BAF3 suspension cells made adherent by plating them on fibronectin-coated plates overnight displayed activated surface integrins as evidenced by RGD staining (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8B</xref>) and acquired sensitivity to GT-induced detachment (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8A</xref>), caspase-3 processing (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8D</xref>), apoptosis (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8C</xref>) and activation of the same MKK4/JNK signalling pathway (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8D</xref>) as previously seen in BEAS-2B cells.

However, in contrast to GT, the cells treated with Cilengitide detached in clusters (instead of single cells) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7E</xref>), and FAK dephoshorylation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7F</xref>) and subsequent anoikis signalling were less pronounced and delayed (Supplementary Fig&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7G-I</xref>). This was also true when Cilengitide was combined with an anti-integrin &#945;5/&#946;1 inhibitory antibody, which was ineffective alone and did not further enhance Cilengitide-induced anoikis (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7I</xref>). This might be due to the fact that Cilengitide, even at a concentration where it also affects integrin &#946;1, does not inhibit all forms of integrins. Indeed, Affymetrix Gene Array and RNAseq analysis of BEAS-2B cells revealed the expression of at least 13 integrin genes with ITGB1 (integrin &#946;1), ITGA3 (integrin &#945;3) and ITGAV (integrin &#945;V) being expressed the highest (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4D</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4E</xref>). While GT induces maximal cell detachment and anoikis because it targets cysteines in the RGD&#160;binding groove, which are conserved among all integrins, we would need a combination of several inhibitory integrin antibodies to achieve the same effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">Here we used GT, the major virulence factor of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, to identify a novel anoikis signalling pathway. GT qualifies for an anoikis inducer for the following reasons: (i) it induces rapid cell detachment prior to apoptosis induction; (ii) it can directly modify N-terminal cysteines of &#945; and &#946; chains of integrins thereby interfering with their binding to extracellular matrix components; and (iii) it cannot kill suspension cells of the hematopoietic system and does not activate the anoikis signalling pathway in these cells. Only when suspension cells are made adherent, i.e., either plated on fibronectin or induced to express integrins on their surface, they become sensitive to GT-induced anoikis via the same signalling pathway as epithelial cells. Although we provide compelling evidence that GT can directly target integrins by modifying cysteines at the RGD&#160;binding interface, we cannot exclude that it also modifies and disrupts binding domains in other adhesion molecules, including inflammatory receptors or cadherins. Indeed, we found that E-cadherin could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GT antibodies. This may explain why cells treated with GT detach as single cells while those treated with integrin inhibitory antibodies or compounds detach as cell sheets. Further studies are needed to identify the impact of GT on signalling pathways regulated by cadherins.</p><p id="Par28">Protection from anoikis was suggested to involve activation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

This indicated that GT uses a JNK-dependent, but ERK/AKT-independent pathway for anoikis signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Previously, Stupack et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> reported that unligated integrins or &#946;-integrin tails recruit caspase-8 to the membrane and induce apoptosis distinct from anoikis in death receptor-independent manner. We therefore tested if caspase-8 was activated and required for GT-induced apoptosis. However, while recombinant FasL rapidly activated caspase-8 in BEAS-2B cells, we did not detect any caspase-8 activation after GT treatment for up to 6&#8201;h (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9A</xref>). Moreover, knocking down caspase-8 expression did not affect the kinetics of GT-induced anoikis but it blocked FasL-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9B</xref>). Thus, GT uses a JNK-dependent, but ERK/AKT- and caspase-8-independent pathway for anoikis signalling.</p><p id="Par30">JNK/c-Jun-induced transcription in response to lysophosphatidic acid was previously shown to be mediated by RhoA-ROCK-MKK4 signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

However, in this case ROCK was activated by caspase-3-mediated cleavage, which occurs downstream of cytochrome c release. Although we cannot exclude a cytoskeletal involvement for GT-induced, ROCK-mediated anoikis, our data show that ROCK does not signal back to focal adhesions (FAK) but stimulates the downstream phosphorylation/activation of MKK4 and MKK7 essential for anoikis. The precise mechanism of this activation is not yet understood. It either occurs through intermediate kinases such as MLK or ASK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and/or the scaffold proteins hCNK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> or JIP-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, which were shown to link ROCK to JNK activation.
