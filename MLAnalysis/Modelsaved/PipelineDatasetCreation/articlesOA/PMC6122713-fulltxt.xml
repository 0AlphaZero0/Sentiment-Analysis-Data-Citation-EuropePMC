Previous studies show that this disorder predominantly occurs in peripheral or small-airway areas, whereas the same condition has not been identified in the larger airways during the course of COPD. However, the different biochemical and genetic alterations occurring in response to CS exposure among airway epithelial cells from different sites in the lungs have not been fully investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) were exposed to CS extract (CSE), and microarray analysis was used to determine gene- and protein-expression profiles and identify alterations following CSE exposure in both cell types. An in vivo smoking experiment was also performed to confirm differential responses to CS between sites in the lung.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Microarray analysis of SAECs and NHBEs following 24&#160;h of CSE exposure showed that inflammatory related pathways and terms, including the tumor necrosis factor-signaling pathway, were overrepresented, especially in SAECs. Clustering analysis highlighted <italic>prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2</italic> [also known as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2] as a gene specifically upregulated in SAECs, with COX-2 mRNA and protein expression significantly elevated by CSE exposure in SAECs (3.1- and 3.1-fold, respectively), but not in NHBEs. Furthermore, time-course analysis of COX-2 expression revealed earlier increases in SAECs compared with NHBEs following CS exposure. Short-term exposure of mouse lungs to CS was found to predominantly induce COX-2 expression in the small airway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The small airway is more susceptible to CSE than the large airway and could be the initial site of development of CS-related respiratory diseases, such as COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12890-018-0715-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cigarette smoke</kwd><kwd>Airway epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>Small airway</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Cyclooxygenase-2</kwd><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26461199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institute for Environmental and Gender-Specific Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine</institution></funding-source><award-id>E2920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">Cigarette smoke (CS) produces oxidant and reactive oxygen species in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the unfavorable impacts of CS represent a primary cause of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a leading contributor to preventable morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preventing CS-related diseases can be best achieved by avoiding smoking initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; however, when the smoking habit has already started, smoking cessation considerably decreases numerous adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Intervention by smoking cessation during the early stages of COPD can decrease the rate of lung-function loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, CS-induced oxidant burden can irreversibly change endogenous antioxidant protection in airways. CS-derived oxidants injure airway epithelial cells by affecting lipid-membrane, carbohydrate, protein, and DNA structures and lead to the persistent inflammation evident in COPD development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In addition to its status as a leading cause of mortality worldwide, COPD is also the only major cause of death that continues to increase annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Two main features of COPD include progressive limitation of expiratory airflow, which is not completely reversible, and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hogg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] suggested that the initial locus of inflammation in COPD is the small airways represented by membranous (diameter, &lt;&#8201;2&#160;mm), terminal and respiratory bronchioles. In smokers, the small airways show structural abnormalities, with or without COPD. The relationship between inflammatory mucus exudates from airway lumen and COPD severity was investigated by analyzing lung tissue from patients with all clinical stages of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], revealing that small-airway obstruction associated with COPD is related to thickening of the airway wall as a consequence of the remodelling process marked by mucociliary clearance-component malfunction and tissue repair related to innate-immune mechanisms, finally resulting in acculumation of lumen inflammatory exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A more recent study from the same group, based on multidetector computed tomography obtained from patients at various stages of COPD, showed that narrowing and loss of small conducting airways occurs before the emphysematous changes associated with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the genetic and biochemical alterations involved in responses to CS exposure by airway epithelial cells from different sites in the lungs have not been fully investigated.</p><p id="Par24">In this study, we investigated the response to CS in two commercially available human airway epithelial cell lines [small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs)]. SAECs were isolated from the distal portion of a healthy lung in the 1-mm bronchiole area, and NHBEs were derived from the epithelial lining of airways above the bifurcation of the lung (according to documentation from Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). We explored the genetic differences between SAECs and NHBEs during the initial phase of CS-exposure using microarray analysis and performed in vivo smoking experiments using a mouse model to confirm that cells from different lung sites respond differently to CS exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of CS extract</title><p id="Par25">CS extract (CSE) was prepared using commercially marketed Peace unfiltered cigarettes (29&#160;mg of tar and 2.5&#160;mg of nicotine per cigarette; Japan Tobacco, Tokyo, Japan).

Pilot cell-growth experiments showed that concentrations of &#8804;2.5% CSE were not cytotoxic; therefore, cultured cells were exposed to 2.5% CSE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par26">SAECs and NHBEs were purchased from Lonza. Three batches of each cell type, each originally isolated from three different healthy never-smoker donors, were used.

COX-2 is not expressed under normal conditions in most cells; however, elevated levels are observed during inflammation. Furthermore, our previous studies identified a relationship between COX-2 and the abnormal inflammatory response in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated COX-2 mRNA and protein expression following exposure to CSE. After 24&#160;h of exposure, COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were both significantly elevated in SAECs (3.1- and 3.1-fold compared with no CSE treatment, respectively), but not in NHBEs (1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). To explore the mechanism of COX-2 overproduction in SAECs, we performed time-course analysis of COX-2 expression in response to CSE exposure in NHBEs and SAECs.

Microarray analysis revealed that small airways showed higher susceptibility to CS compared with large airways and displayed enhanced expression of genes associated with inflammation-related pathways, including TNF-signaling. Among TNF-pathway related genes, <italic>PTGS2</italic>, also known as <italic>COX-2</italic>, showed the greatest difference in expression levels, with higher CSE-induced increases in both mRNA and protein expression in SAECs compared with NHBEs. In vivo short-duration smoking experiments also showed that initial COX-2 expression occurred in lung small-airways. This is the first study clarifying initial genetic and biochemical alterations associated with inflammatory responses to CS exposure in the small and large airways.</p><p id="Par40">CS is the most typical source of exogenous oxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and oxidants derived from CS can injure airway epithelial cells, leading to persistent inflammation. Oxidative stress and persistent inflammation combine to result in increases in airway free radicals and amplification of the expression of proinflammatory genes that contribute to the release of inflammatory proteins, thereby promoting inflammatory cell infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that the expression of proinflammatory genes, and initiation of signaling associated with their related pathways, were more greatly enhanced in SAECs relative to NHBEs following a comparatively short period of CSE exposure. Further, we identified initial induction of <italic>COX-2</italic> expression in the small airway of CS-exposed mice. These results suggest that SAECs represent the initial targets of CS and play an important role in the development of CS-mediated inflammation, which might contribute to CS-related respiratory diseases, such as COPD.</p><p id="Par41">Accumulating evidence suggests that the small airway is the initial locus of inflammation in COPD and plays a critical role in disease development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Based on clinical findings, even patients with mild COPD already show some pathological abnormalities in the small-airway area, including active inflammation and obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Based on the results of multidetector computed-tomography, McDonough et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported that small-airway injury precedes the development of centrilobular emphysema, and another study of pathology in smokers who underwent surgical resection showed that the number of neutrophils and mast cells infiltrating the small airway was higher than that in the large airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In terms of genetic analysis, Mercer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] performed microarray analyses using CSE-exposed SAECs and showed differential regulation of 425 genes involved in various biological processes, including immune function, signal transduction, apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and antioxidation. The results of the present study were consistent with the findings of Mercer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and further demonstrate that CSE exposure affects gene groups related to diverse biological processes in SAECs, including the inflammatory response, wound healing, aging, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and neutrophil chemotaxis (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Importantly, these findings extend previous results by demonstrating that SAECs exhibit greater alterations in gene regulation and a higher susceptibility to CSE exposure than NHBEs.</p><p id="Par42">A recent study by Yang et al. demonstrated that smoking induced <italic>distal-to-proximal repatterning</italic> of the adult human small airway epithelium, which is a pathologic feature of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] . The authors showed that the proximal airway epithelium is enriched for molecular features related to oxidative stress, xenobiotic metabolism, and nicotine degradation, suggesting that the proximal airway epithelium can more robustly tolerate oxidants and toxins compared with the small airway epithelium. In the current study, the GSEA in NHBEs indicated that a smaller number of pathways and GO terms were overrepresented following CSE exposure compared to SAECs (Tables <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>); however, <italic>GPX-2</italic> [glutathione peroxidase] was one of the enriched genes in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, according to KEGG analysis (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis showed that several <italic>AKR</italic> [aldo-keto reductase] family members, which encode enzymes that detoxify oxidative stress-induced carbonyl proteins, were enriched (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). These findings are consistent with those of Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], showing that <italic>GPX-2</italic> is a proximal airway epithelial signature gene. Interestingly, Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] also showed that the expression of proximal signature genes was increased in the small airway epithelium of healthy smokers and COPD patients compared with nonsmokers. They named this phenomenon, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of small airway disorder in COPD, <italic>distal-to-proximal repatterning</italic>. Here, we investigated the initial response towards CS-exposure to determine whether the small-airway is the initial site of the CS-induced lung damage; however, investigations during longer periods of CSE exposure will likely be fruitful beyond the current study.</p><p id="Par43">Here, we focused on COX-2 as an important factor that initiates an inflammatory response to CSE exposure in the lung. COX-2 is a key mediator of inflammation that catalyzes the transformation of arachidonic acid to thromboxanes and PGs, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. COX-2 is also believed to be associated with COPD pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A previous animal study showed that treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor attenuated PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis and protected against the development of CS-induced pulmonary emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our previous study, using primary lung fibroblasts from patients with COPD and smokers without COPD (controls), demonstrated that following stimulation with inflammatory cytokines, fibroblasts from COPD subjects produced higher PGE<sub>2</sub> levels relative to those from control subjects, and that elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels were the result of an increase in COX-2 expression due to alterations in mRNA stability caused by weak induction of microRNA-146a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. More recently, Zago et al. demonstrated that expression of RelB, a component of the non-canonical NF-&#954;B pathway, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, are both reduced in fibroblasts from COPD patients and regulate COX-2 protein levels by altering mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings suggest that the regulation of COX-2 is critical to controlling abnormal inflammation associated with COPD pathogenesis, and that its targeting could be a promising strategy for COPD therapeutics. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that mesenchymal stem cells attenuated airway inflammation and emphysema in CS-exposed rats through the downregulation of COX-2 and PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">This study had several limitations. First, we did not use primary cells from COPD patients to evaluate the direct contribution of the current findings to the disease condition. Second, the SAECs and NHBEs used in the current study were not from matched donors. Instead, we confirmed COX-2 expression in the lungs of CS-exposed mice as an experimental model of COPD. Thirdly, we used different media approved by the supplier for SAECs and NHBEs. Their components are almost identical; however, there is a possibility that they influenced the current findings. Additionally, we did not perform air-liquid interface (ALI) culture to promote differentiation. The phenotypes of each cell type observed under non-differentiating conditions could be affected by contamination with different cell types. Therefore, differentiating SAECs and NHBEs using ALI culture system first and then exposing to CSE will make experimental findings more applicable to human airways. However, our findings were consistent with those from a previous study using ALI culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], indicating that commercially available cells cultured using conventional methods can be suitable for these types of experiment. Lastly, we did not define the mechanisms by which inflammation spreads from the initial site to the whole lung, leading to development of pulmonary emphysema. Further investigation of the transition of COX-2 expression in the airways, following various durations of CS exposure, and the interactions between small-airway cells and other cells will be beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">This study demonstrated that the small airway is more susceptible to CS than the large airway and might represent an initial target site for development of CS-related respiratory diseases, such as COPD.
