Understanding how different cell fates are established and maintained is critically important for both developmental biology and cancer research as disruption of this unique balance can result in tumorigenesis or tissue degeneration (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</xref>). Generation of different cell fates after a stem cell division can be achieved either stochastically or through an asymmetric cell division (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992</xref>). When stem cells divide asymmetrically, one daughter cell reproducibly maintains stem cell identity while the other commits to differentiation (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>). Asymmetric cell division can be attained intrinsically whereby the stem cell segregates cell fate determinants into only one of the two daughter cells. Alternatively, the mitotic spindle of the stem cell is oriented so that after division only one of the two daughter cells continues to receive self-renewal factors released by the stem cell niche (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Knoblich, 2008</xref>). Ultimately, differential exposure to niche factors or unequal concentrations of segregating determinants need to be translated into distinct and stable cell fates by instructing or repressing particular transcriptional programs. These programs are implemented through very dynamic gene regulatory networks (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gloss et al., 2017</xref>). As most of our knowledge about transcriptional changes is based on end-point analysis, a time-resolved overview of these transitional states is essential to fully understand the molecular mechanisms shaping and maintaining the distinct fates of the two daughter cells. In this study, we fill this knowledge gap by establishing high-resolution time-course transcriptome datasets that extend our current understanding of the events occurring after stem cell division.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval neuroblasts (NBs) are a well-established model system to study stem cell biology (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2015</xref>). Several types of NBs can be distinguished in the central larval brain based on their division mode (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). Type I NBs divide into a larger cell that retains NB characteristics and a smaller ganglion mother cell (GMC) that gives rise to two postmitotic neurons or glial cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Type II NBs also divide asymmetrically, generating an NB and a smaller intermediate neural progenitor (INP) cell. Newly formed INPs go through defined maturation steps to become transit-amplifying INPs, which undergo three to six asymmetric divisions generating one INP and one GMC that also divides into two neurons or glial cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>NBs and INPs divide asymmetrically in an intrinsic manner through the differential localization of cell fate determinants. Brat, Numb, and Prospero (Pros) are segregated into the GMC to drive a differentiation program. Pros is a transcription factor that activates proneural genes and inhibits cell cycle genes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>), whereas Brat acts as a translational repressor (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sonoda and Wharton, 2001</xref>) and Numb inhibits Notch signaling in the GMC by promoting endocytosis of the Notch receptor (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Schweisguth, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Couturier et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of these cell fate determinants disturbs the balance between differentiation and self-renewal. For example, in a <italic>brat</italic> mutant, type II NB&#8211;generated INPs fail to mature and revert into NB-like cells giving rise to transplantable tumors (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Betschinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Generation of different cell fates after asymmetric cell division implies several fundamental differences in the biology of the two daughter cells, including their proliferation and cell growth potential. Larval NBs regrow after each cell division to their original size before they continue dividing, whereas GMCs do not alter their cell volume (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). NBs and GMCs also differ in their cell cycle times: type I NBs require 1.3 h for each cell division compared with 4.2 h for the final division of GMCs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular machinery that regulates the asymmetric segregation of the cell fate determinants during mitosis is well understood. However, how the asymmetric distribution of the cell fate determinants translates into these fundamental differences between the two daughter cells is less clear (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). A regulatory network including <italic>deadpan</italic>, <italic>klumpfuss</italic>, <italic>worniu</italic>, and <italic>E(spl)m&#947;</italic> that controls self-renewal in NBs has been identified (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Slack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Neum&#252;ller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the dynamic molecular events stabilizing the distinct fates after asymmetric distribution of the cell fate determinants are poorly understood. To fill this gap, we performed time-resolved transcriptome analysis of NBs and maturing GMCs.</p><p>For this, we established a method to purify type I NBs and GMCs at three different time points after their asymmetric cell division. This is possible as cell cycle, cell growth, and maturation times in NBs are highly synchronous, allowing us to derive high-quality transcriptomes by pooling NBs and GMCs isolated at defined times after mitosis. We performed complex enrichment analysis using the Complex Enrichment Analysis Tool (COMPLEAT; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Vinayagam et al., 2013</xref>) on the transcriptome data to determine protein complexes whose members undergo similar transcriptional changes in NBs and GMCs over time. This analysis highlighted a progressive down-regulation of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>&#8211;ATPase (v-ATPase) complex in GMCs over time. v-ATPase is a multisubunit proton pump found in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic cells, where it is essential for the acidification of intracellular organelles, including endosomes and lysosomes. Consequently, v-ATPase plays a crucial role in protein trafficking and degradation and was only recently found to modulate several signaling transduction cascades (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Forgac, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Sun-Wada and Wada, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Oot et al., 2017</xref>). We show that the v-ATPase complex is required for efficient NB self-renewal and acts in a regulatory loop involving the Notch signaling pathway. Our data indicate that this regulatory loop acts across multiple stem cell lineages at different times of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle. In addition, our data provide a resource for investigating neural developmental biology with high temporal resolution and may shed light on the mechanisms that establish the fundamental differences between stem cells and their differentiating sibling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Pure populations of larval NBs and GMCs of different ages can be obtained by FACS</title><p>To understand the temporal changes in NBs and GMCs, we retrieved transcriptomes from cells of different ages. To this end, we cultured FACS-sorted NBs from dissociated brains (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Harzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2013</xref>) for 1.5, 3, or 5 h as they continued to divide asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). To collect nearly pure populations of both NBs and GMCs, we subjected the cell suspension containing NBs and newly formed GMCs to a second FACS sort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>; and Fig. S1). In each experiment, we obtained &#8764;1,000 NBs and, depending on the incubation time, up to 3,000 GMCs with a maximum age of 1.5, 3, or 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Low-input sequencing was achieved by combining transposon-mediated library preparation with molecular barcoding. Adding a unique identifier barcode to the 3&#8242; end of each original cDNA molecule allowed us to extensively amplify our sequencing library without risking misrepresentation by PCR amplification artifacts (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Landskron et al., 2018</xref>). In sum, the combination of our two-step FACS strategy and low-input sequencing technique allowed us to obtain the transcriptome of NBs and differently matured GMCs.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Pure populations of larval NBs and GMCs of different ages can be obtained by FACS. (a)</bold> Larval central nervous systems (CNS) expressing a nuclear GFP in a type I NB&#8211;specific manner (<italic>ase</italic>-GAL4 and UAS-stingerGFP) were dissected and the tissue was disturbed into a single-cell solution. NBs were sorted according to cell size and GFP intensity (step 1) and were cultured in Schneider&#8217;s medium for 1.5, 3, or 5 h (step 2); white arrowheads indicate NBs, and yellow arrowheads indicate GMCs. The mixture of NBs and newly formed GMCs was subjected to a second FACS sort, displaying two clearly distinct cell populations in the FACS plot. The population containing large cells with a high GFP intensity signal comprises NBs (Mira<sup>+</sup>), whereas the small cells with the low GFP signal intensity are GMCs. The FACS plot is a representative example of the second FACS sort after 3 h of NB culture (step 3). By using a GAL4 strain harboring both heterozygous and homozygous GAL4 and UAS-stingerGFP, we were able to separate two NB and two GMC populations when plotting the strength of the GFP signal to the size of the cells (forward scatter [FSC]-A). Both subpopulations are equal in size but different in the strength of the GFP signal as heterozygous insertions result in weaker GFP signals than homozygous insertions. <bold>(b)</bold> Essentially pure populations of NBs and GMCs were obtained after the second FACS sort. <italic>n</italic> (NB gate) = 849 cells, <italic>n</italic> (GMC gate) = 761 cells. <bold>(c)</bold> Increased incubation time between the two consecutive FACS sorts resulted in an increased GMC/NB ratio. <italic>n</italic> &#8805; 3 Experiments.

However, the vast majority of these genes are lowly expressed (Fig. S2, b and c) and more than one third of them have an reads per million mapped reads (RPM) value of &lt;10 at all three time points (Fig. S2 b). Thus, only minor transcriptional changes affecting lowly expressed genes occur in NBs during the culture time, while most moderately or highly expressed genes remain unchanged. Hierarchical clustering of the log2RPM values of the 180 differently expressed genes showed that four out of five clusters were not enriched for any gene ontology (GO) term, indicating that NB culture does not affect a specific biological process within these clusters (Fig. S2 a). Cluster 4 contained predominantly genes that are lowly expressed in 1.5- and 3-h NBs but are up-regulated at the 5-h time point. Genes in this cluster were slightly enriched for the GO terms synaptic signaling and neuron development, indicating that longer culture might induce the expression of neuronal genes in NBs. Altogether, short-term NB culture has modest effects on the NB transcriptome. To avoid artifacts arising from those changes, however, we only compare NB and GMC datasets from identical culture times in the following analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Time-resolved transcriptomics demonstrates gradual fate commitment</title><p>2,438 genes were differentially expressed between NBs and GMCs isolated 1.5 h after asymmetric division (FDR = 0.05, P &lt; 0.05; log2fc &gt;1). Over time, the total number of genes expressed unequally between GMCs and NBs increased, reflecting their continuous move toward differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref> and Table S1). 1,028 genes were deregulated between NBs and GMCs at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>), including the known NB markers <italic>deadpan</italic>, <italic>worniu</italic>, and <italic>string</italic> as well as the known differentiation/neuronal markers <italic>dacapo</italic>, <italic>embryonic lethal abnormal vision</italic>, and <italic>nerfin-1</italic>, confirming the reliability of our datasets (Fig. S2 e). Pros, Inscutable, Cherub, and Staufen RNAs are known to be asymmetrically inherited between NBs and GMCs (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Landskron et al., 2018</xref>). Except for Staufen, all RNAs follow the expected trend, further verifying the high quality of our datasets (Fig. S2 d). Furthermore, we observed higher overlap of deregulated genes between the 1.5&#8211;3-h and 3&#8211;5-h time points compared with the 1.5&#8211;5-h time points, suggesting continuous and dynamic transcriptional changes over the lifetime of a GMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Time-resolved transcriptomics demonstrates gradual fate commitment.

As expected, genes in these clusters were enriched for the GO terms differentiation and neurogenesis. We also identified genes that were either permanently or progressively down-regulated in GMCs compared with NBs (clusters 2 and 3). These clusters were enriched for DNA replication and metabolic processes, consistent with the slower cell cycle and reduced proliferation capacity of GMCs. Other sets (clusters 4 and 7) contained genes expressed more highly in 1.5- and 3-h GMCs and less in 5-h GMCs compared with NBs. Surprisingly, these clusters scored for the GO terms synaptic signaling and learning and could include interesting candidates for further studies of neural differentiation processes. Taken together, the GMC fate program is not completely established immediately after asymmetric cell division but instead is a gradual process that occurs over the entire lifespan of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>Complex enrichment analysis reveals the gradual transcriptional down-regulation of v-ATPase in GMCs</title><p>To identify coregulated genes involved in similar molecular processes, we performed a protein complex enrichment analysis using COMPLEAT (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Vinayagam et al., 2013</xref>). This revealed an increasing number of protein complexes differentially regulated between NBs and GMCs over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). 137 complexes were down-regulated in GMCs compared with NBs at all three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). This included protein complexes required for DNA replication (e.g., Mcm2&#8211;7, GINS, and DNA polymerases), DNA repair (e.g., MSH2/6&#8211;BLM&#8211;p53&#8211;RAD51, PCNA&#8211;MutS&#8211;&#945;&#8211;MutL&#8211;&#945;&#8211;DNA complex, and BASC complex), regulation of the mitotic cell cycle progression and metabolic processes (e.g., &#946;-oxidation, inosine monophosphate biosynthesis, and gluconeogenesis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref> and Table S3). Interestingly, only 36 complexes were up-regulated at all three time points in GMCs compared with NBs. The highest overlap of up-regulated complexes in GMCs versus NBs was detectable between 3 and 5 h, suggesting that GMCs first down-regulate complexes required for proliferation and subsequently up-regulate new sets of complexes promoting differentiation and their final division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). Complexes up-regulated in 3- and 5-h GMCs included the Notch corepressor complex spen&#8211;CtBP&#8211;Su(H) (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Oswald et al., 2005</xref>), potentially reflecting an interesting cross talk between transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional inhibition of Notch by Numb (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Schweisguth, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Couturier et al., 2012</xref>).

Finally, comparing mature GMCs and NBs revealed the up-regulation of several chromatin remodeling complexes (p300&#8211;CBP&#8211;p270&#8211;SWI/SNF and ING2 complex) and the Mediator&#8211;DRIP complex in GMCs, which have been shown to act as master coordinators of cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref> and Table S3; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Eroglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Wang, 2014</xref>).

The 343 protein complexes down-regulated in old compared with young GMCs included DNA replication complexes (Mcm2&#8211;7, nuclear origin of replication recognition complex, and DNA synthesome complex), the large and small ribosome subunits and complexes of the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref> and Table S3). This is expected as GMCs do not grow in cell size and slow down their cell cycle after asymmetric cell division. Complexes up-regulated during the maturation of GMCs included the Mediator&#8211;DRIP complex, chromatin remodeler (p300&#8211;CBP&#8211;p270&#8211;SWI/SNF complex and nucleosome remodeling factor [NURF] complex), the 13S condensin complex and genes related to the mitotic cell cycle G2/M transition DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref> and Table S3). We propose that the increased expression of the 13S condensin complex and genes required for the G2/M transition relates to the final cell division of the GMC into two neurons/glia cells. Additionally, the NURF complex was shown to be essential for the differentiation of melanocyte stem cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Koludrovic et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the intriguing possibility that NURF could play a similar role in GMC differentiation.</p><p>Among the protein complexes we identified, the v-ATPase complex stood out as it is one of the few complexes gradually down-regulated in GMCs over time, both when compared with NBs as well as when compared with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, c, e, and h</xref>; and Fig. S3, a and b). Asymmetric inheritance of RNAs between NBs and GMCs has been reported previously (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Landskron et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we performed FISH for the catalytic v-ATPase subunit Vha68-2. During NB division, no asymmetric mRNA localization was detectable, suggesting that Vha68-2 mRNA is not asymmetrically segregated between NBs and GMCs and that different mechanisms are responsible for v-ATPase down-regulation in GMCs (Fig. S3, c and d). To confirm the transcriptome data, we generated a fly strain where <italic>Vha68-2</italic> was tagged with GFP. <italic>Vha68-2-</italic>GFP was strongly expressed in a punctate manner in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane of NBs, whereas a significantly reduced Vha68-2-GFP signal was detectable in GMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, f and g</xref>). Thus, consistent with the transcriptome data, the v-ATPase complex is down-regulated in GMCs after asymmetric cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>v-ATPase is required for NB regrowth after asymmetric cell division</title><p>To understand the function of v-ATPase, we inhibited its components by RNAi in type I NBs. Both depletion of the catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, a and b</xref>) and inhibition of several other v-ATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>) resulted in a prominent reduction in NB size, suggesting that v-ATPase might be required for cell growth. To further understand this loss of function phenotype, we performed ex vivo live imaging of NBs labeled by nuclear GFP (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). It is well established that larval NBs regrow after each cell division to their original size before they continue dividing, while GMCs do not alter their cell volume (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). In line with that ex vivo control NBs regrew to their original size after each cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, c and d</xref>; and Video 1). v-ATPase deficient NBs still divided into two daughter cells of unequal size but did not grow to the same extent as control NBs before the next division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, c and d</xref>; and Videos 2 and 3). GMCs generated by control or v-ATPase deficient NBs, instead did not show volume alterations during their lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>). In addition, cell cycle time in NBs but not in GMCs was prolonged upon v-ATPase knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 f</xref>). Thus, v-ATPase is required for cell growth in NBs but not in GMCs, consistent with its down-regulation in GMCs. We also observed a significant decrease in NB number upon v-ATPase knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, g and h</xref>). To exclude apoptosis as a potential explanation for the loss of v-ATPase<sup>RNAi</sup> NBs, we performed TdT dUTP Nick-End labeling (TUNEL) assays and did not observe any TUNEL-positive NBs upon v-ATPase depletion (Fig. S3 e). This confirms previous research showing that NBs, like other stem cells, can only maintain their stemness if they grow at a minimum rate (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Song and Lu, 2011</xref>).

We purified NBs and GMCs at different time points during their development, which enabled us to follow transcriptional changes that occur during the process of differentiation upon asymmetric cell division with high temporal resolution.</p><p>Previous studies have successfully described transcriptome dynamics during differentiation in several mammalian stem cell systems, including neural, cardiac, and pancreatic tissue (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fathi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Piccini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). These studies followed the differentiation of stem cells into specified cell types over days or weeks, which allowed the identification of optimal cell culture conditions for differentiation or to determine sets of genes or pathways required for the fate commitment of specific cell types. Our study complements these experiments by providing a highly time-resolved transcriptome analysis that assesses the fast changes occurring in differentiating daughter cells after asymmetric cell division. The combination of our time-resolved transcriptomes and the protein complex enrichment analysis lays the foundation for a more targeted search for factors and protein complexes that are required to stabilize the NB or GMC fate. Multiple protein complexes known for their role in fate regulation in several distinct species were enriched in our dataset, providing the potential applicability of this knowledge to other stem cell systems.</p><p>We identified the v-ATPase complex as one of the strongest and most consistently differently expressed complexes between NBs and GMCs over time. Our study reveals a regulatory loop between v-ATPase and the Notch signaling pathway in NBs. This interplay ensures the balance between self-renewal and differentiation and therefore constitutes an additional and novel layer of Notch signal pathway regulation in NB lineage development. The requirement for Notch signaling during G1/S transition in neural stem cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Borghese et al., 2010</xref>) could explain the prolonged NB cell cycle time observed upon v-ATPase knockdown. v-ATPase expression by the Notch signaling pathway is further supported by transcriptome data showing that the expression of all v-ATPase subunits are more highly expressed in the Notch-active ECs compared with ISCs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>). Our experiments in the adult ISC system are also conceptually surprising: reducing the expression of a protein complex that was initially considered as a &#8220;housekeeping&#8221; complex was able to induce an overproliferation of stem-like cells. This highlights the role of the v-ATPase in cellular signaling and tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that v-ATPase acts in endosomes to create an acidic environment required for efficient Notch S3 cleavage (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Vaccari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lange et al., 2011</xref>). The S3 cleavage process generates the free Notch intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus to drive target gene expression (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Schweisguth, 2004</xref>). Although it is likely that the v-ATPase plays a similar role during Notch signaling in NBs, it is less clear what drives v-ATPase expression in NBs but not in GMCs. In other tissues, either Rbcn-3 or the transcription factor Mitf can induce the expression of v-ATPase subunits (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bouch&#233; et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Tognon et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs, however, neither loss nor overexpression of Mitf nor loss of Rbcn-3 had any effect on self-renewal capacity (unpublished data). Our results indicate that the Notch pathway is driving v-ATPase expression in NBs. This effect seems to be indirect, as v-ATPase is not among the targets suggested by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the Notch-binding protein Su(H) in hyperplastic <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Zacharioudaki et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, prominent Notch targets such as E(spl) act as transcriptional repressors (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Paroush et al., 1994</xref>) that could indirectly influence v-ATPase in NBs and GMCs.</p><p>Interestingly, reduced v-ATPase expression in NBs caused them to acquire GMC-specific characteristics including a prolonged cell cycle time and a reduced proliferation and cell growth potential. This raises the exciting possibility that overexpression of the v-ATPase complex might revert GMCs into NB-like cells as does overexpression of E(spl)m&#947; (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2012</xref>). As the v-ATPase complex contains 15 core subunits (many of which are gradually down-regulated), such a gain-of-function study would be technically very challenging. We nonetheless generated transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines driving the overexpression of the three most strongly down-regulated v-ATPase subunits. However, even upon simultaneous overexpression of those three transgenes in both type I and type II NBs and GMCs, self-renewal and differentiation behavior was not detectably changed (unpublished data). This result could be explained by an uneven stoichiometry of all the functional v-ATPase complex subunits. Alternatively, additional factors not present in GMCs could be required for v-ATPase to be active; v-ATPase activity was shown to be regulated by a reversible assembling processes of the two major domains V<sub>0</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> depending on nutrients response, cell maturation, hormones, and growth factors (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Oot et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Notch pathway is one of the most commonly activated signaling pathways in cancer (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). Our data show that inhibition of the v-ATPase either genetically or chemically impairs proliferation capacity of the Notch signaling-dependent <italic>brat</italic> tumors. Consistently, cell proliferation can be reduced in Notch-addicted breast tumor cell lines upon v-ATPase inhibition (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kobia et al., 2014</xref>). Based on this and other research, v-ATPase is considered as a potential novel anticancer target (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Stransky et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that reduction of v-ATPase expression in ISCs and EBs primarily affects Notch signaling, suggesting that the regulatory loop involving v-ATPase and the Notch pathway might also be critical for <italic>brat</italic> tumor progression. Investigating whether a similar pathway operates in human tumors as well might result in important mechanistic insight into the mechanism of action for v-ATPase inhibiting antitumor compounds.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide a time-resolved transcriptome dataset that represents a significant resource for investigating new mechanisms of neural stem cell biology and might help to explain how the fundamental differences between stem cells and their differentiating siblings are established.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title>Fly strains and RNAi analysis</title><p>The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were used: UAS-<italic>Vha68-2</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (34390; Vienna Drosophila Resource Center [VDRC] and BL34582; Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center), UAS-<italic>Vha100-2</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (30297; VDRC), UAS-<italic>VhaAC39-1</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (20950; VDRC), <italic>E(spl)m&#947;</italic>-GFP (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Almeida and Bray, 2005</xref>), <italic>NRE</italic>-LacZ; <italic>esg</italic>-GAL4, UAS-GFP<italic>, tubulin</italic>-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lucchetta and Ohlstein, 2017</xref>), UAS-<italic>Notch</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (100002; VDRC), UAS-Notch&#916;ECD (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Larkin et al., 1996</xref>), UAS-<italic>brat</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (31333; VDRC), and UAS-mCherry<sup>RNAi</sup> (BL35785).
