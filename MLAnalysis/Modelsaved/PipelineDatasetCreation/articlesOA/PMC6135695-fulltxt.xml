Here, we conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of FAP neoplasms, including seven cancer samples and 16 adenoma samples, using an Infinium 450K BeadArray. As controls for sporadic colorectal neoplasms and mucosae, we used Infinium 450k data from 297 CRC samples, 45 colorectal adenoma samples, and 37 normal mucosa samples with reference to The Cancer Genome Atlas and other databases. Unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering analysis of FAP and sporadic CRC/adenoma revealed that CRC was classified into four DNA methylation epigenotypes (MEs): high-ME (HME), intermediate-ME (IME), low-ME (LME), and normal-like ME (NME). Five FAP neoplasms (two cancer and three adenoma) were clustered with IME, whereas 18 FAP neoplasms (five cancer and 13 adenoma) were clustered into NME. IME FAP neoplasms significantly correlated with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, similar to sporadic CRC. Within IME cases, however, aberrant DNA methylation was significantly less frequent in FAP neoplasms than sporadic neoplasms, and these unmethylated genes included WNT family genes and several types of oncogenes. In summary, FAP neoplasms were classified into at least two molecular subtypes, i.e., NME in the majority of cases showing mostly no aberrant methylation and IME in some cases accompanied by <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations but less frequent aberrant DNA methylation than sporadic neoplasms, suggesting that FAP may follow a tumorigenesis pathway different from that of sporadic CRC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>colorectal adenoma</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of death and is associated with high incidence and mortality rates [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sporadic CRC arises through accumulation of genetic alterations, called the &#8220;adenoma-carcinoma sequence&#8221;, which involves progression from adenomatous polyps to CRC [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to genetic alterations due to chromosomal instability and microsatellite instability [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], aberrant DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands has been reported to be one of the most important epigenomic alterations in colorectal carcinogenesis, leading to inactivation of multiple tumor-suppressor genes [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In our previous study, we performed epigenotyping of sporadic CRC using comprehensive and quantitative DNA methylation data [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although some genes were commonly hypermethylated in nearly all CRC cases, two groups of classifier genes (Group-1 and Group-2 markers) were established to classify sporadic CRC into three distinct DNA methylation epigenotypes (MEs): high-ME (HME), intermediate-ME (IME), and low-ME (LME) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Group-1 markers are mostly equivalent to classical markers for the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HME/CIMP-high sporadic CRC showed hypermethylation of both Group-1 and Group-2 markers and was strongly correlated with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations. IME/CIMP-low sporadic CRC showed methylation of Group-2, but not Group-1 markers, and was strongly correlated with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. Finally, LME sporadic CRC showed aberrant hypermethylation of commonly methylated genes, but no methylation of Group-1/Group-2 markers, and did not correlate with <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, as reported by other groups [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by numerous colorectal adenomatous polyps with predisposition to the development of CRC. The worldwide incidence of FAP is 3&#8211;10 per 100,000, accounting for approximately 1% of CRC cases [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In patient with FAP, the risk of progression to CRC by the age of 35&#8211;40 years is approximately 100% [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite this extremely high risk of cancer, the molecular basis of tumorigenesis in FAP is not fully understood. The &#8220;second hit&#8221; against <italic>APC</italic> has not been definitively identified in patients with FAP with germline mutations in <italic>APC</italic> [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, approximately 20% of patients with FAP do not possess <italic>APC</italic> germline mutations, and responsible mutations have not yet been identified [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With regard to epigenetic alterations, few studies have described aberrant DNA methylation with a focus on FAP, and molecular stratification of FAP neoplasms has yet to be clarified [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We recently evaluated DNA methylation epigenotypes of FAP neoplasms by pyrosequencing using 20 methylation marker genes, which we previously established [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There are thought to be at least two molecular subtypes of FAP neoplasms, and these lesions appear to be similar to LME and IME in sporadic CRC. The two epigenotypes are independent of <italic>APC</italic> germline mutation status, and both subtypes can develop malignant tumors. Comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation status other than the 20 methylation markers or investigation of differences between FAP and sporadic neoplasms, however, has not yet been clarified.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of FAP neoplasms using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Infinium 450k) array with reference to the Infinium 450k data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other data [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Some protocols have been reported to improve quality of FFPE DNA samples and achieve robust array results [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because both frozen and FFPE samples were analyzed in this study, probes that were not significantly influenced by FFPE were extracted to exclude the effects of the FFPE procedure for Infinium analysis.

CRCs vary according to not only clinicopathological features, e.g., location and histology, but also molecular features, e.g., DNA methylation levels, microsatellite instability, chromosomal instability, and the presence of somatic or germline mutations. While these factors may interact with one another, sporadic CRC develops through several different tumorigenic pathways. Although comprehensive molecular characterizations of sporadic colorectal adenoma and cancer have been performed, the detailed molecular features of FAP-associated colorectal neoplasms are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the presence of multiple methylation epigenotypes in FAP-associated colorectal neoplasms through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and to elucidate the distinction between FAP-associated and sporadic colorectal neoplasms. Sporadic CRC could be classified into four MEs (HME, IME, LME, and NME); however, FAP-associated neoplasms were classified only into two MEs (IME and NME). FAP IME neoplasms, however, had significantly lower levels of aberrant DNA methylation than sporadic IME colorectal adenoma/cancer, suggesting that the molecular basis of FAP neoplasms differed from that of sporadic colorectal tumorigenesis.</p><p>We and others previously classified CRC into three distinct epigenotypes: HME, IME, and LME [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although HME and IME were strongly correlated with <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, respectively, LME cases were not associated with these oncogenic mutations, suggesting the existence of distinct pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study, the fourth ME was identified in both FAP-associated and sporadic colorectal neoplasms. Since these neoplasm samples hardly showed aberrant hypermethylation, and clustered with all the normal mucosa samples, this fourth ME was named normal-like ME (NME). The existence of NME in both sporadic protruded adenoma and cancer suggested that a fraction of sporadic CRC could develop without accumulation of aberrant promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, a major fraction of FAP neoplasms were classified as NME. Because inactivation of <italic>APC</italic> is supposed to occur at an early stage of FAP tumorigenesis, aberrant hypermethylation of genes, especially with regard to negative regulators for WNT signaling, may not be required in the majority of FAP neoplasms, and genetic mutations, e.g. <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, might be required.</p><p><italic>KRAS</italic> mutations were detected in a fraction of FAP neoplasms and were significantly correlated with IME in FAP neoplasms, as observed in sporadic CRC [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although most FAP neoplasms develop without requiring aberrant methylation, some FAP neoplasms develop in the presence of both IME and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, demonstrating aberrant methylation and oncogene mutations.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> are well-known genetic alterations, which were demonstrated in the model of adenoma-carcinoma sequence, and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation plays a major role in the progression from low-grade to high-grade adenoma [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Whereas sporadic CRC is known to be stratified into several molecular subtypes with/without these mutations and the tumorigenic pathway is more complicated [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], accumulation of DNA hypermethylation and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation was demonstrated to be completed by adenoma stage in IME neoplasms [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], in good agreement with adenoma-carcinoma sequence. In the progression from adenoma to intramucosal carcinoma, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation was reportedly required in both <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutation(+) and <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutation(&#8722;) neoplasms [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>TP53</italic> mutation is also frequently observed in FAP neoplasms, and suggested to play a critical role in FAP tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to clarify at which stage of tumorigenesis <italic>TP53</italic> mutation is required in each subtype of FAP neoplasm.</p><p><italic>BRAF</italic> mutations were not detected in FAP neoplasms, and HME was also not observed in FAP neoplasms. These data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that sporadic HME CRC was strongly correlated with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and that SSA was a precursor for sporadic HME CRC showing both HME and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the serrated pathway of sporadic CRC may not be involved in FAP tumorigenesis.</p><p>Interestingly, the methylation levels of intermediate methylation and commonly methylated markers were lower in IME FAP neoplasms than sporadic IME CRC. These genes showing lower methylation included <italic>WNT1</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>GDNF</italic>, and <italic>FGFR1</italic>. The proposed mechanisms for the oncogenic function of <italic>OTX2</italic> include transactivation of cell cycle genes and induction of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene, which play key roles in tumor maintenance in some medulloblastomas [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. <italic>MYC</italic> is upregulated by WNT signaling [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, although WNT signaling is activated by <italic>APC</italic> mutations in FAP neoplasms, reduced inactivation of <italic>OTX2</italic> and activation of <italic>MYC</italic> may contribute to tumor development in FAP.</p><p><italic>GDNF</italic> has been shown to enhance the migration of colon cancer cells by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor interactions, which are mainly regulated by the p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; signaling pathways [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. <italic>GDNF</italic> has been reported to be hypermethylated in colorectal carcinogenesis [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; however, reduced inactivation of <italic>GDNF</italic> may also contribute to FAP tumorigenesis. <italic>FGFR1</italic> was reported to be highly expressed in colorectal adenoma and cancer, and activating mutations and overexpression of <italic>FGFR1</italic> have been shown to trigger the development of various cancers, e.g., breast, bladder, ovarian cancer, renal cell, and squamous cell lung cancers [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings suggest that lower methylation of these oncogenic genes in FAP-associated IME neoplasms might perhaps contribute to the early development of adenoma/cancer in FAP. Further studies of these genes and roles of their reduced methylation should be conducted to fully clarify the tumorigenic mechanisms of FAP neoplasms.</p><p>Limitation of this study is that FAP neoplasm samples were obtained from only two patients; thus the current results may not be generalizable to all the FAP neoplasms. Although it should be necessary to conduct comprehensive genome-wide analysis using samples from more FAP patients, our study clearly demonstrated that there are at least two DNA methylation epigenotypes in FAP neoplasms, and that FAP neoplasms involve different molecular features from sporadic CRC/adenoma, e.g. lower levels of aberrant DNA methylation.</p><p>In summary, sporadic colorectal adenoma and cancer were classified into four MEs (HME, IME, LME, and NME), whereas FAP neoplasms were classified into at least two subtypes (IME and NME). The significantly lower levels of aberrant methylation observed in FAP-associated IME neoplasms compared with that in sporadic IME CRC/adenoma suggested that aberrant DNA methylation may contribute to tumorigenesis of FAP in a manner different from that of sporadic CRC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Clinical samples</title><p>A total of 23 colorectal neoplasm samples (16 adenoma samples and seven cancer samples) were obtained from two patients with FAP who underwent operation at Chiba University Hospital with written informed consent.
