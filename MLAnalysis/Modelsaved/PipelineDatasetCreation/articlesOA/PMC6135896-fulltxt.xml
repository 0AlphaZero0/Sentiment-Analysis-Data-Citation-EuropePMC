There is a large gap in understanding of the underlying molecular basis of their roles in tea plants. Here, we identified 11 <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes from the tea plant (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>), and characterized their phylogeny, gene structure and protein features into three subclasses. We then examined their enzymatic activities, LOX expression and alternative splicing of transcripts during development and in response to abiotic or biotic stresses in tea plants. In vitro expressed protein assays showed that the CsLOX2, 3 and 9 enzymatically function to produce 9/13-HPOT, 13-HPOT and 9-HPOT, respectively. CsLOX2 and CsLOX9 green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins localized to chloroplasts and the cytoplasm, respectively. RNA sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription&#8211;PCR and Northern blot analysis suggested that <italic>CsLOX5</italic>, <italic>6</italic> and <italic>9</italic> were predominantly expressed in seeds, flowers and roots, respectively. <italic>CsLOX2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>4</italic>, <italic>6</italic> and <italic>7</italic> were up-regulated after attack by the insect <italic>Ectropis oblique</italic>, while <italic>CsLOX1</italic> was induced after infection with the pathogen <italic>Glomerella cingulata</italic>. <italic>CsLOX3</italic>, <italic>7</italic> and <italic>10</italic> were up-regulated by JA but not ABA or salicylic acid. Long-term cold stress down-regulated <italic>CsLOX</italic> expression while a short duration of cold induced the expression of <italic>CsLOX1</italic>, <italic>6</italic> and <italic>7.</italic> Alternatively spliced transcripts of six <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes were dynamically regulated through time and varied in relative abundances under the investigated stresses; we propose a mechanism of competing or compensating regulation between isoforms. This study improves our understanding of evolution of LOXs and regulation of their diverse functions in plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>Biotic and abiotic stresses</kwd><kwd><italic>Camellia sinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>Expression patterns</kwd><kwd>LOX gene family</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31171608</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Special Innovative Province Construction in Anhui Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>15czs08032</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Special Project for Central Guiding Science and Technology Innovation of Region in Anhui Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016080503B024</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University</named-content></funding-source><award-id>IRT1101</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perennial plants are in general more resistant to environmental stresses than annual plants, which suggests that they possess more elaborate mechanisms for stress adaptation (<xref rid="pcy091-B63" ref-type="bibr">Rennenberg and Schmidt 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B58" ref-type="bibr">Munne-Bosch 2014</xref>). The perennial tea tree (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) is an important economic woody crop planted within tropical to temperate regions (<xref rid="pcy091-B84" ref-type="bibr">Yu 2011</xref>). The leaves of the tree are used for making tea, which is a popular beverage due to its attractive aroma, good taste and health-promoting effects (<xref rid="pcy091-B85" ref-type="bibr">Zaveri 2006</xref>). The quality of tea leaves and thr abundance of natural flavor molecules are affected by the environment. To date, it is known that various abiotic stresses such as cold (<xref rid="pcy091-B4" ref-type="bibr">Ban et&#65533;al. 2017</xref>), nitrogen (<xref rid="pcy091-B50" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#65533;al. 2017b</xref>) and drought (<xref rid="pcy091-B54" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#65533;al. 2016</xref>), and biotic stresses such as insect attack (<xref rid="pcy091-B75" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#65533;al. 2016b</xref>) and pathogen infection (<xref rid="pcy091-B75" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#65533;al. 2016a</xref>) can induce a series of adaptive responses.</p><p>Oxylipins are oxygenated derivatives of fatty acids, and play roles in signaling responses to environmental stresses. In plants, oxylipins include the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), hydroxy-, oxo- or keto-fatty acids or volatile aldehydes (<xref rid="pcy091-B57" ref-type="bibr">Mosblech et&#65533;al. 2009</xref>). Lipoxygenases (LOXs; EC 1.13.11.12) constitute a family of iron-containing enzymes which catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to initiate oxylipin biosynthesis in plants (<xref rid="pcy091-B24" ref-type="bibr">Feussner and Wasternack 2002</xref>). During the reaction, LOXs catalyze the insertion of molecular oxygen into position C-9 or position C-13 of the PUFAs to produce 9S-HPOT and 13-HPOT hydroperoxides, respectively. Based on the positional specificity of substrates, LOXs can be classified into 9- and 13-LOXs (<xref rid="pcy091-B24" ref-type="bibr">Feussner and Wasternack 2002</xref>). 13-LOXs can be further classified into type I and type II based on sequence similarity (<xref rid="pcy091-B51" ref-type="bibr">Liavonchanka and Feussner 2006</xref>).</p><p>These hydroperoxides can be substrates for the allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathways. JA, as the product of the AOS pathway, is biosynthesized by a series of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by plastid-localized 13-LOX, AOS, allene oxide cyclase (AOC; Li et al.) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase (OPR), and the final product is synthesized by three consecutive &#946;-oxidation steps (<xref rid="pcy091-B79" ref-type="bibr">Wasternack and Hause 2013</xref>). Synthesis of LOX-derived six carbon (C<sub>6</sub>) volatile compounds, such as C<sub>6</sub> aldehydes, is catalyzed by HPL, isomerization factor, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) (<xref rid="pcy091-B51" ref-type="bibr">Liavonchanka and Feussner 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andreou and Feussner 2009</xref>). Both JA and C<sub>6</sub> aldehydes commonly play roles in triggering and regulating defense mechanisms against insects, pathogens and environmental stresses in plants, which are mediated by the AOS and HPL pathways via molecular cross-talk and by competition for substrate (<xref rid="pcy091-B34" ref-type="bibr">Halitschke and Baldwin 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B35" ref-type="bibr">Halitschke et&#65533;al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B20" ref-type="bibr">Duan et&#65533;al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B11" ref-type="bibr">Chehab et&#65533;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B60" ref-type="bibr">Pauwels et&#65533;al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B79" ref-type="bibr">Wasternack and Hause 2013</xref>). Therefore, the characterization of LOX as a critical mediator in the AOS and HPL pathways will help us understand these plant defense mechanisms under stresses.</p><p>Many LOX-related studies have examined the functions of 9-LOX, 13-LOX or 9/13-LOX in plant development, and abiotic and biotic stresses; several enzymes have been described in several plant species such as <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> and <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic> (<xref rid="pcy091-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andreou and Feussner 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B3" ref-type="bibr">Andriy et&#65533;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B83" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#65533;al. 2012</xref>). In addition, functional characterization studies of LOXs in some model plants have been reported (<xref rid="pcy091-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bannenberg et&#65533;al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et&#65533;al. 2010</xref>, Fournier et al. 2010). However, functional differences among the entire <italic>LOX</italic> gene family in a plant species have remained unclear. Moreover, it is not well known which types of LOXs regulate the AOS and HPL pathways in response to various stresses.</p><p>RNA alternative splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional gene regulation at the mRNA level, resulting in diverse transcripts encoded by the same gene (<xref rid="pcy091-B25" ref-type="bibr">Filichkin et&#65533;al. 2015</xref>). AS affects transcript export, localization, mRNA stability, translation, protein stability and degradation (<xref rid="pcy091-B62" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et&#65533;al. 2013</xref>). In plants, AS occurs during many stages of growth and development, circadian rhythms and environmental stresses (<xref rid="pcy091-B17" ref-type="bibr">Crosetto et&#65533;al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B18" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Xiong 2015</xref>). For example, photoperiod, heat, low temperature and high salinity stresses induce clock genes such as <italic>CCA1</italic>, <italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>ZTL</italic> to undergo AS (<xref rid="pcy091-B43" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et&#65533;al. 2014</xref>). However, previous studies on AS were mainly focused on regulatory genes (<xref rid="pcy091-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kriechbaumer et&#65533;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B78" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#65533;al. 2015</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, AS of LOX genes has not been reported.</p><p>This study aims to determine the functions of <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes in the tea plant. We initially identified 11 <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes, examined their phylogenetic relationships and compared them with those of other plants. We predicted and then experimentally characterized the functions of <italic>CsLOX2</italic>, <italic>CsLOX3</italic> and <italic>CsLOX9</italic> via heterologous expression. We examined the expression patterns of full-length <italic>CsLOX</italic> transcripts and their alternatively spliced transcripts in developmental tissues, under stresses of cold, insect attack, pathogen infection and phytohormone exposure.

The 102 <italic>LOX</italic> genes were divided into two main subfamilies (9-LOX and 13-LOX) based on their sequence similarities and positional specificities of substrate oxygenation. Seven and four <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes were grouped into the 9-LOX and 13-LOX categories, respectively. We further classified the genes in the 13-LOX category into type I and II according to the presence or absence of an N-terminal transit peptide. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F1">Fig.&#65533;1A</xref>, six and one <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes were grouped into types II and I, respectively.</p><p>To reveal the internal relationship of the tea <italic>CsLOX</italic> family of genes, conserved motifs were predicted and annotated by submitting 11 CsLOX amino acid sequences to the MEME website (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Most of the closely related members have common motif compositions. Of 20 identified motifs, 14 identical motifs were shared among all LOX proteins (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Motif 2 consists of 38 amino acid residues, and includes five highly conserved histidine residues [His-(X)<sub>4</sub>-His-(X)<sub>4</sub>-His-(X)<sub>17</sub>-His-(X)<sub>8</sub>-His] (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S1B</xref>).

Our prediction shows that all CsLOX proteins contain two domains consisting of one N-terminal domain-I forming a &#946;-barrel, and a C-terminal domain-II forming a bundle of helices. To examine further features of CsLOX members, multiple alignments of the 11 CsLOX amino acid sequences were performed, and all CsLOXs were found to harbor the five conserved amino acid residues (His, His, His, Asn and Ile), which were essential for binding of iron (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Detection and validation of alternative splicing of <italic>CsLOX</italic> transcripts</title><p>Using the sequence of genomic DNA and RNA-seq data, we identified six <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes which had undergone alternative splicing where each gene produced two isoforms.

The existence of &#945;- and &#946;-transcripts of the six <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes was validated by reverse transcription&#8211;PCR (RT&#8211;PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F2">Fig.&#65533;2</xref>). The &#946;-<italic>CsLOX10</italic> isoform retained the ninth intron, while the remaining <italic>CsLOX</italic> isoforms produced 3' splicing variants. Notably, a premature stop codon (PTC) was found in &#946;-transcripts of <italic>CsLOX1</italic>, <italic>CsLOX2</italic> and <italic>CsLOX3</italic>, which may result in degradation. However, no PTC was found in those of <italic>CsLOX5</italic>, <italic>CsLOX9</italic> and <italic>CsLOX10</italic>, indicating that these genes may produce potentially truncated proteins.

Heterologous expression was necessary to determine whether CsLOX2, CsLOX3 and CsLOX9 proteins are functional LOXs; to determine this, we cloned the protein-coding regions to examine the heterologous expression of each gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> under the control of the inducer isopropyl-&#946;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). To improve the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction, recombinant proteins were purified and characterized.

To investigate the positional specificity of CsLOX proteins, we performed HPLC analysis to test the products resulting from CsLOX enzymatic reactions. Based on their retention times relative to the references 9S-HPOT and 13S-HPOT, we concluded that the products catalyzed by CsLOX3, CsLOX9 and CsLOX2 were 13-HPOT, 9S-HPOT and 9/13S-HPOT, respectively; the target products were not detected in the vector control pMAL-C2X or pGEX-4T-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F3">Fig.&#65533;3B</xref>).

However, there remains a large gap between understanding <italic>LOX</italic> gene sequences and their functions in plants. In this study, we identified and characterized 11 LOX genes in the tea plant <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, including their phylogenetic relationship, their evolution in plant species, and gene and protein structures. We predicted and experimentally verified cellular localization of CsLOXs. We noted differential expression patterns and transcript splicing during tea plant developmental stages, in different tissues, and in response to stresses of insects, pathogens, phytohormones and cold. We concluded that <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes share sequence and functional similarity but have different roles with tissue specificity during development and plant defense, which could be regulated via alterative transcript splicing. Thus, the study highlights the important contribution and efficacy of AS and provides comprehensive understanding of the functional roles of <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes.</p><p>Evolutionarily, the divergence in the gene phylogenetic tree may indicate a divergence in functional roles, while genes within the same cluster may share common functions. <italic>LOX</italic> genes were proposed to have multiple functions in several plant species such as <italic>Populus</italic> (<xref rid="pcy091-B3" ref-type="bibr">Andriy et&#65533;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#65533;al. 2015</xref>). In this study, the classified subfamilies of 13-LOXs and 9-LOXs, which comprise our 11 identified full-length <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes, were predicted and proven to have different functions for 9- or 13-LOX specificity. The primary conserved motifs of R/TH, R/TF, R/SF or R/CF for 13-LOX and R/TV for 9-LOX in the substrate-binding region may determine the 9- or 13-LOX specificity (Feussner and Wasternack 2002). Among the tested CsLOX2, 3 and 9, CsLOX3 and CsLOX9 exhibited 13-LOX and 9-LOX catalytic activities as expected, respectively; however, CsLOX2 exhibited dual-positional specificity. Previously, <italic>CsLOX1</italic> was initially classified as a 9-LOX, but also has dual-positional specificity (<xref rid="pcy091-B53" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Han 2010</xref>). Similar functions of LOXs have been detected in rice, pea and maize (<xref rid="pcy091-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#65533;al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B74" ref-type="bibr">Veronico et&#65533;al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B76" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#65533;al. 2008</xref>). Positional specificity may be imparted by amino acids other than those within the conserved motif. Therefore, we propose that additional amino acids should also contribute to the detailed positional specificity of LOXs. In addition, the dual-positional LOX may enrich the potential biological function via simultaneously producing two different hydroperoxides.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that LOX gene family members play fundamental roles in lipid and fatty acid catabolism in seed germination, plant development and senescence, formation of signaling molecules, stress responses and plant defenses (<xref rid="pcy091-B51" ref-type="bibr">Liavonchanka and Feussner 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B2" ref-type="bibr">Andreou and Feussner 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B83" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#65533;al. 2012</xref>).

Among them, <italic>CsLOX7</italic>, <italic>CsLOX9</italic> and <italic>CsLOX11</italic> showed significantly higher expression in roots than in leaves. This may explain a reported observation that strong 9-LOX catalysis of 9S-HPOT synthesis and its derivatives (i.e. 9-KOT, 9-KOD and 9-HOT) may modulate lateral root formation and decrease primary root elongation (<xref rid="pcy091-B73" ref-type="bibr">Vellosillo et&#65533;al. 2007</xref>).

In contrast to previous studies (<xref rid="pcy091-B82" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki 2005</xref>), our results showed that ABA did not induce the expression of <italic>CsLOX1</italic>, <italic>CsLOX6</italic> and <italic>CsLOX7</italic>, which may result from the absence of ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in promoters of these genes.</p><p>Studies have shown a linkage between environmental stress and AS events (<xref rid="pcy091-B18" ref-type="bibr">Cui and Xiong 2015</xref>). For instance, the clock genes are regulated by extensive AS, and are influenced by various adversities (<xref rid="pcy091-B37" ref-type="bibr">James et&#65533;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B43" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et&#65533;al. 2014</xref>). Plant <italic>LOX</italic> genes are regulated by circadian rhythms (<xref rid="pcy091-B59" ref-type="bibr">Nemchenko et&#65533;al. 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we found similar or opposite expression patterns between <italic>CsLOX</italic> full-length and alternatively spliced transcripts under diverse stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F6">Figs.&#65533;6&#8211;8</xref>), and similar patterns were observed in MtJMJC5 expression profiles in response to cold (<xref rid="pcy091-B69" ref-type="bibr">Shen et&#65533;al. 2016</xref>). For example, the splicing variant &#946;-<italic>CsLOX3</italic> was significantly inhibited by insect feeding, while the &#945;-<italic>CsLOX3</italic> transcript level reached a peak. Previous studies on protein LSm5 and SKIP suggested that alternatively spliced transcripts generally decrease the levels of the corresponding full-length transcripts (<xref rid="pcy091-B19" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#65533;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B22" ref-type="bibr">Feng et&#65533;al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, LOX function should depend on not only full-length transcripts but also alternatively spliced transcripts via compensation or competition. Moreover, sequence analysis of alternatively spliced <italic>CsLOX</italic> indicated that the PTC was in &#946;-<italic>CsLOX1</italic> and &#946;-<italic>CsLOX3</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F2">Fig.&#65533;2</xref>). The alternatively spliced RNA variants with PTCs were degraded through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (<xref rid="pcy091-B9" ref-type="bibr">Brogna and Wen 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B17" ref-type="bibr">Crosetto et&#65533;al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that alternatively spliced transcripts of <italic>CsLOX1</italic> and <italic>CsLOX3</italic> are degraded by NMD, and they meanwhile regulate the abundance of corresponding full-length transcripts via competition for splicing machinery. On the other hand, we proposed that the PTC lacking alternatively spliced variants of <italic>CsLOX2</italic>, <italic>CsLOX5</italic>, <italic>CsLOX9</italic> and <italic>CsLOX10</italic> may encode the truncated proteins. In comparison, Arabidopsis <italic>&#946;-AtHAB1</italic> and <italic>&#946;-AtJAZ2</italic> are truncated proteins and still function at a lower activity than full-length transcripts (<xref rid="pcy091-B16" ref-type="bibr">Chung et&#65533;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B78" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#65533;al. 2015</xref>); hence, the truncated CsLOX proteins may still have activity. Recent reports indicated the different function of alternatively spliced transcripts in plant (<xref rid="pcy091-B41" ref-type="bibr">Kriechbaumer et&#65533;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcy091-B52" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#65533;al. 2018</xref>). In our study, we found that several alternatively spliced transcripts were significantly induced under diverse stresses; for example, &#946;<italic>-CsLOX1</italic> is highly expressed in response to <italic>G. cingulate</italic>. Therefore, we speculate and emphasize that the basic LOX functionality may not only depend on the constitutive transcripts but may also be augmented or modulated to act on stress induction pathways in an AS-dependent manner. The functional validation of alternatively spliced <italic>CsLOX1</italic> could be of interest in our future research.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified 11 <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes from the tea plant (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) genome sequence, classified them into three subfamilies and characterized these CsLOXs by bioinformatic and experimental methods. The regulation of <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes showed differential spatiotemporal expression, and alternative transcript splicing in plant development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy091-F10">Fig.&#65533;10</xref>). The AS in <italic>CsLOX</italic> genes may play a role through compensation or competition with corresponding full-length transcripts. Therefore, this study improves our understanding of evolution of the LOX gene family and their diverse functions in plant.
