The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well demonstrated. Here, we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knock-out tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP, and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at postnatal day 4 but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin&#8217;s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after postnatal day 4.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>advillin</kwd><kwd>autonomic neurons</kwd><kwd>enteric neurons</kwd><kwd>parasympathetic neurons</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>sympathetic neurons</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">http://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</named-content>Gouvernement du Canada | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">http://doi.org/10.13039/100010269</named-content>Wellcome</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="6564"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>September/October 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Significance Statement</title><p>Cell-specific promoters are useful for effecting DNA recombination (e.g., via Cre-lox) for studies of lineage and gene function. Accordingly, advillin, an actin-binding protein expressed in all somatic sensory neurons, has proven valuable in manipulating gene expression therein. Whether advillin expression is restricted to sensory neurons, which is crucial to ascribing primary afferent-specific roles of particular genes, has not been established. Here, we show that advillin is also expressed throughout the adult autonomic and enteric nervous systems, the habenula, and endocrine cells of the skin and gut. Thus, while advillin promoter activity remains useful in achieving recombination in sensory neurons (and some other cells), caution is warranted in interpreting results of experiments in which outcomes depend on multiple advillin-expressing tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to manipulate gene expression within specific cells using recombinase driver (e.g., Cre, Dre, Flp) mice has proved a useful tool in studying gene function. Identifying appropriate promoters, expressed exclusively and ubiquitously within a cell population of interest, to drive recombinase expression is a crucial and challenging first step. This is particularly true for primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which represent an extremely heterogeneous population that have significant overlap in gene expression with other peripheral neurons (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple lines have been created that target subpopulations of sensory neurons based on the expression of sensory receptors, channels or neuropeptides. In the DRG, for example, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8-Cre-recombinase expression occurs predominantly in nociceptive but not mechanoreceptive neurons allowing for manipulation of genes within this subset of nociceptors (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Stirling et al., 2005</xref>). Other sensory neuron populations can be similarly targeted with other subtype-specific promoters (e.g., parvalbumin for proprioceptors, Ret for low-threshold cutaneous mechanoreceptors; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>). However, these promoters target only some DRG neurons and their expression in other tissues reduces their overall utility. As such, the discovery of the expression patterns of the advillin gene generated significant interest.</p><p>Advillin is a member of a gelsolin/villin superfamily of actin binding and regulatory proteins (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 1998</xref>). Identified through a screen of an adult murine brain cDNA, advillin was found to have a high degree of homology with villin, gelsolin and adseverin, all of which are important for control of actin organization (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Silacci et al., 2004</xref>). Functional experiments suggest that advillin is important for neurite growth and for the development of neuronal cells which form ganglia (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ravenall et al., 2002</xref>). Its strong expression in DRG and trigeminal ganglion neurons at embryonic and adult stages led to the production of multiple mouse lines that used the advillin expression for the purposes of labeling, or manipulating genes, within all primary sensory neurons.</p><p>Initially, a knock-in mouse with the start codon of advillin replaced by the axonal tracer human placenta alkaline phophastase was created for the characterization of advillin expression and visualization of sensory endings and central terminal arborizations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al., 2007</xref>). The results suggested that advillin was expressed almost exclusively in sensory neurons. This lead to the development of a mouse with Cre-recombinase under the regulatory elements of the advillin gene for the excision of floxed genes within neurons of the peripheral ganglia (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al. (2011)</xref> recombineered the knock-out mouse with a tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase that they also reported was only expressed in sensory neurons on tamoxifen dosing.</p><p>Since sensory and sympathetic axons are intermingled in target tissues, peripheral nerves, and sympathetic ganglia (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and communication between these systems is important in conditions such as pain and inflammation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Raja, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pongratz and Straub, 2014</xref>), we sought to take advantage of advillin-based reporters and Cre drivers to study the specific role(s) of sensory neurons in these conditions. However, we immediately found that advillin is expressed throughout the peripheral autonomic nervous system. This was surprising, given assertions to the contrary, but partially supported by limited descriptions of expression patterns of advillin in the earlier literature (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ravenall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>). This led us to undertake a more thorough investigation of the expression of advillin in the entire peripheral nervous system and peripheral target tissue of the adult mouse. Along the way we characterize advillin&#8217;s differential expression in the mouse DRG, describe novel advillin-positive axonal spines in pelvic ganglion neurons (mixed sympathetic/parasympathetic), and confirm advillin expression throughout the entire peripheral autonomic nervous system of mice and selected autonomic ganglia in rats and monkeys. Finally, we show that the likely source of confusion regarding advillin&#8217;s specificity is rooted in development: advillin only begins to be expressed in sympathetic and enteric neurons postnatally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3A"><title>Animals and tissues</title><p>Observations were made on three P17 advillin knock-out mice and two wild-type littermates (a generous gift of Prof. Fan Wang, Duke University), five wild-type adult male C57Bl6 mice, two STOCK Tg (Avil-EGFP) QD84Gsat/Mmucd bred in-house for several generations on a CD1 background (&#8220;advillin-EGFP,&#8221; a BAC transgenic), three male advillin-CreERT2 reporter mice [B6.Cg-Tg(Avil-icre/ERT2)AJwo/J crossed with B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J from The Jackson Laboratory (also a BAC transgenic), killed 4 d after 3 d of 75 mg/kg tamoxifen treatment], five adult male Wistar rats, and two rhesus macaques (DRG and sympathetic ganglion tissue a gift of Qingan Zhu, Department of Spine Surgery, Nanfang Hospital, The Southern Medical University, Guangdong, China).

Enteric neurons, on the other hand, tended to be large, advillin-rich and ChAT-negative, or smaller, advillin-poor and ChAT-positive. Advillin expression was absent from the adrenal medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>), despite being of the sympathetic lineage.</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Advillin is expressed throughout the mouse autonomic neuronal lineage.

We therefore examined reporter expression in sensory and sympathetic neurons in advillin-CreERT2 mice crossed with floxed-stop ROSA26-tdtomato mice 4 d following 3 d of tamoxifen treatment. In these mice, reporter expression is far less dependent on the level of ROSA26 activity (which ought to be high and ubiquitous), but more on whether the advillin promoter is active at all. In the DRG, reporter expression varied widely across neurons, but inversely with cell size, most likely reflecting consistent reporter transcription but a limited half-life, and widely-varying cytoplasmic volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). In the stellate ganglion where neuronal size is intermediate but far more uniform, all but a few (&gt;98%) neurons (which probably had not undergone recombination) were brightly fluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p><p>In mouse pelvic ganglia, intense advillin immunoreactivity defined pairs of small neurons, very similar in size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Fortuitously, Allen brain atlas <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies with P4 mice (alleninstitute.org) include sympathetic chain ganglia in their rostral sections of whole spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9<italic>A</italic></xref>, left).

In P4 mice, while advillin immunoreactivity was intense in nodose ganglia (containing primary afferents of the vagus nerve), it was absent from the adjoining superior cervical ganglion (SCG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9<italic>A</italic></xref>, right). Advillin immunoreactivity emerged in the SCG over the next 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9<italic>B</italic></xref>).

In many cases, specificity of advillin expression to the DRG is important in their interpretation, but evidence thereof has been incomplete. We therefore conducted a thorough examination of the expression patterns of advillin in the adult mouse using immunohistochemistry and two advillin reporter mouse strains. Although advillin is expressed in all DRG neurons, we found that the expression was enriched in small, IB4-binding DRG neurons, corresponding to a subpopulation of non-peptidergic nociceptors (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Snider and McMahon, 1998</xref>). Subsequent examination of autonomic neurons revealed substantial advillin expression in enteric, parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons as well as in their peripheral projections. The expression of advillin was particularly notable in fibers innervating blood vessels and in Merkel cells of glabrous and hairy skin. We extended these observations to the peripheral autonomic nervous system of rats and non-human primates. Finally, we show that advillin expression only emerges postnatally in the mouse autonomic nervous system.</p><p>Although advillin is ubiquitously expressed by DRG neurons, it has gone unnoticed that some early work indicated that it is not, in fact, sensory neuron-specific. The initial description of advillin expression in mice by Northern blot and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analyses revealed that in addition to the DRG and trigeminal ganglia, advillin is expressed in uterus, intestines, taste buds, and at low levels in the brain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, expression data for pervin, the rat homolog of the advillin protein, showed expression extensively in both the DRG and SCG (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ravenall et al., 2002</xref>). The initial characterization of the advillin-Cre mouse also showed significant levels of Cre expression within the adult SCG (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>). These early but clear indications of advillin expression in autonomic structures appear to have been subsequently overlooked. A reason might simply be anatomy: compared to easily-identifiable DRGs in the bony confines of the spinal column and the trigeminal ganglia in the base of the skull (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Devor, 1999</xref>), the autonomic ganglia are widely-dispersed in the soft tissue of the animal and more challenging to isolate. For example, even the relatively large SCG can easily be confused by the inexperienced with nearby lymph nodes. The more likely explanation is that conclusions about advillin distribution have relied on prenatal expression patterns (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Minett et al., 2012</xref>). The present work not only underscores that advillin is expressed in adult autonomic neurons (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zurborg et al., 2011</xref>), but also identifies the first postnatal week as the time at which advillin expression by sympathetic neurons begins, and the second week for enteric neurons.</p><p>The lack of specificity of advillin expression is in some cases without significant issue. For example, the only spinal cord-projecting advillin-expressing axons are those of primary afferents which terminate throughout the gray matter and form the ascending dorsal columns. As such, studies that use advillin driven reporter expression to examine the termination patterns of sensory neurons in the spinal cord are able to take advantage of this mouse while avoiding potential pitfalls (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Leslie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Comer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, studies which use advillin-Cre expression tolabel neurons or knock-out genes <italic>in vivo</italic> before studying the effect within DRG neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, circumvent the problems with additional gene expression changes in other cell types (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lopes et al., 2017</xref>). Combinatorial approaches taking advantage of expression of multiple genes have been used to effect changes in a more specific cell population than advillin alone. For example, McCoy et al. used an advillin-Cre mouse crossed with a LoxP-stopped human diphtheria receptor knocked-in to the CGRP&#945; locus so that CGRP-expressing sensory neurons were specifically targeted for ablation with diphtheria toxin (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">McCoy and Zylka, 2014</xref>). Requiring the expression of multiple genes for recombination may be the key to specifically targeting the entire population of DRG neurons.</p><p>Caution, however, must be applied when interpreting results where multiple advillin-positive populations are involved, such as <italic>in vivo</italic> regeneration studies, or where changes in behavioral responses or target tissue innervation are examined (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Minett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, this may mean simply extending conclusions to include additional cell populations. For example, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al. (2014)</xref> used advillin-driven reporter expression in axons to conclude that SCG10 is present at high levels in sensory, but not motor axons; our results (not to mention the fact that SCG10 stands for superior cervical ganglion 10), allow inclusion of sympathetics among SCG10-enriched axons. However, for cases where the independent roles of sensory and autonomic neurons need to be considered separately, such as in some studies of pain and neuroinflammation, the expression of advillin throughout the peripheral nervous system could significantly impact the conclusions. In one such study (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Minett et al., 2012</xref>), the role of (floxed) Nav1.7 in different pain modalities was examined using mouse lines that had Cre expression driven by either Wnt1, which is expressed in all neural crest derived cells, Nav1.8, which is expressed in a subset of sensory neurons, or advillin. Interestingly, only the Wnt1-Cre mice demonstrated a &#8220;pain-free&#8221; phenotype, which was inferred as due to the elimination of Nav1.7 in both sensory and sympathetic neurons. However, based on the fact that advillin is expressed in peripheral sympathetic neurons, an alternate explanation for their findings must be found. Feng et al., used advillin-driven channelrhodopsin 2 to &#8220;selectively&#8221; stimulate sensory axons projecting to the colon <italic>via</italic> the pelvic nerve (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). Not only does the pelvic nerve convey sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the colon from the pelvic ganglion, but it also contains centrifugally-projecting axons of enteric neurons (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Luckensmeyer and Keast, 1996</xref>), all of which would be expected in this case to be activated by light. It is clear from these examples that the key to drawing conclusions from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that use genetically modified mice is in understanding the complete impact of the modifications. Indeed, a recent study took advantage of advillin-Cre expression in both sensory neurons and Merkel cells, to demonstrate the importance of Piezo<sub>2</sub> expression in transduction of low-threshold mechanical stimuli (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the expression of advillin in multiple cells types limits its use as a way to specifically target primary sensory neurons, modification of techniques may help to restrict gene manipulation to desired populations. Attempts to only activate recombination in primary sensory neurons might be undertaken in advillin-CreERT2 mice via intrathecal administration of tamoxifen methiodide (which unlike tamoxifen, does not easily cross the blood-brain-barrier (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Biegon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">S&#246;mjen et al., 1996</xref>). A second method might be the intrathecal administration of specific serotypes of recombinant adeno-associated virus (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Storek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Vulchanova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Machida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fagoe et al., 2014</xref>) carrying advillin promoter-driven Cre, which would result in Cre expression only in the infected cells that are also expressing advillin. However, difficulties with achieving high-level, long last lasting gene expression within all DRGs by intrathecal injection may mean lower recombination efficiency in the peripheral sensory neuron population (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Beutler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Vulchanova et al., 2010</xref>). An alternative is suggested by our developmental data: conditional recombination using advillin-CreERT2 mice before postnatal day 4 would be expected to spare autonomic neurons.</p><p>In conclusion, our data clearly show that in mammals, advillin is expressed in the all classes of neural crest-derived neurons; advillin-driven expression of reporters or recombinases is not sensory neuron specific. Genetic labeling or modification based on advillin expression remains useful, but must take in to account or exclude potentially important roles of other advillin-expressing cells.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list content-type="nameDate"><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Abe</surname>

The authors find that advillin is expressed fairly broadly and can be found in most neural-crest derived cells. This finding is important because the advillin locus is widely used to drive Cre recombinase expression for sensory neuron specific recombination. The paper points out that advillin promoter driven Cre expression will also lead to recombination in other cell types including the autonomic and enteric nervous systems, the habenula and various endocrine cells of the gut and skin. While this finding is not particularly novel (several other groups have described advillin expression beyond the peripheral nervous system), it is timely in that it has become almost dogma that advillin Cre driver lines are sensory neuron specific. However, there are some concerns that must be addressed before a final decision regarding publication, as follows:</p><p>1) Validation of the advillin antibody must be done on advillin knockout tissues as controls. This is critical given the main message of the paper, as otherwise doubts may still remain.</p><p>2) The paper should be strengthened by inclusion of developmental data. This can be done by immunostaining of embryos at E15-16 or by labeling using the Tg(Avil-icre/ERT2). In Hasegawa et.al, it is clearly demonstrated that Advillin is not expressed in the SCG (by in situ and KI PLAP reporter). It might well be that there is a window in which the expression is sensory neurons specific.</p><p>3) The authors tend to overstate the novelty of their work and are too strong in their condemnation of previous work which reported sensory-neuron specific expression of advillin, for example on page 5 and 6. Similarly, Zurborg et al found expression of advillin in other tissues contrary to what might be assumed from paragraph 2 on page 5, and this should be made more explicit. Citations of the original advillin-Cre mouse (Hasegawa et al) are also sometimes missing (e.g. first line of the discussion). By toning down assertions about previous literature, and perhaps discussing technical differences which might arise from using different mouse lines (knock-ins versus BAC transgenics) and different protocols for tamoxifen induction, the message that advillin is expressed beyond DRG neurons would still be clear.</p><p>4) The authors sometimes include data from public resources in their figures (Figure 1 and Figure 3). It would be more convincing if original data could be included and this data be removed. This is most apparent in Figure 3. Rather than the inset in 3A, it would be quite simple to include an original image at the same spinal level from the advillin-GFP mouse line used in this study. Similarly, the table in 3D does not add much information, and if the authors wish to explore Avil expression in different populations of DRG neurons then immunohistochemistry experiments should be performed with the appropriate marker antibodies.</p><p>5) The authors should provide more information about the Tg animals they used. Are these transgenic, BAC-transgenic or a knockin?</p><p>6) The authors do not refer to Fig. 5 in the text?</p></sec><sec sec-type="synthesis-author-response" id="s7"><title>Author Response</title><p>Dear Dr. Fainzilber,</p><p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to submit a revised version of our manuscript. The MS has been revised according to the reviewers' suggestions. We have also performed an additional developmental study as suggested by the reviewer(s), which we feel has greatly improved the mansuscript.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>1) Validation of the advillin antibody must be done on advillin knockout tissues as controls. This is critical given the main message of the paper, as otherwise doubts may still remain.</p><p>Response: </p><p>This would certainly be true were ISH data, other antibodies, and reporter mice not available. The developmental data we now include provide further support. First, the antibody data match precisely with ISH data in brain and DRG (Allen institute ISH data shown in Fig. 1). Second, advillin immunohistochemistry mirrors Advillin-EGFP signal not only in terms of tissue distribution, but also in terms of intensity in the DRG (note tight correlation in Fig. 1), and temporal expression (Figure 9, where we show postnatal onset of advillin expression in sympathetics). Third, mouse duodenal staining with the antibody we used (abcam ab72210) matches immunohistochemical staining in the human duodenum using a diffierent advillin antibody (Atlas antibodies HPA058864). Fourth, both reporter lines, which are different BAC transgenics, show overlap in the appropriate tissues. It might be argued that in either strain (advillin-EGFP and advillin-CreERT2), the site of integration and copy number of the BAC transgenes are unknown, which might lead to a degree of uncertainty as to whether local chromatin environment, nearby genes or extra copies of advillin might distort native expression patterns. However, both variables are also extremely likely to differ between the two lines, since construct integration and concatemerization are determined by chance during the generation of founder mice. Any overlap in expression (of EGFP or CreERT2) is therefore likely to reflect &#8220;real advillin signal&#8221; and independent of possible extraneous artefacts specific to a particular transgenic strain. Together, these data render any concern about the specificity of the antibody vanishingly small. This has been clarified in the text.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>2) The paper should be strengthened by inclusion of developmental data. This can be done by immunostaining of embryos at E15-16 or by labeling using the Tg(Avil-icre/ERT2). In Hasegawa et.al, it is clearly demonstrated that Advillin is not expressed in the SCG (by in situ and KI PLAP reporter). It might well be that there is a window in which the expression is sensory neurons specific.</p><p>Response:</p><p>This has turned out to be an excellent suggestion. We went back to Allen Institute ISH data, and found that in their P4 cord samples (whole spine), the upper thoracic sympathetic chain was often included. At P4, advillin mRNA is expressed at very low levels in the sympathetic chain (Fig. 9A). We therefore looked at pups aged 4 days, 7 days and 10 days, and show that both advillin immunoreactivity and advillin-driven EGFP fluorescence emerge during the post-natal period. We have changed the title of the paper to reflect that advillin is not sensory neuron specific in the adult mouse. This has also led to solutions for genetic manipulation using advillin-CreERT2: i.e. treat with tamoxifen prior to P4. </p><p>Comment:</p><p>3) The authors tend to overstate the novelty of their work and are too strong in their condemnation of previous work which reported sensory-neuron specific expression of advillin, for example on page 5 and 6. Similarly, Zurborg et al found expression of advillin in other tissues contrary to what might be assumed from paragraph 2 on page 5, and this should be made more explicit. Citations of the original advillin-Cre mouse (Hasegawa et al) are also sometimes missing (e.g. first line of the discussion). By toning down assertions about previous literature, and perhaps discussing technical differences which might arise from using different mouse lines (knock-ins versus BAC transgenics) and different protocols for tamoxifen induction, the message that advillin is expressed beyond DRG neurons would still be clear.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have toned-down our criticisms of previous literature, although it is important to emphasize that the dogmatic notion of advillin as sensory specific is mistaken, which has led to some conclusions that need revisiting. The new developmental experiments add novelty, and point not to differences in BAC transgenic lines, but developmental differences between DRGs, sympathetics, and enteric neurons in terms of advillin expression.</p><p>The Hasegawa paper did not use an advillin-cre mouse. Rather they generated an advillin-hPLAP mouse. </p><p>Comment:</p><p>4) The authors sometimes include data from public resources in their figures (Figure 1 and Figure 3). It would be more convincing if original data could be included and this data be removed. This is most apparent in Figure 3. Rather than the inset in 3A, it would be quite simple to include an original image at the same spinal level from the advillin-GFP mouse line used in this study. Similarly, the table in 3D does not add much information, and if the authors wish to explore Avil expression in different populations of DRG neurons then immunohistochemistry experiments should be performed with the appropriate marker antibodies.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The purpose of publicly available datasets is to avoid re-inventing the wheel. However, we have now included &#8220;original&#8221; advillin-EGFP data in Figs 1 and 3. Not surprisingly, these match the publicly available data, since they are the same transgenic line. We have kept the parasagittal section from the Gensat database as it nicely demonstrates the habenula and fasciculus retroflexus. We have also kept the Allen ISH data for the habenula as it strengthens the argument that the antibody is specific. </p><p>We have definitively shown that the DRG neuronal subpopulation that expresses advillin at high levels is the non-peptidergic (IB4-binding) phenotype. The evidence for this is (1) the pattern of advillin staining in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in lamina IIi, and (2) the tight correlation between IB4-binding intensity and advillin intensity (both Figure 3). It is well-established that the IB4-population has little overlap with the other neuronal phenotypes in the mouse (peptidergic nociceptors, NF200 cells, TH-positive neurons), and so repeating this experiment with markers for those populations would be redundant. Although the Usoskin-Ernfors table provides further information about the supopulation of non-peptidergic cells with high advillin expression, we have removed it for clarity.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>5) The authors should provide more information about the Tg animals they used. Are these transgenic, BAC-transgenic or a knockin?</p><p>Response:</p><p>Both the advillin-EGFP and Advillin-CreERT2 lines are BAC transgenics. This has been clarified.</p><p>Comment:</p><p>6) The authors do not refer to Fig. 5 in the text?</p><p>Response:</p><p>We do indeed refer to Fig. 5 (highlighted text in the revised version).</p></sec></back></article>
