Here, using deep RNA profiling with linear RNA digestion by RNase R we explored a comprehensive map of changes in circRNA expression in rhesus macaque (<italic>macaca mulatta</italic>) brain in two age groups from adult (10&#8201;y) to aged (20&#8201;y) periods. Total 17,050 well expressed, stable circRNAs were identified. Cluster analysis reveals that dynamic changes in circRNA expression show the spatial-, sex- and age-biased specificities. On the basis of separate profiling of the RNAs, age-related circRNAs show differential correlation to host mRNA expression. Furthermore, two voltage-dependent L- and R-type calcium channel gene-derived circCACNA2D1 and circCACNA1E negatively regulate their host mRNA expression. Our results demonstrate the power of changes in circRNA expression to reveal insights into a potentially circRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying the biology of brain aging.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China (Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB755605</award-id><award-id>2016YFC1305902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jiali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Aging leads to changes in brain function as well as many other physiological activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Brain aging is characterized by changes in the neuronal physiology, from molecular, to cell and functional levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. One of the biggest obstacles in the study of brain aging is there are no good markers which classify normal versus pathological brain aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recent studies demonstrate that local RNA including mRNA-, miRNA- and lncRNA-mediated regulation is heavily involved in synaptic development and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Circular RNA (circRNA) is formed by head-to-tail splicing with the covalent joining the 5&#8242; end of one exon with the 3&#8242; end of another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

With deep sequencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-depleted RNA, in combination with other biological and computational tools, this has led to the identification of thousands of new circRNAs in organisms ranging from Archaea to human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Alternatively, linear RNA digestion by the RNA exonuclease RNase R method was also employed to identify and enrich circRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The phenomenon in which miRNA &#8216;sponges&#8217; sequestering miRNAs and prevents their interactions with target mRNAs was contributed by a couple of circRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The best known ones so far include a particular type of circRNA namely &#8220;circular RNA sponge for miR-7&#8221; (ciRS-7/CDR1as) which is the inhibitor of miR-7 microRNA&#8212;known to regulate various diseases like, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Similarly, another circRNA molecule called circMbl modulates the ratio of linear mRNA by competing with linear muscleblind gene through which it is synthesized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, circRNAs could also sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and thereby regulate the intracellular transport of associated RBPs or RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Recently, two studies suggest that circRNAs could be translated in a cap-independent way, as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">CircRNAs are highly enriched in the mammalian brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Recent studies indicate that circRNAs might service as a new regulatory network that may contributes to brain development, maturity, and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It is reported that a subset of circRNAs in monkey muscle were significantly repressed as muscle aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Loss of circRNA CDR1as locus in mouse causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, circRNAs represent a heterogeneous and dynamic class of noncoding transcripts that likely regulate brain function via as yet undiscovered and diverse mechanisms. However, the expression pattern and function of the majority of circRNAs in the brain, especially in primates, remains unknown. Indeed, it is a huge task to explore whether alterations in circRNA expression and function are involved in the process of brain aging.</p><p id="Par6">Aging probably derives from a relationship between environmental factors, mutations, and regulation of gene expression. While in vitro and in vivo studies on mammals allow hypotheses that may be useful for the understanding of aging events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, there is no theory for explaining the biological age-related and age-dependent changes in human brain. Nonhuman primates have served as one of the most valuable models for modeling human diseases and developing therapeutic strategies due to their close similarities to human in genetic and physiological features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, to systematically identify and analyze dynamic changes in circRNA expression in rhesus macaque brain during aging, we sequenced linear RNAs&#8211;depleted RNAs from multiple brain compartments in the 10 and 20 years old rhesus macaque brain smaples, which indicated the states of brain aging, and performed subsequent computational analyses and experimental validation. Our findings reveal that circRNAs are highly abundant in rhesus macaque brain, and changes in circRNA expression show spatiotemporal- and sex-biased specificities during aging, and age-related circRNA correlate with their host mRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genome-wide identification of circRNAs in rhesus macaque brain</title><p id="Par8">To systematically determine the pattern of circRNA expression in the rhesus macaque brain during aging, we deep-sequenced RNA samples with linear RNAs depleted from eight anatomical brain compartments including prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal cortex (TC), parietal cortex (PC) and occipital cortex (OC), hippocampus (CA1), and dentate gyrus (DG), and cerebellar cortex (CB) of rhesus macaque across the two ages (10&#8201;y and 20&#8201;y) (Supplementary Table&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Research pipeline of our study was briefly concluded in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Candidate circRNAs with head-to-tail junctions were detected by the CIRI2 software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> with the threshold of two or more head-to-tail junction reads in each sample. The DESeq normalization method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> was used to quantify circular transcript expression level. In total, we detected 52,828 distinct circRNA candidates spliced from 8147 genes as well as intergenic regions from all macaque brain samples. Brain-expressed circRNAs were usually derived from annotated exons (34,321, 64.97%). Due to the incomplete annotation of macaque, circRNAs derived from the intergenic region (11,619, 21.99%) still occupied reasonable quantity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Next, we further utilized find_circ (version 1.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to re-predict circRNAs for our data. 37694 circRNAs were detected by find_circ, including 30684 circRNAs (81.40%) with two or more head-to-tail junction reads. Although more than 80% circRNAs by find_circ were re-detected by CIRI2, about half of the circRNAs (48.0%) detected by CIRI2 were not included in the find_circ set (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>Profiling of circRNA expression in rhesus macaque brain</bold>. <bold>a</bold> Pipeline of library construction, data analysis and functional exploration for macaque brain-expressed circRNAs in this study. <bold>b</bold> Pie chart showing the genomic distribution of all predicted circRNAs from eight macaque brain regions. <bold>c</bold> Venn diagram showing the overlapping distribution between CIRI2 and find_circ predicted circRNAs. <bold>d</bold> Subsets of circRNAs and mRNAs were quantifed by RT-qPCR analysis with (brown) or without (gray) RNase R treatment, as well as following RPAD (green)&#160;method. <italic>GAPDH</italic> was shown with only linear mRNAs. <bold>e</bold> Reads distribution of circSTAU2 from OC region showing the efficient linear mRNA digestion by RNase R.

To assess the efficiency of RNase R treatment in this study, we tested the residual linear RNAs in our samples by using RNase R alone or a recently published RPAD method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. It is obvious that linear mRNAs were effectively digested by both RNase R and RPAD methods, when compared to the respective circRNAs. RPAD was more efficient than RNase R alone for two of the four tested linear mRNAs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Generally, less than 20% of mRNAs were left after RNase R treatment alone, implying the high efficiency of RNase R treatment. To further illustrate the linear RNA digestion efficiency and the confidence of the detected cirRNA, we presented the reads distribution map of both circRNA-seq reads and RNA-seq reads from polyA-puridied mRNAs for one circRNA host gene, <italic>STAU2</italic>. Exon regions of circRNA origination were with abundant reads, while exon regions out of circRNA origination were with little transcriptional signal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). As a control, the polyA-enriched RNA-seq data of the same samples from our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> showed abundant transcriptional signal in non-circRNA regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), illustrating the efficient linear RNA digestion by RNase R.</p><p id="Par10">Splicing sites of circRNAs typically enclose three exons. While the median number of circRNA isoforms per gene in macaque brain samples is five, 1212 genes give rise to ten or more circular isoforms. Similar to the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the majority of head-to-tail junctions were supported by few reads (two to ten), we also detected 7504 (14.20%) circRNAs supported by more than 100 junction-spanning reads (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). To confirm the data reliability of circRNA prediction, we downloaded and reanalyzed the mouse data from the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> with CIRI2. Over 80% circRNAs detected by Rybak et al. were also detected by CIRI2 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>), illustrating the sensitivity of CIRI2. While the 3093 circRNAs detected specifically by CIRI2 also implied the higher discovery efficiency but also the potential false discovery rate. Meanwhile, the overlapped circRNAs exhibited higher abundance than the non-overlapped circRNAs (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>), which implied that circRNA with the higher expression level could be more easily detected. The higher number of rhesus macaque brain circRNA candidates may partially be explained by the higher sequencing depth.</p><p id="Par11">To independently test the confidence of the CIRI2-detected circRNAs in this study, we randomly selected 24 circRNAs for validation by RT-qPCR with divergent primers, including eight circRNAs only detected by CIRI2 and 16 circRNAs by both methods. All of these circRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR (Supplementary Table&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Then eleven randomly selected circRNAs from the above 24 circRNAs were subjected to Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), all showing back-spliced junction sequences consistent with the prediction, including three circRNAs only identified by CIRI2 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>), and eight circRNAs detected by both methods (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f-k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dynamic expression pattern of circRNAs and high conservation between human and macaque</title><p id="Par12">Next, we characterized the patterns of circRNA expression in the eight brain areas. Interestingly despite more specific circRNAs were detected in cerebral cortex compared with other regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), CA1 and DG showed less enriched for circRNA expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To understand the features of circRNA expression in macaque brain, we plotted the abundance of circRNAs in each of totally sex- and age-matched 32-paired samples (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Indeed, the highly varying and dynamic expression pattern may be due to the low abundance of numerous circRNAs or the natural cell-type-specific feature of circRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To further explore the conservative property of circRNAs, we downloaded 140,790 and 16,444 circRNAs for human and mouse, respectively, from circBase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and performed a comparative analysis. By utilizing the LiftOver software, we systematically mapped the human and mouse circRNAs to the macaque genome according to the genomic locus. With strict threshold, significant more macaque circRNAs find their homologies from human than mouse (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), indicating the better conservation of circRNAs between primates. Nevertheless, about 40% circRNAs could not be mapped to human circRNAs database, implying the inherent divergence feature of circRNAs. We also validated the homology analysis by blast method. Among the macaque circRNAs that have homology to human or mouse, 17,190 circRNAs (32.54%) were identified in all three species. The homologues between macaque brain circRNAs and the human circRNAs were much higher by increasing the blast stringency compared with the homologues between macaque and mouse (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>The conservation of circRNAs in human and rhesus macaque</bold>. <bold>a</bold> Venn diagram showed the overlapped result of circRNAs detected in three brain regions. <bold>b</bold> Bar plot of circRNA numbers detected in the eight brain areas. <bold>c</bold> Conservation analysis showed the higher conservation ratio between macaque and human compared with that of mouse, indicating the higher conservation between primates. <bold>d</bold> Linear plot of the decreased number of circRNAs by increasing the alignment threshold E-value by BLAST, which showed that circRNAs sequence character between human and macaque is more conserved than mouse. <bold>e</bold> Venn diagram showed the overlapped circRNAs between find_circ method and CIRI2 method after filtering</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41421_2018_50_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e653"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">To eliminate the influence of low expressed circRNAs, we filtered circRNAs expressed only in sporadic samples with low abundance (see methods for detail thresholds). Finally, we reserved a total of 17,050 unique circRNAs from the eight brain compartments, originated from 4902 host genes. 12241 circRNAs (73%) from these filtered circRNA sets were detected by find_circ (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We then used the 17050 circRNA set to perform the following analysis, and searched the functions of these filtered circRNA host genes. Important neuronal pathways were enriched from the KEGG pathway (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), such as Long-term potentiation, Glutamatergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. We also investigated these genes from the Gene Ontology (GO) database, and found that they also participated in the protein phosphorylation and catabolic process (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). This analysis could provide a new perspective to investigate these circRNA-originating genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cerebellar circRNAs are distinct from that of other areas by spatial analysis</title><p id="Par14">CircRNAs are enriched and differentially expressed in the mammalian brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To further define an overview of spatial patterns of circRNA expression in rhesus macaque brain, we explored circRNA expression modules by co-expression network analysis of WGCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Cubic power was chosen as the soft threshold to calculate block wise modules (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). This network identified 38 main circRNA expression modules (including module 0), each represented by a characteristic expression pattern (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). CircRNAs number in each module ranged from 39 to 1652. Surprisingly, we found the correlation coefficient values were quite small as a whole from the dendrogram and correlation heatmap of the module eigengenes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). However, five modules (darkgrey, magenta, darkturquoise, lightcyan, and paleturquoise) were clustered together and showed high correlation between each other. Other modules were very distinct from each other, and the distance between the specific modules was very high (more than 0.8, Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">To further validate the above finding, we utilized other methods to explore spatial-regulated circRNAs in brain.

Expression pattern of other modules showed distinctly high level in one or two samples from different brain areas, which did not exhibit the regular expression pattern. Despite the fact that circRNA expression was more tissue- and cell-type specific than mRNA expression, our finding reflected that there existed circRNAs which possessed consistent and distinct expression patterns for the cerebellum region.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>Cerebellar circRNAs were enriched and distinct from that of other areas.</bold>

This phenomenon supports the above discovery that circRNAs in CB were abundant and distinct from other regions. Moreover, from another previous study on lncRNAs using the same biological samples, we also obtained the similar results that both lncRNAs and mRNAs from CB was distinct from other regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Spatial-specific circRNA groups of hippocampus regions (CA1 and DG, total 64, 13.11%) were the smallest circRNA sets compared with cerebellum and cerebral cortex (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The spatial-specific circRNAs number from each neocortical region varied mildly from 13 to 98. PCA method was performed to assess the spatial expression patterns of these circRNAs. As shown in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, CB was also dramatically separated from all other regions, and other region samples exhibited similar pattern on the first principal component (PC1). To independently test these results, we selected tens of spatial-specific circRNA candidates with different expression levels. For five CB specific circRNAs, all of them were validated to be expressed higher in CB (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e1</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

This solid validation supports the conclusion that spatial-specific circRNA expression pattern exists in the macaque brain samples. We also analyzed the function of host genes for spatial-specific circRNAs. Enriched KEGG pathways for all spatial-related circRNA host genes were performed. Compared with the total circRNA host genes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), spatial-specific circRNAs yielded functional pathways more related to various signaling pathways related to brain development and function (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). Spatial classification of circRNAs revealed that plentiful circRNAs which were originated from the brain function-related host genes were distinctly expressed in the cerebral cortices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>A sex-related circRNA expression found in rhesus macaque brain</title><p id="Par17">From previous studies, sex-biased expression of protein coding genes has been reported in human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, but the sex-biased expression pattern for circRNA has not been reported. To further explore the impact of specificity of circRNA regulation, we screened sex-specific circRNAs from a different aspect regardless of the spatial and age regulation. By statistically identifying circRNAs differentially expressed between all male and female brain samples, a total of 468 sex-biased circRNAs containing 194 female-biased and 274 male-biased were obtained (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). A little more sex-biased circRNAs were detected by permutation test (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). Highly overlapped circRNAs implied the consistent sex-biased circRNA results. Although no sex-biased circRNAs were detected from the Y chromosome, a larger fraction (58.54%) of male-biased circRNAs was detected, which was consistent with previous findings of mRNAs from human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We observed more male-biased circRNAs (four circRNAs) were found from X chromosome than that from female (two circRNAs), but the total percentage of sex-biased circRNAs from X chromosome showed no enrichment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The circCD99, whose host gene CD99 was validated as male specific from Weickert et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, was also calculated as male specific from X chromosome (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The similar male-biased expression patterns were found from circPREX1 and circTSPAN15 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b-c</xref>), whose host genes were treated as male specific by Kang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We further validated several circRNAs showing sex-biased expression pattern. For example, circEFCAB2 was for male-biased expression pattern, circPCTP and circZNF484 were for female-biased pattern (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d</xref>).

The positive correlation and the consistent bias with host mRNAs of sex-specific feature indicated that sex-specific circRNAs showed no allosome bias and may be influenced by their host linear RNAs. We then analyzed the expression pattern of host genes of these sex-specific circRNAs. However, spatial factor was more pronounced than the sex factor for these genes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>), implying the distinct expression patterns of circRNAs and their host genes. To investigate the functional identity of circRNAs in their sex-biased features, functional enrichment analysis of host mRNA genes with each of the sex-related circRNA was performed to allow us to further annotate these circRNAs. From the biological process (BP) term of the GO database, several terms related to the signal transduction, protein modification and transport were significant enriched compared with the background, relating to various physiological and pathological states of primate brain in a sex-biased manner (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f</xref>). Cellular component (CC) terms from GO database revealed that host genes of these circRNAs were mainly distributed in cytoplasm, nucleoplasm microtubule, synapse, postsynaptic membrane, and density (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4g</xref>). KEGG pathways were also obtained for all host genes of sex-biased circRNAs, which yielded distinct functional pathways including RNA degradation, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, related to various physiological and pathological states of primate brain in a sex-biased manner (Supplementary Fig.&#160;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4h</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p><bold>Sex-biased circRNA analysis showed more male-biased circRNAs</bold>. <bold>a</bold> Clustering heatmap of sex-biased circRNA expression levels.

Therefore, we asked whether the dynamics expression pattern of circRNAs in primate is associated with aging-related changes in brain function and structures. We screened aging-related circRNAs from the aspect regardless of the sex and spatial regulation. We also used <italic>t</italic>-test method to identify circRNAs differentially expressed between 10 years and 20 years brain samples.

While circRNA identification mostly relied on genome annotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, we used the updated circRNA identifier software CIRI2 and find_circ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> to identify circRNAs with remarkably balanced sensitivity, reliability, duration, and RAM usage. CIRI2 also does not rely on exon annotations or assumption of canonical splice sites, and can thus identify circRNAs derived from previously unannotated exons and transcripts, as well as the intergenic regions. This allowed us to identify circRNAs in rhesus macaque brain, which, up-to-date, has relatively incomplete annotations of transcriptome and functions, particularly in the aged brain. Using this approach, 17,050 well expressed circRNAs were identified in rhesus monkey brain. Functional analyses and exploration of two specific calcium channel gene-derived circRNAs, suggesting that age-related circRNA biogenesis regulates its host mRNA production, and is potentially involved in the biological process of brain aging.</p><p id="Par26">In this study, we sacrificed eight macaques in total, two females and two males at 10-year and 20-year ages. After extracting total RNAs, the two biological replicates were mixed together to prepare libraries and circRNA-seq, which should effectively eliminate the problem of individual biases. Furthermore, we have obtained circRNA-seq data from eight different regions of each mixed pair of animals. Therefore, a total of 32 circRNA-seq data were generated to analyze the spatial-, sex- and aging-regulated circRNAs. For each set of statistical analysis, there were either 4 or 16 circRNA-seq data in each compared group, which should be enough to avoid the interference of experimental variations and to yield confident results. We analyzed sex-regulated and aging-regulated circRNAs by both permutation and <italic>t</italic>-test, which yielded highly similar results. Taken together, the experimental approaches applied should be adequate to support the related conclusions. Meanwhile, we are aware of the limitations of the conclusions drawn from an aging trend with only 2 time points. Future studies are needed to include more time points during macaque aging.</p><p id="Par27">We observed that circRNAs are more conserved between human and macaque than that between mouse and macaque (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This led us the hypothesis that human specific circRNAs may play more important roles in perception and learning. Moreover, we analyzed the common of circRNAs detected in macaque and human, 23,921 (45.28 %) of the circRNAs identified in macaque PFC and cerebellar cortex were also expressed in human PFC and cerebellar cortex. This further suggests that circRNAs are well conserved, and our observation that 13.67% overlap between macaque and human circRNAs may prove to be an underestimate. Notably, the exon sequences around head-to-tail junctions detected in both macaque and human are extremely conserved, strongly suggesting their potential functional relevance.</p><p id="Par28">While circRNAs are ever thought as side products of pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, recent studies have suggested that circRNAs have biological functions based on their strong tissue- and cell-type-specific expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. For instance, brain-specific circRNAs are expressed from gene loci that also code for proteins take part in synapse-related functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the present study, we have extracted circRNAs showing spatial-specific, sex-biased, aging-biased, and relationship with host mRNA characters. In line with former studies, we found most of the circRNAs (~90%) showed none of this characteristic and their expression pattern seemed to be random. Nonetheless, there is also over one thousand circRNAs with these features. Among which about 3% circRNAs (475 out of 17,050) participates in the biology of brain aging. To investigate if changes in circCACNA2D1 and circCACNA1E expression are associated with their host calcium channel gene mRNA expression, we detected and revealed a strong correlation between <italic>c</italic>ircCACNA2D1, circCACNA1E, and their host mRNA expression in rhesus macaque brain over the aging states. Further investigation may help to elucidate the role of increased circCACNA2D1 and circCACNA1E expression in the neurobiology of aging.</p><p id="Par29">Overall, this is a first systematic analysis of circRNA profiles in nonhuman primate brain, and is also a first clustering of changes in circRNA expression during brain aging. We generated a highly qualitative novel resource for the neuroscience community. Variance decomposition analysis was used to obtain a quantitative assessment of the involvement of circRNAs in the biology of brain aging, independent of genetic influences. This deep characterization of molecular events is expected to substantially boost focused functional explorations of circRNA-mediated regulatory system, and an important step toward further elucidation of circRNA function underlining the biology of brain aging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals and samples collection</title><p id="Par30">Frozen postmortem brain tissue samples from rhesus macaque were provided by Kunming Primate Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KPRC).
