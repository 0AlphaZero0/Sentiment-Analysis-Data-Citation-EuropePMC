However, it is not well understood how community structure, including its richness, mass, and composition, influences soil functions. We investigated the relationships between soil productivity and microbial communities in unfertilized arable soils extending over 1000 km in eastern Japan. Soil properties, including C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, microbial C, and various soil chemical properties, were measured. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illumina&#8217;s MiSeq using 16S rRNA and ITS regions. In addition, root microbial communities from maize grown in each soil were also investigated. Soil bacterial communities shared many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among farms. An ordination plot based on correspondence analysis revealed convergent distribution of soil bacterial communities across the farms, which seemed to be a result of similar agricultural management practices. Although fungal communities showed lower richness and a lower proportion of shared OTUs than bacterial communities, community structure between the farms tended to be convergent. On the other hand, root communities had lower richness and a higher abundance of specific taxa than the soil communities. Two soil functions, decomposition activity and soil productivity, were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) based on eight soil properties. Soil productivity correlated with N mineralization rate, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and maize growth, but not with decomposition activity, which is characterized by C turnover rate, soil organic C, and microbial mass. Soil productivity showed a significant association with community composition, but not with richness and mass of soil microbial communities. Soil productivity also correlated with the abundance of several specific taxa, both in bacteria and fungi. Root communities did not show any clear correlations with soil productivity. These results demonstrate that community composition and abundance of soil microbial communities play important roles in determining soil productivity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP25281059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9064-5184</contrib-id><name><surname>Sugiyama</surname><given-names>Shuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant number JP26550092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9064-5184</contrib-id><name><surname>Sugiyama</surname><given-names>Shuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI Grant Number JP25281059 and JP26550092) to SS.

The diversity and composition of these communities vary largely between different environments. For example, the structure of microbial communities can be influenced by soil pH [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], soil type [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], electrical conductivity (EC) [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], nutrient availability [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], climate [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and vegetation type [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, microbial communities play an important role in determining soil functions such as carbon (C) turnover rate, mineralization of nitrogen (N), and pest control [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As soil properties influence the microbial community, and the microbial community, in turn, shapes various soil functions, there exists a close association between the soil and the microbes.</p><p>Soil productivity is strongly influenced by soil microbial communities. Since crop yield in conventional agriculture depends strongly on the utilization of synthetic fertilizers and various kinds of pesticides, the effects of soil productivity on crop yield have been neglected. In contrast, organic farming does not depend on synthetic fertilizers, and thus crop yield essentially relies on soil productivity. While soil microbes contribute to soil productivity through amelioration of soil physical structure and activation of mineral cycling in soil [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], it is not completely clear how the microbial community influences soil productivity. As the structure of soil microbial communities is heavily altered by the quality and quantity of synthetic fertilizers and manures [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], arable lands that have not been exposed to any fertilizers are suitable for investigating the relationships between microbial communities and soil productivity.</p><p>The structure of a microbial community is characterized by its mass, abundance, and richness. Chloroform fumigation and the use of phospholipid fatty acids are effective ways to estimate microbial mass, while molecular fingerprinting methods such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) have been used to analyze community composition [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, these methods have a limited ability to dissect the structure of microbial communities. Furthermore, despite the fact that fungi are important members of the soil microbial community, much more attention has been paid to bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled a deeper resolution of community structure and identification of a large number of low-abundance taxa in bacterial and fungal communities [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we examined the richness, composition, and abundance of soil bacterial and fungal communities from 12 unfertilized farms extending over 1000 km, where microbial communities have not been exposed to any fertilizers, including manures, for at least the last five years.</p><p>We first compared the diversity patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities across the 12 farms. We investigated how spatial variations in bacterial and fungal communities, including root communities, are organized in organic farms. Second, we examined how soil productivity is affected by microbial communities. Soil productivity is determined by many factors including soil physical and chemical properties, microbial activities, and their interactions. To clarify which soil properties are responsible for soil productivity, we measured C turnover rate when incubated with grass litter, N mineralization rate, and maize growth in each soil, as well as chemical properties such as soil pH, N, phosphorous (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and organic C (Co) contents. Our aim was to clarify which characteristics of microbial communities are responsible for soil productivity and its components. Three specific questions were addressed. Among mass, richness, and composition of communities, which components are involved in soil productivity? Are bacterial or fungal communities more important in determining soil productivity? What is the contribution of root communities to soil productivity?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Soil collection</title><p>Soils were collected from 12 unfertilized organic farms in eastern Japan with the permission of landowners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204085.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0204085.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The soils were sampled from the 0&#8211;10 cm layer at three different locations (replicates) in each site during April and May 2015. After sieving through a 2 mm mesh to remove roots, macrofauna, and rocks, the soils were subjected to chemical and microbial analysis for assessing the growth of maize, and to DNA extraction for microbial community analysis.

After extraction of 5 g dry soil in 50 mL of 2 M KCl solution, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were determined using the sodium salicylic acid and indophenol blue methods, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The available P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> content was determined using the ammonium molybdate-ascorbic acid method, following the extraction of 5 g dry soil in a 50 mL solution of 0.05 M ammonium sulfate [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Soil total N content (%) and total C content (%) were determined using an automatic N-C analyzer (Vario EL cube. Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany). The soil pH was determined with a pH meter (Horiba pH Meter D-52, Tokyo, Japan) after dissolving 10 g of dry soil in 25 ml of distilled water.</p><p>In addition, three microbial traits, C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, and microbial mass, were measured using fresh soil. C turnover rate was evaluated for the soil incubated with leaf litter from C<sub>3</sub> grass <italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic>, which has high nitrogen content and a high decomposition rate [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A polyvinyl plastic pot (19.6 cm<sup>2</sup> area and 3.5 cm height) was filled with 25.0 g fresh soil along with dried leaf litter (0.3 g). Sterilized distilled water was added to all the soils to standardize the moisture content to 60%. The samples were incubated at 25 &#176;C for 40 days. The CO<sub>2</sub> efflux rate was monitored using an automatic CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer (Li-6400; Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission chamber (LI-6400&#8211;09; Li-Cor). The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside the chamber was set at 400 &#956;mol during the measurements. The changes in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were monitored for 60 s, and the CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from the soil was calculated in &#956;mol CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>&#8211;2</sup> s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. As the CO<sub>2</sub> efflux rate reached a peak value at 3 days after the incubation and then rapidly declined, the maximum rate at 3 days was used as the C turnover rate. The N mineralization rate was measured by incubating the soil for 40 days without the addition of grass litter. The available N was measured before and after the incubation, and N mineralization rate was calculated as the difference in available N content during the incubation period (40 days). Microbial mass was measured using the chloroform fumigation method [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fresh soil (8 g) was placed into a 100 mL glass beaker and fumigated with 50 mL chloroform under reduced pressure in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h. After extracting 50 mL of 0.5 M potassium sulfate solution, soil C was measured with an automatic carbon analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-L, Kyoto Japan). Soil microbial C was calculated as the difference between the control and the fumigation treatment multiplied by a correction factor (2.64).</p><p>Soil productivity was evaluated using the dry mass of maize grown on each soil. Maize seeds were sown on a wet filter paper for germination, and on July 7, three seedlings were transplanted into pots (113 mm diameter and 184 mm depth) containing each of the soils and grown in a greenhouse. Three pots (replicates) for each soil were prepared. After 20 days, the shoot and root of the maize were harvested. The root parts were washed to remove attached soil, and 2 g of fresh root tip was taken and stored at -25 &#176;C for DNA extraction. After drying at 70 &#176;C for 48 h, the root and shoot dry weights were measured. As there was a large difference in the bulk density among soils, maize weight was expressed as per g of dry soil in a pot, not as per pot.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>DNA extraction</title><p>As DNA extraction using commercial extraction kits was difficult for some soil samples from volcanic ash, the DNA was extracted by bead-beating and CTAB-based method of Hoshino [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with slight modifications. This method can be applied for DNA extraction from roots.

In this study, a 0.4 g soil sample included an average of 2785 bacterial OTUs, which belonged to 150 different taxa at the order level. In contrast to this high within-site diversity, the soil bacterial communities shared many OTUs between farms, even those that were 1000 km apart from each other. Another study had also reported that a small proportion of phylotypes comprises almost half of the total abundance of bacterial communities worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Dispersal limitation increases the community divergence between geographically distant sites, while selection causes community divergence depending on differences in environmental conditions across sites. Therefore, the spatial patterns of &#945;- and &#946;-diversity indicate the relative importance of external factors in shaping the structure of soil microbial communities. Furthermore, it is known that microbes establish distinctive communities in plant roots [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which can potentially influence the structure of soil microbial communities. Although the latitude of the sampling sites showed a significant effect on the structure of bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204085.s007">S6 Table</xref>), the sharing of most OTUs among distant farms suggests that dispersal limitation does not play an important role in the shaping of bacterial communities.

In agricultural lands, soil bacterial communities show a large divergence between conventional and organic farms [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], between different tillage regimes [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and between nitrogen treatments [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Although fungal communities consisted of a smaller number of OTUs (an average of 577) per soil sample and a lower proportion of shared OTUs among the farms than the bacterial communities, &#945;-diversity was still higher than &#946;-diversity and soil communities were still less divergent in the ordination plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204085.g003">Fig 3</xref>), suggesting the importance of cultivation management on the structure of fungal communities.</p><p>Maize root had distinctive communities from the bulk soil, for both bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204085.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

In fact, a significant correlation between soil respiration rate and soil productivity has been reported in some studies [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], but not in others [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>N fixation is the other source for N supply to soil. N fixation in the soil is performed by free-living bacteria as well as symbiotic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, which showed a significant positive correlation with soil productivity, contains various members with N-fixation capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. On the other hand, order <italic>Solibacterales</italic>, which showed a negative correlation with soil productivity, is reported to be a potential indicator for soil degradation [<xref rid="pone.0204085.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Therefore, soil productivity and supply of inorganic N in soil should be strongly affected by the composition of microbial communities, especially by the abundance of microbial groups with low demands for N and N-fixing ability.</p><p>Many studies have reported the existence of growth-promoting bacteria in roots. However, high abundance OTUs in root communities did not show any significantly positive correlations with maize DW. Taxa below the order level were not discriminated in this study. The lower taxonomic resolution may clarify the close association between beneficial functions of host plants and specific microbial groups in root communities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study revealed extremely high diversity and a disproportionate contribution of a small number of phylotypes to the total abundance in soil bacterial and fungal communities. Soil productivity and its components showed close associations with the abundances and composition of communities rather than with diversity <italic>per se</italic>. We identified four orders in bacteria and one order in fungi that showed significant correlations with soil productivity. Since these taxa were shared among all farms, changes in their abundance through agricultural management could contribute to improvements in soil productivity in farms. Although there is still little information about the most effective farm management practices and soil conditions for altering community composition in a way that leads to increased soil productivity, this study could inform further studies on the relationships between microbial communities and soil functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Rarefaction curve of soil bacterial 16s rRNA sequences (A) and soil fungal ITS sequences (B).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of soil bacterial taxa at order level in 12 farms.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of soil fungal taxa at genus level in 12 farms.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of root bacterial taxa at order level in 12 farms.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Relative abundance of root fungal taxa at genus level in 12 farms.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s006"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Correlation coefficients among eight soil properties and OTU richness in soil bacterial communities.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204085.s007"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>The relationships of soil properties and the latitude of farms with the whole community structure and the abundance of the top 10 orders in soil bacterial and fungal communities.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204085.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0204085.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fierer</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name>. <article-title>The diversity and biogeography of soil bacterial communities</article-title>. <source>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</source>. <year>2006</year>;<volume>103</volume>: <fpage>626</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>631</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1073/pnas.0507535103</pub-id>
