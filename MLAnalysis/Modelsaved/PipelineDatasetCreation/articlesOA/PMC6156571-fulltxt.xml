Deregulated RNA editing contributes to different types of human diseases, including cancers. Here we report that peptides generated as a consequence of RNA editing are indeed naturally presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We provide evidence that effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for edited peptides derived from cyclin I are present in human tumours and attack tumour cells that are presenting these epitopes.

The most common type of RNA editing, which converts adenosine to inosine (A&#8594;I editing), is catalysed by Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

However, despite this intriguing possibility, whether such peptides are indeed generated and capable of stimulating immune responses has so far been unknown.</p><p id="Par4">The use of edited peptides in immunotherapy would require characterisation in three dimensions: peptide presentation, T-cell recognition and tumour association. First, the peptide should be processed and presented by the HLA class I antigen pathway in order to be considered as HLA ligand. Second, the peptide-HLA complex should be recognised by specific T-cells and be able to stimulate immune responses. Third, the peptide should show tumour-specific or tumour-associated presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">High-resolution mass-spectrometry has enabled identification and quantitation of HLA ligands that are naturally processed and presented.

Standard data analysis of LC-MS experiments relies on the comparison of MS spectra against theoretical spectra derived from a reference proteome. Due to the absence of editing information in reference proteomes, identification of edited peptides is usually missed and requires a specialised proteogenomics screening approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here we report the identification and confirmation of five edited peptides from three editing sites by mass spectrometry.

We present relative quantitative data on primary healthy and tumour tissues supporting over-editing on peptide level for a subset of tumour patients. We confirm that peptide levels correspond to editing on RNA level by absolute quantitation.

HLA class I-peptides were isolated from 1514 different healthy and tumour samples from primary tissues of 1119 donors resulting in ~60 million fragment spectra (MS/MS). To search for edited peptides, we first constructed an RNA editome peptide database (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) derived from 1369 editing sites extracted from the Rigorously Annotated Database of A-to-I RNA editing (RADAR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Matching MS/MS spectra against the database identified 7 peptides (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) of which two were false positive.

Activation of TIL2661 and TIL2559 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) by CCNI-ED10 suggested that this epitope was presented to TIL2661 and TIL2559 endogenously by autologous tumours resulting in the response to CCNI-ED10 in the absence of in vitro education.

We were able to confirm the existence of five peptides derived from three editing sites out of 1369 sites investigated. While this might seem to represent a low proportion, this gap between the number of RNA events observed and HLA-bound peptides detected is in the range of other proteogenomics studies which also report less than 1% of the genomic sites to be presented on peptide level. For instance, Granados et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> identified 26 peptides out of 4833 SNPs (0.54%), Yadav et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> identified 7 out of 1357 expressed somatic tumour mutations (0.52%) and Bassani-Sternberg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> identified 11 out of 3487 mutations (0.32%). While LC&#8211;MS sensitivity can be considered as one factor, reverse immunology identifications were also in this range with 18 confirmed mutations out of 1452 as reported by Tran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. More importantly this gap is influenced by biological factors including mRNA stability, translational regulation, protein turnover, proteasome processing, cytosolic peptidases, TAP and binding affinity to HLA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">For in-depth characterisation we focused on the <italic>CCNI R75G</italic> editing site that presented two over-lapping HLA-A*02 ligands, CCNI-ED10 and CCNI-ED9. We quantified both peptides on a comprehensive set of tumour and normal tissues to assess potential tumour association. The edited peptides showed abundances elevated beyond normal levels (&#8220;over-editing&#8221;) in 7% of all tumours, which is a prevalence comparable to the most frequent neoantigen epitopes like PIK3CA H1047R, which is expressed in 4% of all tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The tumour indications with the most frequent over-editing were ovarian cancer, melanoma and breast cancer showing a prevalence comparable to frequent neoantigen epitopes like KRAS G12D which is present in 33% of all pancreatic cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. While over-editing cannot be considered tumour-specific due to presentation of edited peptides on healthy tissues, it contributes to the class of over-expressed and thus tumour-associated shared self-antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As shown e.g. for MUC1 and other over-expressed self-antigens, central tolerance can be incomplete or absent for self-peptides that are associated with tumours due to over-expression, tissue- or germline-specific expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While this antigen class sets higher standards for clinical development with regard to definition of an appropriate therapeutic window and establishing safety, it allows for immunotherapeutic approaches in indications with low mutational load especially when multiple peptide targets are combined to a warehouse for active personalisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">To confirm the prevalence of over-editing on a larger scale, we investigated <italic>CCNI</italic> editing in TCGA on mRNA level. While an overall correlation between transcript levels and number of detectable HLA peptides has been shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, the peptide-specific abundance levels correlate only for a fraction of HLA peptides with their corresponding mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, confirmation of correlation between number of edited peptide copies and edited transcripts is necessary. We were able to show that for edited CCNI peptides the mRNA can be used as a&#160;surrogate measurement for peptide levels, and based on this we determined prevalence estimates on the TCGA data set and showed that they reproduce peptide-level estimates. While TCGA enables a comprehensive assessment of tumour and autologous normal tissues, the included normals are underrepresented and adjacent to tumour tissue. Therefore, for a comprehensive safety assessment further studies incorporating healthy donors will be necessary.</p><p id="Par19">To investigate tumour association on cellular level, we screened melanoma TILs for edited peptide-specific T cells and demonstrate that peptides derived from RNA editing are immunogenic. We have found T-cell populations from TILs that respond to both CCNI-ED 10 and CCNI-ED 9 and showed that these TILs are activated in vitro by the edited peptides and display specific cytotoxicity toward target cells expressing endogenous edited protein. Although this study only investigated the CCNI-ED peptides in depth, our finding that 3 out of 15 TILs positively reacted to CCNI-ED 10, and 1 out of 15 TILs reacted to CCNI-ED 9, suggests the possibility that edited peptides serve as a source of antigens that activate tumour-specific T cells which infiltrate into tumour site to mediate antitumor immunity. The editing of <italic>CCNI</italic> mRNA is mediated by <italic>ADAR1</italic>, which is the major enzyme in RNA editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Edited peptides were found on healthy and tumour tissues showing over-editing for a subpopulation of tumours. Thus, over-edited peptides present an additional class of tumour-associated self-antigens that might provide a therapeutic window for immunotherapies. While safety needs to be addressed in future studies to exclude on-target toxicity, we show that T cells with cytotoxic reactivity against edited peptides are physiologically present in cancer tissue and thus in patients without evidence of severe side effects. The shared nature of these antigens would suggest new opportunities for immunotherapies in the treatment of cancer and immunological disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Peptide isolation and mass spectrometry</title><p id="Par21">To allow discovery and selection of novel HLA peptides as targets for immunotherapy, we acquired immunopeptidomes together with corresponding transcriptomes and HLA genotypes for 1514 primary human tissue samples extracted post mortem or surgically from 850 patients with cancer or benign neoplasms and 269 healthy tissue donors after written informed consent.
