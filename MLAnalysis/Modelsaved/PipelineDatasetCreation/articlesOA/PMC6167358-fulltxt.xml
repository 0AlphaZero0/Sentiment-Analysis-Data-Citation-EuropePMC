The comparison of the RNA-Seq data from several flax stem parts enabled the characterization of those processes occurring specifically during the fiber intrusive elongation. The revealed molecular players are summarized as those involved in the supply of assimilates and support of turgor pressure, cell wall enlargement and modification, regulation by transcription factors and hormones, and responses to abiotic stress factors.

This increase of cell size in a multicellular organism can proceed in three major ways: by symplastic, protrusive, or intrusive growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During symplastic growth, the involved cells increase their surface simultaneously, retaining the contacts between them through the joint middle lamellae and plasmodesmata. Symplastic growth is the most common type, usually characterizing cells in the elongation zones. Protrusive growth is an outgrowth of a cell part; it takes place only in the epidermal layer and leads to the formation of trichomes, such as root hairs, or hairs of the cotton seed (&#8220;cotton fibers&#8221;). The third type of cell enlargement, the intrusive growth, is a type characterized by a higher rate of a cell enlargement compared with the adjacent cells. During intrusive elongation, a cell squeezes in between the surrounding cells, splitting their middle lamellae. Several types of plant cells can perform the intrusive growth, with fibers being the classical example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In recent years, the intrusive growth has attracted much attention and has been the subject of discussions in several reviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, all of which have pointed to the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underpinning intrusive growth of fibers.</p><p id="Par3">The fiber intrusive elongation is very important for the development of plant architecture as well as for the yield and quality of commercial plant fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Fiber bundles develop within plant organs mainly due to the intrusive elongation of individual fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The key processes that a fiber must accomplish during the intrusive growth include enlarging the cell wall surface (via synthesis and secretion of cell wall polymers and loosening of the existing layers) and increasing the vacuole volume (via water uptake, osmolyte accumulation, synthesis of membrane components). Furthermore, an intrusively growing fiber requires conditions that enable it to squeeze in between neighbouring cells&#8212;the dissolution of middle lamellae of the cells on the way of invasion and the abolishment of possible wound effects. Characterization of any of these processes in intrusively growing fibers from a molecular point of view remains quite poor. There is not a single paper with the analysis of fibers isolated at this developmental stage by comprehensive high-throughput techniques, like RNA-Seq. Such experiments are highly demanded to approach understanding of the mechanisms of intrusive elongation and its regulation, but have, at most, been performed on complex samples, which together with the intrusively growing fibers contained other cell types at other developmental stages. The quite limited examples of the studies are the description of transcriptome landscapes in sections of the young xylem from aspen wood, which contain xylem vessels and ray parenchyma together with intrusively growing xylem fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, [cluster e1], or flax stem portion (TOP) that includes intensively elongating fibers together with many other tissues (e.g. epidermis, phloem, parenchyma, cambium, xylem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To perform the RNA-Seq analysis specifically for intrusively growing fibers, we have chosen primary phloem fibers of flax due to the well-characterized location within the stem and duration of the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Primary flax phloem fibers originate from the procambium, close to the apical meristem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and at the earliest stages of development they grow symplastically with the surrounding tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The intrusive elongation is initiated at a 1&#8211;2-mm distance from the stem apex and continues several centimetres down the stem until the so-called &#8220;snap point&#8221;, where the transition of fibers to cell wall thickening occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These morphological markers allow the study of stage-specific parameters of fiber development. However, the combination of a significant cell length with only a primary cell wall makes the intrusively growing fibers quite prone to breakage, which hinders their isolation.</p><p id="Par5">To elucidate the molecular events associated with the fiber intrusive elongation, we isolated the intrusively growing fibers through laser microdissection and, for the first time, performed the RNA-Seq analysis for such cells.

The latter is largely provided by aquaporins, located in both the plasma membrane (PIP) and the tonoplast (TIP). Different members of multigene families encoding aquaporins were expressed in iFIB and APEX; the genes for PIPs (Lus10014978, Lus10015083) and TIP (Lus10025808) were considerably up-regulated in the intrusively growing fibers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, see also Lus10032283, Lus10024651, Lus10022611, and Lus10021510 in Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

All salt overly-sensitive (SOS) genes were neither differentially nor highly expressed in iFIB (see Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

However, the abundance of mRNAs for these genes remained similar at further stages of fiber development. Transcription of the genes for vacuolar proton ATPase (Lus10017490, Lus10028796) was activated less substantially, but more specifically for the elongating fibers (see Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Since plasmodesmata in fibers are disrupted during the intrusive elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the intercellular transport is possible only through the fiber apoplast.

Assimilates necessary for cell expansion are also supplied by the fibers themselves, which have fully developed chloroplasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

However, by applying a laser microdissection technique, we could progress in filling the knowledge gaps in the molecular mechanisms that rule this peculiar type of plant cell growth. Having in mind that changes in mRNA levels of individual genes are not automatically related to protein synthesis or, especially, enzyme activity, we used the transcriptome profiling as the very indicative approach to realize the patterns of cell metabolism and to identify the key molecular players in the fiber intrusive growth. Based on our obtained data, fiber physiology may be characterized by several major processes that occur simultaneously. Cell elongation goes together with the establishment of active photosynthetic machinery; the latter is coupled to intensive expression of chloroplast-localized chaperonins and thioredoxins. The high proportion of specifically up-regulated genes encodes proteins localized in the cell wall and in the plasma membrane. These include expansins, enzymes for the modification of pectins (pectate-lyases rather than polygalacturonases and glycanases that can cleave off RG-I side chains) and several proteins with poorly characterized functions.</p><p id="Par49">Symplasmic isolation of the fibers within the other stem tissues involves callose and callose-binding proteins, while the intensive water influx to the plant cell is provided by aquaporins (PIPs and TIPs). Our results suggest that low-molecular sugars rather than inorganic ions are the major osmolytes involved in providing turgor essential for fiber growth. The importance of auxin in fiber development is evidenced by the up-regulation of the genes for receptors and transporters of this hormone and for numerous attenuators of its action, such as the SAURs and AUX/IAAs. A specific set of transcription factors is expressed during intrusive fiber elongation. However, to identify the specific roles of each of these transcription factors in inducing and regulating the intrusive elongation <italic>per se</italic>, will require much further research.
