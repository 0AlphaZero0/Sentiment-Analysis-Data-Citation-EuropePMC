Responsible for the long half-life is FcRn that protects albumin from intracellular degradation. An in-depth understanding of how FcRn binds albumin across species is of importance for design and evaluation of albumin-based therapeutics. Albumin consists of three homologous domains where domain I and domain III of human albumin are crucial for binding to human FcRn. Here, we show that swapping of two loops in domain I or the whole domain with the corresponding sequence in mouse albumin results in reduced binding to human FcRn. In contrast, humanizing domain I of mouse albumin improves binding. We reveal that domain I of mouse albumin plays a minor role in the interaction with the mouse and human receptors, as domain III on its own binds with similar affinity as full-length mouse albumin. Further, we show that P573 in domain III of mouse albumin is required for strong receptor binding. Our study highlights distinct differences in structural requirements for the interactions between mouse and human albumin with their respective receptor, which should be taken into consideration in design of albumin-based drugs and evaluation in mouse models.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Research Council of Norway (Grant no. 230526)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Research Council of Norway through its program for Global Health and Vaccination Research (GLOBVAC) (Grant no. 143822) and program for biotechnology and innovation (BIOTEK2021) (Grant no. 267606).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Supported by the University of Oslo</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (Grant no. 2015095) (Regional Core Facility for Structural Biology).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Research Council of Norway through its Center of Excellence funding scheme (project no. 179573).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Research Council of Norway (Grant no. 179573, 230526,143822 and 267606) and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (Grant no. 40018).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Albumin consists of 67% &#945;-helices connected via flexible loops that make up three homologous domains (DI, DII and DIII)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Each domain contains hydrophobic pockets that allow albumin to accommodate and transport various small and insoluble molecules, such as fatty acids, hormones, toxins and drugs, throughout the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Albumin is the most abundant protein in blood with an average serum half-life of three weeks in humans, a feature only shared with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although structurally and functionally unrelated, both&#160;albumin and IgG possess the ability to bind a cellular receptor, named the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is broadly expressed and protects against lysosomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Mice lacking expression of the receptor exhibit only about 40% and 25% of normal serum levels of albumin and IgG, respectively, and the half-life of injected albumin and IgG is considerably shorter than in wild-type (WT) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">FcRn is a major histocompatibility class I-like molecule consisting of a unique transmembrane heavy chain, with three extracellular domains (&#945;1, &#945;2 and &#945;3), which is non-covalently associated with the common soluble &#946;2-microglobulin (&#946;2m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The binding sites for albumin and IgG on FcRn are distinct and non-overlapping, and binding of both ligands is pH-dependent, occurring only at acidic pH below 6.5 and not at neutral pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This enables FcRn to rescue albumin and IgG from lysosomal degradation, as binding readily occurs in acidified endosomes and cease at the cell surface when exposed to the physiological pH of the extracellular surroundings. The mechanisms by which FcRn transports IgG intracellularly have been studied in detail. IgG enters the endosomal pathway when taken up by fluid-phase pinocytosis, but instead of following the route to the lysosomes, it may engage FcRn in endosomes followed by sorting to the cell surface at the side of entry or to the opposite side of polarized cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Conserved histidine residues in both FcRn (H166) and albumin (H464, H510 and H535) form intramolecular interactions at acidic pH that are crucial for binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. H166 of the &#945;2-domain in the human FcRn (hFcRn) heavy chain stabilizes a loop in the &#945;1-domain and conserved tryptophan residues (W51, W53, W59 and W61) within the loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This allows binding of W53 and W59 to hydrophobic pockets in DIII of human serum albumin (HSA) that are sustained in open conformations by H464, H510 and H535<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. DIII of HSA contains the main binding site for hFcRn, but while recombinant DIII on its own can bind the receptor, the affinity is much weaker than of full-length HSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. More recently, we demonstrated that the reduced affinity is due to a contribution from DI in the complete HSA molecule, as targeting selected residues within two surface-exposed loops in DI (loop I: residues 81&#8211;89, loop II: 105&#8211;114) either decreased or increased binding to hFcRn when mutated to alanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The half-life property of albumin is used to improve therapeutic efficacy of drugs by extending their serum persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and engineering of HSA for improved FcRn binding is now explored to further optimize dosing frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Rodents are extensively used to test WT and engineered HSA-drug fusions, but we have revealed that there are great differences in cross-species FcRn-albumin binding that challenges such evaluations. Specifically for mouse and human, mouse FcRn (mFcRn) binds HSA weakly compared to mouse serum albumin (MSA), whereas hFcRn binds MSA more strongly than HSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We have demonstrated that sequence variation in DIII is largely responsible for the cross-species differences, as MSA with human DIII, instead of mouse DIII, showed comparable binding as WT HSA to the mouse and human forms of FcRn, while binding of HSA with mouse DIII to both receptors improved, but showed even stronger binding than WT MSA towards hFcRn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the current study, we aimed to investigate how differences in the amino acid composition of DI between MSA and HSA affect receptor binding. We found that targeting residues within the two DI loops of HSA gave rise to either increased or decreased hFcRn binding when mutated to the corresponding mouse residues. In contrast, substitution of residues in the two loop regions of MSA did not affect binding to hFcRn. Furthermore, HSA with mouse DI (mDI), instead of human DI (hDI), showed weaker binding to hFcRn than WT HSA, whereas improved binding was measured for MSA with hDI. Importantly, recombinant DIII of MSA bound to hFcRn and mFcRn with similar affinity as the full-length molecule, supporting that DI of MSA does not contribute much to the interactions. Lastly, we show that P573 of MSA is crucial for strong receptor binding and that the single amino acid difference between HSA (K573) and MSA at this position contributes greatly to distinct cross species binding. Thus, there are considerable differences in the structural requirements for the interactions between HSA and MSA with their respective receptors, and across the two species. Our findings shed new light on albumin biology across species and must be taken into consideration during development and evaluation of albumin-based therapeutics in preclinical mouse models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Species analysis of the FcRn-albumin interaction</title><p id="Par7">Albumin consists of three domains (DI, DII and DIII) connected via flexible loops (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). While DIII is the principal binding domain, two surface-exposed loops in the N-terminal DI of HSA, encompassing residues 80&#8211;89 (loop I) and 105&#8211;114 (loop II) contribute to optimal hFcRn binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We have previously uncovered large differences in binding of albumin to FcRn across species, which has consequences when HSA-based therapeutics are evaluated in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The challenge is that HSA binds weakly to mFcRn, while MSA binds more strongly than HSA to hFcRn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To gain insight into these differences, we aligned the amino acid sequences of albumin from human and mouse with that of 15 other species (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), and found that conservation within DI and DIII were 67.1% and 67.9%, respectively, and 68.9% for the non-interacting DII. Regarding mouse and human, the conservation in DI, DII and DIII were 67.6%, 75.6% and 74.0%, respectively. Examining the two exposed loops within DI, we found that seven out of nine amino acids in loop I, and six out of ten in loop II, are either fully conserved or replaced with an amino acid with similar characteristics (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In loop I, the amino acid in position 83 is the least conserved, and vary from a threonine in humans to a serine, histidine, asparagine and lysine among the other species, suggesting that it may be less important for FcRn binding. Notably, the side chain of T83 does not contact hFcRn or any other residues of HSA in two available co-crystal structures (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), and we previously found that T83 in HSA could be replaced with alanine without affecting hFcRn binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Residues 109, 111 and 114 are the most variable in loop II. Interestingly, albumin from human, orangutan and chimpanzee have an arginine in position 114, which is replaced by a lysine in another six of the seventeen species. With the exception of Q114 in cat, albumin from mouse and the remaining six species contain a proline at this position. This amino acid difference may affect the degree of flexibility of the loop, which noted from the HSA-hFcRn co-crystal structures, is able to adopt different conformations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>DI and DIII of HSA interact with hFcRn.

To identify the regions involved in binding, we examined two HSA-hFcRn co-crystal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and observed that the interface to loop II of DI differed slightly, as the loop had different conformations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In the complex with WT HSA, N111 forms two hydrogen bonds with S58 in the &#945;1-domain of hFcRn (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). S58 and flanking residues of the receptor (Q56 to T65) that face the loop are highly conserved among species. In the second co-crystal, the loop extends towards the &#945;2-domain and N111 interacts with E165 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This region of the receptor is less conserved, and in all species but primates, E165 (human numbering) is replaced by a glycine. The interface area between hFcRn and loop I of DI is very similar in the two co-crystal complexes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), and includes the amino acid stretch from N149 to L163 in the &#945;2-domain of the receptor, which is less conserved overall (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Screening of the MSA variants showed that neither the loop swapping nor the single amino acid mutations had much effect on hFcRn binding, as they bound equally well as WT MSA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). However, somewhat increased binding to mFcRn was observed for the MSA variant with the single point P114R mutation in loop II (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). None of the albumin variants bound the two receptors at pH 7.4 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was then used to derive the binding kinetics for selected albumin variants (HSA WT, -mLoopI&#8201;+&#8201;II, -N111S, -R114P and MSA WT, -hLoopI&#8201;+&#8201;II) by injecting titrated amounts of monomeric receptor over immobilized variants at pH 5.5. Both the human and mouse form of FcRn bound MSA more strongly than HSA (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Introduction of the two mouse loops, or the R114P mutation, in HSA modulated the interaction to hFcRn by increasing the dissociation rates, resulting in 2.1- and 1.4-fold weaker binding affinity, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and c</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The single point mutations did not affect the thermal stability of the proteins (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

In addition to the main binding site for hFcRn in the C-terminal DIII of HSA, we recently discovered that the N-terminal DI, and two-surface exposed loops in particular, contribute to optimal pH-dependent binding to the receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here we identified four amino acid differences between HSA and MSA in the two DI loops. Mutation of all four amino acids in HSA to the corresponding residues in mouse resulted in negative modulation of binding to hFcRn. However, when the mouse residues were introduced individually, it turned out that only one mutation in loop II, R114P, was responsible for reduced hFcRn binding, and that it had actually masked a positive effect of the second loop II mutation, N111S. In the two co-crystal structures of hFcRn in complex with WT HSA or HSA13, loop II of DI have different orientations, which suggests that the loop is a flexible part that can adopt distinct conformations and interactions upon receptor binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In the WT HSA-hFcRn complex, N111 forms two favorable contacts with S58 of hFcRn and one unfavorable contact with K63<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, substitution of N111 with an alanine also improved binding to hFcRn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, increased receptor binding of mutating N111 to a serine or an alanine, which removes the repulsive interaction and two direct hydrogen bonds, suggests that improved interactions in nearby locations are allowed to occur. Interestingly, albumin from several species expresses an aspartic acid in this position, which could potentially form a favorable salt bridge with K63, and lead to increased binding to hFcRn if introduced in HSA.</p><p id="Par19">R114 does not interact directly with hFcRn, but a proline in this position may affect the flexibility of the loop and explain the decrease in&#160;binding to&#160;the receptor. R114 is mutated to a glycine in the naturally occurring HSA variant Yahomana-2, and we previously showed that a recombinant form of this variant had almost 2-fold reduced binding affinity for hFcRn compared to WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Loop II extends over a binding pocket, the so-called FA site 1 or drug site 3, located in sub-domain IB of HSA, which also accommodates hemin and bilirubin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Interestingly, homozygotes for the Yahomana-2 variant have been shown to bind bilirubin poorly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, whereas crystal structures of HSA solved in the presence of ligand have revealed that R114 coordinates binding of hemin to the binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, R114 of HSA is not only important for optimal binding to hFcRn, but is also involved in binding of cargo to the&#160;binding pocket in DIB. In the multiple sequence alignment, we found that about half of the species included express either a positively charged arginine or lysine in position 114, whereas MSA and the remaining species have a proline. This is interesting in regard to how binding of cargo may affect FcRn binding and transport properties, and subsequent biodistribution, and whether there are differences to such mechanisms between species should be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par20">Swapping DI of HSA with mDI led to decreased hFcRn binding, whereas MSA with hDI showed improved binding. This is actually in line with results we previously reported on DIII swapping, where a chimeric variant built from DI-DII of HSA and DIII of MSA was found to bind more strongly than WT MSA to hFcRn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, it is sequence variation in DIII that is mainly responsible for stronger binding of MSA than HSA, whereas hDI is actually favored over mDI in binding to hFcRn. Interestingly, and in contrast to DIII of HSA, DIII of MSA bound with similar binding affinity as full-length MSA to both the human and mouse forms of FcRn, which support that while DI of HSA is crucial for optimal binding to hFcRn, DI of MSA plays only a minor role in binding to the receptors.</p><p id="Par21">Furthermore, we show that a single amino acid residue in position 573 of DIII has great influence on cross species receptor binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. When the amino acid at position 573 of MSA (P573K) and HSA (K573P) was substituted and binding of HSA and MSA could be compared without this amino acid difference, HSA was the strongest binder towards hFcRn (HSA K573P&#8201;&gt;&#8201;WT MSA and WT HSA&#8201;&gt;&#8201;MSA P573K). The DI contribution from HSA may partly explain the effect. Except for albumin from primates, all other species have P573 in common with MSA. It is therefore tempting to speculate whether the HSA DI contribution evolved to compensate for the P573K mutation, or that the proline was lost after DI got involved, to fine-tune the binding affinity for optimal serum half-life. Moreover, MSA bound more strongly to mFcRn than HSA with the K573P mutation. Only when HSA was equipped with the whole DIII from MSA, did it show as strong binding as MSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, there must be additional amino acids in MSA DIII that contribute to optimal mFcRn binding.</p><p id="Par22">Receptor binding to the albumin variants was measured at pH 5.5 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Notably, we observed that the percentage of detergent affected the binding kinetics (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>, Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The derived K<sub>D</sub> for the WT HSA-hFcRn pair was actually 4.3-fold lower in the presence of only 0.005% Tween-20 as compared to 0.05%, whereas binding of WT MSA to the human receptor was 2.5-fold stronger. Interestingly, the WT MSA-mFcRn interaction was affected to a lesser extent as the K<sub>D</sub> was 1.7-fold lower in the presence of 0.005% Tween-20 compared to 0.05%. Tween-20 contains a fatty acid ester moiety (lauric acid (C12:0)) and a long polyoxyethylene chain. In light of a previous report showing that fatty acids can bind hydrophobic pockets of HSA and modulate hFcRn binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, it may be that Tween-20 can bind albumin and affect receptor binding.</p><p id="Par23">Another interesting question is whether the interactions are modulated through a pH gradient. Interestingly, MSA bound only slightly better than HSA&#160;to hFcRn at pH 5.5 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). However, while binding of HSA was clearly weakened as the pH increased from pH 5.5 to pH 6.0, binding of MSA was less affected by the pH in this range, which bound more strongly than HSA at both pH 5.8 and 6.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, as binding to FcRn occurs in an endosomal environment that gradually becomes more acidic, MSA may engage the receptor before HSA. Importantly, when engineered HSA and MSA variants were compared with WT at pH 5.5 and 6.0, the mutations showed the same effect on binding to hFcRn as at pH 5.8 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Our findings should be taken into consideration as they may have implications for development of mouse and human albumin fusions made for pre-clinical testing in conventional and transgenic mice. In addition,&#160;drugs may be fused or conjugated to small albumin-binding molecules, such as anti-albumin binding antibody fragments or the albumin-binding domain derived from bacterial <italic>Streptococcal</italic> protein G, which target endogenous albumin following administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To achieve extended drug half-life, it is important that binding to albumin does not negatively influence FcRn binding and transport.

In light of our new findings, binding of cross-species reactive albumin-binding drugs may affect the interaction between albumin from mouse and human and FcRn differently. As such, molecules that bind in the DI region may have a greater influence on receptor binding of HSA than of MSA. Thus, to avoid influencing FcRn binding, it may be favorable to target DII of albumin when designing novel albumin-binding molecules.</p><p id="Par25">Fusion to DIII of albumin was previously suggested as an alternative scaffold to alter the serum half-life of coupled molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

However, this was most likely due to the increase in size above the clearance threshold of the kidneys and not dependent on FcRn, as mFcRn binds HSA&#160;very weakly. Fusion of diagnostic and therapeutic molecules to full-length albumin may in some cases affect their potency, and the use of the smaller DIII of albumin could then be beneficial. A smaller scaffold may also be preferred when the fusion is large and target accessibility is an issue. Importantly, as mFcRn binding of MSA is less dependent on DI than hFcRn binding of HSA, construction of a MSA DIII-fusion for pre-clinical testing in mice may not reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of the corresponding HSA DIII-fusion. Furthermore, to obtain long <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life in the presence of high levels of endogenous albumin, engineering of HSA DIII, which makes it more MSA DIII-like or even a better FcRn binder, would be necessary to increase its ability to compete efficiently with full-length albumin for binding to the receptor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par26">High Five cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Express FIVE SEF medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 18 mM L-glutamine and 1% antibiotic-antimyotic (Invitrogen).
