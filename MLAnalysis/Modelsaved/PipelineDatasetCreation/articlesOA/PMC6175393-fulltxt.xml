Abametapir is an inhibitor of metalloproteinases critical for louse survival and egg development. The efficacy of abametapir lotion, 0.74%, was assessed for its ability to clear head louse infestations after a single application.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0002"><title>Methods</title><p>Two randomized, double&#8208;blind, multicenter, vehicle&#8208;controlled studies were conducted in subjects aged 6 months and older to compare the effectiveness of abametapir lotion versus vehicle control for eliminating head louse infestations without nit combing. Abametapir lotion was applied to dry hair for 10 minutes on day 0 and then rinsed with water. The primary endpoint was the proportion of index subjects (youngest household member with &#8805; 3 live lice at screening) in the intent&#8208;to&#8208;treat population who were louse free at all follow&#8208;up visits through day 14. Older household members with one or more live lice at screening were designated as nonindex subjects and treated as per the index subject within their household.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0003"><title>Results</title><p>In the intent&#8208;to&#8208;treat population (index subjects, N = 216), 81.5% of subjects treated with abametapir lotion were louse free through day 14 after a single treatment, versus 49.1% with vehicle (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). For the combined index and nonindex population (N = 704), 85.9% were louse free through day 14 in the abametapir group, versus 61.3% in the vehicle group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events were erythema (4.0%), rash (3.2%), and skin burning sensation (2.6%).</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Abametapir lotion, 0.74%, was effective at clearing active head louse infestations through day 14 in subjects aged 6 months and older.

The study design was agreed upon with the Food and Drug Administration under a Special Protocol Assessment. Studies were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the institutional review board for each investigation site. Written informed consent (parental assent if younger than 18) was obtained from all subjects. Studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02060903 and NCT02062060.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0008"><label>2.2</label><title>Study subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were male or female, aged 6 months and older, with an active head louse infestation. Because of the transmittable nature of louse infestations, all family members with head lice were enrolled in these studies. The youngest household member with at least three live head lice was designated as the index subject and included in the primary analysis. Other household members with at least one live head louse were designated as nonindex subjects.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had used any form of head louse treatment during the 14 days before the study period or an investigational agent during the prior 30 days. Subjects were also excluded if they had visible scalp or skin conditions not attributable to louse infestation (including eczema or atopic dermatitis of the scalp) or had had a prior reaction to any product containing permethrin. If any household member with a louse infestation was not willing to enroll or was ineligible, or a subject was not located in the same household for the study period, all household members were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0009"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design</title><p>Studies 1 and 2 were randomized, double&#8208;blind, multicenter, vehicle&#8208;controlled, parallel&#8208;group, single&#8208;dose studies. At baseline (day 0), index subjects were randomized to abametapir lotion or vehicle lotion. Nonindex subjects received the same treatment as the index subject within their household. Each subject received a 200&#8208;g bottle of study drug with instructions for application at home by the subject or caregiver on the day of receipt. Product was applied once to the subject's dry scalp and hair and massaged into the scalp and hair, working from the hairline at the back of the neck to the end of the hair. Caregivers were instructed to apply a sufficient amount to achieve saturation, with no more than one bottle of product to be applied regardless of the length and thickness of the hair. Subjects were instructed to cover their face and eyes during application. Once saturation of the hair and scalp was achieved, the product was left on for 10 minutes and then rinsed out with warm water. Nit combing was not permitted for 14 days before and after treatment. Subjects returned to the site and were inspected for the presence of live lice on post&#8208;treatment days 1, 7, and 14. Trained evaluators performed systematic head louse evaluations until live lice were observed or 15 minutes had elapsed. If live lice were detected at any of the three visits, the treatment was considered to have failed, and a commercially available rescue therapy (1% permethrin) was provided. Safety was assessed according to reported adverse events and measurements of vital signs, physical examination, and scalp and eye irritation on days 0, 1, 7, and 14. Scalp irritation included erythema and edema, pruritus, excoriation, and pyoderma. Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry and hematology) were collected on days 0 and 14.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0010"><label>2.4</label><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of index subjects (intent&#8208;to&#8208;treat [ITT]) who were louse free at all follow&#8208;up visits through day 14. Secondary efficacy endpoints were defined as the proportion of index subjects who were louse free at days 1 and 7. An exploratory endpoint was the proportion of all randomized subjects (index and nonindex) who were louse free at all follow&#8208;up visits through day 14. Safety endpoints included adverse events and evaluations for skin, scalp, and ocular irritation.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0011"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To determine sample size, the expected effect size was estimated based on the results of an earlier phase 2b study and the calculation based on a two&#8208;sided, two&#8208;group, continuity&#8208;corrected, chi&#8208;square test for equal proportion with a 5% level of significance. To detect an effect size that would yield a difference of at least 35% between the vehicle and active treatment groups with 90% power, a sample size of 48 index subjects per group was required. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, an initial enrollment of 53 index subjects (families) per group was required to ensure evaluable data for the primary endpoint from at least 48 index subjects.</p><p>The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for each study were analyzed using the Cochran&#8208;Mantel&#8208;Haenszel test, stratified according to site at a 5% significance level. Interaction between treatment group and site was tested using the Breslow&#8208;Day test; if significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10), a logistic regression sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm any treatment site interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0012"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="pde13612-sec-0013"><label>3.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Enrolled subjects ranged in age from 6 months to 61.1 years, with 83.7% females and 16.1% males.

In two large phase 3 studies conducted in a total of 704 subjects aged 6 months and older, abametapir lotion eliminated lice in more than 80% of subjects after a single 10&#8208;minute application with no nit combing. Abametapir demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in the clearance of head louse infestations than vehicle, with comparable results seen between the two studies.</p><p>The life cycle of the louse ranges from 33 to 35 days and includes egg, nymph, and adult stages. If a product cannot kill louse eggs through chemical or physical action, a second treatment may be necessary to eliminate nymphs emerging from unaffected eggs. In the two studies presented here, 81.1% and 81.8% of ITT subjects were louse free at day 14 after a single treatment. These data indicate that abametapir kills lice, and by inference also their eggs. In a previously completed in vitro study, topical contact with abametapir lotion showed 100% efficacy against head louse eggs.<xref rid="pde13612-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>
</p><p>The vehicle used in the abametapir lotion resulted in 47.2% and 50.9% of louse&#8208;free subjects at day 14. Some degree of vehicle effect was anticipated in the clinical studies, as an in vitro study of our vehicle formulation reported that it can provide up to 55% ovicidal efficacy against head lice compared with 10&#8211;20% for the water control. 16 It is currently not clear as to what component or components of the vehicle formulation may be contributing to this observed vehicle effect.</p><p>The incidence of adverse events was low and consistent with a topical product, with the most common adverse events being erythema, rash, and skin burning sensation. There were no discontinuations associated with abametapir lotion in any age group. Hair color changes were noted in three subjects. The abametapir compound can chelate iron at concentrations as low as 1 part per million. High iron content in the water used to rinse the product from the hair may have resulted in the observed color changes, which resolved within 7 days.</p><p>One limitation of these studies is that reinfestation was not specifically assessed or quantified. To eliminate any possibility of reinfestation, subjects would need to be isolated for the 2 weeks after treatment, a methodology that would present significant practical and ethical obstacles in the population studied here.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0018"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Abametapir lotion, 0.74%, was effective for the topical treatment of head louse infestation in subjects aged 6 months and older with a single administration. The incidence of adverse events was low, with the most common adverse events being erythema, rash, and skin burning sensation. The inhibition of metal&#8208;dependent processes, including metalloproteinases, in adult lice and lice eggs, is a novel mechanism of action that head louse treatments have not previously used.</p></sec><sec id="pde13612-sec-0020"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>Vernon Bowles and Hugh Alsop are stockholders in Hatchtech Pty Ltd.
