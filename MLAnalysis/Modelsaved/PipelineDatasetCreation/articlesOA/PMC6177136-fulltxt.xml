However, single target agents can perform excellently during the treatment of diseases with linear pathways. Multi-factorial diseases with complex signalling networks, such as cancer, are robust and can be efficiently eradicated only by the simultaneous attack of multiple targets.</p><p>A well-established strategy for anticancer therapy is the rational design of drug combinations aimed at achieving synergistic effects and overcoming drug resistance. However, the combination of agents that exhibit synergistic interaction in cell culture can be less effective than expected. This is mainly due to differential pharmacokinetic behaviour of each drug and to the difficulty to afford optimal concentrations for the required time [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other shortcomings of drug combinations are unpredictable drug-drug interactions and possible enhancement of adverse effects. To overcome these limitations, an increase of interest has been made recently in hybrid bifunctional agents designed to inhibit simultaneously multiple cellular targets relevant to tumour growth/survival [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The benefits of drugs with multiple targets could be (a) improvement of the efficacy by exploiting synergistic interactions; (b) enhancement of the selectivity resulting in a better tolerability; (c) modulation of drug resistance. Additionally, multivalent molecules are expected to provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages over the separate administration of the two drug components [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205018.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One attractive pathway for tumour growth inhibition is the protein acetylation state modulation by histone deacetylases (HDACs). To date, 18 human HDACs have been identified and grouped into four classes on the basis of their homology with yeast proteins [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) share high homology with the yeast transcriptional regulator RPD3; class II HDACs are closely related to HDAC1 (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10); class III HDACs, also called sirtuins, are homologous with Sir2 (SIRT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and class IV HDAC (HDAC11) is homologous with class I and II enzymes. HDAC inhibitors have already surpassed the clinical trial stage, culminating with the approval of Vorinostat, originally known as SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid), romidepsin (FK228), panobinostat (LBH-589), and belinostat (formerly PXD-101) [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205018.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205018.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0205018.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0205018.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Structures of representative HDAC and topoisomerase I inhibitors.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0205018.g001"/></fig><p>Another class of therapeutic agents acting at a nuclear level are topoisomerase I inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205018.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Topoisomerases relieve the torsional stress associated with the separation of DNA strands during transcription and DNA replication. Eukaryotic Topoisomerase I (Top1) is a Type IB enzyme that nicks and rejoins only one strand of duplex DNA, and it is critically important for maintaining genome integrity [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many small molecule inhibitors of Top1 have proven clinically effective, the most potent being the camptothecin (CPT) derivatives [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205018.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205018.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>Two semisynthetic camptothecins have been approved by US FDA for cancer chemotherapy: Irinotecan (CPT-11) and Topotecan. Belotecan (Camtobell) has been approved in South Korea for treatment of NSCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205018.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Other derivatives are in different stages of clinical development, such as Lipotecan [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and BAY 56&#8211;3722 [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], together with a number of macromolecular delivery agents and supramolecular assemblies [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The cancer-promoting mechanism of HDAC involves transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressors via deacetylation of nucleosomes containing tumor suppressor genes. HDAC inhibition has been reported to affect cancer cells mainly by a global relaxation of chromatin structure, which contributes to a recovered cell response to chemotherapeutic agents targeting DNA [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this respect, there is a lot of evidence showing that co-treatment with HDAC inhibitors and camptothecin derivatives (such as Topotecan, Irinotecan) synergistically block cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0205018.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We decided to exploit this synergistic effects by designing hybrid inhibitors which could, in principle, interact with both targets. In particular, we chose to incorporate into a prototypical HDACi pharmacophore a properly substituted CPT. Classical medicinal chemistry approaches coupled with computational analysis and biological evaluation led to the definition of key molecular insights for dual inhibition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Chemistry</title><sec id="sec004"><title>General information</title><p>All reagents and solvents were reagent grade or were purified by standard methods before use.

Solvation parameters were added to the final structure using the Addsol utility of Autodock. Each docking consisted of an initial population of 100 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 200 energy evaluations, a mutation rate of 0.02, a crossover rate of 0.80, and an elitism value of 1. For the local search, the so-called pseudo-Solis and Wets algorithm was applied using a maximum of 250 iterations per local search. 250 independent docking runs were carried out for each ligand. The grid maps representing the system in the actual docking process were calculated with Autogrid. The dimensions of the grids were 80&#215;80&#215;80, with a spacing of 0.1 &#197; between the grid points and the center close to the cavity left by the ligand after its removal.

The new hybrid molecule showed a potency superior to both HDAC inhibitor SAHA and Top1 inhibitor Irinotecan, increased antitumor activity and very high tolerability in <italic>in vivo</italic> human tumor models with respect to SAHA and Topotecan.</p><p>In molecular modelling studies, compound <bold>3d</bold> showed the most favourable interactions and its promising binding mode provided structural support to the molecular design and development of analogues. Overall, the docking interaction profiles of synthesized compounds were in accordance with the biological results, especially for selected compound <bold>3d</bold>, which was found to have significantly better interactions with both target proteins. This finding can be explained considering the simultaneous presence in <bold>3d</bold> of the phenolic -OH on ring A of camptothecin (10-hydroxy) and the right length of the linker (n = 5). These two structural features represent the driving force that makes <bold>3d</bold> a better ligand for both the DNA-Top1 binary complex and the HDAC-II active site.</p><p>The single dual-function molecule not only attacks the cancer cells from two distinct pathways simultaneously but also improves drug efficacy of the conventional CPT without increasing its dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, it can be used for treating tumors susceptible to camptothecin drugs and/or to HDAC inhibitors, showing at the same time a good tolerability and low toxicity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0205018.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sundar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Valeri</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Clin.
