It subdivides as it exits the intervertebral canal, into a large anterior primary ramus and a smaller posterior primary ramus. The posterior ramus runs around the facet joints and gives branches supplying ligaments, joints, and all the segmental spinal muscles in addition to providing for the cutaneous supply over the back from the vertex to the coccyx.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Surgeries for lumbar discectomy are usually associated with severe postoperative pain; there are a variety of pharmacological options available for the effective relief of pain after spinal surgery.

The study was registered with a clinical trial registry (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03285282). The study trial was conducted and reported according to the Consolidating Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 statement.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Seventy cases with herniated lumbar disc scheduled for lumbar single-level or multiple-level lumbar discectomy from May 2017 to February 2018 were selected for this study. Inclusion criteria were patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) I or II aged between 21 and 60 years of both genders scheduled for lumbar discectomy. Exclusion criteria were body mass index &gt;32, history of relevant allergy to any of the drugs used in the procedure, previous lumbar spine surgery or back surgery with planed spinal fixation, or the inability to operate a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. All participants signed an informed consent after explaining them the objective of the study. Computer-generated randomization numbers were used to allocate patients into two groups using sealed opaque envelopes. The envelope was chosen by each patient which determined his/her group. Patients were randomized and divided into two groups, each containing 35 patients. Group I (control group) received the standard general anesthetic technique without TLIP block and Group II (TLIP group) received TLIP block with 20 ml mixture of 10 ml 0.25% bupivacaine and 10 ml 1% lidocaine on each side.</p><p>General anesthesia was standardized in the two groups using propofol (1&#8211;2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (2 &#956;g/kg). Tracheal intubation was facilitated using atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) and maintenance of anesthesia was with 50:50% O<sub>2</sub> and air with isoflurane and atracurium.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Technique</title><p>TLIP block was done after induction of anesthesia with patients in the prone position, and standard monitors were applied. A SonoSite S-Nerve high-frequency linear (HFL) 50X transducer using SONOSITE M-TURBO machine (FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc., USA)was placed in transverse orientation in a midline position at approximately the level of the 3<sup>rd</sup> lumbar vertebra (L3). After identification of corresponding spinous process and interspinal muscles, the probe moved laterally to identify the MF and LG muscles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. At the most caudal level, the block was performed to allow reliable identification of the MF/LG interface. Differentiation of the MF and LG muscles may be difficult as these separate muscles can often appear as a single larger one.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Identification of landmarks before proceeding for injection</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-12-559-g001"/></fig><p>Under complete sterile condition, a 22G spinal needle(BD Spinal needle Quincke type point 22G 0.7 &#215; 90 mm, Becton Dickinson S.A.S Agustin del Guadalix, Madrid, Spain, REF: 405256)was advanced under real-time in-plane ultrasound guidance bevel up in lateral-to-medial direction at an approximate angle of 30&#176; to the skin.

The primary outcome was to compare the two groups with regard to pain scores. Pain scores were observed and recorded using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) both at rest and during movement. The acute pain service team recorded the scores in the ward at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, whereas secondary outcomes included the TFA, 24-h morphine consumption, and side effects associated with morphine such as nausea, vomiting, and sedation.

There are several postoperative pain control methods to reduce pain; among them, intramuscular injections, intermittent intravenous, and PCA are the most commonly used. Furthermore, these methods are generally insufficient to control pain arising from movement as well. Such an insufficient postoperative pain control may delay discharge from hospital and result in complications. Furthermore, using nonopioid medication to control postoperative pain has repeatedly been shown to benefit patients in terms of morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In line with studies demonstrating the efficacy of LA infiltration in back surgery, spine surgeons frequently perform a preoperative field infiltration for lumbar surgery with a total dose of anesthetics similar to that of the TAP block,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with significant reduction of morphine consumption and longer TFA requirement than the control group. However, the efficacy of this approach has not been well studied. Nevertheless, the safety of such a procedure with the typically used dose of LAs is supported by the extensive regional anesthetic practice using similar blocks. In another study by Gurbet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] they found that preemptive infiltration of LAs is superior to at-closure administration for postoperative analgesia after lumbar laminectomy, and also they found that instillation of the nerve roots before wound closure by the surgeon may represent an excellent alternative, being superior to at-closure infiltration. An argument in favor of root infiltration the need for lower doses of LAs than infiltration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Bianconi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] concluded that continuous wound instillation by LAs after spine fusion surgery found to be more effective than systemic analgesia while plasma concentrations of the LAs remained below toxic levels. Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that continuous infusion with LAs reduced postoperative morphine consumption with up to 0.5 mg/kg. After multiple trials for LA infiltration, ultrasound-guided TLIP block was first described by Hand <italic>et al</italic>. when ten participants underwent bilateral ultrasound-guided injections of 0.2% ropivacaine 20 mL in the fascial plane between the MF and LG muscles. After 20 min, the area surrounding the needle injection site where anesthesia was administered was 217.0 (84.7) cm<sup>2</sup>. This area consistently covered the midline and had a predictable spread. Ueshima <italic>et al</italic>. described two cases of spinal surgeries where TLIP block was administered.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a cadaveric study, the dye added to the LA of the TLIP block colored the dorsal rami of the lumbar nerves.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Hand <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the efficacy of the TLIP block is restricted to the lumbar region; however, Ueshima <italic>et al</italic>. determined that the TLIP block also affected the dorsal rami of the thoracic nerves.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Ohgoshi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] described TLIP block for multi-level spine surgery. Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] recorded a case report of a patient who received ultrasound-guided TLIP block for postoperative pain management after lumbar discectomy at L3&#8211;L4; the duration of surgery was 2 h and the demand for the first analgesic dose was 5 h after surgery. Another study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] discussed the efficacy of TLIP block in postoperative analgesia for lumbar laminoplasty compared with the control group which received intravenous analgesia, the TLIP group reported lower pain scores for pain at 1, 2, 4, and 24 h postoperatively and less analgesic requirement and showed no significant differences in the incidence of complications.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are few limitations that were faced in this study. Since it was carried out on alivepatient, the exact extent of the injected solution could not be exactly evaluated; although in one case after obtaining consent, a contrast medium was added to the mixture followed by an anteroposterior X-ray as mentioned before, in a trial to understand the exact extension of the injectate. Furthermore, we could not exactly determine the proper or the ideal volume and concentration of LA that should have been used to perform the TLIP block. We were limited in the concentration of the LA for fear of reaching the toxic level of the drugs used. Moreover, further assessment of the patient after being discharged from the hospital could not be done, which could have shed some lights on the role of TLIP on preventing failed back surgery syndrome. Hence, a prospective study should be planned to deal with those limitations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TLIP is an effective and safe method for
