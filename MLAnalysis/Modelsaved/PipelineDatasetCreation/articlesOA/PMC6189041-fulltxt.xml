Recent molecular phylogenetic studies identified significant diversity and genetic divergence within both the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex and the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex. In one study, the divergent lineages within each of the two species complexes were proposed as different species: the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex was divided into two species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>deneoformans</italic>) and the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex into five species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>deuterogattii</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>bacillisporus</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>tetragattii</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>decagattii</italic>) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, there is an ongoing debate about whether the observed differences warrant naming the different lineages as different species and on how species should be named in this and other groups of fungal taxa. Here we used the conservative naming system to call strains of lineages VNI to VNIV as belonging to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex while those of lineages VGI to VGIV as belonging to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex. Regardless of the naming disagreements, these lineages/species are readily identified using a variety of molecular markers, including multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Hybridization and hybrids have been observed in animals and plants since antiquity, but the scientific study of hybrids didn&#8217;t begin until the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century when K&#246;lreuter showed that hybrid progeny often had intermediate phenotypes of the parents and that most of them were sterile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Since then, hybridization has been continuously reported. However, the role of hybridization in long-term evolution has been debated and there are two opposite viewpoints among biologists. At one extreme, hybridization is regarded as a potent evolutionary force that creates opportunities for speciation and adaptive evolution. Biologists holding this view believe hybridization increases the genetic diversity and brings novel gene combinations, which could lead to significantly increased adaptive potential in heterogeneous environments. The contrary considers hybridization as evolutionary noise, with only transient effects on populations and relatively little long-term evolutionary importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Recent genetic and genomic evidence suggest that hybridization is very common and has likely played a significant role in speciation and other biological processes of many organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The impact of hybridization on fungal evolution differs from those in the majority of plants and animals in several aspects. For example, unlike in plants and animals, most fungal species can reproduce both sexually and asexually. As a result, sexually sterile hybrid progeny can continue to reproduce through asexual/clonal reproduction and thus can have continuous evolutionary effects. Another unique characteristic of fungi is that they generally have short reproductive cycles and can achieve large population sizes in a relatively short period of time. Both features can contribute to the possibility that hybrid progeny with high fitness could emerge during hybridization in fungi.</p><p id="Par6">Although most studies of hybridization have focused on animals and plants, natural and artificial hybridization has been frequently reported in many microbial groups, including the human pathogenic <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>. Both the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex and the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex have a bipolar mating system with two different mating types, <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> and <italic>MAT</italic>&#945;. Under appropriate conditions, strains of different mating types from the same or different lineages and species complexes can mate with each other to generate meiotic progeny. The hybridization process includes cell fusion, formation of dikaryotic hyphae, and the generation of basidiospores through meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, natural hybrid strains have been frequently reported in the human pathogenic <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species. For example, strains of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> &#215; <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> (or VNI &#215; VNIV and VNII &#215; VNIV hybrids) have been observed in both the natural environments and in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

In addition, Kavanaugh <italic>et al</italic>. reported an ancient introgression event that a fragment of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> gene region (~40&#8201;kb) non-reciprocally transferred to a strain of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> var. <italic>neoformans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These results suggest that hybridization is common in the human pathogenic <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species complexes and that they represent great model organisms for understanding the effects of hybridization on fungal evolution.</p><p id="Par7">One of the key indicators of evolution and speciation is the viability of sexual offspring. In the human pathogenic <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, the sexual basidiospores are also considered the infectious propagules. These spores can be abundant, stress resistant, and readily aerially dispersed. As a result, animals may encounter spores more often than other infectious forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A previous study described that spores from the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex were much more infectious than yeast cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

However, based on the low spore germination rate at 37&#8201;&#176;C, several studies also suggested that basidiospores might not be the only nor most important infectious propagule in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">A recent study reported that basidiospores from intra-lineage crosses within the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex had an overall greater germination potential than those from inter-lineage crosses over a range of environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

However, the observed correlation was not statistically significant in the present study.

To eliminate some of the confounding factors associated with both parental strains being different in the comparison, we further assessed the relationship between genetic distance and basidiospore germination rate for crosses all involving a shared mating partner. Here, we focused on JF101, the only strain that successfully mated with representative strains from all lineages (VNI, VNIV, VGI, VGII, and VGIII) in this study. A total of eight crosses involving strain JF101 were included in this analysis (Tables&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

Overall, the results suggest that in the crosses examined here, the level of genetic divergence between parental strains is a relatively minor contributor to differences in basidiospore germination rate. In contrast, other factors such as genome structure differences (e.g. translocations and inversions) and mutations in genes involved in basidiospore germination likely play important roles.

We examined the effects of two media, three temperatures, and genetic divergence between pairs of parental strains on the germination rates of basidiospores. Our analyses indicated that all examined factors (temperature, medium, parental strain and strain pair) could influence basidiospore germination. Unlikely in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex where nucleotide sequence divergence between parental strains was negatively correlated with basidiospore germination rate, the results from the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex were more variable and complex. The highest spore germination rate was found in an intra-lineage VGIII&#8201;&#215;&#8201;VGIII cross. In addition, while environmental factors can significantly influence the pattern of basidiospore germination, most of the environmental influences are not universal but are cross-specific. Our results also suggest that novel hybrids among certain lineages within the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex and between the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex and the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex could be readily generated under laboratory conditions.

The twelve <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex strains belonged to three lineages: VGI, VGII and VGIII. Strains B4545, B4492 and B4495 belong to the VGI lineage; strains LA55n, LA61n and R265 belong to the VGII lineage; and strains B4544, B4546, B4499, ATCC32608, JF101 and JF109 belong to the VGIII lineage. Strain JF109 is a derivative of a clinical strain B4546 with the <italic>crg1</italic> gene deleted while strain JF101 is derived from a clinical strain NIH312 with the deletion of <italic>crg1</italic> gene. Four of the five <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> species complex strains correspond to two pairs of isogenic isolates, one pair is JEC20 and JEC21, the other one is KN99a and KN99&#945;.

Not all 72 pairwise strain combinations between the <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> and <italic>MAT</italic>&#945; types were crossed with each other. Instead, 46 pairwise combinations, including all 36 possible pairs within the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> species complex were attempted (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). To prepare for mating, all parental strains were first cultured on Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose (YEPD) agar medium for 2&#8211;3 days at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Actively growing cells were then re-suspended in sterile distilled water and 10&#8201;&#956;l of the adjusted cell suspension (~10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) from each parental strain was completely mixed together and then spotted on the V8-juice mating agar medium. Each plate contained six spots (10&#8201;&#956;l/spot): four for the mixed cells and two for pure parental cells as negative controls. Mating plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature (around 23&#8201;&#176;C) for 7&#8211;30 days to allow for mating and sexual spore formation. Successful mating was indicated by the formation of hyphae at the periphery of the mating spots containing yeast cells from the two parents.</p><p id="Par35">For those pairs that failed to mate at the first try, additional attempts were made, including by changing the pH of V8-juice agar medium, from pH7 to pH5. For all successful crosses, sections of agar with hyphae and basidiospores (i.e. no parental yeast cells) were cut and transferred to a new blank plate. The hyphae and basidiospores were gently washed by applying sterile 0.5% Tween 20 solution to the mycelial surface of each agar block and four layers of sterile cheesecloth (Loblaws Inc. Toronto, Canada) were used as filter to obtain pure spore solutions. Basidiospore suspensions were diluted with additional sterile 0.5% Tween 20 solution to a final density (approx. 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>3</sup> spores/ml). 100&#8201;&#956;l of the diluted basidiospore suspensions was spread on either the common rich medium (YEPD agar medium) or the minimal Synthetic Dextrose (SD) agar medium and incubated at each of the tested temperatures (23&#8201;&#176;C, 30&#8201;&#176;C and 37&#8201;&#176;C) for seven days. The number of all visible colonies formed by germinated basidiospores was counted on each plate at three and seven days respectively after incubation. For each cross&#8201;&#215;&#8201;temperature&#8201;&#215;&#8201;medium combination, we performed at least three repeats. The germination of basidiospores was determined as a ratio of the number of observed colonies to the estimated total number of basidiospores plated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sequencing</title><p id="Par36">To estimate the genetic divergence among parental strains, sequences in fragments of three protein-coding genes (<italic>GPD</italic>1, <italic>LAC</italic>1 and <italic>PLB</italic>1) were obtained from either the GenBank or through PCR followed by sequencing.
