Plasmids are one of the popular carriers to disseminate resistance genes among pathogens. However, the response of plasmid-carrying bacteria to antibiotic treatment and how these bacteria evolve to increase their resistance remain elusive. In this study, we conjugated plasmid pNDM-HK to <italic>E. coli</italic> J53 recipient cells and selected survivors using different concentrations of the broad spectrum antibiotic meropenem. After selection, transconjugants conferred varying minimum inhibitory concentrations with respect to carbapenems. We sequenced and compared the transcriptomes of transconjugants that exhibited distinct carbapenem susceptibilities, and found that the loss of outer membrane proteins led to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, we identified a novel mutation, G63S, in transcription factor OmpR which moderates the expression of outer membrane proteins. The loss of porins was due to incapability of phosphorylation, which is essential for porin transcription and carbapenem resistance. We also characterized other genes that are regulated by <italic>ompR</italic> in this mutant, which contributed to bacterial antibiotic resistance. Overall, our studies suggest antibiotic pressure after conjugation might be an alternative pathway to promote antimicrobial resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Food and Health Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region | Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12111662</award-id><award-id>1514032</award-id><award-id>HKM-15-M10</award-id><award-id>12111662</award-id><award-id>15140342</award-id><award-id>HKM-15-M10</award-id><award-id>12111662</award-id><award-id>15140342</award-id><award-id>HKM-15-M10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Hoi-Kuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Ting-fung</given-names></name><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Pak-Leung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Development of antibiotic resistance among <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> has become a worldwide health issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the past, extended-spectrum &#946;-lactamases (ESBLs), which hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins, have emerged and carbapenems were regarded as a last resort antibiotic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the development of carbapenemases that can inactivate the carbapenems substantially increases the burden of clinical treatment at hospitals. New Delhi metallo-&#946;-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) is one of the dominant carbapenemases. The NDM-1 gene (<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>) was first identified from a strain of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> in India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and has since been found in various Gram-negative pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Conjugative transfer of plasmids is one of the major pathways to disseminate <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> among bacteria, regardless of their species and class. In recent years, numerous plasmids carrying the NDM-1 gene, including both narrow (IncFII) and broad host range (IncM, IncA/C, IncH and IncX3) plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, have been reported to associate with other classes of antibiotic-resistance genes, constraining therapeutic options for the infections caused by bacteria carrying these plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Apart from antibiotic degradation enzymes, reduced expression of porins is a complementary mechanism to confer carbapenem resistance in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Porins are outer membrane proteins that act as a selective barrier to protect bacteria from harmful substances and function as channels for molecules to diffuse into the cytoplasm. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli)</italic>, OmpC, OmpF and PhoE are porins that control the influx of metabolites, amino acids and antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Down-regulating these genes would reduce the permeability of porin, resulting in mitigated antibiotic resistance. Notably, clinical isolates with carbapenem resistance are often associated with porin loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In the last decade, the relationship between gene regulation and antibiotic resistance, as well as the environmental factors that initiate gene moderation to activate antibiotic resistance pathways, have been widely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It was suggested that incubating bacteria with sublethal concentration of antibiotics altered gene expression for adaptation and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, antibiotics have been shown to act as the selective driver to influence the physiology of bacteria, such as conjugation dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the effect from the selective pressure of antibiotics in terms of bacterial adaptation and their responses leading to further development of antibiotic resistance, particularly in the presence of antibiotic resistance plasmids, remain limited.</p><p id="Par5">Previously, we isolated the first NDM-1 positive <italic>E. coli</italic> strain in Hong Kong and sequenced the corresponding plasmid pNDM-HK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We found that the 90&#8201;kb plasmid contains a 55&#8201;kb backbone and a 28.9&#8201;kb variable region. The backbone shared 97% homology with pEL60 originated from the plant pathogen <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, while the variable region encodes resistant determinants to &#946;-lactams (<italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>TEM-1</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>DHA-1</sub>), aminoglycosides (<italic>aacC2, armA</italic>), sulphonamides (<italic>sul1</italic>) and macrolides (<italic>mel, mph2</italic>). It is in high homology to pCTX-M3 plasmid which has been associated with the dissemination of CTX-M type &#946;-lactam resistance with the difference of a unique region of <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub>. In order to understand the effect of antibiotics on bacteria carrying pNDM-HK, we conjugated pNDM-HK to <italic>E. coli</italic> J53 from a clinical isolate and selected using different concentrations of meropenem. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of transconjugants was drastically changed under different conditions. Transconjugants selected by higher dosage of meropenem exhibited stronger carbapenem resistance. Transcriptomic analysis of these isogenic transconjugants indicated the development of stronger resistance was attributed to a novel point mutation G63S on the porin transcription factor, <italic>ompR</italic>, leading to the loss of porin. Our findings highlighted the importance of antibiotic selective pressure to bacterial physiology and their manipulations on gene expression for further developing stronger antibiotic resistance strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="Par6">The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.
