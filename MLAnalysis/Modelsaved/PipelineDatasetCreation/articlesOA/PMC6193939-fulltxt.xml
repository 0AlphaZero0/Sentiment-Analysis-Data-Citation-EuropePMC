However, the molecular consequences of polymorphism within these candidate loci remain poorly understood. To address this, we have used computational tools to quantify the effects of point mutations conferring resistance to three major anti-tuberculosis drugs, isoniazid (n&#8201;=&#8201;189), rifampicin (n&#8201;=&#8201;201) and D-cycloserine (n&#8201;=&#8201;48), within their primary targets, <italic>katG</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic>, and <italic>alr</italic>. Notably, mild biophysical effects brought about by high incidence mutations were considered more tolerable, while different structural effects brought about by haplotype combinations reflected differences in their functional importance. Additionally, highly destabilising mutations such as <italic>alr</italic> Y388, highlighted a functional importance of the wildtype residue. Our qualitative analysis enabled us to relate resistance mutations onto a theoretical landscape linking enthalpic changes with phenotype. Such insights will aid the development of new resistance-resistant drugs and, via an integration into predictive tools, in pathogen surveillance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Australian Government Research Training Program Fellowship</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phelan</surname><given-names>Jody E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M01360X/1</award-id><award-id>MR/N010469/1</award-id><award-id>MC_PC_15103</award-id><award-id>MR/K020420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Taane G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Furnham</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tuberculosis disease (TB), caused by bacteria in the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex</italic>, continues to have a profound impact on global health. In 2015, TB was responsible for infecting 10.5 million new patients, and taking 1.4 million lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, being the foremost cause of mortality from a single infectious agent. While HIV co-infection and immigration play important roles in disease re-emergence, drug resistance remains an important but poorly understood driver of disease transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and threatens disease control. Resistance arises from evolutionary selective pressure on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> after years of the same-antibiotic re-exposure, patient non-compliance to the long strict drug regime, and a lack of approved and available anti-TB therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It is further exacerbated as the latest drugs, such as bedaquiline and delamanid, are reserved as last line add-on drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> for fear of emerging resistance.</p><p id="Par3">Different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains have been observed to be both mono- and poly-resistant to current drug regimens, where the latter present a higher risk for treatment failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Prominent classes of poly-resistant TB strains include: multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin first line drugs, and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), which are additionally resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone and one injectable second line drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may occur genetically or phenotypically, and is often an interplay between the two mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Phenotypic resistance is a result of changes in gene expression via epigenetic changes and transcriptional regulation, while genetic resistance principally is via acquired genetic mutations, since horizontal gene transfer via plasmids does not occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Distinctive mechanisms by which resistance is achieved have been described for mycobacteria including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Intrinsic resistance can manifest in several ways including changes to the cell wall permeability. This can occur through using alternative enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, such as the expression of a second class of transpeptidases that form non-classical linkages between peptides that make up the cell wall leading to resistance in &#223;-lactam antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, hydrophilic agents often use porins to cross the outer membrane as the lipid membranes of mycobacteria generally have very low permeability for these agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The loss of such porins in mycobacteria has shown to drastically increase resistance to hydrophilic antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As well as low permeability of the cell wall, the other major system contributing to intrinsic resistance are active efflux pumps that transport antibiotics out of the cell. A well-studied exampled in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is the increased transcription of <italic>jefA</italic>, that leads to increased resistance to isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This increased expression, in clinical strains, is a result of induction in response to antibiotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The importance of efflux pumps has been shown through the development of&#160;pump inhibitors that can restore susceptibility in resistant strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Another intrinsic route to resistance is though modification by acetylation or methylation of either the antibiotic or its target to inhibit interaction or recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">A major route to resistance is acquired resistance principally via genetic polymorphism or mutations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels) and occasionally large deletions in genes coding for drug-targets or -converting enzymes in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome (size 4.4 Mbp)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Pharmacologically, these mutations may manifest resistance via different mechanisms, affecting drug activation in the case of prodrugs, its entry to the target via drug permeability, or the drug target itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These genetically acquired mechanisms are influenced by factors such as: the genetic differences between lineages and especially differences in mutation rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; epistatic interactions between mutations within the genetic background of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; and the dynamics within a clonal population that lead to competition within a host between sub-populations possessing emergent resistance associated mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">An understanding of the molecular consequences of these mutations can provide valuable insight into how resistance develops and the pre-emptive identification of likely resistance mutations. Here we focus on the SNPs associated with resistance to two core first-line drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, and the second-line drug D-cycloserine. The mechanisms of these drugs are broadly known. Isonazid is a compound that inhibits mycolic acid biosynthesis by binding to an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase encoded by the <italic>inhA</italic> gene. It is a pro-drug, which is activated by a catalase-peroxidase enzyme encoded by <italic>katG</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Most SNPs causing isoniazid drug resistance are mapped onto the <italic>katG</italic> gene, and lead to a reduction or full inhibition of activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Rifampicin is a semisynthetic antibiotic that binds to the RNA polymerase &#946; subunit encoded by <italic>rpoB</italic>, inhibiting transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Most rifampicin resistant mutations are confined to the <italic>rpoB</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, within a 27 residue (81&#8201;bp) region known as the Rifampicin Resistance Determining Region (RRDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Whereas, D-cycloserine blocks bacterial growth by inhibiting two enzymes involved in D-Alanine metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, including alanine racemase, which is encoded for by the <italic>alr</italic> gene. It is thought that enzyme overexpression leads to D-cycloserine resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Using a suite of structural bioinformatics tools we sought to evaluate the structural and biophysical effects of putative resistance SNPs in the <italic>alr (</italic>D-cycloserine), <italic>katG (</italic>isoniazid) <italic>rpoB (</italic>rifampicin) genes. In particular, we model the effects of these SNPs within their environments in protein drug targets alanine racemase, catalase peroxidase and RNA Polymerase-&#946;, respectively. Using this approach we successfully identified the molecular mechanisms of known resistance mutations. While we have previously observed correlations between structural features and the resistance they confer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, a broader systematic analysis of the structural and biophysical changes leading to resistance will greatly facilitate their integration into genotypic phenotyping programmes. The proteomic structural methods decribed have the ability to inform our understanding of how clinically observed variants lead to resistance, as well as guide the development of compounds less prone to resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore the proteome-wide scaling up of our approach has the potential to identify new drug targets and forms of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>SNPs and protein structures</title><p id="Par8">SNP data for 6,465&#8201;<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolates with drug susceptibility testing using 1<sup>st</sup> line and 2<sup>nd</sup> line drugs were available (described elsewhere)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The isolates represented the four main lineages (1&#8211;4) of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and were sourced from over 20 countries across 5 continents, thereby representing global diversity. Drug&#160;resistance phenotypes for the isolates varied from susceptible (n&#8201;=&#8201;4,451, 68.8%), resistant to at least one drug (n&#8201;=&#8201;763, 11.8%), MDR-TB (n&#8201;=&#8201;973, 15.1%) and XDR-TB (n&#8201;=&#8201;278, 4.3%). Many of the isolates have been experimentally measured to establish the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of drug required for resistance phenotype. SNPs with non-synonymous mutations in the <italic>katG</italic> (n&#8201;=&#8201;189) and <italic>rpoB</italic> loci (n&#8201;=&#8201;201) collectively associated with MDR-TB (isoniazid and rifampicin), and within the <italic>alr</italic> gene (n&#8201;=&#8201;48) associated with D-cycloserine resistance were analysed (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These SNPs have been identified in recent GWAS studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> with the majority (80%) not described in functional studies. The crystal structure of <italic>apo</italic>-alanine racemase is available as PDB entry 1XFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The crystal structure of <italic>apo-</italic>catalase peroxidase is available as PDB entry 1SJ2, and described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The crystal structure of RNA Polymerase-&#946; was inferred through homology modelling. The analytical strategy is described in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and the Methods section. In brief, GWAS data and protein structural understandings were used to map SNPs onto protein structures and measure their effects on&#160;protein and complex stabilities, and ligand and nucleic acid affinities using the mCSM suites. Based on these measures, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms was achieved based on the predominant functions affected by each mutation. A general overview of all properties and their respective variabilities is depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. As expected: correlation between accessible surface area and volume exists; a weak correlation between mCSM-lig measures and distance from the active site is observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; and other measures showing no correlations to each other (see Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Trends for the separate proteins are depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, where differences between the three proteins normalised averaged values were intriguingly similar. Notably, the main difference between targets was between affinity and respective distance, and was attributed to the different complexities ranging from small protein Alr to large protein RpoB. Residues having multiple SNPs were identified and linked to drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These were not limited to the active site, showing that drug resistant hotspots need not directly interfere with ligand binding.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) General correlations between biophysical (DUET, mCSM-lig, mCSM-PPI) and physicochemical (Accessible Surface Area, Volume, Mass, Charge, Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors) properties of all mutations in this study.

Within <italic>alr</italic>, four multiple SNP sites having two SNPs each were identified: Thr75, Asp139, Tyr388 and Arg397. The <italic>katG</italic> gene had 22 multiple SNP sites, the most prominent being active site residue Ser315 which had five variants.

Within <italic>alr</italic>, 39.6% of the 48 mutations were within 10&#8201;&#197; of either protomer&#8217;s (of the homodimer) active site and 58.3% within 10&#8201;&#197; of a protein-protein interface Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The properties analysed were evenly distributed, as 33.3% of all mutations directly affected ligand affinity, 29.2% affected complex stability via protein-protein interactions, and 31.3% were related to protomer stability (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It is thought that this even distribution is due to the small number of mutations identified, the compact structure of the homodimer and the presence of the active site at the protein-protein interface, where different mechanisms imparted by local mutations may equilibrate.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of mutations within alanine racemase (alr; <bold>a</bold>), catalase peroxidase chain A (katG; <bold>b</bold>) and RNA Polymerase &#946;-subunit (rpoB; <bold>c</bold>).

Since <italic>katG</italic> is not an essential protein for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but the principle activator of isoniazid, a large proportion of protomer destabilising mutations is thought to impart a drug resistance phenotype through a direct instability of the activating protein, which does not come at a high bacterial fitness cost. For the purposes of our analysis, bacterial fitness in the presence of the drug is considered to be the ability of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolates to survive following administration of a drug regimen observed clinically and supported&#160;using standard experimentally measured minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, where available.</p><p id="Par12">For target <italic>rpoB</italic>, 29.4% of the 201 mutations analysed were within 10&#8201;&#197; of the active site; 30.3% of all mutations were within 10&#8201;&#197; of any type of nucleic acid &#8211; whether single stranded RNA, single stranded DNA, double stranded DNA or DNA/mRNA transcript and 82.6% were within 10&#8201;&#197; of another RNA polymerase complex subunit (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

However, as the protein-protein interface comprises both the active site and the nucleic acid binding site, variants affecting local conformation leading to a loss in complex stability, may affect other properties directly leading to drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mutational effects were mostly imparted via steric or electrostatic changes</title><p id="Par14">At the protein level, local changes in size or charge upon mutation are thought to contribute to conformational changes, leading to a difference in protein stability and interactions with other proteins, nucleic acids and ligands. One such mutation is E373G within <italic>alr</italic> (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The large steric difference in residue size upon mutation to glycine (accessible surface area: &#8722;99 &#197;<sup>2</sup>), along with a loss of negative charge, has led to a large loss of protein stability (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At the molecular level, this mutation likely disrupts local interactions involving the wildtype residue glutamic acid, causing a local conformational change. Changes in amino acid properties upon mutation were a notable trend throughout the SNPs. Of all the 438 mutations within the three structures, 34.9% exhibited a change in charge, which is judged to affect local interactions with neighboring residues. When considering the change in accessible surface area (ASA; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) as a measure of residue size, 63.9% of all variants in our dataset exhibited a modulus difference of less than 50 &#197;<sup>2</sup>. This skewed distribution is considered to be a direct limitation of protein fitness. In the context of protein folding, a large difference in ASA upon mutation is deemed to disrupt local conformation and stability, in turn affecting the overall protein fold. Although we relate this disruption to a protein fitness penalty, other mutations are thought to compensate for these penalties, ultimately restoring protein fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, these conformational changes, though ultimately not affecting overall protein fold, may still lead to functional changes. Therefore, is thought that&#160;differences in drug response, coupled with an improved protein fitness via compensatory stabilising mutations, leads to the development of the drug resistance phenotype (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Steric clashes (<bold>c</bold> red) introduced upon mutation in alr when Glu373 (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold> accessible surface area: 188.42 &#197;<sup>2</sup>) was mutated to Gly (<bold>c</bold> accessible surface area: 89.41 &#197;<sup>2</sup>).

While R463L seems to have a higher fitness penalty than expected for its frequency, this mutation is part of a number of haplotype combinations (described later in further detail). It is therefore postulated that these secondary mutations that combine with R463L compensate for this fitness penalty, and enable the enrichment of the mutation within the bacterial population (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The <italic>alr</italic> high frequency mutation L113R is another exception to the nearly neutral concept, as it showed highly destabilising effects on both ligand affinity and protein stability. These values may explain why the incidence of this mutation, though the highest in its subset (0.57%), are very low compared to other high incidence mutations (R463L: 40.6%, S315T: 18.5%, S450L: 13.5%).

Moreover, we attribute large steric (&gt;50 &#197;<sup>2</sup>) changes to a local instability, that is unlikely to be tolerated without external, compensatory mutations. The conservation scores further highlight our observations, as the mutations at these highly conserved residues were also related to drug resistance in GWAS (L113R <italic>p-</italic>value: 6.44&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;17</sup>, S450L <italic>p-</italic>value: 2.85&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;10</sup>&#8201;<sup>2</sup>).

Similarly to the high frequency mutations described above, unclassified mutations are also considered to be nearly neutral, but are thought to have an opposite role via a mildly stabilising effect. In general, all unclassified mutations mapped within a 5&#8201;&#197; distance to destabilising mutations and described in more detail below. Despite a lack of GWAS evidence showing haplotype combinations including these unclassified mutations, we associate the overall positive effects to a compensatory protein fitness measure (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) for neighbouring destabilising mutations.

Notably, mutation A217V was close to (&lt;5&#8201;&#197;) A212D and F215V, which were highly destabilising for protomer stability. Theoretically, it is thought that A217V improves the fitness of these close mutations by improving a local minimum (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), however, there was no GWAS evidence of these mutations occurring concomitantly. A similar scenario is applicable to T401I, which is close to variant A38V, which is moderately destabilising for protomer stability. Mutation T75M was not present close to any other mutation in our dataset, but was at a polymorphic site also mutated to alanine. As this residue was not within an interacting distance to the drug or the interface, a possible mechanism of resistance is a compensatory action against unfavourable closeby mutations thereby maintaining a local protein minimum (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

Mutation R463L, located at the solvent accessible C-terminus, was present in all haplotypes. Its combination with W191R at the N-terminal protein-protein interface, and S315T/N at the active site is thought to be a means of achieving different resistance mechanisms concomitantly (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Moreover, W191R and S315T/N are thought to compensate the effects of R463L, and enrich it within the population.

Most haplotypes occurred coupled to S450L, the most frequently occurring mutation for this protein. Again, it is thought that these haplotypes may help enrich S450L within the population by counteracting any steric and consequentual conformational changes imparted via S450L (change in ASA: 78 &#197;<sup>2</sup>). Mutations coupled to L452P were present both at the active site (D435G, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), and at the &#946;&#8242; interface (I1106T and H1028R, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). L452P combinations were moderately destabilising for protomer stability, ligand affinity and complex affinity, while they were mild to moderately stabilising for nucleic acid affinity. From those coupled with S450L, only I488V is in close geographical proximity to the active site (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), which explains the highly destabilising effect on nucleic acid affinity occurring for this combination.

The destabilising effects were given higher consideration in classifying mutations, since nsSNPs are usually related to a decrease in protein stability, or a change in protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (via disruption of drug affinity, nucleic acid affinity or overall complex stability). This left a minority of protein stabilising variants &#8216;unclassified&#8217;, which we consider to be nearly neutral for protein fitness. Their stabilising role is thought to permit the restoration of the protein fold following the introduction of conformation-disrupting, unfavourable mutations in close proximity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The restoration of the protein fold is thought to increase the bacterial fitness in the presence of the drug&#160;(as approximated by changes in&#160;clinically observed susceptibility supported by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values), as drug resistant mutations are stabilized and enriched within the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>).

The milder effects on protein stability exhibited by the high frequency mutations are considered to help select for the mutation enrichment within the population. High frequency mutations, along with the unclassified mutations, are deemed to be nearly neutral with respect to protein fitness. The &#8216;unclassified&#8217; variants had mild stabilising effects, while high frequency mutations had mild destabilising effects. This enabled the latter to confer drug resistance via an optimised local energy minimum (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), thereby considered to be better tolerated according to protein thermodynamics. Further to this, the nearly neutral nature of high frequency mutations is thought to enable their enrichment in a particular locus, due to an overall &#8216;mild impact&#8217; imparted on protein folding and bacterial fitness, whether in the presence or absence of drug (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The more destabilising mutations are considered to confer a &#8216;higher impact&#8217; on protein folding energy, and subsequent protein and bacterial fitness, and are deemed to be less likely tolerated.

Conclusions were then drawn up based on all the factors and interaction distances. In classifying the major properties of each mutation, the destabilising effects were reviewed in a hierarchical manner, according to ligand affinity, nucleic acid affinity, complex stability (protein-protein interactions) and protomer stability. Unexplained mutations were those which had a stabilising effect, with no other destabilising effects to explain disruption of the wildtype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Haplotype analysis</title><p id="Par38">During haplotype analysis, we sought to calculate the enthalpic change in properties upon introduction of a mutation, in the presence of another mutation.
