While genetic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed some genes and non-coding loci associated to OA, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Chromatin profiling, which provides insight into gene regulation, has not been reported in OA mainly due to technical difficulties. Here, we employed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map the accessible chromatin landscape in articular knee cartilage of OA patients. We identified 109,215 accessible chromatin regions for cartilages, of which 71% were annotated as enhancers. By overlaying them with genetic and DNA methylation data, we have determined potential OA-relevant enhancers and their putative target genes. Furthermore, through integration with RNA-seq data, we characterized genes that are altered both at epigenomic and transcriptomic levels in OA. These genes are enriched in pathways regulating ossification and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Consistently, the differentially accessible regions in OA are enriched for MSC-specific enhancers and motifs of transcription factor families involved in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrate how direct chromatin profiling of clinical tissues can provide comprehensive epigenetic information for a disease and suggest candidate genes and enhancers of translational potential.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> that is one of the most common causes of chronic disability in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, of which the knee OA is the most common. Main features of OA include cartilage degradation, subchondral bone thickening, joint space narrowing and osteophytes formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, resulting in stiffness, swelling, and pain in the joint. Currently available treatments are either pain relief or joint function improvement by strengthening the supporting muscles. However, OA progression ultimately leads to costly total joint replacement surgery, making it a growing global health burden.</p><p id="Par3">Although the causes of OA are not well understood, risk factors such as age, weight, gender, and genetic factors have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

To date, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 loci to be associated with the risk of developing OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While next generation sequencing data is being generated to discover rare variants with larger effect size, the identified variants are often located in the non-coding regions of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, complicating the identification of the causal genes. Transcriptomic analyses of cartilage in diseased joints of OA patients (taken from replacement surgeries) provided an opportunity to pinpoint transcriptionally dysregulated genes and pathways relevant to OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, such studies have yet to fully reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of how the transcription of these genes are dysregulated.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, epigenetic tools have been applied to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of OA.

ATAC-seq maps the accessible chromatin regions, which are often regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers that play roles in regulation of gene expression. By integrating our ATAC-seq data with the publicly available genetic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we identified dysregulated enhancers and their potential target genes.

To assess the relevance of these peaks to OA, we intersected these peaks against OA GWAS (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) SNPs and OA DML datasets. We found 149 peaks (31 promoters and 101 enhancers) overlapping with OA-associated GWAS SNPs and 2,508 peaks (595 promoters and 1,715 enhancers) overlapping with OA DML. The fact that majority of these overlapping peaks are enhancers, along with the notion that many disease-associated noncoding variants reside in enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, suggest the dysregulation of enhancer might play a role in OA pathogenesis. To further characterize these potentially OA-relevant enhancers, we utilized public resources to predict their target genes (Methods). We listed enhancers that overlap OA GWAS SNPs (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) and OA DML (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), as well as their predicted target genes, representing candidates of dysregulated transcriptional network during OA pathogenesis.

Therefore, our study provides an accessible chromatin landscape of cartilage tissue for better interpretation of other genetic and epigenomic data relevant to OA and other skeletomuscular disease, although caution should be taken since public data from many populations are involved in the integrative analysis while our ATAC-seq dataset is acquired from the Japanese population.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Identification of accessible chromatin regions with OA susceptible GWAS SNPs and differentially methylated loci.

In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, we investigated the relationship between the extent of differential accessibility of peaks (measured by False Discovery Rate (FDR)) and their 1) compositions, 2) enrichment in OA GWAS SNPs, and 3) enrichment in OA DML.

Moreover, we have previously proposed that ETS-1 may be involved in OA based on our DML study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Taken together, the motif enrichment analysis of the differentially accessible regions in the damaged tissues is consistent with the hypothesis that the transcriptional program for chondrocyte differentiation may be disrupted during OA progression, and suggests that cell type-specific enhancers may be dysregulated through the ETS and bZIP family transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Integrative transcriptomics and epigenomics analysis reveals pathways involved in OA</title><p id="Par15">To evaluate the effects of the dysregulated regulatory regions on gene expression in OA, we reanalyzed the RNA-seq dataset from a different cohort that used the same disease model (i.e. oLT vs. iMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and integrated it with the differentially accessible regions identified in this study (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

In conclusion, our integrative analysis of ATAC-seq and publicly available RNA-seq datasets indicates that dysregulated chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification are associated with OA progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">Conventional epigenomic profiling at the chromatin level, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and DNase-seq, is informative in providing insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of gene expression. However, applying these methods to clinically relevant tissue is less feasible due to the requirement of large number of cells. Especially with the cartilage tissues, the limited tissue sampling size and the extracellular matrix make collection of sufficient cells difficult. One major advantage of ATAC-seq is that it can be achieved with only thousands of cells, making the direct chromatin profiling of clinical samples feasible. In this study, we applied ATAC-seq on OA samples to obtain a chromatin accessibility map in articular cartilage, and identified regulatory regions associated with OA. The lack of normal knee tissues due to difficulties associated with collecting them is a limitation for studying OA. However, our previous studies of the pathology and transcriptome showed that the oLT regions are very similar to normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, the oLT regions could serve as a suitable alternative to normal control, which could also reduce the inter-individual variations.</p><p id="Par18">Our strategy of integrating the epigenomic data of clinically relevant tissues with the publicly available genetic and transcriptomic data allowed us to better understand how the identified loci may contribute to OA pathogenesis. Most of these accessible chromatin regions are annotated enhancers and we linked them to their putative target genes using public datasets. Previous studies have suggested the potential role of OA-associated epigenetic changes within enhancers in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. With this enhancer-gene map in chondrocyte, we can now better interpret the previously identified OA GWAS SNPs or OA differential methylated loci located lie outside of the coding regions. For example, we have verified 7 OA associated SNPs (rs10851630, rs10851631, rs10851632, rs12905608, rs12910752, rs4238326, and rs35246600) reside in 3 chondrocyte accessible enhancers of the predicted target gene <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Since <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> is inactivated in prechondrogenic mesenchyme during the cartilage development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, these SNPs may contribute to OA through disrupting the enhancer of <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> and inappropriately activating a cell differentiation pathway. Consistently, OA genetic risk variants in <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> locus has also been functionally characterized in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In addition, we identified several aberrantly methylated enhancers that may be associated with OA. One example is cg09221159 within the enhancer for <italic>PTEN</italic> gene which is hypomethylated in the damaged cartilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. PTEN is involved in the positive regulation of the apoptotic signaling pathway and its activation is consistent with the notion that chondrocyte apoptosis may contribute to the failure in appropriately maintaining the cartilage. Thus, our analyses show that the chromatin accessibility map can provide an additional layer of evidence for determining which loci, especially those in the non-coding regions, are associated with OA, which may have been ignored in previous studies.</p><p id="Par19">In general, our differential enhancer analysis shows MSC, chondrocyte and osteoblast-specific enhancers are dysregulated in the damaged tissues. Furthermore, motif enrichment analysis of differentially accessible loci has identified many dysregulated transcription factors, the functions of which are known to be in chondrocyte development regulation. For example, the transcription factor Jun-AP1, which is enriched in the more accessible regions of the damaged tissues, is known to regulate chondrocyte hypertrophic morphology, which contributes to longitudinal bone growth, consistent with the notion of endochondral ossification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. A recent study showed injection of adipose-derived stromal cells overexpressing an AP-1 family transcription factor Fra-1 can inhibit OA progression in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Consistently, in our ATAC-seq analysis, other members of AP-1 family (e.g. BATF, FOSL2) also showed enrichment in differentially accessible regions. In addition, if we combine the RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, 15 out of 18 transcription factor genes identified in the motif analysis are expressed (CPM &#8805; 2) in the cartilage tissue, of which <italic>ETS1</italic> is differentially expressed between the two cartilage types. These transcription factors could be candidate targets for further experiments.</p><p id="Par20">In the integrative analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, many dysregulated genes related to lineage differentiation of MSC pathways were observed. For example, we found that <italic>BMPR1B</italic> (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B) is upregulated and both its promoter and enhancer are more accessible in the damaged tissue. Its activation is consistent with the ossification pathway activation, since it encodes a transmembrane serine kinase that binds to BMP ligands that positively regulate endochondral ossification and abnormal chondrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Consistently, an osteoblast marker gene <italic>MSX2</italic> (Msh Homeobox 2) involved in promoting osteoblast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, is upregulated and both its promoter and enhancer are more accessible in the damaged tissue, suggesting the osteoblast differentiation may be activated in OA. Furthermore, we found <italic>ROR2</italic> (receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 2) is down-regulated and its enhancers are less accessible in the damaged samples. Since it is required for cartilage development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, it suggests that the normal chondrocyte development and cartilage formation may be compromised in OA. Consistently, we have also determined <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic>, which are known to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, are upregulated. In summary, our ATAC-seq data and integrative analyses support the OA model of abnormal MSC differentiation and endochondral ossification over other models, such as inflammatory mediums from the synovium.</p><p id="Par21">The pathogenesis for OA is not yet fully understood, despite multiple genes and pathways that have been characterized to be dysregulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.

A gene is defined as &#8220;consistently dysregulated both at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels&#8221; when it is upregulated (or downregulated) in RNA-seq with more (or less) accessible promoters or enhancers in ATAC-seq (n&#8201;=&#8201;371).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p id="Par37">Enrichr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> was used to identify gene sets enriched in genes implicated in OA.
