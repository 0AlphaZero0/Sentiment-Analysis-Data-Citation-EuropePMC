Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 2 (HSDL2) belongs to the SDR subfamily of oxidoreductases, and it is involved in glioma oncogenesis, as it can promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of HSDL2 in the process of CCA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>HSDL2 expression levels were observed in CCA and adjacent (normal control) tissues by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out. In vitro, we overexpressed HSDL2 in RBE cells (a human CCA cell line) using a stable lentivirus-mediated transduction strategy. We then used quantitative real-time-PCR and Western blotting methods to detect the efficiency of HSDL2 overexpression. Cell proliferation was assessed using a Celigo Image Cytometer, MTT assays, and the expression of PCNA. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis, caspase3/7 activity, and the expression of the apoptotic markers BCL-2 and BAX.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We observed a downregulation of HSDL2 in CCA tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus data analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that HSDL2 could be an excellent efficacy biomarker for CCA. In vitro, HSDL2 overexpression largely suppressed the proliferation of RBE cells. In addition, apoptosis was induced by HSDL2 overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the data analysis indicated that, compared with adjacent tissues, HSDL2 was downregulated in CCA tissues, and overexpressing HSDL2 in CCA cells suppressed growth and proliferation, which involved activating apoptosis.

TCGA data on HSDL2 that could be used for expression analysis were extracted. The results of data analysis indicated that HSDL2 was significantly downregulated in CCA tissues compared to adjacent tissues (fragments of kilobase of exon per million: 11.21&#177;1.177 vs 33.91&#177;1.933, fold change =3.02, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-11-7133">Figure 1A</xref>).

HSDL2 was mainly expressed in the nucleus, and to a certain extent in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-11-7133">Figure 2</xref>).

Similarly, overexpression efficiency was further determined in RBE cells transfected with LV-HSDL2 or LV-Control via Western blotting. The Western blotting results suggested that LV-HSDL2 efficiently increased HSDL2 expression in RBE cells at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-11-7133">Figure 3B</xref> and C). Taken together, the LV-HSDL2 strategy efficiently increased HSDL2 expression in RBE cells.</p></sec><sec><title>HSDL2 overexpression significantly blocked cell proliferation in RBE cells</title><p>To verify the effect of HSDL2 on cell proliferation, we used a Celigo Image Cytometer, MTT assay, and PCNA expression analysis.

Significant inhibition of cell proliferation was detected in RBE cells transfected with LV-HSDL2 rather than LV-Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-11-7133">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In addition, the number of RBE cells transfected with LV-HSDL2 hardly increased on the fourth and fifth days. Additionally, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ott-11-7133">Figure 5A and B</xref>, the MTT assay results indicated significant inhibition of proliferation of RBE cells transfected with LV-HSDL2. Moreover, PCNA was suppressed by overexpressed HSDL2 in RBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ott-11-7133">Figure 6</xref>). In general, the results implied that HSDL2 was vital for RBE cell proliferation, indicating that HSDL2 might suppress CCA progression based on the deceleration of cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>HSDL2 overexpression activated apoptosis in RBEcells</title><p>The inhibition of cell proliferation by HSDL2 overexpres-sion may result from increased cell death. Consequently, apoptosis in RBE cells infected with LV-HSDL2 or LV-Control was assessed by annexin V&#8211;APC apoptosis detection, caspase 3/7 activity determination, and the mRNA/protein expression of BAX/BCL-2. There were more apoptotic cells among RBE cells infected with LV-HSDL2 rather than LV-Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ott-11-7133">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Similarly, the activity of caspase-3/7 increased in RBE cells infected with LV-HSDL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ott-11-7133">Figure 7C</xref>). In RBE cells with overexpression of HSDL2, BAX mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased and BCL-2 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ott-11-7133">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Peroxisomes are organelles that are surrounded by a single membrane and are found in almost all eukaryotic cells.
