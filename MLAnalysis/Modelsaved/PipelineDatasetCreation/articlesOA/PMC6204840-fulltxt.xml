Traditionally, such approaches have largely relied on random mutagenesis and display formats, which fail to address related critical attributes of the antibody, such as effector functions or biophysical stability. We have developed a structure- and network-based framework to interrogate the engagement of IgG with multiple Fc receptors (FcRn, C1q, TRIM21, Fc&#947;RI, Fc&#947;RIIa/b, Fc&#947;RIIIa) simultaneously. Using this framework, we identified features that govern Fc-FcRn interactions and identified multiple distinct pathways for enhancing FcRn binding in a pH-specific manner. Network analysis provided a novel lens to study the allosteric impact of half-life-enhancing Fc mutations on Fc&#947;R engagement, which occurs distal to the FcRn binding site. Applying these principles, we engineered a panel of unique Fc variants that enhance FcRn binding while maintaining robust biophysical properties and wild type-like binding to activating receptors. An antibody harboring representative Fc designs demonstrates a half-life improvement of &gt;&#160;9 fold in transgenic mice and &gt;&#160;3.5 fold in cynomolgus monkeys, and maintains robust effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibody</kwd><kwd>half-life</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>structure-guided engineering</kwd><kwd>neonatal Fc receptor</kwd><kwd>FcRn</kwd><kwd>effector functions</kwd><kwd>amino acid interaction network</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Visterra Inc</named-content></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Visterra, Inc.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies are a preferred treatment modality, particularly in cancer and autoimmune diseases, with more than 50 approved antibodies and more than 500 molecules in various stages of clinical development.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref></sup> The success of antibodies in disease intervention is, in part, due to their high level of specificity, relative safety, and long circulating half-life. The circulating half-life of immunoglobulin G (IgG), roughly 10&#8211;21&#160;days depending on IgG isotype and attributes of the variable region,<sup><xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup> is attributed to association with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)<sup><xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup> leading to antibody recycling and minimal endosomal degradation. FcRn plays a key role in serum IgG homeostasis as well as in placental transfer of IgG molecules from mother to fetus.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup> Following pinocytosis, the acidic environment of the early endosome allows for binding of IgG (as well as albumin) to FcRn, which provides protection from degradation and facilitates trafficking of IgG back to the extracellular environment, where the molecules dissociate back into circulation upon exposure to physiological pH.</p><p>With the increasing use of antibodies as therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of diseases, there has been interest in developing antibodies with extended half-life, especially in the context of the prevention or treatment of chronic diseases in which an antibody must be administered repetitively. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of an antibody is primarily responsible for binding to FcRn to facilitate antibody recycling. Ghetie <italic>et al</italic>. were among the earliest to propose that the half-life of antibodies could be extended through modification of the Fc domain to promote FcRn interaction, and they demonstrated that enhancing the binding of a mouse IgG1-derived Fc fragment to mouse FcRn at pH 6.0 by 3.5-fold increased the serum persistence of the antibody approximately 1.6-fold.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup></p><p>Since these initial reports by Ghetie et al., several groups have reported enhancement of <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of therapeutic IgG molecules by introducing alterations in the Fc region of IgG to promote the Fc-FcRn interaction in the acidic environment of the endosome.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> The FcRn affinity-enhancing mutants in these studies were identified from phage display coupled with directed mutagenesis,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> alanine scanning,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup> or, in select cases, from molecular modeling and rational design.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> The prototypical example of an FcRn affinity-enhancing Fc mutant is the M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) mutation which, when incorporated into motavizumab IgG1, is able to extend serum half-life in humans by more than four-fold.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> In these studies, the Fc was primarily optimized for FcRn binding. However, the Fc of IgG binds to various other receptors, such as Fc&#947;RI, Fc&#947;RIIa, Fc&#947;RIIb, Fc&#947;RIII, C1q and TRIM21, and these interactions mediate various effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization (ADIN). As such, to maintain appropriate effector function of the wild type IgG, any Fc domain engineered for enhanced FcRn binding or half-life extension must be assessed in the context of its impact on the various antibody effector functions. Indeed, it has been reported that the Fc variant YTE has lower thermal stability<sup><xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup> and lower ADCC potential<sup><xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> compared to antibodies containing a native Fc domain.</p><p>We developed a structural- and network-based framework to interrogate the interaction of the Fc domain with FcRn at neutral and acidic pH.

The interaction networks of mutations were mapped, and select mutations were combined and assessed for binding to FcRn and other Fc receptors.

Inspection of the structure showed that both the alpha and beta subunits of the FcRn molecule participate in binding to the Fc-domain, making contact with the CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc, with the primary interaction being mediated by the alpha-subunit on FcRn and the CH2 domain on the Fc. The pH-specific nature of binding is driven by histidine residues at positions 310 and 435 (Kabat numbering) on the antibody Fc, which undergo protonation at acidic pH and make critical contacts with glutamate at position 115 and aspartate at position 130. Mutation of either of the two histidine residues significantly reduces the binding affinity of Fc with FcRn.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> In addition to His310 and His435, several other Fc residues are involved in making molecular contacts with FcRn (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19420862.2018.1490119-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<italic>top</italic>) Structural view of human IgG CH2-CH3 domains (<italic>yellow</italic>) in complex with human FcRn &#945; (<italic>green</italic>) and &#946;2M (<italic>cyan</italic>) domains.

Given that amino acid residues involved in FcRn binding, such as M252 and I253, are located on the 250-helix, the observed displacement of the helix is expected to influence the affinity of Fc for FcRn.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, the difference in the relative orientation of CH2 with respect to CH3 highlights the dynamic nature of the CH2-CH3 domains at different pHs (Supplementary Figure 1).<sup><xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup> Recently, deuterium exchange studies of human Fc were performed in the absence or presence of FcRn. The studies were performed at both acidic and neutral pHs and showed that FcRn binding to the Fc domain limits exchange on contacting Fc residues. Further, the 250-helix residues demonstrated enhanced deuterium exchange at low pH in the absence of FcRn, suggesting that a pH-specific conformational change occurred within this region.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref></sup></p><p>Analysis of the strength of engagement of Fc with FcRn at acidic pH reveals that human FcRn binds to the human Fc domain with weak affinity (&gt;&#160;600&#160;nM).

Indeed, some of these identified positions have been previously investigated, such as within the half-life enhancing mutants YTE,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref></sup> LS (M428L/N434S),<sup><xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> AAA (T307A/E380A/N434A),<sup><xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref></sup> QL (T250Q/M428L)<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref></sup> and V308P.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref></sup> In our analysis, we first investigated the role of each residue <italic>in silico</italic>, and identified the network of interactions mediated by that residue (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Specific sets of mutations were rationally designed to enhance both hydrophobic interactions within the core of the Fc-FcRn interface and polar and electrostatic interactions at its periphery. The impact of each mutation on its interaction network was assessed and, when needed, additional mutations were introduced to maintain the stability of the protein.

More than 30 distinct positions were chosen for substitutions. Combinations of the individual mutations were designed based on the following guiding principles: 1) avoiding introduction of large clusters of charge or hydrophobicity to avoid destabilizing the IgG fold and to minimize binding to solvent ions;<sup><xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref></sup> 2) incorporating diversity into the types of interactions, <italic>i.e</italic>., not just enhancing electrostatic or hydrophobic contacts; and 3) dispersing mutations across the CH2 and CH3 domains. Based on these considerations, more than 150 unique mutant combinations were designed and experimentally evaluated.</p><p>Designed Fc mutants were incorporated into the IgG1 Fc domain of either the actoxumab<sup><xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref></sup> or motavizumab<sup><xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref></sup> antigen-binding fragment (Fab), which were recombinantly expressed and evaluated for binding to human FcRn by biolayer interferometry. Motavizumab was chosen as the model antibody for this study primarily because its half-life has been well characterized in transgenic mice, cynomolgus monkeys and in humans. Further, its half-life extending variant that includes the YTE mutation has also been studied in mice, monkeys and humans. Motavizumab has a half-life of 19&#8211;34&#160;days<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> in humans and actoxumab has a half-life of 26&#160;&#177;&#160;8.4&#160;days<sup><xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref></sup> in humans. Two different approaches were employed: recombinant (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged FcRn capture on NiNTA biosensors with IgG as the analyte, and IgG captured on anti-CH1 biosensors with recombinant FcRn as the analyte. The assays were used to quantify binding at pH 6.0 followed by dissociation at pH 6.0 and subsequently dissociation at pH 7.4, as well as binding and dissociation solely at pH 7.4 (Supplementary Figure 2). Fc variants incorporating mutations at Pro257 and Val308 had high affinity at pH 6.0, but displayed markedly slower off-rates at pH 7.4 (<italic>data not shown</italic>) and were not considered for further analyses.

</p><p>Enhancement of FcRn binding affinity was achieved by mutation of centrally-located Fc-FcRn interface residues to improve hydrophobic interactions, and mutation of peripheral residues to improve electrostatic and polar interactions. The Fc residues T256, T307, H285, N286 and N315 located on the periphery of the interface were mutated to polar and charged amino acids to complement the positively charged N-terminal region of the FcRn &#946;-domain. Additionally, Q311 and L309, both located at the Fc-FcRn interface, were mutated to hydrophobic residues. However, aromatic amino acids were avoided to minimize the impact on thermal stability. Although a Met amino acid substitution at residue 311 was found to be beneficial, it was not included in any final designs due to the possibility of <italic>in vivo</italic> oxidation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref></sup> Residues M252, I253 and S254, which are involved in FcRn binding, are part of the 250-helix which exhibits conformational flexibility at various pHs. We hypothesized that reduced conformational flexibility would lead to better exposure of these residues and improve the shape complementarity between Fc and FcRn. Residues that are part of, or in contact with, the 250-helix (such as P257, A378, V308) and are not found on the Fc-FcRn interface were mutated to restrict or dampen the movement of the helix. Interestingly, the 250-helix contact residues M428 (part of the LS mutant) and A378 are naturally present as Leu and Thr, respectively, in the mouse Fc domain and an analysis of the crystal structure suggests these residues influence the 250-helix.</p><sec id="S0002-S2001-S3001"><title>Biophysical characterization of the lead Fc designs</title><p>The biophysical attributes of a modified motavizumab containing the designed Fc variants were experimentally assessed.

Inspection of the structural model of this specific design revealed that several negatively charged residues (D256, D285, and E258) are in close proximity to each other, which may be causing repulsive electrostatic forces that destabilize the CH2 domain. Indeed, introduction of a basic amino acid at T307, which is located proximal to the negatively charged cluster, enhanced the thermal stability of the domain. Therefore, a T307R mutation was introduced into many of the designs to help balance the surface charge. Indeed, the T<sub>m</sub> increased to 62.3&#176;C when T307R was introduced to DF190. Despite T307R having a negative impact on FcRn binding as a single point mutation, it did not affect FcRn binding in the context of DF190 and provided improved thermal stability.</p><p>To assess the stability of the designed Fc domains, motavizumab variants incorporating DF183, DF197, DF213, DF215, DF228, YTE, and LS mutations were subjected to a 30-day accelerated stability study, and compared to wild type motavizumab (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3C</xref>). All Fc variants stored at 40&#176;C had similar elution times as the samples stored at 4&#176;C. There was a decrease in monomer content for some of the Fc variants, including YTE and LS. Overall, the Fc designs (DF183, DF197, DF213, DF215 and DF228) behaved similarly to wild type Fc when subjected to temperature stress, with some indication that the variants might exhibit greater stability than the wild type protein.

</p><p>While binding to Fc receptors is necessary for activities such as ADCC (Fc&#947;RIIIa), CDC (C1q), and ADIN (TRIM21), binding alone is not sufficient to mediate these activities. For example, a hexameric assembly of Fc is required to elicit CDC activity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref></sup> The Fc hexameric assembly involves formation of an Fc-Fc interface, and residues involved in the formation of this interface partially overlap with the FcRn binding site. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the capacity of our designs to not only bind to Fc receptors, but also mediate effector functions. Rituximab containing designed Fc variants (DF183, DF197, DF213, DF215, DF228, YTE, LS and wild type) were evaluated for ADCC and CDC activity as described in Methods. The results confirmed that Fc designs DF183, DF213, DF215, DF228 and LS retained potent ADCC and CDC activity and showed a slight enhancement in CDC activity.

With increasing use of antibodies as therapeutics, there has been an enhanced focus on not just selecting an optimal Fab, but also combining it with an appropriate Fc for desired half-life and effector functions. Since the elucidation of the role of FcRn in IgG homeostasis, several attempts have been made to modulate the binding affinity of IgG to FcRn. While not all FcRn-affinity enhancing mutations resulted in increased serum persistence, Fc variants, such as YTE and LS, have resulted in enhanced half-life in non-human primates and humans, validating that such efforts can modulate antibody half-life. In this study, the availability of structural information of the human FcRn-Fc complex has enabled: 1) identification of molecular features governing Fc-FcRn interaction; 2) mapping the interaction networks of amino acids in the Fc domain; and 3) a systematic investigation into the impact of introduction of specific residues on interaction with FcRn, as well as other amino acids in their interaction networks. Using this approach, we designed a broad panel of Fc variants that possess improved binding affinity to FcRn at endosomal pH and confers enhanced half-life in transgenic mouse models and cynomolgus monkeys. Identification of multiple Fc variants that enhance circulating half-life provides flexibility in choosing a different Fc that may be more compatible with different Fabs. Further, in line with the engineering approach of combining mutations that are unlikely to destabilize the antibody or disrupt its interaction with other receptors, the designed Fc variants retained the biophysical properties and effector functions of the parental IgG.</p><p>In recent years, there have been attempts to understand how the sequence and biophysical properties of the Fab domain influences the IgG-FcRn interaction and PK. While the primary focus of the structural analysis presented here was understanding the &#8220;cross-talk&#8221; between CH2-CH3 of Fc and FcRn, one key aspect of this analysis was also to address, structurally, the way in which Fc, within the context of a fully assembled antibody, interacts with membrane-associated FcRn (mFcRn). Such an analysis is imperative to understand the relative importance of Fc mutations on governing the overall strength of engagement between antibody and mFcRn. Additionally, such an understanding can help to address the role of the Fab in governing antibody half-life, especially when coupled with existing analyses of Fab properties. Of note, the sequence and the structure of the Fc domain of most IgG molecules are highly similar, yet their FcRn affinities vary and are either the same or weaker than that of the Fc domain alone.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref></sup> This observation suggests that the Fab domains of the IgG molecule play either a passive or, in some cases, a detrimental role in mFcRn-IgG interactions. Some, but not all, of these differences can be ascribed to physiochemical characteristics of the variable sequences.<sup><xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref></sup> In addition, the hinge domain that links the Fab to Fc domain also plays a role in the mFcRn-IgG affinity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref></sup> Interestingly, the protein A/G binding site on the Fc domain overlaps with the FcRn binding site, yet neither the variable or hinge domain of an IgG molecule influence the binding of an IgG to protein A/G protein.</p><p>Facilitating this analysis, the crystal structure of the rat FcRn-Fc complex has been reported, as well as the structure of a human Fc-FcRn-human serum albumin ternary complex.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref></sup> Since only the soluble domain of FcRn was used in these studies, the structures do not fully elucidate the role of the Fab domain in mediating the mFcRn-IgG interactions. The short length of the linker peptide (ten amino acids) between the Fc-binding domain and the transmembrane domain requires that the Fc-binding domain of FcRn be in close proximity to the membrane bilayer if the two molecules are to interact. Therefore, the cell membrane and its influence on the IgG-FcRn interaction must be taken into consideration when attempting to design IgG molecules with enhanced binding to mFcRn.</p><p>In conjunction with available structural data on Fc-FcRn interactions, we examined possible rationalizations for the observed differences in the context of IgG binding to mFcRn. Previously, two models of IgG engagement with mFcRn have been proposed: the &#8220;standing up&#8221; and &#8220;lying down&#8221; positioning of engaged Fc, relative to mFcRn (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>).<sup><xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref></sup> Since albumin and IgG molecules can bind simultaneously to membrane-positioned FcRn, we propose that the IgG molecule is likely to bind in an inverted orientation, the &#8220;standing up&#8221; orientation, with its Fab domains close to the membrane bilayer surface and possibly, in certain circumstances, interacting with the membrane (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). We note that this close membrane proximity of Fab domains to the cell membrane offers a possible structure-based explanation for the reduced affinity to membrane-bound, native mFcRn of most IgG molecules and Fc-fusion proteins, as well as antibodies bound to large antigens.<fig id="F0006" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19420862.2018.1490119-F0006</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><italic>Current best-fit model of IgG-FcRn complex formation</italic>.

This is the only conformation that does not impose a severe steric clash between the Fab domains and the membrane bilayer. Further, only the T-conformation of IgG supports FcRn binding to IgG and HSA simultaneously. The cartoon diagram of the bound HSA molecule shown is based on the crystal structure of its complex with FcRn-Fc complex (PDB ID: 4N0U).</p></caption><graphic content-type="color" xlink:href="kmab-10-07-1490119-g006"/></fig></p><p>One consequence of this analysis relates to the conformational flexibility of the hinge domain of IgG, which allows the Fab domains to access multiple orientations with reference to the Fc domain. For example, in solution IgG can sample not only the canonical Y-shaped conformation, but also T- shaped and intermediate conformations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0052">52</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0053">53</xref></sup> Due to the proximity of the membrane bilayer when Fc is bound to FcRn, the &#8220;standing up&#8221; model likely restricts binding of IgG molecules to the T-shaped conformation, as this would allow minimal steric hindrance with the membrane bilayer. In contrast, other conformations would likely lead to severe steric hindrance (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). In this proposed model, when the antibody is in the T-shaped conformation, the Fab domains are found close to the mFcRn molecule and possibly interact weakly with mFcRn.</p><p>In summary, we developed a structure- and network-based approach to identify molecular features governing Fc-FcRn interactions and used this approach to identify multiple Fc variants that enhance FcRn binding at endosomal pH. Incorporation of these Fc variants on control IgGs significantly decreased clearance rates (by up to 83&#160;%) and enhanced elimination half-life of antibodies (&gt;&#160;3.9-fold) in cynomolgus monkeys and human FcRn transgenic mice. It has been previously shown that incorporation of YTE on motavizumab resulted in a 2&#8211;3.7-fold increase in half-life in cynomolgus monkeys and a half-life of up to 100&#160;days in humans.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> We anticipate that incorporation of the Fc variants described in this manuscript will result in comparable or even improved half-life in humans (as compared to YTE), while maintaining the desired effector functions of the antibody such as ADCC and CDC. Antibodies with intact effector function and significantly enhanced half-life would enable less frequent administration of antibody-based therapeutics for chronic indications. In addition, these long-acting antibodies could be used to provide season-long protection from infectious diseases such as seasonal influenza. We also highlight the role of the Fab in influencing the IgG-FcRn interaction by proposing a model where the orientation of the antibody bound to mFcRn causes the Fab to be proximal to, and possibly engage with, the endosomal membrane and thereby influence the IgG-mFcRn interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><italic>Structure and network model of Fc-FcRn complex</italic>.

Liquid was aspirated from the wells and polyclonal rabbit anti-human C1q (Agilent catalog # A013602-1) was diluted in PBST-BSA to a final concentration of 1&#160;&#181;g/mL and 100&#160;&#181;L was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Polyclonal swine anti-rabbit-HRP (Agilent catalog # P021702-2) was diluted to 0.5&#160;&#181;g/mL in PBST-BSA and 100&#160;&#181;L was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed six times with PBST and then developed with TMB solution as already described. The values of antibody concentration (x-axis) and absorbance at 450&#160;nm (y-axis) were fit to a four-parameter logistic regression (4PL) curve. The curve fit was then used to determine the EC50 (the midpoint of the 4PL) for each Fc variant.</p><p>Binding to TRIM21 was measured by ELISA following the same protocol as C1q with the following alterations. The capture protein was TRIM21-GST (Antibodies Online catalog # ABIN1323621) and the reagents used to detect the captured antigen were a combination of two rabbit anti-TRIM21 antibodies (AbCam catalog # ab91423 and ab96800) that were mixed together in PBST-BSA at a final concentration of 1&#160;&#181;g/mL.</p><p><italic>Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity</italic>. ADCC assays were performed using the ADCC Reporter Bioassay with CD20<sup>+</sup> WIL2-S target cells from Promega (catalog # G7014) following the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. All Fc designs were tested in the context of the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab. Antibody concentrations were titrated five-fold ranging from 5&#160;&#181;g/mL to 0.0016&#160;&#181;g/mL. The values of antibody concentration (x-axis) and fold induction of the luminescence read on Biotek luminescence reader (y-axis) were fit to a four-parameter logistic regression (4PL) curve. The curve fit was then used to determine the EC<sub>50</sub> (the midpoint of the 4PL) and the maximum induction for each Fc design.</p><p>CDC assays were performed using CD20<sup>+</sup> Raji cells and low toxicity guinea pig complement (Cedarlane Laboratories Product # CL4051). Complement-induced cell lysis was measured using the CytoTox 96&#174; Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay from Promega (catalog # G1780) following the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. All Fc variants were tested in the context of rituximab. The antibody concentrations were titrated four-fold ranging from 20&#160;&#181;g/mL to 0.005&#160;&#181;g/mL and incubated with 20,000 target cells per well at 37&#176;C for 30&#160;minutes. Complement was then added to the cells and incubated for an additional 2&#160;hours at 37&#176;C. Additionally, cell lysis buffer (provided with the CytoTox kit) was added to control wells to measure the maximal cell lysis. A negative control antibody, motavizumab, was used to measure the background signal of an irrelevant antibody. The background signal and maximal lysis signal were used to calculate the percent of cell lysis for each Fc design. The values of antibody concentration (x-axis) and percent lysis (y-axis) were fit to a four-parameter logistic regression curve. The curve fit was then used to determine the EC<sub>50</sub> (concentration needed to obtain 50&#160;% lysis) and the maximal lysis for each Fc design.</p><p><italic>Quantitative Serum IgG ELISA</italic>. To evaluate the serum concentration of human antibody in the serum of Tg276 mice, a quantitative anti-human ELISA was performed using the Human IgG ELISA quantitation kit from Bethyl Labs (catalog # E80-104) following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. To evaluate the serum concentration of human antibody in cynomolgus monkey serum, a quantitative anti-human ELISA with minimal cross reactivity to cynomolgus IgG was performed. Unlabeled goat anti-human IgG (Southern Biotechnology # 2049&#8211;01) was diluted to 2&#160;&#181;g/mL and ELISA plates were incubated with 100&#160;&#181;L/well overnight at 4&#176;C. The following morning all liquid was aspirated from the wells and the plates were blocked with 200&#160;&#181;L of PBST-BSA for 1 hour. A standard curve of purified antibody was included on each plate ranging from 1000 to 1&#160;ng/mL in PBST-BSA. All serum samples were serially titrated 1:2 across the plate starting at a 1:10 dilution and ending at a 1:10,240 dilution. The capture step was performed for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed three times with PBST. Biotinylated Goat Anti-Human IgG (Southern Biotechnology # 2049&#8211;01) was diluted 1:20,000 in PBST-BSA, 100&#160;&#181;L was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed six times with PBST. Streptavidin-HRP (Southern Biotechnology, 7100&#8211;05) was diluted 1:8,000 in PBST, 100&#160;&#181;L was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed six times with PBST and then developed with TMB solution as already described.</p><p><italic>Pharmacokinetic experiments in transgenic mice expressing human FcRn</italic>. To evaluate if the enhanced binding of Fc designs to human FcRn translated to increased serum persistence and longer circulating half-life life, a PK study of IgGs containing the different Fc variants was performed in B6.Cg-Fcgrt<sup>tm1Dcr</sup> Tg(CAG-FCGRT)276Dcr/DcrJ (Tg276) transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock number 004919). Tg276hemizygous FcRn transgenic mice were dosed with 2&#160;mg/kg of mAb intravenously. Each mAb group had 4 mice/group. Retro-orbital blood collection was performed at several time points between 1 hour and 21&#160;days, and IgG titers were determined by quantitative ELISA as described in the section above. PK parameters were determined for each group of mice with a non-compartmental model using Phoenix WinNonlin version 7.0 (Certara).</p><p><italic>Pharmacokinetic experiments in cynomolgus monkeys</italic>. In a non-GLP PK study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, samples of motavizumab containing selected Fc designs were evaluated for persistence in serum. Three male (3.1 to 4.5&#160;kg) and six female (2.4 to 3.2&#160;kg) cynomolgus monkeys aged 3.5 to 3.7&#160;years were divided into three groups. Each group consisted of one male and two female monkeys that were administered a single slow bolus intravenous injection of motavizumab, motavizumab DF215 or motavizumab DF228; the animals were then observed over a 35-day period. Mortality checks, clinical observations and body weight were monitored during the course of study. Blood samples for PK evaluations were collected on day &#8722;7, day &#8722;1 and after dosing on day 1 at 0 (up to 10&#160;minutes after completion of dose formulation administration), 1, 4, and 24&#160;hours and additionally on days 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35. Human IgG levels in plasma were determined by ELISA and the PK parameters were determined for each group of monkeys with a non-compartmental model using Phoenix WinNonlin version 7.0 (Certara).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2730"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="kmab-10-07-1490119-s001.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d37e150" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S0004"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FcRn &#8211; Neonatal Fc receptor</p><p>ADCC &#8211; Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity</p><p>CDC &#8211; Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity</p><p>ADCP &#8211; Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis</p><p>ADIN &#8211; Antibody-Dependent Intracellular Neutralization</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Danielle Wisheart, Jason Kong, Joseph Columbus and Bharathi Sundaresh for their technical assistance and Greg Christianson at The Jackson Laboratories for half-life assessments in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest</title><p>Authors are employees of Visterra and own equity.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>JM.</given-names></name></person-group>
