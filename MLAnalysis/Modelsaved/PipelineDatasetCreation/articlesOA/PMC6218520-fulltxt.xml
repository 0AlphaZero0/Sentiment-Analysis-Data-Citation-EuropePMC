PLE involve in signal transduction and highly catalyze hydrolysis. Therefore, the expression level of PLE most probably exist age and breed difference and lead to significant differences of pharmacology and physiology. Four age groups of Tongcheng (TC) and Large White (LW) pigs were selected to explore PLE breed and age differences, and it was found that PLE mRNA was most abundant in liver in both breeds. In liver, PLE levels and hydrolytic activities increased with age, and PLE levels (except for 3 month) and the hydrolytic activities were higher in LW than in TC across all age groups. Abundance of PLE isoenzymes was obvious different between breeds and among age groups. The most abundant PLE isoenzyme in LW and TC pigs was PLE-A1 (all age groups) and PLE-B9 (three early age groups) or PLE-G3 (adult groups), respectively. 103 new PLE isoenzymes were found, and 55 high-frequency PLE isoenzymes were accordingly classified into seven categories (A-G). The results of this research provide a necessary basis not only for clinical medication of pigs but also for pig breeding purposes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Funder: China National Natural Science Foundation of China, Number:31372484; Funder: the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China, Number: 2012FFB02906; Funder: the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Number: 2662015PY149</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Carboxylesterases(E.C.3.1.1.1) belong to the serine hydrolase family, they catalyze the hydrolysis of endogenous and exogenous compounds containing carboxylic acid esters, amides, and thioesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Studies on human and rodents have found that carboxylesterases control the metabolism and detoxification of nearly one-third of the drugs ingested. Expression level of human and mouse carboxylesterases has been proven to be age-related, the expression profiles and activities of carboxylesterases have a very significant impact on metabolism, efficacy, and safety of drugs; additionally, their expression spectrum and racial differences have become the basis for clinical medication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The expression of pig carboxylesterases is observed in various organs, being the most abundant in the liver, hence, known as PLE. Only the trimer structure of PLE has enzyme active, and in the very early studies, the subunits of the trimer structure were roughly classed as &#945;-, &#946;- and &#947;-subunits according to the difference in molecular weight and isoelectric point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. According to isoelectric point, enzyme kinetics, and substrate specificity, Junge and Heymann(1979) isolated four kinds of PLE trimmers, named &#947;&#947;&#947;, &#945;&#947;&#947;, &#945;&#945;&#947;, and &#945;&#945;&#945;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. PLE extracted from pig liver is a mixture of multiple isozymes of PLE, and it is difficult to obtain a single and highly purified enzyme using physical or chemical methods, because of the high degree of similarity of physical and chemical properties among PLE isozymes. Fortunately, not only a single PLE of high purity has been obtained by genetic engineering methods but also the cDNA sequence and the polypeptide sequence of different subunits of PLE and differences in the enzymatic activity have been documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Structure and genomics of PLE gene families have also been studied by our research group. The PLE gene spans 30&#8201;kb containing 14 exons, most of which are highly conserved, and 13 introns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The full length of PLE encoding cDNA has 1698bp, and it encodes a polypeptide of 566 amino acid (AA) residues. The N-terminal is an 18 AA peptide signal-sequence and C-terminal tetrapeptides HAEL (His-Ala-Glu-Leu) are considered as an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The C-terminal tetra peptides HXEL bind to the KDEL receptor, thus locating the carboxylate ester in the endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. PLE possesses high hydrolytic activity of rich sources, broad substrate specificity, and especially high enantioselectivity and stereoselectivity of hydrolysis, which makes PLE one of the most important hydrolases in the field of organic synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, whereby for one century the study of PLE has focused on its application to organic synthesis.

The small intestine is the main organ for absorption of nutrients and other exogenous substances; intestinal PLE may be related to the absorption of esters in the intestine. As reported, mice carboxylesterases1 in intestine can regulate assembly, secretion, and clearance of chylomicrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Some gut harmful toxic substances may also be hydrolyzed and detoxified by PLE. The skin acts as a natural barrier of the body; the skin PLE may be related to detoxification of some toxic substances. In conclusion, tissue and organ distribution characteristics of PLE suggested that PLE not only plays an important role in the metabolism of ester drugs but also plays an important role in some physiological processes and in the process of self-protection.</p><p id="Par21">In this study, more than 800 PLE cDNA positive clones from the liver of 24 individuals of two different breeds in four age groups were obtained and sequenced. According to the classification method of Br&#252;sehaber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, 108 isoenzymes of PLE were registered, among which were the previously reported PLE1, PLE2, PLE5, PLE 6 and APLE. We found 39 isoenzymes in more than two individuals and 19 were found in the two breeds. In one individual, there were as many as about 15 isoenzymes; considering that active PLE is a random trimer of any subunit, there will be as many as about 120 PLE isoenzymes in one individual, which suggested that the roles of PLE in pigs should not be ignored. Since the number of new found PLE isoenzymes is far more than the 7 previously reported ones, thus, according to the similarity of 25 variable sites on AAs, the 55 high frequency isoforms were divided into 7 groups (A~G), and within the same group, different members were specified by Arabia digital. A blast search of cDNA sequence with the 13th to 14th exons of PLE in NCBI yielded 14 PLE sequences of cDNA, and 14 PLE isoenzymes&#160;(Supplementary material) were also found in this study, which suggests the credibility of the PLE isoforms found in this study.</p><p id="Par22">The two breeds of pigs under study showed obvious differences both in PLE abundance and PLE profile. In order to explore the significance of these differences, major PLE isoenzymes (PLE-A1, B9, G3, G5, C4, and others) were expressed, and the activities of these recombinant PLEs were measured by p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA), which is the universal substrate for PLE. The results showed that the hydrolysis activity of PLE-B9 was the highest, which was about two-fold that of PLE-A1 and about four-fold that of PLE-G3, PLE-G5, and PLE-C4 (submitted). Combining the differences in PLE total amount, isoenzyme type, hydrolysis activity, and abundance between breeds and among age groups, if one specific clinical pig drug could be hydrolyzed by PLE, it is reasonable to speculate that the hydrolysis of the drug would be different between TC and LW pigs and these differences will lead to differences in efficacy and toxicity of the same drug in two breeds and at different ages. If hydrolysis of the drugs abolished or decreased the drug efficacy, TC pigs would be more vulnerable than LW pigs, and vice versa. Furthermore, the differences may also explain why PLE hydrolysis activity was not always consistent with mRNA levels and protein abundance.</p><p id="Par23">For both breeds, PLE-G5 increased significantly with growth (1-month to 3-month), and PLE-G3 increased significantly during maturity (adult), suggesting that PLE-G3 and PLE-G5 may play an important role during growth and maturity, respectively. The significance and regulation mechanism of the profile observed need further study.</p><p id="Par24">The higher level and activity of PLE in the livers of LW pigs than in TC pigs may lead to the higher metabolism level of related compounds, which probably explain the higher growth rate of the LW pigs. Carboxylesterases1 gene deletion reportedly leads to obesity and fatty liver in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which suggested that a lower PLE level may be the cause of the higher fat accumulation rate in TC pig. it was also reported that the same pathogen PRRSV induced obvious differences of inflammation response between TC and LW pigs, and the LW pig showed a much higher inflammatory response against PRRSV than TC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, which suggested that PLE probably play an important role in inflammation response procedure through hydrolysis of some inflammatory factors.</p><p id="Par25">However, because of the limits of pigs population, the same amount of male and female pigs in each group which didn&#8217;t have blood relationship through at least three generations were difficult to satisfy. So the gender differences of PLE weren&#8217;t researched. In addition, according to the report of Zhu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> that sex seems to be an unlikely factor contributing to the regulation of carboxylesterase 1 and carboxylesterase 2 in human and mouse, it suggested that the gender differences of pig may not impact on the level of PLE very much. Because of the high degree of sequence homology and analogously physical and chemical properties among PLE isoenzymes, the antibody against specific PLE isoenzyme was difficult to be developed and a purified PLE isoenzyme to be obtained by physical or chemical methods. So the protein level and enzymatic activity of specific PLE isoenzyme was not explored. As demonstrated in this study, PLE showed obvious age and breed difference between TC and LW pigs, but the mechanisms underlying need further studied. In addition, whether PLE could catalyze the hydrolysis of some important pig drugs and affect the drugs clinical efficacy accordingly, the breed difference lead to clinical efficacy difference also need further study.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, the expression level of PLE is closely related to pig age, and there are obvious differences between the LW and TC breeds, which suggests that clinical medication should be adjusted not only according to the age of the pig but also according to the breed. Furthermore, the growth rate and fat accumulation rate in pigs may be related to PLE, and thus, PLE can be used as a reference target in pig breeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par27">In order to ameliorate the suffering of the pigs and the rabbits, this experiment was performed in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Monitoring Committee of Hubei Province, China, and the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University.</p><p id="Par28">New Zealand white rabbits were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Huazhong Agricultural University.
