TAs require pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme and catalyse the transfer of an amino group from an amino donor to a carbonyl acceptor, thus generating new amines and carbonyls, often with high stereoselectivity. Major efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new TAs and the evolution of known proteins for obtaining biocatalysts with selectivity and robustness fit for preparative biotransformations. To date, more than 60 microbial TAs have been described as potential biocatalysts, of which about 20 have been identified only in the last two years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A number of examples of the evolution by protein engineering of natural TAs into more stable and more selective enzymes, with larger substrate scopes have also been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This endeavor was made possible by the availability of new TA crystal structures that have provided a better insight into the functional mechanisms of these enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, immobilisation of TAs has been shown to enable catalysis under practical conditions (in the presence of co-solvents, stoichiometric amounts of the amine donor) in continuous reactors, where the reaction can be performed with better productivity and long-term stability of the biocatalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Extremophile microorganisms (microbial species withstanding extreme conditions, such as low/high temperatures, low/high pH, high ionic strength and high hydrostatic pressure) have great potential as a source of enzymes that are active under harsh conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In particular, marine microorganisms are known to produce enzymes characterised by outstanding tolerance to organic solvents and high salt concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The recruitment of new enzymes from marine microorganisms as selective and robust biocatalysts is highly attractive. A TA from the halo-adapted bacterium <italic>Halomonas elongata</italic> proved tolerant to the presence of co-solvents up to 20% and showed remarkable stability under operating conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this context, different biocatalytic activities (ketoreductase, esterase, and transaminase) have been reported in marine bacteria, such as <italic>Virgibacillus</italic> sp. 21D, a strain that grows in NaCl concentrations of up to 12%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this current study, a TA gene (<italic>Vb</italic>TA) identified from the genome of <italic>Virgibacillus</italic> sp. 21D was codon optimised and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, however, the protein was entirely found in inclusion bodies under all conditions studied. To address this problem, we successfully adopted a protein engineering approach, based on the mutation of a single residue (T16F) that resulted in sufficiently soluble expression of recombinant <italic>Vb</italic>TA T16F in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

Classification of PLP-dependent enzymes is primarily based on fold type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; e.g., fold type I, also referred to as the &#8216;aspartate aminotransferase superfamily&#8217;, which combines the highest quantity and diversity of members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Transaminases are additionally divided into six classes depending on common structural features and sequence similarity; <italic>Vb</italic>TA, according to its sequence, belongs to fold type I and the class III subgroup. Based on sequence alignments, it was possible to identify three highly conserved residues (see ConSurf analysis, Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) that bind PLP: D24 and Y148, involved in salt bridge and hydrogen bond formation with PLP, respectively, and K273 that forms a Schiff base with PLP (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the small and large binding pockets of <italic>VbT</italic>A.

The halophilic archaeon host <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> was also tested to optimise the marine transaminase expression, without any significant improvement.</p><p id="Par8">While insoluble expression can be due to incompatibility of the host cytoplasmic environment, it is also known that misfolding can be linked to specific mutations in the sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. All fold type-I TAs reported in literature exist as dimers or tetramers and are generally produced as soluble proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, the <italic>VbT</italic>A sequence was further analysed to gain insight into its structure and lack of solubility. Previous structural studies, whereby the active site of a <italic>He</italic>TA homology model was probed by site directed mutagenesis to investigate the enzyme affinity for specific aromatic substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, highlighted that F18 (corresponding to T16 in <italic>VbT</italic>A) is a key active site residue in the catalytic pocket. It forms a strong interaction with a second phenylalanine (F84, contributed by the second monomer), thus stabilizing the compact dimeric structure. <italic>He</italic>-TA F18A was generated at the time to increase the size of the small pocked to shift the activity of the enzyme towards bulky-bulky substrates, however this variant was found to be completely insoluble (data not shown), suggesting that the aromatic side chain at position 16 was essential for the correct folding of the protein. Furthermore, using the program ConSurf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consurf.tau.ac.il">http://consurf.tau.ac.il</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, sequence alignments made with around 500 homologous protein sequences showed that this position is highly conserved for aromatic residues (76.8% Phe, 16.3% Tyr, see Supplementary Figures&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Therefore, based on the hypothesis that dimerisation is critical for solubility, and on the fact that amino acids involved in the structural stabilisation of the functional homodimer must be evolutionary preserved, to some extent, the mutant <italic>Vb</italic>TA T16F was produced.</p><p id="Par9">Expression of the N-terminal His-tagged transaminase was performed in a conventional BL21 DE3 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, transformed with the expression vector pET100-D-TOPO and its expression under different fermentation conditions was compared by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

In order to determine the quaternary arrangement of <italic>Vb</italic>TA T16F, size-exclusion chromatography experiments were carried out, resulting in an estimated MW of 104&#8201;kDa, corresponding to a dimeric quaternary structure (theoretical value 106&#8201;kDa).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of transaminase activity</title><p id="Par10">A standard assay, using (<italic>S</italic>)-1-phenylethylamine as the amino donor and pyruvate as the amino acceptor, was used to determine the transaminase activity of <italic>Vb</italic>TA T16F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

This strain also grows in presence of NaCl concentrations up to 1.5&#8201;M, which may imply halotolerant behavior of its enzymes. As previously observed, enzymes from halotolerant microorganisms are stable in conditions of high ionic strength and co-solvents, which are often crucial for the reaction or storage medium in biocatalysis. Stability towards organic solvents (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was relatively high in most solvents tested; the enzyme, stored at 25&#8201;&#176;C for 2 days in the presence of 20% <italic>(v/v)</italic> methanol (MeOH) maintained 94&#8211;95% of its initial activity.
