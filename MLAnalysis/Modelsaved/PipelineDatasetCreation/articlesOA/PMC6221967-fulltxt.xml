However, the effect of FGR on the immune system, is poorly understood. We used a well-characterized mouse model of FGR in which placental Igf-2 production is lost due to deletion of the placental specific <italic>Igf-2</italic> P<sub>0</sub> promotor. The thymi in such animals were reduced in mass with a ~70% reduction in cellularity. We used single cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq) to analyze 7,264 thymus cells collected at postnatal day 6. We identified considerable heterogeneity among the Cd8/Cd4 double positive cells with one subcluster showing marked upregulation of transcripts encoding a sub-set of proteins that contribute to the surface of the ribosome. The cells from the FGR animals were underrepresented in this cluster. Furthermore, the distribution of cells from the FGR animals was skewed with a higher proportion of immature double negative cells and fewer mature T-cells. Cell cycle regulator transcripts also varied across clusters. The T-cell deficit in FGR mice persisted into adulthood, even when body and organ weights approached normal levels due to catch-up growth. This finding complements the altered immunity found in growth restricted human infants. This reduction in T-cellularity may have implications for adult immunity, adding to the list of adult conditions in which the <italic>in utero</italic> environment is a contributory factor.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Drop-Seq</kwd><kwd>fetal growth restriction</kwd><kwd>T-cell</kwd><kwd>thymus</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>developmental programming</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Wellcome Trust<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000268</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Rosetrees Trust<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000833</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8386"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a serious condition affecting between 3 and 7% of infants in developed nations (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) but can be higher than 40% in low-income nations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The growth restricted infants suffer from an increased risk of a wide variety of acute complications, including necrotizing enterocolitis, perinatal asphyxia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, immunodeficiency, and death (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). FGR is commonly attributed to insufficient fetal nutrients. This may be because either the mother is malnourished, as in the prototypical case of the Dutch Hunger Winter (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), or because the placenta is dysfunctional, leading to poor nutrient transport to the fetus (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Severely growth restricted infants exhibit asymmetric growth wherein resources are reallocated to the fetal brain at the cost of the rest of the body (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), so called &#8220;brain sparing.&#8221; The infants undergo &#8220;catch-up growth&#8221; for years, although some may remain small for life (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Unfortunately, this rapid growth often fails to overcome the complications of intrauterine restriction, as a wide variety of morbidities including diabetes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), polycystic ovary syndrome (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), or perturbed mental health (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) have been linked to FGR or catch-up growth (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Together, these support the &#8220;Developmental Origins of Adult Disease&#8221; paradigm, wherein adverse factors during critical periods of fetal growth irreversibly impact development (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To overcome these effects, a clear understanding of the mechanism for each of these sequelae is necessary (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Several animal models have been developed for the study of adult diseases originating in the uterus. Most of these involve restricting certain nutritional components, such as protein (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or oxygen (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in pregnant dams. However, this does not distinguish between maternal placental effects. The <italic>Igf-2</italic><sup><italic>P</italic>0</sup> model overcomes this through knock-out of placenta-specific insulin-like growth factor 2. There are four <italic>Igf-2</italic> isoforms which result from the use of different promoters although they ultimately generate the same protein. The P<sub>0</sub> promoter is specific to the placenta. This gene is paternally imprinted, allowing for generation of both wildtype and affected offspring within the same litter. Importantly, all offspring develop in a wildtype dam, preventing maternal variables from affecting development. This targeted knock-out reduces placental growth and therefore the nutrient transport to the fetus, resulting in a brain-sparing phenotype reminiscent of human FGR (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Early hypocalcemia in the fetuses of these mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) mimics the hypocalcemia found in human neonates (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These mice have been shown to develop anxiety later in life (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which recapitulates known long-term effects of FGR on mental health (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>While long-term effects are a subject of much interest, most acute FGR complications are simply attributed to a lack of tissue mass and developmental delay: for example, a smaller and less mature kidney (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), pancreas (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), or bowel (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) will simply not function as well. Adaptive immunity is mediated by T-cells which develop in the thymus. However, while the thymus is a short-lived organ which involutes shortly after birth it continues to function well into adult life (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Deleterious effects on this transient organ could, therefore, have a significant and irreversible impact on immunity in adult life. Initially, infants with FGR have acutely smaller thymi and altered CD4/CD8 ratios of peripheral T cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Later in life, FGR is associated with abnormal responses to vaccines and higher rates of death due to infection (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). For example, indirect evidence comes from a study showing that young adults born in the annual &#8220;hungry season&#8221; in rural Gambia&#8212;and therefore likely to be born with FGR&#8212;have a 10-fold higher risk of premature death, largely due to infection (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>At a cellular level, broad definitions classify cells based on discrete cell-surface markers. In T-cell development, lymphoid progenitors travel from the bone marrow through the bloodstream to arrive at the thymus where NOTCH signaling directs them toward the T-cell lineage (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These cells divide and differentiate through four stages of DN (double negative, referring to lack of either CD4 or CD8 T-cell surface markers) whilst undergoing <italic>Tcr</italic><sub>&#946;</sub> rearrangements in the thymic cortex. With the correct set of signals, a minority of the cells become &#947;&#948; T cells. The rest gain CD8 and then CD4 surface makers (DP, double-positive) at which point <italic>Tcr</italic><sub>&#945;</sub> rearrangements take place. The rearrangements provide the diverse T-cell receptor repertoire necessary for antigen recognition. The cell is then activated by either MHC Class I or Class II molecules presenting self-antigens. Strong affinity for either MHC Class I or Class II leads to apoptosis to prevent auto-immune disease. Weak affinity to Class I or II leads to differentiation into either CD8+ cytotoxic T cells or CD4+ T helper cells, respectively. Intermediate affinity to Class II molecules leads to differentiation into a T-regulatory cell. Errors anywhere along this pathway of T-cell differentiation, from insufficient <italic>Tcr</italic> rearrangements to underrepresentation of any of the T cell lineages, can lead to impaired immune function (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing, for example Drop-Seq (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), In-Drop, or the commercial 10X Genomics and Dolomite platforms allow the analysis of the transcriptomes of thousands of single-cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). These analyses have been invaluable for identifying immune-cell subtypes within populations traditionally classified by discrete cell surface markers (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and revealed new regulatory pathways (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a previously established murine model of FGR in order to assess the effect of an adverse <italic>in utero</italic> environment on neonatal and adult immunity.

We then used Drop-Seq to profile the transcriptomes of 7,264 cells from neonatal thymi in order to characterize possible immune perturbations at a cellular level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse tissue preparation</title><p>Mice were maintained at Central Biomedical Services in accordance with the UK Home Office, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which mandates ethical review.

Spleens of FGR P<sub>0</sub> neonates were smaller than WT but this change was proportionate to body weight. However, overall cell number was reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Further investigation using flow cytometry revealed a number of perturbed lineages, where neutrophils and macrophages were the most affected by FGR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The thymus suffered markedly more growth restriction than the spleen with disproportionately reduced size and a nearly 70% reduction in cells compared to littermate controls. Given the overall severity in thymocyte reduction, we used Drop-Seq to investigate the effects of FGR at the single-T-cell level. Within the <italic>Igf-2</italic> locus, neither WT nor P<sub>0</sub> thymocytes cells contained reads aligned to the P<sub>0</sub>-specific upstream exon U2 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4</xref>), confirming that placental-specific P<sub>0</sub> was not expressed in T cells. This suggests, therefore, that the observed phenotype was a not result of a direct effect of loss of local <italic>Igf-2</italic> but rather, insufficient placental supply of nutrients. The Igf2 locus contains a number of transcript variants from the placental P<sub>0</sub> through to P<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We also examined reads mapping to the other isoforms and did not notice any distinct patterns except that in the P<sub>0</sub> mutant there were a number of reads mapping to an untranscribed region upstream of P<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Drop-Seq identifies developing thymocytes</title><p>To investigate the effect of FGR on T-cell development, we performed Drop-Seq analysis of 4,679 WT and 2,585 P<sub>0</sub> thymic cells (<italic>n</italic> = 4 and 3 animals respectively) with an average read depth of 32,399 reads/cell resulting in an average of 994 transcripts per cell (sequencing statistics are in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>). We performed a <italic>post-hoc</italic> power estimate based on our sequencing metrics (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our 7,264 cells have a mean reads (per gene per cell) of 5.8 which is well in excess of the minimum threshold of 0.02. This also holds for the WT (6.6) and P<sub>0</sub> (4.0) experiments if considered separately.</p><p>The transcript signatures of each WT cell were used to identify clusters and the genes driving that clustering. We regressed out the signals from cell cycle regulator genes when determining the cluster map, which they otherwise affected due to the intrinsic link between cell cycle and T-cell differentiation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S5</xref>). Using the remaining cluster determinants, we mapped both WT and P<sub>0</sub> cells into 8 clusters of 7,264 single cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Initially, we used known differentiation markers to define these clusters (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>). We identified the known T-cell maturation pathway, beginning with cells containing high levels of <italic>Il2ra</italic> (Double Negative, DN) through to <italic>Cd4/8</italic> containing cells (Double Positive, DP) and ending with high levels of <italic>Ccr7</italic> and <italic>Itm2a</italic> (T<sub>Mature</sub>). In this map dominated by DP cells, we were unfortunately not able to distinguish CD4 and CD8 single positive mature T cells. Bias in identifying clusters was checked using various degrees of resolution, from 0 (identifying only 1 cluster) to 1 (identifying 11; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S6</xref>). This shows distinct DN1 separation even at the lowest resolution but heterogeneous DP subclustering. Regardless of resolution, cells clustered into distinct T-cell populations based upon differentiation status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Of note, we found that the DP cells were highly heterogeneous and could be divided into multiple clusters, suggesting that the traditional definition using two markers is insufficient to fully characterize these cells. Cells in Cluster 7 were identified as contaminating red blood cells due to high hemoglobin mRNA levels, while Cluster 8 contained macrophages, identified by abundant <italic>Aif1, Lyz2</italic>, Complement, and H2 complex transcripts. As both of these clusters contained fewer than 100 cells, we focused our attention on the larger T-cell clusters.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Single Thymic Cell Transcriptomics reveal T-Cell Differentiation Pathway. <bold>(A)</bold> Drop-Seq of 7,264 single-cells from WT and P<sub>0</sub> thymi were mapped using non-linear dimensional reduction [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)] using WT signatures derived from linear dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis, PCA), with signal from known cell cycle genes regressed.

The majority of the transcripts (9 out of 13, 69%) found by this comparison between clusters coded for proteins that contributed to the ribosome surface. Surface proteins are more likely to play a functional or regulatory role than internal proteins. The protein subunits of a ribosome are known to play a key role in directing translation of specific mRNA pools (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).

Recently, interest in fetal immunity has led to the generation of a cell atlas for the developing thymus (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Here, we add to this atlas with an insight into thymic development after birth. We found a number of genes in common with these early developmental snapshots, such as <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Plac8</italic>, but were further able to resolve multiple developing T-cell populations due to the seemingly increased thymic activity after birth.</p><p>The &#8220;fetal programming of adult disease&#8221; theory has largely been associated with non-communicable diseases such as obesity or heart disease. Within this wider context, we present the first genetic model suggesting that an adverse <italic>in utero</italic> environment perturbs immune cell development. This may lead to poor immune function later in life and consequently a higher risk of communicable diseases.</p><p>Our study has identified a novel sequela of FGR in the mouse: a lasting deficit in T cells, resulting from a maturation delay found in the growth restricted neonate. At the cellular level, there were more DN cells and a skew toward early DP cells. The high heterogeneity of DP cells found here suggests that current definitions of DP are not specific enough given the large proportion of the thymic T cells in this category. Our 26 supplemental tables from the single-cell dataset provide numerous candidates for future investigation of subcluster markers and some of these may be functionally relevant to the differentiation process. Of particular note is the high number of ribosomal protein transcripts driving clustering within this group. Ribosome biogenesis has recently been shown to play a key role in stem cell differentiation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and translation of specific pools of mRNAs depends on the ribosomal protein composition (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This is particularly noticeable with defects in specific ribosomal protein genes, which can lead to discrete effects such as an erythropoiesis block in hematopoietic stem cells (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or a loss of body hair (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), as opposed to an expected generalized protein deficit. Clusters 1, 4, and 6&#8211;comprised of DN, late DP and maturing T cells&#8212;seem to subcluster based on ribosomal protein transcript levels. The ribosomal proteins encoded by these transcripts, located largely on the outside of the ribosome, are greatly reduced in the P<sub>0</sub> mice. It is interesting to speculate that within this T-cell differentiation pathway, ribosome biogenesis, and hence function, plays a role in directing maturation.</p><p>The clusters were defined by transcript signatures after excluding cell cycle regulators. Nevertheless, distinct cell cycle signatures were present within the clusters, confirming that proliferation and T-cell maturation are inexorably linked, which is consistent with a similar finding in specifically CD4+ T-cell differentiation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>How this early phenotype leads to low thymic cellularity in the adult remains unclear. Infants with FGR typically undergo &#8220;catch-up growth&#8221; to reach normal or near normal weight. This was the case here for all parameters except thymus cellularity. T-cell maturation, is linked at a molecular level to cell cycling because RAG2 is degraded during G2, S, and M phases (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Perhaps thymic &#8220;catch-up growth&#8221; and T cell diversification and maturation are incompatible because proliferation inhibits T-cell maturation. Indeed, the similar cell-cycle profiles of the P<sub>0</sub> and WT thymic cells is indicative of a lack of catch-up growth in the P<sub>0</sub> thymus. It is also possible that catch-up growth cannot occur because the thymus is programmed to involute after birth, rather than expand. In either case, growth restriction early in life would be irreversible: the number of T-cell clones generated in the neonatal thymus restricts the number of T-cell clones present in the adult.</p><p>In both mice and humans, thymus output declines with age, with the memory T cells dominating the peripheral pool in old age (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The diversity and clonality of naive T cell also change with age (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Immune function declines with age and there is an increased risk of infection and malignancy late in life (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Genetically manipulated mice with enlarged thymi have increased thymic activity and enhanced recovery from &#947; irradiation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In contrast, patients with DiGeorge syndromes where the thymus is small display immune vulnerability early in life (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Thus, a thymic deficit early in life could have dramatic effects on adult immunity which would only become exacerbated by normal thymic involution.</p><p>Overall, we have identified key immune phenotypes caused by placental insufficiency. Future studies will ultimately determine the role of FGR in both neonatal and adult immunity. Nevertheless, we have shown a distinct and negative impact of FGR on immune cells in the mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The single-cell datasets generated for this study can be found in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI under accession number E-MTAB-6945, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945</ext-link>.
