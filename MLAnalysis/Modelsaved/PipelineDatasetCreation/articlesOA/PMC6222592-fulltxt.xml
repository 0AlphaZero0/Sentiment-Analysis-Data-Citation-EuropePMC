Brazil is one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world, both from a socio-cultural and a genetic point of view. In this work, we investigated a previously developed set of 61 ancestry informative markers (AIM), aiming to estimate the proportions of four different ancestral groups (African, European, Native American and Asian) in Brazilian populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use a set of AIM to investigate the genetic contribution of all four main parental populations to the Brazilian population, including Asian contribution. All selected markers were genotyped through multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis. The set was able to successfully differentiate the four ancestral populations (represented by 939 individuals) and identify their genetic contributions to the Brazilian population. In addition, it was used to estimate individual interethnic admixture of 1050 individuals from the Southeast region of Brazil and it showed that these individuals present a higher European ancestry contribution, followed by African, Asian and Native American ancestry contributions. Therefore, the 61 AIM set has proved to be a valuable tool to estimate individual and global ancestry proportions in populations mainly formed by these four groups. Our findings highlight the importance of using sets of AIM to evaluate population substructure in studies carried in admixed populations, in order to avoid misinterpretation of results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Ancestry-informative markers</kwd><kwd>Insertion-deletion polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>Admixture</kwd><kwd>Population substructure</kwd><kwd>Asian</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Studies of genetic association are frequently performed in groups of non-related individuals in one or more populations to identify susceptibility <italic>loci</italic> regarding complex human traits (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Santos <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).

Therefore, it is important to estimate the genetic contributions in such populations, as well as controlling the substructure effects in these types of studies.</p><p>Brazil is one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world, both from a socio-cultural and a genetic point of view. The history of this country is marked by continental migrations, which influenced in a definitive manner the process of admixture of the Brazilian population. In the first half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, Europeans (mainly Portuguese) started an immigration process to the large territory that was inhabited by Native Americans (also known as Amerindians) and later would become Brazil (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Cunha 1995</xref>). In the second half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the process of slave trade from Africa started and it continued until 1850 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Curtin 1969</xref>).</p><p>The immigration process of Asians to Brazil started in the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants in the city of Santos (located in S&#227;o Paulo state, in the Southeastern Brazil), brought by the Kasato-Maru ship (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Takenaka 2003</xref>). Currently, Brazil is home of approximately 1.5 million Japanese, becoming the largest Japanese community outside Japan (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Kurtz 2010</xref>). It shows the importance of this parental group to the formation of the Brazilian population. However, most studies still only consider European, Native Americans and African as the main contributors to the admixed Brazilian population and this could lead to misinterpretation of results.</p><p>Therefore, when carrying association studies in the Brazilian population, it is important to consider that: i) the current Brazilian population was mainly formed by the admixture of four continental populations (Native Americans, Europeans, Africans and Asians); and ii) association studies carried in admixed populations should be carefully analyzed to avoid misinterpretation due to population substructure, which can be done through ancestry informative markers (AIM). These markers, also known as population-specific markers, are genetic markers with great variation of allelic frequency between different continental populations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a certain allele can range from exclusive absence to exclusive presence in different populations) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Parra <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).</p><p>Estimates of genetic ancestry proportions in admixed populations are not only fundamental to control the effect of population substructure in association studies, but they can also be useful in other types of investigations, being considered more accurate than physical traits (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ramos <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).

We quantified the level of standard error (SE) using data obtained in analysis performed with Structure v.2.3.4. software. As described by Halder <italic>et al.</italic> [18], SE represents the bias caused by the nature of allele frequency distributions, not the bias that could be generated by the process of sample selection, and it can be defined as population SE (total ancestry from the noncontributing populations to individuals) or ancestry SE (total contribution from one noncontributing population to other populations). <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the results from these analyses. In the four parental populations, the estimate of interethnic admixture showed more than 99% similarity within the expected group, which establishes the mean population SE with less than 1%.</p><table-wrap id="t3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Quantification of statistical bias level introduced in interethnic admixture estimates</title></caption></table-wrap><p>The measure of ancestral SE was also very low (less than 1%), which means that none of the parental populations could have contributed with more than 1% in the formation of the other three populations. It suggests that the panel of 61 AIM could be employed in the estimates of individual interethnic admixture involving the Asian ancestral population. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> presents the estimates of genetic contribution for each individual included in the study and it shows that the panel of 61 AIM successfully differentiates European, African, Native American and Asian populations.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the interethnic admixture estimates in the four continental populations, using Structure software for k = 4.

Considering the obtained values, the FST results indicate a great degree of differentiation between Native American and Asian populations, and an even greater degree in the analysis between the other populations (all with P-value &lt; 0.05). To further investigate this finding, we applied the 61-AIM set to estimate interethnic admixture in samples from 1050 individuals from the S&#227;o Paulo population that have reported Asian ancestry. Then, we performed analyses considering three and four parental populations (EUR/AFR/NAM; EUR/AFR/ASN and EUR/AFR/NAM/ASN) (<xref rid="t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). European contribution presented the higher contribution in the S&#227;o Paulo sample, with similar percentage, regardless of the carried test: i) four ancestral populations (67.5%), ii) three ancestral populations without ASN (68.4%) and iii) three ancestral populations without NAM (67.8%). There is also a small variation in the AFR contribution between the three analyses: 16.1% when considering the four ancestral populations, 19.6% when considering three ancestral populations without ASN and 18.2% when considering the three ancestral populations without NAM.

For this purpose, in addition to groups representing European, Native American and African ancestries, we included a population from the Northern Brazil with known Asian origin and a population from the Southeastern Brazil with admixture history of the 4 populations (EUR, AFR, ASN and NAM).</p><p>To validate the AIM panel, we employed an approach that has been previously used (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Halder <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Santos <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) and observed that this set provides reliable estimates of the admixture of the four ancestral populations that are the main contributors to the formation of the Brazilian population (Native American, African, European and Asian). This was further strengthened by the results of the DAPC analysis with the set of markers, in which all populations are visibly separated. Moreover, the obtained FST values are indicating large or very large genetic differentiation between the four populations, according to the guidelines proposed by Wright (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wright 1978</xref>) (FST &lt; 0.05 indicates small genetic differentiation, 0.05 &lt; FST &lt; 0.15 indicates moderate genetic differentiation, 0.15 &lt; FST &lt; 0.25 indicates large differentiation and FST &gt; 0.25 indicates very large genetic differentiation).</p><p>Corroborating previous studies (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Wallace <italic>et al.</italic> 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Schurr <italic>et al.</italic> 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Horai <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>) our results show a greater similarity between Native American and Asian populations, when compared to the other continental groups investigated here. For instance, the mean &#948; between Asian and Native American populations (0.244) are lower than the correspondent measures between Asian and European populations (0.307) and between Asian and African populations (0.353).</p><p>Although there is a greater proximity between Native American and Asian groups, the AIM panel provides a robust and specific estimate of ASN individual ancestry in admixed populations, successfully separating ASN population from others. This was strengthened with the obtained results of the analyses in the samples from S&#227;o Paulo, in which we were able to identify 0.6% of global Asian ancestry in this admixed population from the Southeast region of Brazil. This result differs from the registered data of 1.9% of Asian contribution in this region (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">IBGE 2008</xref>). However, this registered data were estimated based on self-declaration criteria, which is different from measures of genomic ancestry.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that this INDEL panel not only can be used to genetically distinguish different continental populations (specifically Europeans, Africans, Native Americans and Asians), but it can also identify substructure in admixed populations. When applied to such populations, this panel allows estimates of the individual and global interethnic admixture regarding the genetic contributions of these ancestry groups. Moreover, it was able to efficiently separate Asian and Native American populations, despite their proximity when compared to the other continental populations. Therefore, we showed in this study that the 61-AIM panel is a useful tool that could be valuable in studies in Brazilian populations, which is extremely important to avoid misinterpretations of the findings in association studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply an AIM panel to estimate the individual contribution of these four main parental populations (European, Native American, African and Asian) in an admixed population from Brazil.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank PROPESP/UFPA (Pr&#243;-Reitoria de Pesquisa e P&#243;s-Gradua&#231;&#227;o/Universidade Federal do Par&#225;), CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#237;fico e Tecnol&#243;gico), CAPES (Coordena&#231;&#227;o de Aperfei&#231;oamento de Pessoal de N&#237;vel Superior), FAPESPA (Funda&#231;&#227;o Amaz&#244;nia de Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisa do Par&#225;) and FADESP (Funda&#231;&#227;o de Amparo e Desenvolvimento da Pesquisa) for the received grants.
