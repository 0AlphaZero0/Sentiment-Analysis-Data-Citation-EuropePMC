As mentioned above, this study investigated drug information at 0, 3, and 12 months. At the start point (0 months, the time of enrollment), the person with RAAS use history was defined as taking &#8764;30 days from the index date. Initially, RAAS use history was defined as use 60 days from 30 days after the index date if the patient did not take the RAAS agent at the start time or did not know whether to take it and thus took it at the third month, and the duration of use was defined as 90 days from the index date if it was taken at 0 months and 3 months.

Overall, patients receiving RAAS blockade treatment tended to be younger than patients in the control group, as well as being more likely to have started dialysis due to diabetes, to be undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and to be using other antihypertensive drugs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>).

Based on previously published reports of a clinical benefit of RAAS blockade treatment in improving left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with advanced kidney disease,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> we evaluated the clinical indication for RAAS blockade treatment specifically in patients newly diagnosed with ESRD, taking into account cardiac parameters such as echocardiography, left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, and levels of selected cardiac enzymes. There was no significant difference in the other variables. The difference between the 2 groups was that left ventricular mass index was larger in the control group, but this was not statistically significant. Left atrial dimension and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension were significantly larger in the RAAS group, and in this study we could infer that RAAS is indicated mainly in diabetic patients and patients with heart failure and in incident dialysis patients with large left ventricular size (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#160;4</xref>).</p><p id="p0115">According to the first definition of the RAAS group (the RAAS group was formed of patients using an ACEi or ARB at the time of enrollment in the study and for the first visit at 3 months), this group showed a significantly better overall survival rate for mortality (<italic>P</italic>&#160;= 0.003), and the MACE-free survival did not achieve statistical significance between the groups in the competing risk analysis (<italic>P</italic>&#160;= 0.073) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>). In addition, we performed a time-varying Cox regression analysis according to cumulative duration of RAAS blockade use, taking into account the point that actual treatment duration of RAAS blockade could be crucial.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> There are conceptual and analytical challenges in modeling the effects of complex time-varying exposures. Exposure to RAAS blockade after the study enrollment was applied as a time-dependent variable to minimize the immortal time biases. In this study, to avoid length biases due to modeling cumulative exposure duration as a time-fixed covariate, we also used cumulative exposure duration as time-varying covariate.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="p0120">The results were quite different for the RAAS current-use group and the group that knew the cumulative duration to specify the duration of RAAS. The RAAS current-use group was defined with the use of the RAAS blockade in this cohort referring to cases in which where the use of the drug was confirmed at any point in time and at any dose. Patients with poor general condition (especially in those with hyperkalemia or intradialytic hypotension) and unable to continue to use of RAAS blockade may be included in this RAAS current-use group. The observational nature of this study means that it is difficult to prove the correct causality by distinguishing the sicker patients, and those with more complicated disease are more likely to include the treatment that was presented in the RAAS current-use group. We have acknowledged that this cohort is a well-recognized cohort with a large number of studies,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> including close to 10% of dialysis patients in Korea.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> In this regard, we suggest that this tendency reflects the actual real-world data in Korea. Although there may be unresolved bias, at least in large cohorts of Korea, it is meaningful to have the previously discussed results, and a further study on a well-designed randomized controlled trial with a controlled treatment pattern is needed.</p><p id="p0125">Our results regarding a specific clinical benefit of RAAS treatment among patients with ESRD is not consistent with previously reported data from 2 meta-analyses,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> from randomized controlled trials,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and from a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the outcomes of the HEMO Study.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> One possible explanation is that a difference in the use of ACEi and ARB among patients in the RAAS group may have influenced clinical outcomes. In this study, the RAAS group was defined as RAAS treatment group using only 1 of ACEi and ARB. In some cases (&lt;5%), dual RAAS blockade was prescribed, and this part was also included in the RAAS group. The proportion of ACEi versus ARB users in the RAAS group was somewhat different between the incident dialysis patient group and the maintenance dialysis patient group. In the newly started dialysis patient group, 7.7% received ACEi and 50.2% received ARB. In the maintenance dialysis group, 9.1% received ACEi and 48.1% received ARB. The use of ARB was more frequent than ACEi, reflecting the real-world characteristics of hypertension treatment in Korean ESRD patients. A previous meta-analysis reported clinical benefit of ACEi, but not ARB, on MACE and all-cause mortality among a diabetic population with preserved renal function.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, other trials evaluating the long-term benefit of ACEi in patients with ESRD on maintain dialysis reported mostly negative results.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In the case of ARB, the conflicting results were that positive results were reported regarding the benefit of ARB on cardiovascular outcomes,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> with negative randomized controlled trial results on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic hemodialysis.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> In their observational study of &gt;6 years&#8217; follow-up of 28,628 patients on hemodialysis in the United States, Chan <italic>et&#160;al.</italic> reported a 4-fold increase of ACEi over ARB using a propensity-matched analysis of patients taking ACEi&#160;+ other drugs and those taking ARB&#160;+ other drugs.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Similarly, in our study, we identified about a 5-fold increase in the use of ARB over ACEi, with a rate of MACE-specific mortality of 25% among patients using ARB compared to 28% among patients using ACEi, as in the study by Chan <italic>et&#160;al.</italic>, who reported a benefit of ARB&#160;+ other drugs on cardiovascular survival.</p><p id="p0130">The clinical outcomes of patients on dialysis with RAAS blockade who have an underlying heart condition have previously been evaluated. Using clinical data of patients with ESRD from the US Renal Data System database, Berger <italic>et&#160;al.</italic> reported a 43% reduction in the risk of mortality from all causes 30 days after an acute myocardial infarction among patients treated with ACEi compared to patients not receiving treatment.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> In their evaluation of the effects of different hypertensive drugs in 902 hemodialysis patients with congestive heart failure after a myocardial infarction, the risk of mortality was significantly lower in patients treated with ACEis or ARBs, compared to patients treated with other classes of hypertensive drugs.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Despite these reported benefits of ACEis and ARBs in patients with previous CVD history, we could not identify specific effects on left ventricular function in study participants overall. In our prospective observation protocol, only patients with incident dialysis underwent 2D echocardiography, so that additional analysis could identify cardiovascular risk factors in the RAAS group in incident dialysis patients (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#160;4</xref>). As expected, incident dialysis patients with diabetes were significantly more likely to use RAAS treatment, but there was no difference in previous cardiovascular history. Both the left atrial dimension and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension were significantly larger in the RAAS group, and in this study we could infer that RAAS is indicated mainly in diabetic patients and patients with heart failure with large left ventricular size among incident dialysis patients. Moreover, the residual renal function has a great influence on the results of the association between RAAS blockade use and dialysis patients&#8217; outcomes.</p><p id="p0135">The limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. Several limitations such as use of prevalent patients (patients who already started dialysis before study enrollment), no adjustment for heart failure in the main study participants, no definite indications for RAAS treatment, residual confounding due to the observational study nature, and low power for some of the outcomes remain. The definition of the RAAS treatment group in this prospective study cohort is also a limitation of this study. This study is a real-world observational cohort study that examined patients from 31 university hospitals and their physicians&#8217; decisions on which BP medications were used and which cases of hypertension received treatment. Due to the nature of the research design, it is impossible to control for treatment indications in all patients. Therefore, we designed the additional time-varying analysis to reflect the actual RAAS blockade duration to the nearest actual treatment.</p><p id="p0140">In conclusion, we have reported a specific benefit in the RAAS blockade group with cumulative duration in improving overall survival and MACE-free survival after adjusting for confounding factors in real-world data from Korea. Further research, evaluating the clinical importance of RAAS blockade in Korean ESRD patients with specific subpopulations, is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0145">All the authors declared no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>United States Renal Data System</collab></person-group><chapter-title>2016 USRDS Annual Data Report: Epidemiology of Kidney Disease in the United States</chapter-title><year>2016</year><publisher-name>National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Bethesda, MD</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>C.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Asinger</surname><given-names>R.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease.
