A series of radioligand binding studies, confocal microscopy studies, and internalization of radiolabeled or fluorescently tagged LDL particles were then conducted in these cells.

TMEM97 KO resulted in a complete loss of binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]<bold>RHM-4</bold> and a significant reduction in binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG. TMEM97 KO and PGRMC1 KO resulted in an equal reduction in the rate of uptake of fluorescently-tagged or <sup>3</sup>H-labeled LDL, and knocking out both proteins did not result in a further rate of reduction of LDL uptake. Confocal microscopy and Proximity Ligation Assay studies indicated a clear co-localization of LDLR, PGRMC1 and TMEM97.

The current classification lists two types of sigma receptors, sigma-1 (&#963;1) and sigma-2 (&#963;2) receptors (R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The sigma receptors were identified in 1976 and were initially classified as a member of the opiate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies revealed that they represented a discrete family of receptors. For many years, the sigma receptors were described pharmacologically through the binding of the radioligands [<sup>3</sup>H](+)&#8722;pentazocine and [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG. [<sup>3</sup>H](+)&#8722;Pentazocine has a high affinity for &#963;1R whereas [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG bind with equal affinity to both &#963;1 and &#963;2 receptors. The &#963;1R was purified, sequenced and cloned from guinea pig brain in 1996, and bears little sequence homology to any known mammalian receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The crystal structure of the &#963;1R was reported in 2016, and the reported structure shows it as a trimeric species with a single transmembrane spanning region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The &#963;1R is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), specifically at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. At the MAM, the &#963;1R acts as a molecular chaperone for the translocation of inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1) in transmitting ER stress signals to the nucleus. The &#963;1R can also undergo translocation from the ER to the plasma membrane, where it has been found to be associated with a variety of receptors, channels and kinases. This association with a variety of plasma membrane-bound receptor is responsible for the diverse number of biological and pharmacological properties associated with the &#963;1R.</p><p id="Par3">Although much has been learned about the biology of the &#963;1R in the two decades since its sequencing and cloning, the same cannot be said of the &#963;2R. In 2011, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the &#963;2R represented a binding site in a protein complex containing Progesterone Membrane Binding Component-1 (PGRMC1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The association of the &#963;2R with PGRMC1 was initially made via the photoaffinity tagging of this protein with an azido compound having a high affinity for the &#963;2R. This study did not conclude the &#963;2R to be PGRMC1, but reported that altering expression levels of PGRMC1 changed the pharmacological properties of small molecules interacting with the &#963;2R. Evidence supporting this conclusion was reported in two subsequent papers: Izzo <italic>et al</italic>. reported that knocking down PGRMC1 reduced A&#946; oligomer synaptic dysfunction in cultured neurons, and this effect could also be achieved pharmacologically with an antagonist of the &#963;2R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Secondly, Yi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that genetic knockout or knockdown of <italic>vem-1</italic>, the nematode ortholog of PGRMC1, diminished the neurotoxicity of amyloid precursor protein in a nematode model of AD, and this effect could be demonstrated pharmacologically by using &#963;2 R antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data suggested a strong association between the &#963;2R and PGRMC1. PGRMC1 has been proposed to be a membrane-associated progesterone receptor, but its role in cell biology is also poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. PGRMC1 is similar to the &#963;1R in that it too is thought to be a molecular chaperone, in this case one that is involved in the translocation of heme and lipophilic molecules such as cholesterol and other steroids from the plasma membrane and the ER, mitochondria and other organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The high association of PGRMC1 and &#963;2R in breast cancer, and the suspected role of both proteins in cell proliferation, also support an association between these two proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Evidence disputing the link between the &#963;2R and PGRMC1 was first reported by Abate <italic>et al</italic>., who demonstrated that stable knockdown of PGRMC1 or the overexpression of this protein in MCF7 cells did not alter the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A subsequent paper by Chu <italic>et al</italic>. provided similar results in NSC34 cells where PGRMC1 had been genetically knocked out using CRISPR gene editing techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In each case, the authors concluded that the &#963;2R was not PGRMC1 and suggested that the data reported by Xu <italic>et al</italic>. was incorrect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the original study did not claim that the &#963;2R was PGRMC1, only that the &#963;2R was a binding site located in the complex of proteins that contained PGRMC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Subsequently, a recent report by Alon <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that the protein TMEM97 was not only a [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG binding site, but represented the gene for the &#963;2R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, raising further doubt about the association between the &#963;2R and PGRMC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">TMEM97 is a protein that has generated interest lately because of its association with lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1, a protein whose loss results in Niemann&#8211;Pick disease type C1, a fatal lysosomal storage disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. TMEM97 has also been associated with the LDL receptor, and a previous study has shown that siRNA studies knocking down TMEM97 reduced the rate of internalization of LDL by the LDL receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Prior to its identification as TMEM97, the &#963;2R had also been suggested to be involved in cholesterol biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Consequently, the association of TMEM97/&#963;2R, the new nomenclature for this protein, with cholesterol pathways was consistent with prior literature reports on the potential role of the &#963;2R in cell biology. Since PGRMC1 has also been implicated with cholesterol trafficking (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>), there is a distinct possibility that both TMEM97/&#963;2R and PGRMC1 may be involved in the same biochemical pathways within the cell. Therefore, as part of our continued interest in the role of the &#963;2R in cell proliferation, our group conducted a series of CRISPR studies aimed at exploring the functional relationship between TMEM97/&#963;2R and PGRMC1 on the mechanisms of cholesterol uptake and translocation in the cell. In this report, we present evidence demonstrating that deletion of either TMEM97/&#963;2R or PGRMC1 reduces the level of internalization and trafficking of LDL by the LDL receptor. Knocking out both proteins in HeLa cells did not have an additive effect on LDL uptake. This effect could also be produced through the pharmacological blocking of TMEM97/&#963;2R with a &#963;2R antagonist. These data indicate that <italic>both TMEM97/</italic>&#963;<italic>2R and PGRMC1</italic> are involved in the internalization of LDL by LDL receptor. Confocal microscopy studies also show that LDLR, PGRMC1 and TMEM97 have an asymmetric distribution in the plasma membrane, suggesting that they are involved in a protein complex. We also report that CRISPR gene editing of TMEM97/&#963;2R results in a complete reduction of the binding of the &#963;2R ligand [<sup>125</sup>I]<italic>N</italic>-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1&#8201;H)-yl)butyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-iodo-benzamide ([<sup>125</sup>I]<bold>RHM-4</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but only a partial reduction in the specific binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG to HeLa cell membranes. The residual binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG was not attributed to binding to the &#963;1R, and may represent a third, currently uncharacterized sigma receptor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CRISPR Gene Editing of PGRMC1 and TMEM97</title><p id="Par6">In order to study whether TMEM97 or/and PGRMC1 is responsible for &#963;2R binding and what their biological functions are, CRISPR technology was used to knockout TMEM97, PGRMC1 and both TMEM97 and PGRMC1 in HeLa cells to generate four knockout (KO) cell lines, i.e. control, TMEM97 KO, PGRMC1 KO, and TMEM97/PGRMC1 double KO. All the four cell lines were generated using the same plasmid transfection and lentivirus-infection procedures. Single clones were isolated for all knockout cell lines and used throughout the current study. Western blot showed that TMEM97 or/and PGRMC1 were completely removed in the knockout cell lines (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). TMEM97 or PGRMC1 protein levels were measured as the expression ratio of TMEM97 or PGRMC1 to GAPDH, respectively, were quantified in control and knockout cell lines.

TMEM97 was knocked out by using three different guide RNA sequences, i.e. sgRNA-1, 2 or 3, each directing cas9 nuclease to cleave distinct, specific site of exon 1 of TMEM97. Western blot analysis showed that TMEM97 proteins were successfully deleted by using each of three sgRNAs (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Since both TMEM97 and PGRMC1 are membrane-bound proteins that have been implicated in cholesterol metabolism, a series of studies were conducted to determine if there is a possible interaction between these proteins and the internalization of LDL by the LDLR. There was no change in protein expression levels of LDLR between the control (Scramble/Cas9), PGRMC1 KO, TMEM97 KO, and double KO cells as assessed by western blot. TMEM97 was not detected in the TMEM97 KO and double KO cell lines, and PGRMC1 was not detected in the PGRMC1 KO cells and double KO cell lines, verifying the knockout of the representative proteins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Total intracellular cholesterol levels were not affected in the knockout cell lines as assessed by filipin staining (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The next series of experiments studied the effect of knocking out TMEM97 and PGRMC1 on the internalization of LDL by LDLR. Since LDL is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we measured the kinetics of LDL internalization using LDL labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol. Cells were incubated in the presence of lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) for 24&#8201;hours in order to induce expression of LDLR. As noted above, there was no difference in LDLR expression between the control cells and any of the knockout cell lines (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Uptake of radiolabeled LDL was significantly decreased in PGRMC1 KO, TMEM97 KO, and double KO cell lines. Moreover, this decrease in LDL internalization was not a stepwise reduction with the loss of each protein but rather a complete diminished capability, as PGRMC1 KO and TMEM97 KO cells had the same decreased internalization of radiolabeled LDL as the double KO cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). This decreased LDL uptake was also observed in experiments using fluorescently tagged DiI-LDL (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To ensure the radiolabeled LDL was taken up via the LDLR pathway, excess unlabeled LDL (250&#8201;&#956;g/mL) was incubated with the radiolabeled LDL (50&#8201;&#956;g/mL). Under these conditions the excess LDL competes with radiolabeled LDL for binding with LDLR, resulting in significantly decreased internalization (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). These data confirm that the LDL-LDLR pathway is responsible for internalization in these cells.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol labeled LDL (50&#8201;&#956;g/mL LDL labeled with 3&#8201;&#956;Ci/mL [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol) expressed as cpm /&#956;g cell protein.

All compounds resulted in a reduction of LDL uptake, with the classical &#963;2R antagonists having a greater effect than both the &#963;2R agonists and the PGRMC1 inhibitor. There was a dose-dependent reduction in uptake of LDL labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol when HeLa cells were treated with these inhibitors (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). This pharmacologic inhibition of LDL uptake was observed in control cells only, but did not further decrease uptake in the knockout cells lines, further suggesting that PGRMC1 and TMEM97 must both be present and functional for effective LDL-LDLR complex internalization (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Somatostatin and Insulin Uptake Rates are unaffected in knockout cell lines</title><p id="Par14">To determine whether the presence of TMEM97 and/or PGRMC1 affects all clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways, we examined at the uptake of radiolabeled [<sup>125</sup>I]TYR<sup>11</sup>-Somatostatin and [<sup>125</sup>I] Insulin.

This asymmetry of LDLR has been reported previously and is thought to represent localization of LDLR in the region of the plasma membrane rich in lipid rafts. There was a similar asymmetric localization of both TMEM97 and PGRMC1 in the plasma membrane. Co-localization studies indicate that there is a high degree of co-localization of LDLR, TMEM97 and PGRMC1 under these conditions.

These data are consistent with the dissociation of the LDL-LDLR-TMEM97-PGRMC1 protein complex following internalization into the lysosomal compartments within the cell. The confocal microscopy data, taken collectively with the cell uptake studies of [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol-labeled LDL and fluorescently-tagged LDL, suggest that the rapid internalization of LDL by the LDLR requires the formation of a complex with both PGRMC1 and TMEM97.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Proximity Ligation Assays</title><p id="Par17">To confirm that the observed associations between the protein was indeed a complex formed, proximity ligation assays were conducted pairwise between LDLR, PGRMC1, and TMEM97.

Previous studies from our group have shown that the density of &#963;2Rs is higher in proliferating breast cancer cells relative to cancer cells driven into quiescence (i.e., G0) by prolonged serum starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. PET imaging studies with a &#963;2R -selective radiotracer, [<sup>18</sup>F]ISO-1, have shown a strong correlation between radiotracer uptake and the density of &#963;2R in a murine model of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and an excellent correlation between radiotracer uptake and Ki-67 score in a mixed population of patients diagnosed with lymphoma, breast, and head &amp; neck cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Since the molecular identity of the &#963;2R was not known at the time of these studies, these encouraging results initiated a series of studies in our lab to characterize this protein as a means of understanding the role of the &#963;2R in cell proliferation. In 2011, we reported a series of experimental results suggesting that the &#963;2R was a binding site in a protein complex containing PGRMC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We did not state that the &#963;2R was PGRMC1 since we did not observe a 1:1 correlation between the binding of a radioiodinated ligand having a high affinity for the &#963;2R, and levels of the protein in HeLa cells having either a transient knockdown or overexpression of PGRMC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The recent identification of the &#963;2R as being the protein, TMEM97, provided further support to the absence of any correlation between the &#963;2R, now called the TMEM97/&#963;2R, and PGRMC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">TMEM97 is thought to be involved in cholesterol trafficking through its association with lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1, a protein whose loss results in a fatal lysosomal storage disorder, Niemann&#8211;Pick disease type C1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A previous study also demonstrated that siRNA studies knocking down TMEM97 reduced the rate of internalization of LDL by the LDL receptor (LDLR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Another protein that has been strongly linked to cholesterol trafficking is PGRMC1, and in a recent review by Cahill and Medlock, a theoretical mechanism showing a role of PGRMC1 in the membrane trafficking of LDLR was proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, if the &#963;2R and PGRMC1 are part of a protein complex as we proposed in 2011, the above evidence suggests that this protein complex may consist of the LDLR, TMEM97 and PGRMC1.</p><p id="Par21">In the current study, we provide strong experimental evidence that this is indeed the case. CRISPR gene editing studies resulting in a complete knockout of either TMEM97 or PGRMC1 resulted in an identical reduction in the rate of internalization of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled LDL and fluorescently tagged DiI-LDL by LDLR. Knocking out both TMEM97 and PGRMC1 did not lead to a further reduction in <sup>3</sup>H-LDL uptake, indicating that the effect was not additive, and loss of one protein has the same effect as losing both proteins. The decreased uptake in the absence of TMEM97, PGRMC1, or both was unique to LDL, as uptake of somatostatin and insulin was not affected, thus demonstrating that knocking out these proteins does not disrupt all clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways. Furthermore, knocking out TMEM97 resulted in a complete loss of binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]<bold>RHM-4</bold>, and a significant reduction in the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG to HeLa cells. These data indicate that [<sup>125</sup>I]<bold>RHM-4</bold> binds selectively to TMEM97, whereas there is some residual binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG to a site not associated with TMEM97. The affinity of [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG for this residual binding site is ~300&#8201;nM, and its density is ~40% that of TMEM97. Since this residual binding was also observed in the double KO cells, it does not represent binding to the low affinity DTG binding site identified previously in the PGRMC1 dimer. Whether this site represents a third, previously unidentified sigma receptor or some other off-target binding site remains to be determined. It is also interesting to note that knocking out PGRMC1 resulted in a decrease in affinity of both [<sup>125</sup>I]<bold>RHM-4</bold> and [<sup>3</sup>H]DTG for TMEM97, but no change in Bmax values for the protein. These results are consistent with an interaction between TMEM97 and PGRMC1, with the knocking out of PGRMC1 resulting in a small change in the 3-dimensional structure of TMEM97 leading to a reduction in affinity of &#963;2R radioligands binding to this site.</p><p id="Par22">The confocal microscopy and proximity ligation assay studies reported here also support the above conclusions.

Co-localization studies indicate that there is a high level of co-localization of the three proteins, which is consistent with the formation of an LDLR-TMEM97-PGRMC1 protein complex. However, there was also a population of PGRMC1 apparently not associated with LDLR, as evident in the proximity ligation assay, where the PGRMC1-TMEM97 and LDLR-PGRMC1 pairs showed less colocalization signal than the LDLR-TMEM97 pair. These data are consistent with previous reports that PGRMC1 may be associated with other membrane-bound receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin receptor (IR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Addition of LDL to HeLa cells after a brief period of serum starvation resulted in the internalization and likely dissociation of the LDL-LDLR-TMEM97-PGRMC1 tetrameric complex in the acidic environment of the lysosomes since this treatment resulted in an increase in the amount of PGRMC1 and TMEM97 not co-localized with LDLR.</p><p id="Par23">The involvement of TMEM97/&#963;2R in the internalization and trafficking of cholesterol via LDL is consistent with our previous characterization of the &#963;2R is upregulated in proliferating versus quiescent breast cancer cells.

Apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) is the main source of cholesterol in brain, which is required for axonal growth and synaptogenesis. Apo-E is synthesized in astrocytes and microglia and released into the extracellular space where it is taken up in neurons by LDLR and a second lipoprotein receptor, LDL receptor related protein 1 (LRP1). There is a strong correlation between the prevalence of AD and lipoprotein metabolism, in particular apolipoprotein e4 (APO-E4). For example, patients having the APO-E4 allele have a higher incidence of AD and are positive for A&#946; plaques as measured by [<sup>11</sup>C]PiB PET imaging studies at an earlier age. Apolipoproteins also bind A&#946;, and it has been proposed that Apo-E-bound A&#946; is taken up by neurons via transport by LDLR or LRP1. Therefore, it is possible that &#963;2R antagonists disrupt the binding of A&#946; oligomers or A&#946;-bound Apo-E to LDLR or LRP1 in a manner analogous to blocking the uptake of LDL in HeLa cells by the &#963;2R antagonist, <bold>RHM-4</bold>.</p><p id="Par25">In summary, our data demonstrate that the rate of uptake of LDL by LDLR is increased by the formation of a complex with both PGRMC1 and TMEM97. Internalization of LDL by LDLR can occur in the absence of this protein complex, but at a much slower rate than what is observed with the ternary complex. Confocal microscopy and radioligand binding studies indicate that PGRMC1 and TMEM97 are physically associated in this complex with LDLR since knocking out PGRMC1 results in a reduction in the affinity of &#963;2R ligands for TMEM97, and there is a high degree of co-localization of these proteins. The formation of a trimeric LDLR-PGRMC1-TMEM97 complex that results in the rapid internalization and trafficking of LDL is consistent with the conclusion we stated in our 2011 paper, that the &#963;2R represents a binding site in the protein complex containing PGRMC1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par26"><italic>N</italic>-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-iodo-benzamide and [<sup>125</sup>I]<italic>N</italic>-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-iodo-benzamide were synthesized as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.
