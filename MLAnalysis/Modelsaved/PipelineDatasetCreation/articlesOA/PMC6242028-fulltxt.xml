The heterogenic nature of the disease poses a great challenge for clinical examinations as well as developing treat-to-target strategies, which is essential when monitoring patients regarding the efficacy of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).</p><p>Evaluation of PsA activity is based on measures of inflammation including joint counts, laboratory measures and examiner&#8217;s evaluations as well as subjective measures including pain and patient global assessment (PGA). In addition, several other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are used for addressing function, quality of life and mental health. Discrepancies in assessing disease activity have been reported between the more objective and the patient-reported measures of disease activity both in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>, and recently also in PsA.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition to inflammation, the patient perspectives may be influenced by factors like joint damage, degenerative changes, central sensitisation, mental health (eg, anxiety and depression) and illness perception.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#8211;9</xref>
</p><p>Several composite scores have been developed in the past years including both subjective and objective measures to provide more comprehensive tools for disease assessment in PsA. Recent recommendations by an international task force suggested the use of the Disease Activity index for PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) in evaluation of the musculoskeletal domain of the disease.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> DAPSA is the numerical sum of 66 swollen and 68 tender joint counts, pain, PGA (pain and PGA scored on a 0&#8211;10 scale) and C-reactive protein (CRP (mg/dL)).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It can be used for evaluation of disease activity and includes cut-offs for different disease activity states including remission.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> DAPSA has been validated in clinical trials and shown to be responsive to treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13</xref> However, patient&#8217;s evaluations have a major contribution to the index score. To which extent DAPSA is reflecting inflammatory disease activity as assessed by ultrasound (US) has not been studied in longitudinal observational cohorts.</p><p>US is increasingly implemented by clinicians as an important additional tool for assessing pathology in inflammatory joint diseases, and several studies of PsA patients have proven US to be a valid, sensitive and reliable tool in assessing inflammation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Recent European League Against Rheumatism recommendations support the use of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in PsA.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Inflammation in joints, tendons, bursae and entheses may be assessed by use of grey scale (GS) changes and vascularisation by use of power Doppler (PD) activity, where PD is considered to be the best proxy to active inflammation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#8211;19</xref> US is sensitive to differentiate between active lesions and structural damage within the entheses<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and also detects response to therapy,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which is important for treatment decisions. On the other hand, clinical evaluations have been shown quite unreliable in this regard due to low specificity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</p><p>Recent cross-sectional US studies in patients with PsA have pointed out a discrepancy between clinical and US measures as well as low association between clinical composite scores like DAPSA and US scores.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> With emphasis on the present use of clinical composite scores in the treat-to-target strategy of patients with PsA, there is a need for longitudinal studies exploring the associations between clinical composite scores and US assessments for evaluation of disease activity in patients with PsA. The objectives of this study were to explore the longitudinal relationships between DAPSA, the clinical assessments of individual components of DAPSA as well as PROMs with an US score based on a comprehensive US examination in patients with PsA initiating bDMARDs. We also aimed to study the concordance between remission defined by DAPSA and US.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 47 PsA patients fulfilling the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> were consecutively included in this single centre study after referral from their treating rheumatologist during a period from December 2011 to March 2015.

We found that DAPSA had cross-sectionally and longitudinally strong associations with PROMs, especially with TJC and pain as its individual components. On the other hand, DAPSA had low association with clinical signs of inflammation and no associations with US scores. US PD was associated with clinical signs of inflammation, but not with any of the PROMs. US scores were generally low, but decreased significantly during the study. Remission was found in twice as many for US PD than for DAPSA at follow-up. However, there was no association between these two assessments of remission.</p><p>Studies of patients with RA have shown that subjective measures of disease activity correlate more strongly with objective measures including US in high disease activity states, but this relationship is weaker in patients with lower disease activity and remission as well as in presence of comorbidities that strongly influence the subjective component such as fibromyalgia.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> The patients in the current study had low inflammatory activity as evaluated by objective assessments, and DAPSA scores were found to be strongly associated to TJC and pain. Although pain ideally reflects inflammation, the present discrepancy with US findings may indicate that in this study pain could also have other explanations than inflammation. Earlier investigations have reported discordance between inflammation and pain in RA<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> confirming that decreased inflammation in arthritis is not always associated with decreased pain. A recent study found global pain, joint pain and PGA to be higher in PsA than in RA<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, and in the present study, the levels of PGA and pain were high compared with signs of inflammation including US. It is proposed that PGA and pain are components of DAPSA that account indirectly for skin involvement and axial disease, and thus capture more than just the peripheral joint pathology.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, in our cohort, only one third of the patients had documented axial involvement.</p><p>US is a valid and reliable tool for assessing inflammation in joints, tendons and entheses with comparable sensitivity to MRI.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> US PD may be considered as the best proxy for ongoing inflammation<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#8211;18</xref> and was presently used as the gold standard for inflammation whereas US GS entheseal thickening and hypoechogenicity may also represent chronic pathology rather than only inflammatory activity. In this study, rheumatologists experienced in US performed comprehensive US examinations using a high-end US machine. Thus, we may assume that the present findings reflect the overall inflammatory activity and serve as a good comparator to clinical disease assessments which is also supported by the significant associations between clinical signs of inflammation and US PD scores.</p><p>Recent cross-sectional PsA studies support our findings showing US variables to have only weak associations with clinical assessments, PROMs and DAPSA.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 23 24</xref> Still, it remains open for further research whether US imaging is sensitive enough to detect all the pathological changes in PsA. A recent high-resolution MRI study of fingers in PsA dactylitis has shown inflammatory activity in miniature entheses of flexor tendon pulleys and sheaths.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> These findings confirm the enthesitis as a primary pathological abnormality in PsA. It remains open whether such findings could explain the enhanced pain in other body areas, although studies of axial SpA which used spine MRI for comparison with clinical composite scores found no or minor correlation between these two measures of disease activity.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
</p><p>The treat-to-target strategy principle has remission or LDA as a target which is outlined in the recent treat-to-target recommendations for management of PsA and axial spondyloarthritis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Early suppression of inflammation prevents progression of joint damage and sustains functional ability. Yet, in our study, only one third of the patients reached clinical composite scores remission despite two thirds reached PD remission. This is striking, since US PD remission reflects no inflammatory activity by a comprehensive assessment. In addition, the US PD and DAPSA remission criteria had no significant longitudinal association. Thus, similar to what has been shown in RA, this discordance of clinical composite score remission and US remission seems to reflect different forms of pathologies, at least on a group level.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the longitudinal relationships between clinical and US variables in patients with PsA starting bDMARDs. A major strength of the study is the comprehensive US examination as well as the real-life inclusion of consecutive patients starting bDMARDs. Furthermore, the use of GEE statistical analyses accounted for missing data and within-subject correlations. The limitations include the one centre design which may limit the generalisability of our findings. Another limitation is the lack of randomisation between the current intervention and a control group. Dactylitis was presently not evaluated by US because of no established US definition at study initiation and we did not include skin assessments. Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints were not included since osteoarthritis abnormalities are common in these joints, and these osteoarthritic abnormalities may be difficult to differentiate from PsA. A limitation is the small number of patients included, however, they were all extensively assessed. Another potential limitation is the low level of inflammation in our patients, which could have influenced the associations in the study. Nevertheless, the patients had clinical indication for initiating bDMARD, and they were thus evaluated to have high disease activity. Other disease activity scores like PASDAS and CPDAI would have been relevant to include, but they were published after the initiation of our study.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
</p><p>In conclusion, in our cohort, DAPSA was mainly influenced by TJC and pain and was not associated with US inflammatory findings. These results show a discrepancy between DAPSA and US, indicating that the two assessments may reflect different aspects of disease activity. This observation indicates that US assessment may be complimentary to clinical measures in a treat-to-target strategy in patients with PsA. However, this assumption needs to be tested further in a randomised controlled strategy trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>SP acknowledges the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for a scientific training bursary for 6 months, enabling data entry, statistical analyses and writing the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> HBH, PBK, TKK: were responsible for study design.
