Effective chemotherapy regimens typically combine drugs with distinct mechanisms of action to minimize emergence of resistance. Nevertheless, treatment responses are often highly variable among patients with clinically indistinguishable tumors. For example, while intensive combination chemotherapy cures a substantial fraction of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), front-line therapy fails in 15&#8211;25% of children and 40&#8211;50% of adults with the disease, and these patients have a very poor prognosis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 2009</xref>). Strikingly, chemotherapy resistance in T-ALL often manifests as induction failure (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Oudot et al., 2008</xref>), in which the first cycle of intensive combination chemotherapy fails to induce disease remission. Despite considerable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular transformation, the pathobiology of resistance to conventional chemotherapy remains poorly understood.</p><p>Decreased proliferation rate provides one mechanism for chemotherapy resistance in some contexts. For example, culture of leukemic cells in nonproliferative conditions induces resistance to antimetabolites and vinca alkaloids (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schabel et al., 1965</xref>), and recent work has revealed that relapses can arise from rare hypoproliferative cells in ALL (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ebinger et al., 2016</xref>). However, several drugs with a central role in contemporary T-ALL therapy, such as asparaginase, corticosteroids, and DNA-damaging agents, remain highly active against hypoproliferative leukemic cells (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schabel et al., 1965</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mauer, 1975</xref>). Additionally, some studies of proliferation rate in pretreatment ALL clinical specimens have suggested that chemotherapy resistance is associated with increased, rather than decreased, proliferation (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Scarffe et al., 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dow et al., 1982</xref>). Thus, proliferation rate cannot fully explain primary chemotherapy resistance. Loss-of-function mutations of <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>CDNK2A</italic> have been shown to mediate chemotherapy resistance in model systems (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt et al., 1999</xref>). However, <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are very rare at T-ALL diagnosis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 1994</xref>), whereas <italic>CDKN2A</italic> deletions are common but lack a consistent association with treatment failure (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Rubnitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ramakers-van Woerden et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez et al., 2010</xref>). Drug resistance mutations are identified more commonly at relapse, including <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and activating mutations of the <italic>NT5C2</italic> nucleotidase that induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Tzoneva et al., 2013</xref>), but these are very rare in treatment-naive patients, indicating selection under evolutionary pressure. Thus, the molecular genetics underlying primary chemotherapy resistance in T-ALL remain poorly understood.</p><p>Pretreatment resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis is a cellular phenotype that predicts resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in a range of human cancers (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Vo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bhola et al., 2016</xref>), findings that we extend here to T-ALL. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the striking phenotypic variability in chemotherapy response among patients with seemingly identical tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that loss-of-function mutations in any of three core components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2; <italic>EZH2</italic>, <italic>EED</italic>, or <italic>SUZ12</italic>) are associated with resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis. PRC2 depletion in human T-ALL cells induced resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis induction by multiple antileukemic drugs with distinct mechanisms of action, including dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and vincristine. PRC2 inactivation led to transcriptional up-regulation of the LIM domain transcription factor <italic>CRIP2</italic> and downstream up-regulation of the <italic>TRAP1</italic> gene, which encodes a mitochondrial chaperone protein of the HSP90 family (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Felts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, we found that <italic>TRAP1</italic> overexpression was necessary for induction of chemotherapy resistance downstream of PRC2 inactivation, and pharmacologic inhibition of <italic>TRAP1</italic> synergized with dexamethasone and doxorubicin. These findings demonstrate the prognostic importance of mitochondrial apoptotic priming in T-ALL and implicate mitochondrial chaperone function as a key determinant of chemotherapy response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Mitochondrial apoptosis resistance predicts primary chemotherapy resistance in T-ALL</title><p>To investigate mechanisms underlying phenotypic variability in chemotherapy response, we focused on childhood T-ALL because combination chemotherapy is often curative, but treatment resistance commonly presents as failure of induction chemotherapy (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Oudot et al., 2008</xref>). Induction failure, in which the first cycle of intensive combination chemotherapy fails to induce disease remission, strongly suggests primary or preexisting chemotherapy resistance. To test whether mitochondrial apoptosis resistance predicts T-ALL treatment failure, we analyzed a cohort of T-ALL specimens collected before the initiation of therapy in children treated on contemporary clinical trials (Table S1). BH3 profiling was performed to assess mitochondrial apoptotic priming, based on the ability of a fixed dose of pro-apoptotic peptide encoding the active site of BIM (also known as BCL2L11) to trigger loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</xref>). Resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis was associated with high levels of residual leukemia in the bone marrow at the end of this initial phase of chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), based on the 10% cutoff that most robustly predicts outcome in a large cohort of childhood T-ALL (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2014</xref>). To assess whether mitochondrial apoptosis resistance predicts survival, we classified patients into apoptosis-sensitive or apoptosis-resistant groups based on whether they were above or below the median mitochondrial depolarization by BH3 profiling. Mitochondrial apoptosis resistance predicted significantly inferior event-free survival (65% versus 91% at 5 yr; P <italic>=</italic> 0.0376; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), as well as a trend toward inferior overall survival that did not reach statistical significance (78% versus 96% at 5 yr; P <italic>=</italic> 0.091; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

To investigate underlying mechanisms, we began by applying targeted exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) to all cases with sufficient available material (Tables S1 and S3&#8211;S6) The best-known regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis are genes of the BCL2 family (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Davids and Letai, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>), but RNA-seq revealed no difference in expression of any of the known pro- or antiapoptotic BCL2 family genes between apoptosis-sensitive versus resistant primary patient samples (Fig. S1 A).

An additional four cases harbored missense or splice region variants of unknown significance.

In this larger cohort, 22 of 107 T-ALL cases (20.5%) harbored PRC2 mutations.

Thus, PRC2 function is a key molecular determinant of treatment response in T-ALL. PRC2 haploinsufficiency was sufficient to induce apoptosis resistance in nontransformed T cell progenitors, suggesting that chemotherapy resistance can evolve before oncogenic transformation. These findings thus provide a model in which the mutational path to T cell transformation, which evolves in the absence of chemotherapy-induced selective pressure, can nevertheless result in the formation of a highly chemoresistant leukemic clone if the genetic lesions acquired result in high-level resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis.</p><p>We found that PRC2 mutations predict early treatment failure in independent cohorts of childhood T-ALL, in line with the previously reported association of EZH2 inactivation with treatment failure in T-ALL (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">G&#246;llner et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, this association was not observed in a recent whole genome&#8211;sequencing study of T-ALL (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), but cases of primary chemotherapy resistance appear to have been excluded from this study because their post-chemotherapy specimens harbored leukemia, and there was no alternative source of germline DNA available for the whole genome&#8211;sequencing approach applied. It will be of considerable interest to prospectively validate the ability of PRC2 mutations to predict primary chemotherapy resistance in future clinical trials.</p><p>Deletion of PRC2 genes induced apoptosis resistance at late double-negative stages of T cell development, but not in more mature T cell progenitors. PRC2 function can be highly context dependent for reasons that are not well understood, even in seemingly related cell types. For example, while EZH2 is a tumor suppressor in immature lymphocytes of the T cell lineage (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Danis et al., 2016</xref>), it functions as a driver oncogene in B-lineage lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Souroullas et al., 2016</xref>). In T cell progenitors, we note that the switch from PRC2-dependent to PRC2-independent regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis occurs in association with profound changes in regulation of apoptosis by TCR signaling. Thus, one speculative possibility is that loss of PRC2-dependent transcriptional repression may potentiate preTCR-driven survival signaling in double-negative T cell progenitors, where this triggers antiapoptotic signals. As these cells mature, PRC2 loss may cease to be antiapoptotic as part of the switch to negative selection, where TCR signaling becomes pro-apoptotic (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data do not rule out a role for differential induction of BCL2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic priming by chemotherapeutics as an additional determinant of treatment response. However, our findings implicate <italic>TRAP1</italic> up-regulation as one important mechanism linking PRC2 loss to induction of mitochondrial apoptosis resistance in T-ALL. Indeed, TRAP1 was required for the induction of resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis upon PRC2 depletion, and pharmacologic TRAP1 inhibition synergized with dexamethasone and doxorubicin, antileukemic drugs with distinct mechanisms of action. TRAP1 is an HSP90 family chaperone that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and inter-membrane space (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pridgeon et al., 2007</xref>). TRAP1 inhibits a nonapoptotic, caspase-independent form of cell death termed mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2007</xref>) and has also been shown to inhibit some features of mitochondrial apoptosis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pridgeon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Costantino et al., 2009</xref>). While mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis and BCL2-regulated mitochondrial apoptosis are distinct cell death pathways (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baines et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Galluzzi et al., 2015</xref>), these do share some cellular machinery (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Karch et al., 2013</xref>), and it will be of interest to define precisely how TRAP1 regulates mitochondrial apoptosis.</p><p>The broad range of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics used for T-ALL therapy are used in combination because their distinct mechanisms of action impair emergence of resistance. However, our findings suggest that their antileukemic activity nevertheless converges on a common downstream pathway, mitochondrial apoptosis, whose impairment is sufficient to simultaneously induce resistance to all chemotherapeutics that we tested. Our data implicate up-regulation of the LIM domain transcription factor CRIP2, and downstream activation of TRAP1 chaperone functions as a key mediator of apoptosis resistance and clinical response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. These findings suggest that the clinical development of TRAP1 inhibitors may provide a therapeutic strategy to specifically reverse apoptosis resistance and improve clinical outcomes for patients with high-risk subsets of T-ALL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>Patient samples</title><p>113 diagnostic T-ALL samples were obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of children before the initiation of chemotherapy from children with newly diagnosed T-ALL enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Study 05-001 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Place et al., 2015</xref>) or Children&#8217;s Oncology Group (COG) Study AALL0434.

Samples were treated with Ambion Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to yield DNA contamination below 10%. 3 &#956;l of 1:10 ERCC spike-in controls (Ambion; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to 5,000 ng of RNA. Quality of RNA was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Library preparation and sequencing were performed as for the T-ALL patient samples, as described above.</p><p>RNA sequences were aligned with STAR aligner (version 2.3.1z4) against the hg19 w ERCC92 genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/</ext-link>). The RUV-Seq package was used to normalize to spike-in controls. FeatureCounts software was used to produce integer counts (raw read counts) for all genes in the supplied genome annotation file, which were then normalized using DESeq package, and these normalized read counts are shown in Table S7. Two control shRNAs (shLuciferase; shGFP) were compared with six PRC2 shRNA (shEZH2 no. 1, shEZH2 no. 4, shEED no. 2, shEED no. 5, shSUZ12 no. 2, and shSUZ12 no. 3), using DESeq2 analysis. Genes that were significantly up-regulated following PRC2 depletion were defined based on log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &gt;0.45 and nominal P value &lt;0.02, as calculated by DESeq2 analysis, and the heat map was generated using GENE-E.

In brief, CCRF-CEM cells transduced with shRNA-targeting control (Luciferase) or EZH2 were cross-linked using formaldehyde, and sonication was performed to fragment chromatin to 200&#8211;700-bp size range using a Covaris E220 Focused-ultrasonicator. Immunoprecipitation was then performed on five million cells with anti-H3K4me3 antibody (no. 39155; Active Motif), which was validated as described (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Knoechel et al., 2014</xref>). Protein A/G dynabeads were used to pull down antibody-bound chromatin, followed by washing and elution. Cross-linking was reversed with proteinase K treatment, and DNA was cleaned up using Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization beads (Beckman Coulter). ChIP DNA was quantified using the Qubit system (Invitrogen). Sequencing libraries for ChIP-seq were prepared according to Illumina&#8217;s instructions. ChIP DNA and input were sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq 500 platfom. ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using BWA (version 0.7.13; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) with default parameters and duplicated reads were filtered out with Picard. Reads with &lt;20 bases of mapping quality were removed from the alignment. ChIP peaks for H3K27me3 were called by Homer (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) using default parameters requiring putative peak to have threefold more normalized tags in the ChIP experiment than the input and a cumulative poisson P value threshold of 0.001. Putative peaks that were identified in regions of genomic duplication or repeat elements were filtered out. Note that there were no significant peaks identified in CCRF-CEM cells transduced with shEZH2, indicating that EZH2 is the primary H3K27me3 &#8220;writer&#8221; in these cells. ChIP-seq peaks were called significant if the maximum peak intensity was &gt; 0.7, a cutoff verified by manual examination of peaks using Integrative Genomics Viewer version 2.3.93.

After 8 d of puromycin selection, treatment with vehicle (DMSO) or the indicated doses of gamitrinib was performed for 48 h, after which cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Synergy of gamitrinib in combination with dexamethasone or doxorubicin was tested in CCRF-CEM cells infected with shEZH2 no. 1 selected for 8 d in puromycin. In brief, 5,000 cells were plated in 384-well format using a Biotek MicroFlo Select Dispenser. Drug concentration combinations, across a serial twofold dilution range around previously determined IC50 concentrations, were plated in quadruplicate onto the cells using a Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent). Viability was then assessed after 48 h of treatment using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). The Chou-Talalay method was used to calculate combination indexes of the fractional inhibition using CompuSyn software.
