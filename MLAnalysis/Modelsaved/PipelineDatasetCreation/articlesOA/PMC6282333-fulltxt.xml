There are four cultivated cotton species: two diploid species (<italic>Gossypium herbaceum</italic> L. and <italic>G. arboreum</italic> L.) and two tetraploid species (<italic>G. hirsutum</italic> L. and <italic>G. barbadense</italic> L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Upland cotton (<italic>G. hirsutum</italic> L.) accounts for more than 95% of cotton production worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Another cultivated tetraploid species, referred to as Egyptian, Pima or Sea-Island cotton (<italic>G. barbadense</italic> L.), exhibits superior extra-long fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cotton fibers are the longest and fastest-growing cells in plants, and each cotton fiber consists of a single cell generated from the epidermal layer of the ovule (seed). Cotton fiber development mainly comprises four distinct, but overlapping stages: initiation, fast elongation, secondary wall thickening and maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The elongation of fibers occurs after initiation and lasts until 25&#8211;30&#8201;days post anthesis (DPA), which determines the ultimate fiber length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is known that quantitative traits such FL are affected by genotype (G), environment (E) and genotype by environment interactions (G&#8201;&#215;&#8201;E). For example, significant E and G&#8201;&#215;&#8201;E were reported for FL by Huang et al. who tested 503 upland cotton accessions in eight environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and by Sun et al. who tested 719 upland cotton accessions in eight environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, numerous genes are found preferentially and differentially expressed during fiber development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, genotypes with the same final fiber length might have different genes and gene expression profiles during fiber elongation. The pyramiding of these different fiber genes from the genotypes with the same fiber length might further enhance fiber length in new breeding lines. However, the genetic basis of dynamic fiber elongation in cotton is currently unknown.</p><p id="Par14">FL is among the most important fiber-quality traits, and the selection of long-fiber cultivars is therefore important for the textile industry. Mature FL is a complex trait controlled by a multitude of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Previous studies have dissected the genetic architecture of FL through traditional QTL linkage mapping using bi-parental populations, and approximately 120 QTLs for FL traits have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, most of the QTLs obtained from interspecific populations are not directly applicable to upland cotton improvement because they are localized in very large genetic regions, and most are not stable across different populations; moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the QTLs are unclear. In contrast to QTL linkage mapping, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) can effectively associate genotypes with phenotypes in a natural population and can simultaneously detect many natural allelic variations. With the development of technologies for sequencing cotton genomes, GWAS has been successfully applied to the genetic dissection of fiber quality traits, including FL. Based on the resequencing of markers, seven and three FL QTLs were identified in 318 and 352 diverse <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> accessions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, 503 and 719 diverse <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> accessions were individually genotyped using the Cotton 63&#8201;K Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, resulting in the identification of 11 and 20 significant SNPs, respectively, associated with the FL trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Because almost all of the FL QTLs identified to date in cotton are for mature fibers, it is currently unknown when and how these QTLs act during the fiber elongation stage. An analysis of phenotypic data at multiple developmental stages can aid the identification of stage-specific QTLs and consistent QTLs across stages for the trait of interest, such as FL. Furthermore, such an approach might uncover new QTLs that were not previously identified at the harvest stage. In fact, QTLs related to important agronomic traits in cotton, such as boll number, plant height and flowering timing, have been detected at different developmental time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the phenotypic value of FL is normally measured at the maturity stage, which ignores the dynamic elongation process of FL with respect to gene-specific expression at different fiber developmental time points. For example, some genes related to fiber development, such as GhPK6, GhJAZ2 and GhCaM7-like, are selectively expressed during different fiber-growth periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying FL at different developmental time points will aid the elucidation of the mechanism of fiber elongation. Currently, there is a lack of work in reporting QTLs for fiber length at different fiber developmental stages and growth rate in fiber length.</p><p id="Par16">Previous GWAS reports used approximately 300&#8211;700 diverse upland cotton accessions from China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Based on the mature FL data of the most of the upland cotton accessions from public databases and our lab, we selected 83 representative upland cotton lines with a wide range variation of mature FL from different sources or pedigrees. The accession number would allow sampling developing fibers in multiple timepoints during fiber development, because the task in harvesting ovules and collecting developing fibers is a time-consuming and laborious process. The accessions were grown at a single, representative cotton production location (Anyang, Henan province) of the Yellow River Valley for 3&#8201;years (2014, 2015 and 2016) to measure FL at five different fiber developmental time points (10, 15, 20, and 25 DPA and maturity). The genotypes of the accessions were determined using the Cotton 63&#8201;K Illumina SNP array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The aim of this study was to detect dynamic QTLs for FL in upland cotton.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par17">A total of 83 upland cotton lines were selected based on a previous GWAS involving approximately 300&#8211;700 diverse upland cotton accessions from China, and the seeds were obtained from the National Cotton Germplasm Collections of the Low-temperature Germplasm Gene Bank of the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CRI-CAAS) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

This result indicates that examining the continual developmental of FL traits contributed to the identification of more QTLs. <italic>H</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> was less than 50% at 10 and 15 DPA, indicating that fiber growth is susceptible to the environment at these two time-points, which likely explains why fewer SNPs were detected at 10 and 15 DPA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Identification and reverification of SNP loci in BILs and previous studies</title><p id="Par40">There is an increasing trend of researchers jointly using multi-genetic background populations to verify the reliability of GWAS results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. For example, a natural association panel and two nested association mapping (NAM) populations were employed for a GWAS of flowering time in maize, and the relevant SNPs indicated high validity for the verification of flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. To analyze the boll number per plant (BNP) in cotton, two corresponding BILs and two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were used for genetic analysis, and 48 potential QTLs for BNP were detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the present study, a natural population was employed for a GWAS of the dynamic FL trait in cotton. Among the 60 significantly associated SNP loci identified in the GWAS analysis, seven SNPs showed polymorphism in the parents of the BILs. To further verify the reliability of the significantly associated SNP loci, 176 BILs were used for HRM analysis. The re-verified SNP i20432Gh was significantly correlated with FL at maturity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5). In the current study, significant correlations of the i60962Gt SNP with FL at maturity were verified in 503 and 719 diverse upland cotton accessions (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). qFL20.1, which is located just 0.50&#8201;Mb from i20045Gh, showed a significant correlation with FL at maturity in 180 recombinant inbred lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, the SNPs identified in FL-QTL-1, FL-QTL-5, FL-QTL-11, FL-QTL-14 and FL-QTL-20 were located in hotspots for FL traits reported in previous studies (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). These data suggest that the results of our GWAS for developing fibers are reliable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Mining candidate genes for improving FL in upland cotton</title><p id="Par41">A combined analysis of KEGG pathways and transcriptome sequencing data revealed a number of candidate genes for fiber elongation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S6). The expression in developing cotton fibers of two of these genes, D10G1008 and D13G2037, differed significantly between two long-fiber cotton varieties and two short-fiber cotton varieties. D10G1008 on Dt10 is homologous to AT4G39490 (alkane hydroxylase MAH1-like). Alkane hydroxylase MAH1-like is a member of the cytochrome P450 family and plays a key role in the biosynthesis of secondary alcohols or ketones. The overexpression of MAH1 leads to an increase in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs, C24:0 and C30:0) in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and saturated VLCFAs promote cotton fiber cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Notably, the expression of D10G1008 was significantly higher in the long-fiber varieties Msco-12 and EJing55173 than in the short-fiber varieties JiShengNaiYan79202 and ShaCheTuMian (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). This result supports the possibility that D10G1008 promotes fiber elongation by increasing the level of VLCFAs. The D13G2037 gene, located simultaneously in the FL-qtl-21 and AGR-qtl-5 confidence intervals, encodes sucrose synthase 4 (Susy4) in Arabidopsis. Cotton fiber mainly consists of cellulose and sucrose, and its development results from sucrose decomposition and cellulose biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Susy activity plays an important role in cellulose synthesis by providing the UDP-glucose substrate, which is essential for cell thickening and cotton fiber cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In developing cotton fibers (10, 15, 20 and 25 DPA), D13G2037 shows high and gradually increasing expression, but its expression in the long-fiber varieties was lower than that in the short-fiber varieties, and this difference approached statistical significance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). This result might support the possibility that a certain range of D13G2037 expression promotes fiber elongation, whereas excessive expression might accelerate or alter the transition from the fast-elongation stage to the cell wall-thickening stage, resulting in a shorter fiber.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">This study provides the first developmental quantitative trait locus mapping of FL in upland cotton. A total of 15,369 SNP markers were genotyped in upland cotton using the Cotton 63&#8201;K Illumina SNP array, and these were employed in a GWAS of dynamic FL. In total, 21 QTLs related to dynamic FL were identified: seven of these have been verified in recent studies, and the other 14 QTLs were first identified in the present study. Two candidate genes, D10G1008 and D13G2037, were verified through qRT-PCR among four cultivars at the 10 to 25 DPA developmental stages of fiber, and these can be exploited to alter fiber development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
