In a prospective multisite study across Subsaharan Africa, we analyzed metabolic profiles in serum and plasma from HIV-negative, TB-exposed individuals who either progressed to TB 3&#8211;24 months post-exposure (progressors) or remained healthy (controls). We generated a trans-African metabolic biosignature for TB, which identifies future progressors both on blinded test samples and in external data sets and shows a performance of 69% sensitivity at 75% specificity in samples within 5 months of diagnosis. These prognostic metabolic signatures are consistent with development of subclinical disease prior to manifestation of active TB. Metabolic changes associated with pre-symptomatic disease are observed as early as 12 months prior to TB diagnosis, thus enabling timely interventions to prevent disease progression and transmission.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The tuberculosis pandemic requires new methods for diagnosing and containing infections prior to active disease.

A quarter of the world&#8217;s population is estimated to be latently infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), and of these, less than 10% will develop active TB disease during their lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, the risk of TB incidence is 10-fold higher in individuals within the first year after infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Novel, cost-effective tools for control of TB must include not only new and improved drugs and vaccines, but also assays for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Defining biomarkers for risk of disease coupled with early and accurate TB diagnosis will enable strategies for prevention and early treatment to prevent progression to advanced disease pathology as well as transmission. Moreover, identifying infected people at high risk of developing TB will facilitate targeted enrollment into drug trials and post-exposure vaccine trials, thus profoundly reducing the&#160;number of study participants and trial costs and duration.</p><p id="Par5">Until recently, the only measurable biomarkers associated with increased risk of developing TB were positive TST or IGRA test results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, these tests have poor specificity for identifying incident TB as over 95% of HIV-negative and ~70% of HIV-positive individuals with TST/IGRA positivity never progress to active TB disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Mass preventive therapy based on IGRA/TST screening in TB endemic countries would therefore require treatment of 50&#8211;80% of the population. This translates to treatment of an estimated 85 people with latent TB to prevent a single case of active TB according to currently available IGRA tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, thus putting many healthy individuals at unnecessary risk of adverse events. Such a strategy would neither be cost-effective nor feasible and would not prevent re-infection in high-incidence situations. This was demonstrated by the Thibela trial which enrolled South African mine workers in a setting with an 89% prevalence of latent MTB infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> but mass isoniazid preventive therapy did not reduce TB incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The Grand Challenges in Global Health GC6-74 project (GC6 project) was initiated in 2003 with the goal of identifying TB biomarkers with prognostic potential. The study encompassed 4462 HIV-negative participants across multiple African field sites (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), reflecting different regions and ethnicities. All participants were household contacts of newly diagnosed TB index cases and were followed for 2 years post-exposure, with blood samples taken at enrollment and at specified follow-up time points. This design provided a unique opportunity to investigate the prospective risk of TB in exposed individuals. The collection of samples from South, West, and East African field sites allowed for comparisons between sites and development of a trans-African biosignature.</p><p id="Par7">Blood transcriptomic biomarkers of TB that discriminate patients from healthy individuals have been identified in several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In a recent prospective study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a 16-gene transcriptomic signature was identified in the Adolescent Cohort Study (ACS) with the power to predict progression to active TB. The signature was validated with samples from two African sites from the GC6 project showing a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 80% in the 12 months preceding the diagnosis of TB. In further pursuance of a transcriptomic risk signature, a combination of 2 gene pairs was found to predict risk of TB at 62% sensitivity and 63% specificity in the tested population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In another promising approach on the same cohort, circulating miRNAs from serum samples were shown to similarly approach 65% specificity at 62% sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Metabolic profiling has been successfully applied for biomarker discovery in several non-communicable diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, but rarely in infectious diseases. To our knowledge, no studies thus far have demonstrated the capability of metabolic profiling in predicting progression to an infectious disease in samples from healthy donors. In TB, metabolic profiling was found to discriminate between TB patients and healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and our previous study identified a metabolomic biosignature which discriminates patients from healthy controls with remarkably high accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (AUC&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.98; 95% CI: 0.97&#8211;1.00).</p><p id="Par9">Here, we investigated longitudinal changes in metabolic profiles in serum and plasma from household contacts of adults with pulmonary TB who either remained healthy (controls) or developed TB (progressors) and applied machine learning techniques to discover metabolite signatures that predict risk of progression to TB across Africa. Amongst recruited individuals, 2.2% progressed to TB (progressors) whilst the rest remained asymptomatic until the end of the 2 years observation period (controls). All analyzed blood samples from household contacts were collected before TB diagnosis and therefore represent clinically asymptomatic individuals.</p><p id="Par10">Two hypotheses were tested: (i) are there metabolites that can predict progression from infection to TB; and, if yes, (ii) does prediction rely on innate metabolic risk factors, or on metabolic processes occurring during disease progression? Accordingly, predictive metabolites fell into the following classes: (a) metabolites that reflect baseline (BL) risk factors and show a consistently significant difference between progressors and controls. We term these risk-associated metabolites, as these indicate a higher likelihood of progression to TB; (b) metabolites predictive of active TB, which show time-dependent differences between study groups, indicating progression to disease. We term these disease-associated metabolites, as the absolute difference in abundances between progressors and controls increases towards clinical manifestation of TB implying that these metabolites are indicators of the host response to subclinical TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study cohorts</title><p id="Par11">To aid the detection of biomarkers which would be potentially applicable across the African continent, study participants were recruited at field sites in East, West, and South Africa (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram for the study.

Having identified a metabolic signature of risk for TB which increased during TB progression, we asked whether there is a common biological denominator between progression toward TB and clinically apparent TB. We hypothesized that in such a case, the changes of metabolites that we have previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> for TB could also predict risk of progression from infection to disease. To test this, we used the data set from healthy individuals and tuberculosis patients described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This data set is referred hereafter as TB-HEALTHY data set.</p><p id="Par24">We first asked whether the models derived from all individuals in the GC6-74 training set (model Total) can also correctly classify patients suffering from TB even though all individuals in the GC6 training set were asymptomatic.

Indeed, our Total model discriminated healthy individuals from active TB cases (AUC 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87&#8211;0.97; Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Furthermore, we asked the reverse question, whether metabolite profiles of TB patient samples can be used to predict progression toward disease in healthy individuals. Here, we tested a model derived from TB-HEALTHY on the prospective GC6-74 samples (both training and test samples, since the TB-HEALTHY data set is completely independent). Serum metabolite levels from 44 TB patients and 92 controls from the TB-HEALTHY data set were used to train a random forest classifier, which was then directly applied to the longitudinal data from the present study.</p><p id="Par26">The TB-HEALTHY signature was significantly predictive for the GC6-74 data (overall AUC 0.68; 95% CI: 0.64&#8211;0.73, corresponding to 50% sensitivity at 75% specificity) and similarly showed a stronger performance for proximate samples (overall AUC 0.82; 95% CI: 0.75&#8211;0.89, 73% sensitivity at 75% specificity; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

Two metabolites were differentially abundant at times far from diagnosis of active TB (Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

Biosignatures that indicate risk factors or signs of &#8220;preclinical TB&#8221; in otherwise healthy individuals could be harnessed for early treatment to prevent clinical disease and dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that changes in serum or plasma abundances of small metabolic compounds identify individuals who progressed to clinical TB. The magnitudes of these changes increased as disease onset approached. Several metabolites associated with TB progression in this study had been found previously to differ between TB patients and healthy individuals in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. By comparing TB patients with patients suffering from other pulmonary diseases, we here demonstrate that these metabolite differences are specific to TB. Accordingly, the identified metabolomic signatures demonstrate specific and robust performance in predicting subclinical TB and progression to active TB.</p><p id="Par41">We further demonstrate the utility of metabolic profiling for predicting progression to TB by successful application of a TB diagnostic signature derived from an independent study cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Both the descriptive analysis of changes of serum abundances and the comparison of the machine learning models show that changes in concentrations of metabolites in progressors were well aligned to differences in these metabolites between TB patients and healthy individuals. This strongly supports the hypothesis that metabolic profiling identifies subclinical TB. In fact, for proximate samples, at 75% specificity, the sensitivity of these models approached (TB-HEALTHY, 73%) or exceeded (TB-ORD, 76%) the proposed requirements for a target product profile for the development of a test for predicting progression to active TB disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par42">Interestingly, the performance of models based on external data sets was better than that of the models derived from the progressors vs. controls of the GC6 cohort. This can be explained as follows: the signature derived from asymptomatic individuals is based on a less pronounced phenotype of a slowly emerging TB, which might lead to a noisy signature. In contrast, a clearly defined signature based on TB patients who all show the molecular markers of symptomatic, clinical TB performs well when applied to noisy data. A similar phenomenon has been observed for transcriptomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, where the more pronounced TB signatures from HIV-positive&#160;patients performed better even when applied to the noisier data from HIV-negative patients.</p><p id="Par43">Despite differences in sample type, life style, genotype, diet, etc. between the different cohorts, a single predictive metabolic signature predicted progression across these cohorts and populations. Consistent with this, the TB-HEALTHY signature derived from a cohort in South Africa showed a strong performance when applied to proximate samples from The Gambia (AUC: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75&#8211;0.96) and Ethiopia (AUC: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.75&#8211;1.00).</p><p id="Par44">In this study, we have not included HIV-positive individuals by design, even though the interplay between these two diseases plays a&#160;pivotal role in TB epidemiology. It is unknown to what extent the presence of opportunistic infections and the perturbed immune responses associated with HIV infection will alter the predictive signatures. However, previous studies show hardly any overlap between the TB and HIV metabolic profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, with plasma glutamate being the only biomarker common for both TB and HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par45">While both tuberculin skin test positive (TST<sup>+</sup>) and negative (TST<sup>&#8722;</sup>) individuals were enrolled in the study, we observed less than 10 conversion events in the whole study and could not find any conclusive evidence for a link between TST conversion and metabolite profiling (see &#8220;Methods&#8221; for details).</p><p id="Par46">Temporal changes in metabolite levels between progressors and healthy controls were concordant with the hypothesis that metabolic profiling detects subclinical disease in progressors, rather than capturing a set of stable risk-associated markers. For example, the abundances of amino acids that were previously shown to be decreased in TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> showed a gradual decline in progressor samples approaching clinical diagnosis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This has been further corroborated by comparing the signatures of progressors with the signatures of TB patients, suggesting a quantitative rather than qualitative change from the subclinical stage of TB development preceding clinical diagnosis to clinical TB, at least at the molecular level.</p><p id="Par47">In contrast to metabolites characteristic for TB, cotinine and mannose were detected at elevated levels irrespective of time to TB onset. As a nicotine metabolite, cotinine is associated with smoking, a well defined risk factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> for the development of active TB and can act synergistically on disease risk with alcohol consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The higher basal levels of cotinine and related metabolites corresponds to the fact that reported smoking was higher in the progressors from the South African cohort than in the predominantly Muslim population of The Gambia. Interestingly, the levels of cotinine approached the levels in the healthy population at time of TB diagnosis, which tempts us to speculate that smoking intensity decreases with disease progression. While cotinine as a biomarker is redundant (as it merely reflects smoking status), it does serve as a positive control, demonstrating that risk factors can be identified with our approach.</p><p id="Par48">Mannose, another metabolite showing differences between progressors and controls irrespective of time to diagnosis, plays a central role in mammalian energy generation and regulation, and can have both beneficial and detrimental effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The consistently elevated levels of mannose in progressors may hint to an impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and could even be associated with an inherent risk of developing type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> in these individuals. The observation of differences in&#160;mannose and cotinine levels&#160;at basal time points emphasizes that metabolic markers of risk could be detected by metabolic profiling.</p><p id="Par49">C-glycosyltryptophan has previously been observed to be negatively correlated with lung function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The progressors in our study showed significant differences in the abundance of this compound during the time prior to diagnosis. This might reflect impaired lung function as a result of inflammatory responses during disease progression.</p><p id="Par50">Decreasing glutamine levels are observed under inflammatory conditions and this nonessential amino acid may become essential during infection and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, such that dietary supplementation of glutamine can be beneficial in some patient populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

In this respect, the gradual drop in glutamine levels observed in progressors likely reflects increasingly exacerbated lung pathology in these individuals.</p><p id="Par51">Changes in amino acid and cortisol levels can be detected as early as 12 months before disease onset, becoming even more prominent toward clinical diagnosis of TB. We conclude that manifestation of active TB is the apex of a prolonged process which remains subclinical for many&#160;months. Since these metabolomic changes can already be detected during the asymptomatic phase, metabolic profiling allows stratification of TB risk in individuals with latent TB into high- and low-risk individuals, as was recently shown for blood transcriptomic signatures of TB risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The metabolomic signatures identified here can potentially be combined with transcriptomic signatures to further improve sensitivity and specificity of TB risk prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This signature can identify high-risk individuals in the absence of available sputum for microbiological diagnosis, facilitating treatment prior to development of disease pathology when the bacterial load and the likelihood of disease transmission is low. A proof of concept trial is currently underway stratifying participants based on the 16-gene transcriptomic correlate of risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> to test its potential for targeted intervention (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02735590). While the development of a diagnostic test for a metabolite can be a costly process, such tests are already&#160;available for a number of relevant compounds such as cortisol.</p><p id="Par52">Along with identifying high-risk individuals for prophylactic treatment, these risk signatures have potential value for clinical trials of new intervention measures. Selecting such individuals for participation has the potential to increase the power and benefit of clinical trials, reducing participant numbers, and trial duration, thereby lowering trial cost and increasing trial effectiveness. Furthermore, the biological insights provided by metabolic profiling in addition to peripherial blood transcriptomics may aid in the development of host-directed therapies.</p><p id="Par53">Undoubtedly, before practical point-of-care application of a metabolomic signature further studies are needed. An important consideration for metabolomic studies is the availability of inexpensive quantitative procedures for the metabolites of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. As some of these are readily available (e.g., cortisol), a follow-up study should focus on those metabolites which can be determined by simple procedures, using our data set as a guide line.</p><p id="Par54">Furthermore, our study did not include samples from the progressors collected after clinical diagnosis and instead relied on separate data sets which included TB patients. Hence, a detailed time course characterization of patients before clinical diagnosis as well as during and after treatment would be an important step to corroborate our results and to progress toward practical implementation of a metabolic signature.</p><p id="Par55">Blood metabolomic profiles are not exclusively dependent on processes ongoing in peripheral blood cells, but can also provide biological information on host&#8211;pathogen interplay at the site of disease and in other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We are confident that a trans-African prognostic signature for TB consisting of disease-associated and specific metabolites can be constructed.

Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e., non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled human plasma samples (median RSD&#8201;=&#8201;9&#8211;12%; <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;several hundred metabolites, depending on the matrix tested). Experimental samples and controls were randomized across the platform run.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p id="Par71">For non-targeted MS analysis, extracts were subjected to either UPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS. The chromatography was standardized and, once the method was validated, no further changes were made. As part of Metabolon&#8217;s general practice, all columns were purchased from a single manufacturer&#8217;s lot at the outset of experiments. All solvents were similarly purchased in bulk from a single manufacturer&#8217;s lot in sufficient quantity to complete all related experiments. For each sample, vacuum-dried samples were dissolved in injection solvent containing eight or more injection standards at fixed concentrations, depending on the platform. The internal standards were used both to assure injection and chromatographic consistency. Instruments were tuned and calibrated for mass resolution and mass accuracy daily.</p><p id="Par72">The UPLC-MS/MS platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> utilized a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution. The sample extract was dried then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each method. Each reconstitution solvent contained a series of standards at fixed concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic, positive ion-optimized conditions (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Pos&#8221;), and the other using basic, negative ion-optimized conditions (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Neg&#8221;) in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;100&#8201;mm, 1.7&#8201;&#181;m). Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient-eluted using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, while the basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5&#8201;mM ammonium bicarbonate. For the TB-ORD samples (i.e., TB vs. other respiratory diseases), one aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions, chromatographically optimized for more hydrophilic compounds (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Pos Early&#8221;). In this method, the extract was gradient-eluted from a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;100&#8201;mm, 1.7&#8201;&#181;m) using water and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). Another aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions; however, it was chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Pos Late&#8221;). In this method, the extract was gradient-eluted from the same aforementioned C18 column using methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA, and 0.01% FA and was operated at an overall higher organic content. Another aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion optimized conditions using a separate dedicated C18 column (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Neg&#8221;). The basic extracts were gradient-eluted from the column using methanol and water, however with 6.5&#8201;mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (&#8220;UPLC-MS/MS Polar&#8221; Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;150&#8201;mm, 1.7&#8201;&#181;m) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10&#8201;mM Ammonium Formate, pH 10.8. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion.

Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% phenyldimethyl silicone column with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60&#176; to 340&#8201;&#176;C within a 17-min period. All samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ MS operated at unit mass resolving power with electron impact (EI) ionization and a 50&#8211;750 atomic mass unit scan range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Compound identification, quantification, and data curation</title><p id="Par74">Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Identification of known chemical entities is based on comparison with a spectral library of &gt;4000 purified chemical standards. Commercially available purified standard compounds have been acquired and registered into LIMS for distribution to the UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS platforms for determination of their detectable characteristics.

These compounds have the potential to be identified by future acquisition of a matching purified standard or by classical structural analysis.</p><p id="Par75">Peaks were quantified using area-under-the-curve. Raw area counts for each metabolite in each sample were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences by the median value for each run-day, therefore, setting the medians to 1.0 for each run. This preserved variation between samples but allowed metabolites of widely different raw peak areas to be compared on a similar graphical scale. Missing values were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Primary data</title><p id="Par76">Metabolic profiling was carried out for each site, using either serum or plasma samples. For a small number of samples, an insufficient amount of plasma was available, so the sample was diluted using RPMI buffer. The sample types taken from each study site are described in Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>. Metabolic profiling was carried out by Metabolon Inc. The metabolic profiles identified a total of 1701 unique metabolites. See Supplementary Data for details.

Based on the training set results, we put forward the hypothesis that we observe markers of progression toward TB rather than risk-associated factors, and accordingly planned the evaluation of the blinded set. Models were proposed and applied to the blinded test set. After unblinding, the performance of the prediction was evaluated for the regression models and repeated for the full dataset (as they were considered to have a primarily exploratory function).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Machine learning</title><p id="Par79">We selected random forest machine learning because we have previously successfully applied these approaches to discriminate TB cases from healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We used the random forest machine learning algorithm as implemented in the R package randomForest 4.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The cross-validation within a dataset was a modified k-fold procedure, in which all samples associated with an individual were removed in the cross-validation process. When models were trained and tested on different sample types (e.g., plasma samples were used to train a model and serum samples were used to test the model), the model was trained only on features which were found in both training and test sets, therefore the number of features may differ depending on the test set.

The algorithms chosen were random forests (caret&#160;&#8211;&#160;rf), generalized boosted models (caret&#160;&#8211;&#160;gbm), neural networks (caret&#160;&#8211;&#160;nnet), and elastic-net logistic regression (caret&#160;&#8211;&#160;glmnet). Each of these algorithms were trained on the entire training set, and performance evaluated using the LOOCV procedure described above. Model metabolites were ranked using the caret:varImp function, which uses model-specific methods to rank features. Random forest and boosted model importance was calculated as the increase in mean standard error on permutation of the metabolite, linear model importance was the magnitude of the metabolite coefficients, and neural network importance was calculated using Garson&#8217;s algorithm to infer metabolite importance through network weights. After calculating variable importance for machine learning algorithms trained on all metabolites, models were retrained on the top 200 metabolites and importance recalculated. This was repeated recursively to create models with 100, 50, 25, and 10 metabolites. An optimal non site-specific small model was selected by only considering models with 50 or fewer metabolites, and calculating LOOCV AUCs for each site individually. The final model was selected by considering the poorest site-specific AUC from each model, i.e., the minimum site-specific AUC. The model with the highest minimum site-specific AUC was selected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par81">For each of the three sample types (plasma, serum, and plamsa diluted with RPMI), we removed metabolites with zero variance or without identification and selected only metabolites found in all three sample types.
