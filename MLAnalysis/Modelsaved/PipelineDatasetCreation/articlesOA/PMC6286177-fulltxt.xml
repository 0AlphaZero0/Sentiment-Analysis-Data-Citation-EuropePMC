However, it is unknown whether this arises from mutations in individual strains leading to curli expression or by selection for individuals already expressing higher levels of curli. To test this, we examined curli production in pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933 as a function of manure management. Five treatments were investigated: (1) soil only, (2) soil with surface-applied <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933 &#916;<italic>stx</italic><sub>1-2</sub> (EcO157), (3) soil with incorporated EcO157, (4) soil with surface-applied EcO157-inoculated manure, and (5) soil with incorporated EcO157-inoculated manure. EcO157 was reisolated from soils immediately after application and weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. EcO157 in the surface-applied treatments died faster than their incorporated treatment counterparts. Phenotypic assays revealed differences between treatments as well. Half of surface-applied manure reisolates from week 6 developed a mixed red and white colony morphology on Congo Red plates, indicating changes in curli production that were not seen in other treatments or times. In 37&#176;C growth tests, week 6 reisolates from all treatments except soil surface-applied EcO157 left the lag phase at a significantly greater rate than week 0 isolates. We applied whole genome sequencing technology to interrogate the genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes. Surprisingly, we only found single-nucleotide polymorphisms in two of the 94 resequenced isolates from the different treatments, neither of which correlated with curli phenotype. Likewise, we found no differences in other genomic characteristics that might account for phenotypic differences including the count of gaps and the origin of discarded reads that failed to map to the parental strain. These results suggest there were no systematic genomic differences (i.e. individual-level selection) that correlated with time or treatment. We recommend future research focus on population-level selection of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains in the manure-amended soil environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1144153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7520-7773</contrib-id><name><surname>Truhlar</surname><given-names>Allison M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Grant No. NYC-123425, MTW.

A minor component of the gut microbiota of many mammals, both commensal and pathogenic strains may coexist in the same environment [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Verotoxigenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (VTEC) strains produce Shiga toxin, which is responsible for hemolytic uremic syndrome, characterized by the destruction of red blood cells and acute renal failure [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 is a pathogenic VTEC serotype that significantly contributes to disease outbreaks in North America and worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In agricultural landscapes, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> sourced from manure application can contaminate surface waters through two major hydrologic routes: surface runoff and subsurface drainage [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Controlling for initial concentration, the primary factor influencing the availability of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> for transport is the die-off rate of the bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some strains of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 have been found to persist in manure-amended soil for more than 200 days, although persistence is strain, soil, and moisture dependent [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Soil is an important reservoir of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> that can cause contamination of drinking water, vegetables, and recreational waters. In agricultural areas the installation of drainage ditches may increase the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> burden in surface waters by short-circuiting natural surface and groundwater flow pathways [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, manure management techniques to minimize the persistence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and thereby decrease the risk of downstream contamination, are of great interest.</p><p>Attenuation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the environment arises from a variety of different stressors that impact their survival, including nutrient limitation, exposure to UV radiation, and fluctuations in temperature, pH, and humidity [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Multiple studies have suggested that water availability is the principal environmental factor affecting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival in soil. In general, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> has reduced mortality in soils with greater water content [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, wetting and drying cycles increase the mortality rate of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Prolonged <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival has also been positively correlated with the amount of bioavailable carbon in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], finer textured soils [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], lower soil temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and neutral to alkaline soil pH [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One added variable in the agricultural soil environment is manure application method. Soils with incorporated or injected manure support prolonged <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival compared to soils with surface applied manure [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Curli is the main proteinaceous component of many <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> biofilms, the extra-cellular matrix that encases aggregated cells and thus promotes survival [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, curli expression has been associated with numerous stimuli including temperature, osmolarity, and electron acceptor availability [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were more likely to express curli if they were isolated from the subsurface drainage of soil receiving surface-applied manure than if they were isolated from the drainage of manure-incorporated soil [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This phenotypic observation left open the question of the mechanism behind the differing curli phenotypes. Specifically, was there an individual- or population-level shift in the gene pool? In other words, did individual strains mutate to become curli over-expressers, or were the curli expressers we isolated already over-expressing curli? To date, genetic analyses aimed at understanding how genomic differences might influence <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival in soil targeted a handful of genes associated with expression of curli and stress adaptations. For instance, both inter- and intra-strain comparisons of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 indicate that an intact <italic>rpoS</italic> gene, which is a global regulator of the general stress response, is correlated with increased survival in soil without manure [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether natural variation in <italic>rpoS</italic> or any other gene is actively selected for in soil and at what level this potential selection occurs. Thus, the more general question we hoped to answer in this work was if mutations were occurring in individual strains.</p><p>This present study aimed to determine how different manure management techniques impact the phenotypic and genomic population structure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933 &#916;<italic>stx</italic><sub>1-2</sub>. We chose to isolate one environmental stressor, desiccation. This sets the stage for future work to address the individual effects of other environmental stressors on both <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> survival and curli phenotype, unlike our previous work where <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were exposed to sunlight and changes in temperature in addition to desiccation. We assessed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions in the genomes of 94 strains that were reisolated after 5&#8211;8 weeks in soil microcosms. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for individual level selection in the genomes of these isolates which suggests that population level selection may be more important than individual selection in determining curli phenotype and soil survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Microcosm setup</title><p>The study organism, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933 &#916;<italic>stx</italic><sub>1-2</sub> (EcO157), is an isogenic mutant derivative of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933, which has a fully sequenced and annotated genome [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

It has been shown that pH, water content, and percent organic matter can partially account for genotype variation across a landscape for microbial species including <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and that the variability in survival seen amongst <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains is as great as the variability in survival caused by soil matrix characteristics for a single <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In light of those findings and the present work, it seems essential that risk assessments aimed at understanding the persistence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in soil should be based on the survival of multiple strains; although this does not always occur in practice [<xref rid="pone.0208346.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Further work could seek to test (1) if differing manure management practices influence the population-level genetic structure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, (2) whether and how different soil landscapes interact with manure management practices to influence the population-level genetic structure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and (3) whether the transport process itself is another variable that selects for distinct <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> populations sourced from subsurface drainage. This knowledge would help guide manure management practices to avoid creation of reservoirs of stress-tolerance genes, such as those promoting curli formation, in both the soil and surface-water landscapes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Through whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrated that there was no systematic selective pressure on genomes of pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933 &#916;<italic>stx</italic><sub>1-2</sub> (EcO157) exposed to cyclic drying in the soil and different manure application methods. This result suggests that more understanding is needed about the impacts of how manure application method affects population-wide phenotypic patterns previously observed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolated from the soil. EcO157 survival in this experiment was not completely stochastic, as evinced by both differing curli phenotypes and specific growth rates by manure application method. We suggest that future research investigate whether and how population-level genetic selection results from different manure application methods. This could provide a much-needed mechanistic basis for choosing manure management techniques that minimize the persistence of pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the agricultural environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208346.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Specific decay rate for EcO157 in each microcosm.</title><p>Calculated according to Neidhardt et al.
