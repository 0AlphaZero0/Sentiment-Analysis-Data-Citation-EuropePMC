In such situations, combination prevention including clinical, behavioural, structural and biological components, as well as adequate treatment are important. We conducted a demonstration project at the Dispensaire <styled-content style="fixed-case">IST</styled-content>, a clinic dedicated to female sex workers (<styled-content style="fixed-case">FSW</styled-content>s) in Cotonou, on early antiretroviral therapy (E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content>, or immediate &#8220;test&#8208;and&#8208;treat&#8221;) and pre&#8208;exposure prophylaxis (Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content>). We present key indicators such as uptake, retention and adherence.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0002"><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective observational study, we recruited FSWs from October 4th 2014 to December 31st 2015 and followed them until December 31st 2016. <styled-content style="fixed-case">FSW</styled-content>s were provided with daily tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (Truvada<sup>&#174;</sup>) for Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content> or received a first&#8208;line antiretroviral regimen as per Benin guidelines. We used generalized estimating equations to assess trends in adherence and sexual behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0003"><title>Results</title><p>Among <styled-content style="fixed-case">FSW</styled-content>s in the catchment area, <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> testing coverage within the study framework was 95.5% (422/442). At baseline, <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> prevalence was 26.3% (111/422). Among eligible <styled-content style="fixed-case">FSW</styled-content>s, 95.5% (105/110) were recruited for E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> and 88.3% (256/290) for Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content>. Overall retention at the end of the study was 59.0% (62/105) for E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> and 47.3% (121/256) for Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content>. Mean (&#177;SD) duration of follow&#8208;up was 13.4 (&#177;7.9) months for E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> and 11.8 (&#177;7.9) months for PrEP. Self&#8208;reported adherence was over 90% among most E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> participants. For Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content>, adherence was lower and the proportion with 100% adherence decreased over time from 78.4% to 56.7% (<italic>p</italic>&#8208;trend&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001). During the 250.1 person&#8208;years of follow&#8208;up among Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content> initiators, two seroconversions occurred (incidence 0.8/100 person&#8208;years (95% confidence interval: 0.3 to 1.9/100 person&#8208;years)). The two seroconverters had stopped using Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content> for at least six months before being found <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content>&#8208;infected. In both groups, there was no evidence of reduced condom use.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides data on key indicators for the integration of E&#8208;<styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> and Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content> into the <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> prevention combination package already offered to <styled-content style="fixed-case">FSW</styled-content>s in Benin.

In 2016, approximately 64% of the 5000 new HIV infections occurring worldwide daily occurred in that region <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. In West Africa, studies have shown that female sex workers (FSWs) have historically contributed directly or indirectly to 52% to 90% of HIV transmission cases towards the general population essentially via their clients and other male sexual partners <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. Thus, preventing HIV among FSWs has the potential to have population level public health impact. The burden of HIV remains disproportionately high among FSWs in this region despite substantial prevention efforts in the last years and reductions in the prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. FSWs are reported to have an HIV prevalence over 12 times higher than other women of reproductive age in sub&#8208;Saharan Africa <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. In Benin, in 2015, HIV prevalence was estimated at 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): (0.7 to 1.4)) in the general population and at 15.7% (95% CI: (13.7 to 17.7)) among FSWs <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>.</p><p>In such situations, it is important to tailor combination prevention, including clinical, behavioural, structural and biological components, for the sex work milieu in general and for FSWs in particular, in addition to ensuring adequate treatment <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Recent research has shown that pre&#8208;exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, the use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV seronegative individuals) and early antiretroviral therapy (E&#8208;ART) for all infected individuals regardless of CD4 count are promising interventions to prevent HIV acquisition and transmission in high risk populations if uptake and treatment adherence are high <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. However, randomized trials have shown disappointing results for PrEP among women at high risk in African countries because of low adherence <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. It is thus essential to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in &#8220;real&#8208;world&#8221; settings since it may vary based on personal, social and cultural characteristics. Although studies assessing the feasibility of these two new prevention methods in &#8220;real&#8208;world&#8221; settings are ongoing <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> or have been recently completed <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, limited data are available on their implementation among FSWs in the West African region, especially in countries where sex work is not legalized like Benin. We thus conducted this demonstration project to assess the feasibility and usefulness of adding E&#8208;ART (immediate &#8220;test&#8208;and&#8208;treat&#8221;) and PrEP to the combination prevention package, including clinical, behavioural and structural components, already offered to FSWs in Benin. In this paper, we are presenting primary results on uptake, retention and adherence.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0007"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="jia225208-sec-0008"><label>2.1</label><title>Study settings</title><p>This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in Cotonou, the largest city in Benin, and its inner suburbs among &#8220;professional&#8221; FSWs (women whose revenue is mostly generated by sex work). The study was carried out at the Dispensaire IST (DIST), a FSW&#8208;friendly clinic providing confidential clinical services and free HIV/STI treatment to FSWs in Cotonou and supported by the National AIDS Control Program. The catchment area and sample size were defined by mapping and enumeration of &#8220;professional&#8221; FSWs in Cotonou. We expected to reach about 500 FSWs and recruit and follow&#8208;up at least 90% of the HIV&#8208;positive FSWs (n~100) on E&#8208;ART and at least 60% of the HIV&#8208;negative FSWs (n~250) on PrEP. More details are presented in Text <xref rid="jia225208-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0009"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>FSWs from the pre&#8208;defined catchment area in Cotonou were informed about the study and invited for a screening visit at the DIST by community workers. Recruitment in the study was planned to spread from downtown Cotonou towards the suburbs. When a saturation point was reached in one area, we recruited in another neighbouring area towards outskirts till the planned sample size was achieved. At the screening visit, participants&#8217; HIV status and eligibility criteria were assessed. HIV rapid tests were performed. Additional tests such as hepatitis B and syphilis serologies, renal and liver function tests, and for HIV&#8208;positive women, CD4 count and viral load were carried out. HIV status was confirmed at recruitment (10 to 14&#160;days after screening) using additional HIV tests performed on separate blood samples. Women who agreed to participate underwent gynaecological exams during which swabs were collected for direct microscopy and for testing for genital gonococcal and chlamydial infections with nucleic acid amplification tests. Laboratory procedures are presented in Text <xref rid="jia225208-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. At the recruitment visit, participants were informed of the results from the screening visit and the implication of the results. This visit allowed potential enrolment into E&#8208;ART for HIV&#8208;positive FSWs or PrEP for HIV&#8208;negative FSWs. Women on PrEP were provided with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, Truvada<sup>&#174;</sup>) to be taken once a day and participants on E&#8208;ART received a first&#8208;line ART regimen as per Benin guidelines. The first follow&#8208;up visit was scheduled 14&#160;days after recruitment, to assess short&#8208;term side effects and early adherence. The next follow&#8208;up visit was scheduled at month 3, and subsequent visits were scheduled quarterly. Recruitment was carried out from 4 October 2014 to 31 December 2015, with an additional 12&#8208;month follow&#8208;up period till 31 December 2016; total follow&#8208;up thus varied from 12 to 24&#160;months depending on the time of recruitment. The medications were refilled every month, but participants could pick&#8208;up a supply for up to three months if needed. Participants could resume follow&#8208;up in the study even after missing a scheduled visit. Four community workers were trained to regularly remind study participants of their visits by telephone or by visiting them at home or their work place. Active tracking was carried out for those that missed an appointment. All participants were counselled on the importance of adherence and received free condoms at each follow&#8208;up visit. Assistance for transportation was provided by community workers when needed, a practice that was already in place for standard quarterly clinical care for FSWs at the DIST prior to the study.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0010"><label>2.3</label><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Participants were eligible for E&#8208;ART if they were 18&#160;years or older, HIV&#8208;positive at screening and reconfirmed on a second sample, and HIV treatment naive. Women with HIV&#8208;2 and dual infection were not included in the E&#8208;ART arm and were referred for treatment at the DIST. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were not excluded from the E&#8208;ART arm and were referred to the prevention of mother&#8208;to&#8208;child transmission programme in Benin. For PrEP, participants were eligible if they were &#8805;18&#160;years old and HIV&#8208;negative at both screening and recruitment visits. Other exclusion criteria for PrEP were a compromised renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;60&#160;mL/min), active hepatitis B and/or abnormal liver function, pregnancy and breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0011"><label>2.4</label><title>Outcomes</title><p>We evaluated the feasibility of E&#8208;ART and PrEP through a set of indicators, including screening coverage, uptake, adherence, retention in the cohort, condom migration (decrease in condom use as a result of being substituted by another preventive intervention) and development of drug resistance. Face&#8208;to&#8208;face interviews (FTFI) at the screening visit were used to collect data on socio&#8208;demographic characteristics, HIV testing history and general health status. We collected information on the number of clients and other sexual partners, sexual practices, condom use, self&#8208;reported adherence to ART, STI diagnoses and other general symptoms since last visit by FTFI. Case report forms were used to collect clinical and biological data. We evaluated coverage based on the number of all screened FSWs in the catchment area and uptake based on the number of eligible FSWs enrolled.</p><p>For E&#8208;ART, self&#8208;reported adherence was measured by asking participants the number of pills missed in the last month. For PrEP, participants were asked the number of pills missed in the last week. Blood samples were collected to evaluate TDF/FTC concentrations; results will be presented subsequently. For E&#8208;ART participants, CD4 and viral load levels were assessed, the latter being a good marker of treatment adherence.</p><p>We monitored seroconversion through HIV rapid testing at each follow&#8208;up visit among PrEP participants. Incidence rates for HIV and STIs were calculated by dividing the number of incident cases by the person time of follow&#8208;up. Retention was evaluated at each study visit. Women who missed visits and came back later were included in the analysis. We assessed trends in sexual behaviour (number of clients having had sex with a regular partner and consistent, that is, 100% condom use with these two types of partners) in the last two and fourteen days.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0012"><label>2.5</label><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the CHU de Qu&#233;bec&#8211;Universit&#233; Laval, Qu&#233;bec, Canada, and the Benin National Ethics Committee for Health Research.

This is of particular importance as HIV testing coverage is essential to assess E&#8208;ART and PrEP feasibility. The high testing uptake we observed in this target population was expected, since in a study carried out in 2013, 87.1% of FSWs reported having ever been tested for HIV in their lifetime without previous FSW&#8208;specific programmes aiming at increasing testing <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. HIV prevalence, with all the progresses made, was still high in this country characterized by an HIV epidemic largely concentrated among FSWs <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. Uptake of both E&#8208;ART and PrEP was high, but HIV&#8208;positive FSWs were more willing to participate in E&#8208;ART than HIV&#8208;negative FSWs were to participate in PrEP. This situation was predictable given the obvious need for treatment among HIV&#8208;positive women <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. Observed retention rates were arguably low by the end of the study but did not differ between E&#8208;ART and PrEP participants still living in Cotonou. Among PrEP participants, two cases of seroconversions occurred. These two FSWs had been lost to follow&#8208;up for several months and returned to the study with a positive HIV status. Among PrEP participants, adherence was poor and decreased over the course of the study. E&#8208;ART participants reported high and relatively stable adherence throughout the study.</p><p>The low HIV incidence found in our study was consistent with results from randomized clinical trials (RCT) and other open&#8208;label studies <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. The fact that seroconversions occurred in FSWs who were off medication for a long period of time clearly emphasize that low PrEP adherence or non&#8208;use in the setting of risk may lead to HIV acquisition <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. In our study, overall adherence to PrEP (47.8% to 78.4%) was low compared to adherence (70% to 95%) found in the demonstration study conducted among FSWs in South Africa (TAPS study) <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, but was consistent with results of RCTs that involved high&#8208;risk women <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. This variability highlights that adherence may be influenced by social and structural factors that should be taken into account in adherence interventions <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. Although PrEP is an effective preventive method among adherent women, it does not need to be lifelong and is only required during the periods of high risk <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. Therefore, adherence should be considered in the context of HIV risk (also known as prevention&#8208;effective adherence) <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>.</p><p>Prior to the implementation of our demonstration project (2006 to 2014), 48 HIV&#8208;positive FSWs among all FSWs (professional or not) had started E&#8208;ART at the DIST since its availability in the country in 2006 (N. Geraldo, personal communication). As they were well known to the DIST staff members, they were not eligible for the study, which was designed to recruit only treatment&#8208;naive FSWs. This low treatment coverage guided us to recruit all HIV&#8208;positive FSWs regardless of their CD4 count in order to increase treatment coverage and to correspond to the practice that would be put in place for HIV treatment when an E&#8208;ART policy is adopted. There was a good response to treatment among E&#8208;ART participants. Adherence and viral load suppression estimates suggest a relatively good adherence to ART. High adherence to E&#8208;ART in our study was expected given previous results of treatment adherence among FSWs <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and was consistent with results of the TAPS study <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. The proportion of E&#8208;ART participants with viral suppression at their final visit was 87%. Overall, this could constitutes a good response to treatment although it felt slightly short of the UNAIDS 90% target <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>.</p><p>As reflected by the E&#8208;ART and PrEP cascades, retention was an issue in both study arms. Lack of retention was mainly due to the high mobility of FSWs. Participants were given the opportunity to refill their medication beyond their monthly supply if they reported that they would be absent for a period of time. For PrEP participants who relocated out of Cotonou, continuous access to the medication was not possible, whereas for E&#8208;ART, availability of medication depended on the HIV treatment policies where the participants relocated. Although retention was low in our study, we found higher rates than the TAPS <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> study where nearly half of the PrEP participants were lost to follow&#8208;up one month after enrolment. Supporting continuous access to PrEP or E&#8208;ART despite the mobility of FSWs is likely to be challenging. Retention issues could be minimized with broad geographical coverage of E&#8208;ART and PrEP programmes in West African countries. Other options include allowing those on stable treatment to collect drugs less frequently or considering medication refill groups to ease drug collection by making such collection possible through peers <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>.</p><p>We did not observe any evidence of condom migration or risk compensation in either PrEP or E&#8208;ART participants despite concern that the interventions would result in increased sexual risk behaviour. Reported condom use was consistently high with clients but was low with regular partners. Previous findings in this population have shown that 88% of FSWs had used condoms with all clients in the previous week <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, and a relatively low proportion of FSWs had non&#8208;paying partners (28%) <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. This high condom use among FSWs can mostly be attributed to community work on the promotion of the condom and to intervention projects aimed at FSWs and the whole sex work milieu <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. The absence of condom migration was also found in South African FSWs with the TAPS project <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. The HIV incidence we observed was slightly lower but not significantly different from the 1.4/100 person&#8208;years found in a cohort of professional FSWs followed in Benin from 2009 to 2012 <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. The STI incidence in that same study <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> was also similar to what we observed in this demonstration project, thus providing additional evidence for the lack of condom migration or risk compensation among FSWs.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. We were able to assess testing coverage among FSWs and this is the first step for accessing interventions such as E&#8208;ART and PrEP in a &#8220;real&#8208;world&#8221; setting. The overall effectiveness of such interventions highly depends on HIV testing uptake <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Estimating testing coverage as we did is thus an important predictor of E&#8208;ART and PrEP feasibility. We had a more prolonged follow&#8208;up time compared to other demonstration projects <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. Our follow&#8208;up time (12 to 24&#160;months) gave us more opportunity to observe potential seroconversions. We were able to precisely document the reasons why participants were no longer in the study, a clear improvement over loss to follow&#8208;up with undocumented status among study dropouts.</p><p>There are a number of caveats to the study. FSWs are highly mobile, and continuous access to the prescribed medications is not guaranteed. In the PrEP arm, pregnant and breastfeeding FSWs were not included due to safety concerns at the time. However, research has shown that there does not appear to be a safety&#8208;related rationale for not prescribing PrEP to pregnant or lactating FSWs who are at continuing risk of HIV infection <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. Given the increase risk of HIV infection in FSWs who become pregnant, FSWs on PrEP who became pregnant could have continued using the medication. We used self&#8208;reported data on adherence, but our results are consistent with findings from RCTs among high risk women <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, and FSWs usually reported when they missed their medications. Sexual behaviours were also self&#8208;reported, but our results were consistent with previous findings in the study population <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jia225208-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0022"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides data on key indicators for the integration of E&#8208;ART and PrEP into the HIV prevention combination package already in place for FSWs in Benin. Uptake was good; however, despite intensive efforts to maximize retention and adherence among PrEP users, the suboptimal levels of these key parameters illustrate the difficulties related to the implementation of a PrEP programme among FSWs in Benin. PrEP may be more useful as an intervention at the individual level for adherent FSWs rather than a broader public health intervention. For E&#8208;ART, adherence was not a major issue but retention was suboptimal due to high mobility. E&#8208;ART could be a potential strategy for reducing the HIV burden among FSWs while significantly contributing to HIV prevention at the population level. More research is needed on identifying the FSWs that really need PrEP and determining if intermittent dosing of a Pr<styled-content style="fixed-case">EP</styled-content> regimen would be more feasible in FSWs in Benin.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0023"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>All authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="jia225208-sec-0024"><title>Authors&#8217; Contributions</title><p>MA, MCB, LB and PV conceived the study.
