The ACC-1 family of receptors are a unique group of acetylcholine-gated chloride channels present only in invertebrates, and sequence analysis suggests that they contain a novel binding site for acetylcholine. We have isolated a novel member of this family, Hco-ACC-2, from the parasitic nematode <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiology and molecular modelling examined how two aromatic amino acids in the binding site contributed to agonist recognition. It was found that instead of a tryptophan residue in binding loop B, which essential for ligand binding in mammalian nAChRs, there is a phenylalanine (F200) in Hco-ACC-2. Amino acid changes at F200 to either a tyrosine or tryptophan were fairly well tolerated, where a F200Y mutation resulted in a channel hypersensitive to ACh and nicotine as well as other cholinergic agonists such as carbachol and methacholine. In addition, both pyrantel and levamisole were partial agonists at the wild-type receptor and like the other agonists showed an increase in sensitivity at F200Y. On the other hand, in Hco-ACC-2 there is a tryptophan residue at position 248 in loop C that appears to be essential for receptor function, as mutations to either phenylalanine or tyrosine resulted in a marked decrease in agonist sensitivity. Moreover, mutations that swapped the residues F200 and W248 (ie. F200W/W248F) produced non-functional receptors. Overall, Hco-ACC-2 appears to have a novel cholinergic binding site that could have implications for the design of specific anthelmintics that target this family of receptors in parasitic nematodes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0010">Isolation of an ACC-2 orthologue from <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0015">Hco-ACC-2 responds to several cholinergic agonists including levamisole and pyrantel.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0020">W248 in loop C plays an essential role in agonist recognition.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cholinergic receptor</kwd><kwd>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)</kwd><kwd>Acetylcholine-gated chloride channel</kwd><kwd>Mutagenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic></kwd><kwd>Anthelmintic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">The Cys-loop (cysteine-loop) superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are a major class of receptor-coupled ion channels. These channels have been widely studied in invertebrate organisms for decades because they play key roles in the nervous system, making them prime targets for insecticides and nematocides (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Del Castillo et al., 1963</xref>). The channel contains five protein subunits, encoded by the same or different subunit genes, all situated around a central aqueous pore. Each subunit contains an extracellular N-terminal ligand binding domain, where two cysteine residues, situated 13 amino acid residues apart, form a disulfide bond, as well as four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), and an extracellular C-terminus. These subunits can assemble as homo-oligomers, containing one subunit type, or hetero-oligomers, containing multiple subunit types (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Sine and Engel, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Upon ligand binding, these channels elicit fast inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmission. In mammals, excitatory channels include nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) serotonin receptors, and inhibitory channels include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ortells and Lunt, 1995</xref>). Invertebrates, specifically parasitic and free-living nematodes, contain a variety of LGIC subunit types which are not found in vertebrates (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Sattelle, 2008</xref>). These channels have been shown to be gated by neurotransmitters including GABA (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bamber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>), glutamate (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cully et al., 1994</xref>), tyramine (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pirri et al., 2009</xref>), acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>), and serotonin (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The ligand-binding site of cys-loop receptors is located at the interface of two adjacent subunits, which are loops A-C on the principal subunit and loops D-G on the complementary subunit (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>). Each receptor has a different ligand-binding domain that contain various residues, which allow for the selection of different molecular agonists. There are key aromatic residues in the binding site of LGICs that have shown to be involved in ligand binding (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beene et al., 2004</xref>). Many neurotransmitters contain a cationic center that acts to stabilize the interaction between a cation and the negative electrostatic potential on the face of the aromatic ring. This is known as cation-&#960; interactions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beene et al., 2002</xref>). These cation- &#960; interactions involve aromatic amino acids (either phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan) in the ligand binding region (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dougherty, 1996</xref>). While the importance of aromatic residues for the function of the agonist binding pocket is widely shared across the phyla, there is variability across different receptors with respect the type of aromatic residues that contribute to binding and their location within the binding loops (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lynagh and Pless, 2014</xref>). This highlights the promiscuous nature of neurotransmitter binding across a variety of receptors in animals.</p><p id="p0040">Early studies from the mollusk, <italic>Aplysia,</italic> reported the presence of a unique class of acetylcholine receptors in neurons, the acetylcholine-gated chloride channels (ACCs) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kehoe and McIntosh, 1998</xref>). Later, studies identified these receptors in the model nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wever et al., 2015</xref>).

As a whole, this family of receptors has potential to be novel antiparasitic drug targets. This is primarily due to the fact that they appear to be expressed in tissues that are sensitive to anthelmintic action, and as sequence analysis suggests, they are not present in mammals and exhibit a unique acetylcholine binding site (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wever et al., 2015</xref>). However, the structural components that are important for agonist recognition of this class of cholinergic receptors has not been explored.</p><p id="p0045">Here we have isolated a novel member if the ACC-1 family (Hco-ACC-2) from the parasitic nematode <italic>H. contortus</italic> and investigated the binding site through site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological analysis.

This family of receptors appear to be unique to invertebrates and not present in mammals, making them attractive targets for novel nematocides. This has been validated by research demonstrating that this family of receptors are expressed in tissues that are sensitive to anthelmintic action (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wever et al., 2015</xref>). The research described here has examined in detail the structure of the ACC binding site which is important for future research focused on the discovery of novel therapeutics.</p><p id="p0125">The pharmacology of the Hco-ACC-2 receptor can provide some valuable insight into the nature of the binding site. In our analysis, the receptor is least sensitive to choline. The low sensitivity of the receptor to choline is likely due to the molecules smaller size and lack of a carbonyl group which limits its interaction with residues. These features could explain why, compared to the other agonists, there was very little change in sensitivity of choline in the hypersensitive mutant F200Y. Moreover, the comparison between the sensitivities of ACh, carbachol, methacholine and urecholine along with the molecular docking results highlights some interesting trends. For example, all molecules docked with their quaternary amine close to W248. However, both ACh and methacholine, which exhibited maximum efficacy, appear to dock in a similar extended orientation, which places them within 3&#8239;&#197; of N170. On the other hand, carbachol and urecholine, which are both partial agonists, dock in a similar bent orientation, which is more pronounced in urecholine, and places them further away from N170.</p><p id="p0130">One of the key features of ACh binding to mammalian nAChR is the presence of a tryptophan residue that participates in &#960;-cationic interactions with the quaternary amine on ACh. In mammalian nAChRs this tryptophan residue is present in loop B (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beene et al., 2002</xref>). However, in ACC receptors there is no tryptophan residue in loop B. Instead, sequence analysis and homology modelling reveal a tryptophan residue present in loop C (W248). W248 is facing into the binding pocket and appears to be within 5&#8239;&#197; of the quaternary amine of the agonists that were docked in this study. While we did not confirm that W248 is participating in a &#960;-cationic interaction with agonists, it is clear that it is essential for the function of Hco-ACC-2. Evidence for the importance of W248 in the function of ACC receptors is highlighted by mutational analysis, which showed that changing W248 to either W248Y or W248F resulted in a severely impacted receptor that did not respond to any agonists other than ACh. This could be partially explained by the removal of the indole nitrogen which is found in tryptophan. The presence of an indole nitrogen causes a large negative electrostatic cloud around this residue, allowing for increased potential of &#960;-cationic interactions (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mecozzi et al., 1996</xref>). Since this indole is not present in tyrosine or phenylalanine, it could explain why these mutations were detrimental to receptor function. In addition, the positioning of this tryptophan in loop C could be important in ACC receptor function, as swapping the residues from loop C to B (F200W/W248F) produced a non-functional channel. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the novel nematode 5-HT receptor MOD-1 which also has a tryptophan residue in loop C instead of loop B, as seen in 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 2000</xref>). The loop C tryptophan in the MOD-1 receptor was shown to participate in the essential &#960;-cationic interaction with serotonin which is key for receptor binding (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Mu et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, this loop C tryptophan is not only present in ACC and MOD-1 receptors but other amine-gated chloride channels such as LGC-55 (tyramine) (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2010</xref>) and LGC-53 (dopamine) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beech et al., 2013</xref>) as well as the nematode DEG-3 receptor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). From, an evolutionary perspective it appears that the presence of a tryptophan in loop C is an essential requirement for a diverse array of nematode cys-loop receptors, and their ability to bind to wide range of ligands.</p><p id="p0135">Unlike mammalian nAChRs which exhibit a tryptophan in loop B, the Hco-ACC-2 receptor exhibits a phenylalanine (F200). Mutations at this position provided some additional insight into the structure of the ACC binding site. First, the introduction of a F200W change caused a reduced sensitivity to all agonists, albeit to varying degrees. Carbachol was the least affected by the change while methacholine was most affected. Methacholine is a full agonist for the ACC receptor and differs from ACh with the addition of a methyl group in the backbone, but both appear to bind in a similar orientation in the wildtype receptor. The addition of a bulky tryptophan residue may therefore cause the larger methacholine to shift orientation and reducing its ability to bind and activate the channel. Interestingly, the opposite was found with the F200Y mutation, which increased the sensitivity of all agonists (including nicotine) to varying degrees. Here, urecholine exhibited the highest increase in sensitivity. It is possible the hydroxyl group on tyrosine allows additional hydrogen-bond interactions with surrounding residues, thus changing the structure of the binding site and enhancing agonist (especially urecholine) binding. F200 may also have other roles such as participating in &#960;-cationic interactions with agonists. However, future experiments would have to confirm.</p><p id="p0140">The ACC receptor family appear to be attractive targets for the development of novel anthelmintics. With this in mind we also tested the activity of the anthelmintics levamisole and pyrantel which activate the nematode nAChR (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Robertson, 2007</xref>). We found both molecules were partial agonists for the Hco-ACC-2 receptor. However, we were surprised to observe that the mutations we introduced into the receptor minimally effected in their activity. This may highlight the distinct manner at which these anthelmintics bind to the ACC receptors. Molecular models for docked pyrantel and levamisole place both molecules within 5&#8239;&#197; of W248. However, the overall positioning of levamisole and pyrantel within the ACC-2 binding site are clearly different (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). How this relates to the differences in efficacy we observed between the two molecules requires further examination.</p><p id="p0145">This study has described the isolation of a member of the ACC family from <italic>H. contortus</italic> and examined two residues in the binding site that are important for agonist recognition. Further research on the essential requirements for agonist recognition of ACC receptor can provide insight into the evolution of cholinergic neurotransmission and may possibly lead to the discovery of novel cholinergic anthelmintics.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations of interest</title><p id="p0150">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdelmassih</surname><given-names>S.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cochrane</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Forrester</surname><given-names>S.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluating the longevity of surgically extracted Xenopus laevis oocytes for the study of nematode ligand-gated ion channels</article-title><source>Invertebr.
