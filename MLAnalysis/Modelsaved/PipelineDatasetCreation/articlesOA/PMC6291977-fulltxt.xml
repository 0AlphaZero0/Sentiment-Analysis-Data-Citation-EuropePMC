Intensive breeding efforts, based on crosses with wild drought-tolerant relatives as potential sources of useful traits, are underway. At the same time, interest in a small group called resurrection plants is increasing, as these plants can withstand long periods of almost full desiccation and recover their vegetative system activities quickly and fully upon rehydration. This makes them useful models to study desiccation tolerance and potential sources of genes, related to these important phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further efforts are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in resurrection plants as a sustained dynamic process.</p><p id="Par13">The Balkan endemic <italic>Haberlea rhodopensis</italic>, one of the few species of resurrection plants, native to Europe, has been the subject of intensive genetic studies in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>H. rhodopensis</italic> gene expression under conditions of normal watering, dehydration (50% relative water content; RWC), full desiccation (5% RWC) and rehydration has been performed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We have shown that the dynamics of desiccation tolerance can be characterized by numerous changes in various processes at additional important time points during drying: the stages of slight (~&#8201;65&#8211;75%) and severe (20&#8211;25% RWC) dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, at the onset of drying (at 75% RWC), an approximately 25-fold increase in jasmonic acid (JA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] occurs, coinciding with the start of the decrease in photosynthetic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, oxygen evolution in leaves of <italic>H. rhodopensis</italic> did not decrease until 20% RWC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Our studies revealed that the levels of numerous compounds changed dramatically during desiccation, particularly before or around the severe dehydration stage (25% RWC), including total phenols, sugars, total glutathione, malondialdehyde, sucrose/fructose ratio, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA) and starch levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Ten cDNA libraries were prepared using the Truseq&#8482; RNA sample preparation kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were size-selected for cDNA target fragments of 200&#8211;300&#8201;bp on 2% low-range ultra-agarose gels followed by PCR amplification using Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 15&#8201;cycles. After quantification using the TBS380 fluorometer, 150-bp paired-end RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Transcriptome de novo assembly, sequence annotation, classification and alignment</title><p id="Par54">The raw data were first processed using Seqprep (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep">https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep</ext-link>) and Sickle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">https://github.com/najoshi/sickle</ext-link>) and the obtained high quality clean reads were subjected to de novo assembly using Trinity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq">https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

Principle component analysis of DEGs was performed using SIMCA 13.0 (Umetrics, Satorius Stedim Biotech, Ume&#229;, Sweden). In addition, functional enrichment analysis including GO and KEGG terms in comparison with the whole-transcriptome background was performed using a Bonferroni-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;&#8201;0.05 threshold.

To map all identified genes with altered expression in D20 and to visualize the pathway relationships among these genes, we used a general mapping method in which mapped genes represent a low percentage of all associated genes per pathway, and Bonferroni correction was omitted. Subsequently, the KEGG file for each pathway was downloaded, and all genes in the pathway were extracted from the ClueGO table. Then, network analysis was performed using Cytoscape software. The Pearson correlations between genes and metabolites were calculated using Cytoscape. The expression of each gene extracted from the ClueGO table for each pathway is expressed as the average log<sub>2</sub> ratio for each treatment compared with the control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>qPCR</title><p id="Par56">All purified RNA samples described above were adjusted to the same concentration (100&#8201;ng/&#956;L) using RNase-free ddH<sub>2</sub>O and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.
