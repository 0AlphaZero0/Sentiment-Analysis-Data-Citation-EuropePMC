The strongest genetic association is with <italic>HLA-DQA1*04</italic>:<italic>01</italic>, but at least three additional independent HLA haplotypes contribute to susceptibility. We used dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in 2861 PBC cases and 8514 controls to impute classical HLA alleles and amino acid polymorphisms using state-of-the-art methodologies. We then demonstrated through stepwise regression that association in the HLA region can be largely explained by variation at five separate amino acid positions. Three-dimensional modelling of protein structures and calculation of electrostatic potentials for the implicated HLA alleles/amino acid substitutions demonstrated a correlation between the electrostatic potential of pocket P6 in HLA-DP molecules and the <italic>HLA-DPB1</italic> alleles/amino acid substitutions conferring PBC susceptibility/protection, highlighting potential new avenues for future functional investigation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that exhibits strong genetic associations, especially with variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene region.

This ability of amino acid substitutions to explain the association of the MHC to PBC in a more parsimonious way than is achieved by classical HLA alleles contrasts with results previously found using stepwise regression in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], where classical HLA alleles (specifically <italic>HLA-DRB1*01</italic>:<italic>03</italic>) entered the model first and better explained the association than models based on amino acid substitutions, leading the investigators in that study to focus their subsequent efforts on an <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> centric model.

In most cases, the difference in model fit between including the top SNP and the top amino acid or classical allele was relatively small. Given the <italic>a priori</italic> potential functional role of amino acid substitutions, we found it most natural to focus primarily on variables directly encoding these effects. The fact that, in some instances, inclusion of a SNP provided a slightly better model fit could indicate that the SNP itself is having a functional role (perhaps through a mechanism such as modulation of gene expression) but, equally, could arise from the phenomenon whereby a SNP tags the combined effects of several functional amino acids. In terms of accounting for the overall association in the region, we found the model that included the top 5 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s013">S2 Fig</xref>, left hand panels) performed similarly to the model that included the top 5 variables of any type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s013">S2 Fig</xref>, right hand panels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s033">S5 Spreadsheet</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s034">S6 Spreadsheet</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s035">S7 Spreadsheet</xref>).</p><p>To explore further the degree to which amino acid substitutions could account for the effects of classical alleles, and to investigate whether such results could occur by chance by tagging classical alleles of differential risk, we used the permutation approach employed in IBD [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Preliminary analyses with FINEMAP generated many equivalently-fitting models; we circumvented this issue by filtering out highly correlated amino acid variables, retaining an index set of 396 amino acids with pairwise correlation values less than 0.98 for analysis. The equivalent strategy in GUESSFM was achieved through setting the user-defined input parameter &#8220;tag.r2&#8221; (the r<sup>2</sup> threshold for grouping predictors together into LD groups) as 0.9604 (= 0.98<sup>2</sup>); this resulted in 354 tag groups once monomorphic amino acid positions had been discarded. Following model fitting, the &#8220;expand.tags&#8221; function within GUESSFM package was then used to expand the set of models considered by GUESSFM to consider all predictors (rather than using a single &#8220;tag&#8221; amino acid as a surrogate for the other amino acids in its LD group) and the &#8220;snp.picker&#8221; function used to pick out the resulting amino acids that had the highest posterior probability of inclusion.</p><p>The top models and amino acids identified by FINEMAP and GUESSFM respectively are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s007">S7 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s008">S8 Table</xref>.

The results from FINEMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s007">S7 Table</xref>) were relatively concordant with those from stepwise regression, strongly implicating four out of the top five amino acids from stepwise regression (HLA-DP&#946;1 11L/G, HLA-DR&#946;1 74L, HLA-DQ&#946;1 57D and HLA-C 156R), but also providing some support for additional predictors HLA-DQ&#946;1 -4V, HLA-DQ&#946;1 71T, HLA-DQ&#945;1 175E and HLA-B 45T (or their correlates). The results from GUESSFM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s008">S8 Table</xref>) were more variable and, in general, GUESSFM generated final models that involved a relatively large number of predictors compared to stepwise regression.

Although FINEMAP and GUESSFM perform well when larger numbers of predictors are included, they did not generally outperform stepwise regression when limited to 5 predictors.

Previous HLA imputation-based studies in PBC [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have sought to determine whether the amino acid associations observed with PBC could be explained by classical HLA alleles; here we took the view, in common with earlier studies of PBC [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and of other diseases [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that, given the functional relevance of amino acid substitutions, a more natural question is whether the association with classical alleles (and with SNPs in the HLA region) can be explained by the amino acid substitutions themselves.</p><p>We found that the majority of the strong association between PBC and SNPS in the HLA region and/or classical HLA alleles could indeed be explained by variation at five separate amino acid substitutions. These included two substitutions (HLA-DP&#946;1 11L/G and HLA-DR&#946;1 74L) that were previously implicated (at much lower levels of significance) by smaller earlier studies, and three substitutions that represent (to our knowledge) novel findings; once these five effects had been accounted for, there remained some residual association, but this was nowhere near as strong as the genome-wide levels of significance observed in marginal analysis. Given the <italic>a priori</italic> functional relevance of amino acid substitutions, we thus considered these amino acids (or other residues highly correlated with them) as good candidates for being causal; we note that this viewpoint&#8212;which places a strong prior on amino acids accounting for association at classical alleles being a more convincing explanation than classical alleles accounting for association of amino acids (given the fact that classical alleles can effectively be considered as specific combinations of amino acid substitutions)&#8212;is, to some extent, borne out by that fact that, in steps 1&#8211;4 of our stepwise analysis, an amino acid always entered the model in preference to a classical allele.</p><p>In our primary analyses, we focussed on examining the effects of individual amino acid substitutions and classical HLA alleles, reserving for secondary consideration omnibus tests that encode the effects of all amino acid substitutions at a position, or all alleles at a gene, simultaneously. This strategy differs from that used in previous studies of IBD [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and RA [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in which the investigators focussed first on omnibus tests, reserving tests of individual amino acid substitutions and classical HLA alleles for secondary consideration. Which analysis strategy is to be preferred is perhaps debatable. We considered the individual testing strategy to be <italic>a priori</italic> the more appealing and interpretable of the two approaches, on account of having fewer df (one df per residue/allele), which provides higher power than testing all residues/alleles at a position/gene simultaneously. For example, if only one residue out of 8 possible residues at a particular position was actually associated with the disease, then this would be clearly visible when testing individual amino acid substitutions, but the effect might well be drowned out when constructing a combined test of all 8 substitutions (one of which is associated, and 7 of which are not). A further reason for preferring the test of individual residues/alleles is the fact that individual residues/alleles may themselves have specific functional effects, separate from the effects of any other residues/alleles at the same position/gene. In application to our PBC data set, we did not find the multi-df omnibus approach to add substantial significance compared to testing individual predictors, perhaps justifying retrospectively our choice of analysis strategy.</p><p>We took forward the implicated amino acid residues from our analyses for three dimensional predictive modelling and calculation of electrostatic potentials, following an approach that was previously used in primary sclerosing cholangitis [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but which has not, to our knowledge, been previously used in PBC. This analysis demonstrated a correlation between the electrostatic potential of pocket P6 in HLA-DP molecules and the HLA-DPB1 alleles/amino acid substitutions conferring PBC susceptibility/protection, highlighting a potential mechanistic explanation for the observed association that warrants further investigation.</p><p>A previous study in IBD [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] addressed this question of electrostatic potentials in a slightly different way, motivated by their finding that classical HLA alleles (specifically <italic>HLA-DRB1*01</italic>:<italic>03</italic>) better explained the IBD association than did models based on amino acid substitutions, leading the investigators to focus their subsequent efforts on an <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> centric model. In that study, Goyette et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] followed three dimensional predictive modelling with an analysis of the electrostatic properties around the seven peptide residues (at peptide positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9) that are known to make contact within the binding grove, and then clustered electrostatically similar HLA-DR molecules together. (A similar analysis was also carried out focussing only on electrostatic properties in the region affected by amino acid positions 67, 70 and 71, which had shown significant association with IBD). This analysis identified four clusters of HLA-DR molecules sharing similar electrostatic properties with respect to the seven peptide regions (or two clusters sharing similar electrostatic properties with respect to the region encompassing amino acid positions 67, 70 and 71). The resulting clustering of <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles (encoding these molecules) showed that alleles associated with increased risk of IBD generally fell into different clusters than alleles associated with decreased risk of IBD, suggesting that the HLA-DR molecules associated with increased risk of IBD exhibited structural and electrostatic properties within the peptide-binding grove that were largely distinct from those associated with decreased risk.</p><p>Given the strong associations of <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles with PBC risk (<xref rid="pgen.1007833.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and the fact that our second most associated amino acid (<italic>P</italic> = 1.73x10<sup>-39</sup>) is residue L at position 74 of HLA-DR&#946;1, we investigated how the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> alleles associated with either increased or decreased PBC risk in our study mapped onto the four clusters of electrostatically similar HLA-DR molecules that had been identified by Goyette et al. In contrast to the results seen in IBD, we did not find a consistent pattern of alleles associated with increased risk of PBC falling into different clusters than alleles associated with decreased risk of PBC, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> associations with PBC may be more specific than is captured by this analysis.</p><p>Although the amino acid substitutions highlighted here represent the most compelling disease-causing factors implicated by our study, we note that high LD in the region and the ability of alternative, more complex, models (such as those examined in our multi-df, FINEMAP and GUESSFM analyses) to account for the disease associations observed means that we cannot definitively rule out the contribution of other factors whose effects are statistically intertwined with the substitutions we have identified; follow-up functional studies will be required to further investigate this question. It has previously been demonstrated that <italic>HLA-DRB1*08</italic>:<italic>01</italic> (DR0801), but not <italic>HLA-DRB1*11</italic>:<italic>01</italic> (DR1101), can bind functional epitopes derived from the dominant autoantigen pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 (PDC-E2) [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We hypothesise that epitope analysis (using resources such as the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource) may suggest that the identified significant DQ residues are likely to be equally significant immunologically, with risk, but not protective alleles being permissive for binding of binding of epitopes derived from the immuno-dominant inner lipoyl binding domain of PDC-E2.</p><p>The association seen between PBC and HLA-C 156R, implicated by all analysis methods, is intriguing, as HLA-C is known to be not very potent in antigen presentation. However, HLA-C does have a significant role in interaction with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and this therefore raises the question of whether the HLA-C association is related to T-cell interaction, or is rather about presentation to KIRs. The fact that, in our data set, we observed no association between PBC and imputed KIR haplotypes and copy number variation makes this explanation seem less plausible, but it remains an interesting topic for future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Research and Development Departments of all National Health Service (NHS) Trusts participating in this study and by the Oxford Research Ethics Committee C (Oxford REC C reference 07/H0606/96).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Study samples and genotyping</title><p>The cases, controls and genotype data used here have been described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In brief, a total of 2981 PBC cases were contributed by the UK PBC Consortium, a consortium operating within 142 NHS trusts, including all UK liver transplant centres. All cases were of self-declared British or Irish ancestry, over 18 years old with probable or certain PBC. 8,970 controls of self-declared British or Irish ancestry were provided by the 1958 British Birth Cohort and the National Blood Service. Samples were genotyped on an Illumina iSelect HD custom genotyping array at either the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (2981 cases and 4537 controls) or the Center for Public Health Genomics at the University of Virginia (4433 controls). Following sample and SNP quality control, we retained 2861 cases and 8514 controls that passed previously-derived quality control checks [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], genotyped at 143,006 SNPs, of which 7848 fell within the extended MHC region [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] on chromosome 6 (ranging from 25,650,000 to 33,426,000 base pairs, Build36).

For a detailed description of the HLA imputation and subsequent association analysis performed using the different software packages, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s028">S3 Text</xref>. Motyer et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] recently compared the performance of HLA*IMP:03, HLA*IMP:02, HIBAG and SNP2HLA and found that HLA*IMP:03 and HIBAG gave generally the best (similar) levels of performance, achieving high accuracy (in the range ~90&#8211;99%, depending on HLA locus). Earlier studies had shown that HLA*IMP:02 and HIBAG performed well in comparison to HLA*IMP:01 [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while SNP2HLA performed similarly to HLA*IMP:01 [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although based on similar methodological approaches (and, in our investigation, producing largely concordant results, see Results), the output from the four packages that we considered is not fully comparable. HLA*IMP:03 and SNP2HLA provide the posterior probability for each best-imputed allele (although SNP2HLA does not output this quantity directly but rather converts it to a dosage), while HLA*IMP:02 and HIBAG produce a posterior probability for each possible genotype (i.e. for each combination of two alleles, including combinations that have lower probabilities than the best combination). We found this genotype-based output most convenient for averaging over the possible genotype combinations (while allowing appropriately for imputation uncertainty) and for subsequent imputation of amino acid substitutions. Neither HIBAG nor HLA*IMP:02 directly impute amino acid substitutions (as is done by SNP2HLA) but this can be done manually using the peptide sequences of classical alleles available in the IMGT/HLA database (see below). According to Motyer et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], HLA*IMP:03 can also impute amino acid substitutions, but this feature was not enabled in the development version of HLA*IMP:03 to which we were given access. Given (a) the similar performance of the four packages in our data set with respect to classical HLA allele imputation (see Results), (b) the superior performance of HLA*IMP:03 and HIBAG seen by Motyer et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and (c) the greater convenience of the output from HLA*IMP:02 and HIBAG, for all subsequent detailed modelling of amino acid substitutions we used the imputations derived from HIBAG.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>KIR imputation</title><p>We also used the software package KIR*IMP [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to examine the association between PBC and genes on chromosome 19q13.4 that encode for killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). In a previous evaluation of KIR*IMP, Vukcevic et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that KIR imputation using the high-density Illumina Immunochip array is extremely accurate, achieving &gt; 98% accuracy for the majority of loci, at least 95% accuracy for half the remaining loci, and &gt; 90% for the rest. For distinguishing the broad A and B haplotype groups, KIR*IMP achieves ~98.5% accuracy. KIR imputation in our data set was informed by 241 genotyped SNPs in the KIR region that matched the 301 SNPs available in the KIR*IMP training data set. The resulting imputed KIR allele and haplotype frequencies in our PBC data set were found to be extremely close to those seen in the KIR training set. Case-control association analysis was carried out using the Unphased package [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and via logistic regression in R, with predictors corresponding to KIR*IMP&#8217;s &#8220;best-guess&#8221; genotypes (provided that both inferred alleles had posterior probability &gt; 0.8). Analysis of each individual KIR allele (or haplotype) was performed by using the dosage of each allele (or haplotype) as a single predictor variable. Additionally, a multi-allelic (multi-df) omnibus analysis was also carried out by including predictor variables encoding the multiplicative effects of all alleles at a position (or all haplotypes at a set of positions) in the regression model simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Stepwise logistic regression analysis</title><p>Stepwise logistic regression [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was used to assess the importance of variables while accounting for the effects of other, previously detected, effects. Predictor variables encoding an individual&#8217;s estimated dosage of the relevant SNP, HLA classical allele or amino acid substitution were included as predictors in a logistic regression equation in a forward stepwise fashion (and were subsequently considered for removal from the model in a backward stepwise fashion). For full details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007833.s026">S1 Text</xref>.</p><p>For our primary analyses, we did not consider it necessary to include additional predictors such as principal component scores in the regression model to account for possible population stratification, as prior analysis of this data set [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] has shown little evidence of population stratification (once appropriate QC has been performed to remove outlying individuals) in this UK-based sample. Similarly we did not consider it necessary to include gender as a covariate&#8211;even though gender is known to be important in PBC (the disease is more prevalent in women than in men)&#8211;as theoretical arguments dictate that inclusion of gender should not bias the results of association tests between disease and genetic factors (outside of the X/Y chromosomes) as gender is not a <italic>confounder</italic> (it is associated with the disease outcome, but not with the genetic predictors). Indeed, it has been shown [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] that inclusion of known covariates such as gender can even reduce power to detect genetic effects in case-control studies. We subsequently investigated the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion (or not) of principal component scores and gender in the regression model, using the top 10 principal component scores calculated from a pruned (by LD) set of SNPs with SNPs in the extended HLA region removed.</p><p>We also investigated the stability of the stepwise selection procedure through a resampling approach motivated by the stability selection procedure of Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In each of 1000 bootstrap replicates, we randomly selected 2/3 of our cases and 2/3 of our controls to form a new case/control data set and applied stepwise regression to select the top 20 amino acid predictors, noting the order and significance of entry of each predictor in each replicate.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Exhaustive and stochastic searches for best combinations of amino acid variables</title><p>A drawback of stepwise regression is that it employs a &#8220;greedy algorithm&#8221; whereby predictors are only included conditional on other predictors that have already been added to the model.

To overcome this issue, we performed an exhaustive search via logistic regression of all pairwise and all three-way combinations of individual amino acids (generating 2 df and 3 df tests respectively), and all pairwise and all three-way combinations of amino acid <italic>positions</italic> (generating multi-df tests that include predictor variables encoding the multiplicative effects of all amino acid substitutions at both&#8211;or all three&#8211;positions in the regression model simultaneously).</p><p>Moving beyond 3-way combinations is computationally prohibitive: the 1028 individual amino acids substitutions considered here result in 527,878 pairwise combinations and 180,534,276 three-way combinations; modelling the full set of effects at each of the 368 positions results in 67,528 pairwise tests or 32,953,664 three-way tests, each with potentially many df. To address this issue, we used two Bayesian stochastic search algorithm implementations that have been proposed in the context of genetic fine-mapping to search for the best set of genetic predictors explaining a phenotypic outcome: the GUESSFM package [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and the FINEMAP package [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For GUESSFM we used as input data the &#8220;best guess&#8221; amino acid designations from HIBAG, while for FINEMAP we used as input the Z-score from the marginal association test of amino acid with disease status. Both packages require specification of various user-defined parameters (such as the expected or maximum number of causal variants) in order to inform the prior distribution of the search space; we performed some limited investigations of the sensitivity of the results to the parameter choices made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>3D protein structure modelling</title><p>The atomic coordinates (3 dimensional structures) of any HLA molecules carrying or not carrying a significantly associated amino acid residue were determined using comparative protein structure modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints as implemented by the MODELLER 9.14 computer algorithm [<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1007833.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
