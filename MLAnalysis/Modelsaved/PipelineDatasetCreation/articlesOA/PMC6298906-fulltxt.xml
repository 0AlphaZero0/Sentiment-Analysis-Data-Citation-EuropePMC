It has become the focus of gynecological research. Analysis targeting the pathogenesis of EMS is the key to providing more effective treatments. In recent years, the superiority of traditional Chinese medicine in treating EMS has been highlighted, so we investigated the impact of a Chinese medicinal formula (Xiao Liu Fang) on the &#8220;3A&#8221; ability, <italic>in situ</italic>, of ectopic endometrial stromal cells in patients with EMS. Primary endometrial stromal cells were isolated using a modified net filtration method, cultured, and identified in different groups. Endometrial cell attachment was measured using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay, cell aggression was detected by the transwell cell-invasion assay, and angiogenesis was defined by evaluating the mRNA concentrations of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Attachment, aggression, and angiogenesis (AAA) plays an important role in EMS, and a high dose of the Xiao Liu Fang extract can be used for the treatment of EMS owing to its inhibition of the AAA of endometrial stromal cells. Therefore, in-depth studies targeting the effective mechanisms and targets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of EMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>endometriosis</kwd><kwd>EMS</kwd><kwd>endometrial stromal cells</kwd><kwd>invigorating the kidney and promoting blood circulation</kwd><kwd>attachment</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>and angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>AAA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Endometriosis (EMS) is a common gynecological disease that affects 10%&#8211;15% of women; 80% of patients have symptoms such as pelvic pain, and 30%&#8211;50% experience infertility.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The recurrence rate of EMS is 40% over 5 years, regardless of the treatment administered,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> which can seriously affect the quality of life.

After removing from the incubator, the cells were rinsed three times using sterile PBS buffer; 50&#160;&#956;L of 10&#160;g &#8901; L<sup>&#8722;1</sup> BSA was then added into each well for another 30&#160;min of incubation. The cells in all the groups were then digested with 0.25% trypsin and the cell density was adjusted to 5&#160;&#215; 10<sup>4</sup> &#8901; mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. 100&#160;&#956;L of this cell suspension was inoculated into the Matrigel-filled wells in the 96-well culture plates. For each concentration, three parallel samples were prepared. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 2&#160;hr. After carefully discarding the culture medium, the cells were rinsed three times using PBS to wash away the free cells. To each well, 200&#160;&#956;L of 2% FBS-supplemented DMEM and 20&#160;&#956;L of 5&#160;mg &#8901; mL<sup>&#8722;1</sup> methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) were added and incubated for 4&#160;hr. After discarding the medium, 150&#160;&#956;L of DMSO was added into each well for a 10-min vibration. The absorbance (OD) of each well was measured at 490&#160;nm, using the all-in-one microplate reader.</p><p id="p0115">The cells were divided into five groups and the following were administered to each group: the control (normal saline group) received 0.9% saline (1&#160;mL/day), the gestrinone group received gestrinone at a dose of 1.8&#160;mg/mL/day), the low-dose Xiao Liu Fang group received 5&#160;mg/mL/day of the Xiao Liu Fang extract, and the high-dose Xiao Liu Fang group received 10&#160;mg/mL/day of the Xiao Liu Fang extract. All the treatments were administered once daily for 7&#160;days, and the cell samples were collected 2&#160;hr after administration.</p><p id="p0120">Following transfer into 6-well plates for normal culture, the cells occupied 80% of the well on the following day, at which time the corresponding intervention drugs were added for a 24-hr intervention. All procedures were performed aseptically. Matrigel, stored at &#8722;20&#176;C, was thawed overnight on ice at temperatures ranging between 2&#176;C and 8&#176;C. Then, 100&#160;&#956;L of Matrigel was added to 300&#160;&#956;L of pre-cooled serum-free medium and thoroughly mixed. The diluted Matrigel (25&#160;&#956;L) thus prepared was added to the upper chamber of the transwell plate and covered entirely with a polycarbonate ester film for 30&#160;min at 37&#176;C to enable Matrigel polymerization. The cells in each group were rinsed three times with PBS, and a single cell suspension was prepared using serum-free medium by conventional methods to achieve a cell density of 5&#160;&#215; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. The placenta staining test requires a cell viability of over 95%. Then 100&#160;&#956;L of the cell suspension (5&#160;&#215; 10<sup>4</sup> cells) was added into the upper chamber of the transwell plate along with 200&#160;&#956;L of serum-free medium. After this, 500&#160;&#956;L of 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM was added into the lower chamber of the transwell plate, and the plate was subsequently incubated for 5&#160;hr at 37&#176;C at a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 48%. After gently wiping the Matrigel and the cells on the upper surface of the polycarbonate film with a damp swab, a defined amount of ice-cold methanol was added to achieve a 30-min fixation. The film was stained with crystal violet (0.1%) for 30&#160;min at room temperature, followed by rinsing with PBS two times. Five fields of view were then randomly selected for photography and counting.</p><p id="p0125">The total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The 20-mL reaction system included 1&#160;&#956;L of 10 mol/L deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1&#160;&#956;L of random primer, and 2&#160;&#956;g of sample RNA, which were mixed thoroughly at 65&#176;C for 5&#160;min and then quickly introduced into ice water for centrifugation.
