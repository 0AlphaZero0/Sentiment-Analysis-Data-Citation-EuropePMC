The cytoplasmic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1 or PEPCK-C), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, initiates the gluconeogenesis process and is reportedly dysregulated in multiple types of cancer. Gluconeogenesis mainly occurs in the liver during fasting, and previous studies have demonstrated that PCK1 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the role of PCK1 in cancer progression remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we found that PCK1 expression was decreased in HCC as compared to adjacent normal liver tissues, and low PCK1 expression correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, overexpression of PCK1 suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatoma cells. In addition, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), an antioxidant enzyme regulated by the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, was downregulated upon overexpression of PCK1 in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, we verified this axis using nude mouse xenograft model. Finally, we found that auranofin, a TXNRD1 inhibitor, enhanced the sensitivity of PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCK1 deficiency promotes hepatoma cell proliferation via the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of transcription factor Nrf2, and that targeting the TXNRD1 antioxidant pathway sensitizes PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase 1</kwd><kwd>thioredoxin reductase 1</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">81371827</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81872270</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">31171307</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81572683</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81602417</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81602045</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7300"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third cause of cancer-related mortality (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), is liable to developing malignant and drug-resistant tumors, with high risk of recurrence. A thorough understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and novel therapeutic strategies are highly needed. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In normal cells, energy is obtained primarily through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, tumor cells undergo glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, known as the &#8220;Warburg effect,&#8221; which supports tumor growth by accumulating glycolytic intermediates for anabolic biosynthesis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The changed glucose metabolism endows tumor cells with metabolic flexibility for biosynthesis requirements. The dysregulation of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis causes a metabolic reprogramming that might be essential for supporting the growth, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. Meanwhile, emerging evidence is linking altered expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, in particular, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK, also known as PEPCK, EC number 4.1.1.32), with tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PCK1, as the first rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and its dysfunction has been related to diabetes, obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and other metabolic diseases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Elevated expression of PCK1 has been reported to benefit tumor growth in certain cancers by maintaining anabolic metabolism (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast, in HCC, PCK1 is downregulated (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and a functional study indicated that forced PCK1 expression retards hepatoma cell proliferation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), however, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), and superoxide anion (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>), are formed by the partial reduction of oxygen and are generated as normal byproducts of numerous cellular processes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Under physiological conditions, ROS are maintained at low levels, and act as signaling molecules to activate cell proliferation and survival pathways (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, excessive ROS production induces oxidative stress, causing cell death or apoptosis, and plays an important role in tumor initiation and progression (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) signaling pathway is one of the crucial defense systems against oxidative stress in tumor tissues and cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). ROS production induces Nrf2 translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with small MAF proteins and binds the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoters of target genes to activate their transcription to protect against oxidative stress.</p><p>Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), an antioxidant enzyme regulated by Nrf2, catalyzes reduction of the active site disulfide of thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and several other substrates and plays a key role in antioxidant defense, redox regulation, cell proliferation, and cell signaling events (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). TXNRD1 is highly expressed in many cancers, and has been linked with tumor development (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Recent studies aimed to suppress TXNRD1 as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancers by using various molecules, such as microRNA-124 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), auranofin (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and gambogic acid (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Mechanically, the Trx1 system senses and responds to ROS generated by cellular respiration, metabolism, and immune response, and then regulates the redox status, function, and activity of its target signal pathway (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, it is not clear whether PCK1 modulates the expression of TXNRD1 by influencing the ROS levels.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of PCK1 in HCC development <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We explored whether PCK1 plays a role in oxidative stress and Nrf2/Keap1 pathway. We also investigated the antitumor effect of auranofin combined with sorafenib in PCK1 knockout hepatoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results implicate that PCK1 acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC and combination therapy of sorafenib and TXNRD1 inhibitors may be a novel strategy for HCC treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Samples</title><p>Surgically resected samples of HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues were obtained from 28 patients at the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China).

Furthermore, combined treatment with sorafenib and auranofin induced a synergistic inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in PCK1-KO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In addition, excess ROS accumulation were observed in PCK1-KO cells treated with auranofin plus sorafenib (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Apoptosis is one of the most important factors affecting cell proliferation. To investigate the effects of sorafenib and auranofin on apoptosis, we detected the protein levels of Caspase3/9, Cleaved caspase 3/9, Bax and Bcl-2, and analyzed the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which indicates apoptosis occurrence.

(<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) Our results demonstrated that PCK1 was significantly decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, which was verified by analysis of data obtained from the TCGA database. Furthermore, lower PCK1 expression correlated with poorer prognosis. Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), our data suggest a tumor-suppressor function of PCK1 in HCC.</p><p>However, elevated PCK1 expression has also been found in other types of cancers, such as melanoma (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), breast cancer (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and colorectal cancer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), where it supports anabolic pathways and cell proliferation. The distinct expression profile of PCK1 in HCC tissues compared to other solid tumors can be explained by the fact that in the liver, which accounts for approximately 90% of gluconeogenesis, the upregulation of gluconeogenesis by PCK1 results in the suppression of hepatoma proliferation. Specifically, PCK1-induced promotion of gluconeogenesis enhances energy consumption and attenuates energy production, including glycolysis, and mitochondrial respiration, which results in ATP depletion. Decreased aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration pathway also suppresses the generation of metabolic intermediates as building blocks for cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Forced PCK1 expression in glucose-starved hepatoma cells reportedly induces tricarboxylic acid cycle cataplerosis, leading to energy crisis, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In cancer cells, excess ROS are generated through increased anabolism, decreased catabolism, or mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that glucose metabolism-related enzymes, such as PKM and FBP1 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), can participate in the regulation of ROS production. In our study, low expression of PCK1 resulted in elevated intracellular ROS level <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. PCK1 plays a crucial role in hepatic anabolism and catabolism (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, PCK1 is likely to regulate the ROS level through altering the metabolism of HCC. Ko et al. reported that PCK1 deletion in myeloid cells increases the intracellular ROS level (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Ma et al. reported that 3-MPA, an inhibitor of PCK1, could increase ROS in CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells through the abrogation of the PCK1-glycogen-pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Since NADPH is a key product of PPP, and plays an essential role in the ROS generation via glutathione (GSH) system, we hypothesized that glucose-6-phosphate which indirectly catalyzed by PCK1 is channeled to PPP. Our results demonstrate that PCK1 overexpression increases the ratio of NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>, and further decreases ROS production. However, it has been reported that forced PCK1 expression in glucose-starved HCC cells induces a high ROS level (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, the specific mechanism of PCK1 affecting ROS through metabolic regulation under different culture conditions requires further investigation.</p><p>Our data further showed that overexpression of PCK1 abrogated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the expression of its downstream gene TXNRD1. The transcription factor Nrf2 is considered a major transcriptional regulator in the defense against ROS (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). TXNRD1 is a critical antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of thioredoxin to regulate cellular redox homeostasis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). TXNRD1 is upregulated in many human malignancies, and inhibition of the TXN pathway causes hepatoma cell death (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Furthermore, auranofin, a TXNRD1 inhibitor, has been reported to induce apoptosis and to enhance the anticancer activities of chemotherapeutic agents (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In line herewith, we observed that TXNRD1 may be related to drug resistance of hepatoma cells. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the first-line therapy for patients with advanced HCC (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, considering the sorafenib resistance crisis in HCC, the development of new combination therapies with sorafenib is urgently required. Recent studies reported that synergistic combination of sorafenib and uracil-tegafur or octreotide can improve the sensitivity toward sorafenib in the treatment of HCC (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This study confirmed that sorafenib in combination with auranofin exhibits a stronger pro-apoptotic effect <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PCK1 is significantly downregulated in HCC, and PCK1 deficiency decreases NADPH/NADP+ ratio, increases cellular ROS levels, which results in activation of Nrf2 and expression of TXNRD1(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). In addition, auranofin enhances the sensitivity to sorafenib via inhibition of TXNRD1 in PCK1-knockout cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism of antioxidant enzyme gene TXNRD1 mediated by altered metabolism in liver cancer, and might offers a potential therapy for HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All patients provided informed consent, and this study was conducted with the approval of Institutional Ethical Review Board of Chongqing Medical University (project license number: 2017012).
