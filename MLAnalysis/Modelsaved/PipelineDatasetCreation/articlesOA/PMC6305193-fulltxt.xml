The wood that it produces provides raw material for construction, fuel, and paper manufacturing. During secondary growth, the cambium contains a pool of pluripotent stem cells that continuously produce xylem and phloem, resulting in thickening of the stem and roots and thereby increasing plant biomass (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Miyashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Secondary growth is also observed in herbaceous Arabidopsis, which provides an excellent model system for this process (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Nieminen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Secondary xylem development involves a cascade of processes including cell wall expansion, secondary wall deposition, lignification, and plant cell death (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Turner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bollh&#246;ner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Several transcription factors have been found to regulate secondary xylem development (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Demura and Fukuda, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and plant hormones such as auxin, cytokinin, brassinosteroids, and ethylene are also involved in the process (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Milhinhos and Miguel, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Both tracheary elements (TEs) and fiber cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) during xylem development. PCD during TE differentiation has been extensively studied in the Arabidopsis model system, in poplar, and in <italic>Zinnia elegans</italic> cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. During TE differentiation, collapse of the vacuole is considered the initial moment of cell death during PCD. The release of hydrolytic enzymes stored in the vacuole leads to the rapid degradation of organelles, nuclear DNA, and part of the cell wall (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kuriyama, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Obara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Escamez and Tuominen, 2014</xref>). Several cysteine proteases have been implicated in the regulation of xylem PCD during TE differentiation. The PCD-specific hydrolytic cysteine protease ZCP4 accumulates in the vacuoles of developing TEs in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and plays a role in the degradation of cell contents following vacuolar collapse (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). A peptide aldehyde inhibitor of papain-type peptidases blocks autolysis of TEs in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cultures (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Woffenden <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). A protease with caspase-3-like activity is associated with PCD during secondary xylem development in poplar (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Two xylem-specific papain-like cysteine peptidases, <italic>XYLEM CYSTEINE PROTEASE1</italic> (<italic>XCP1</italic>) and <italic>XCP2</italic>, have been shown to localize to vacuoles and act as effectors of autolysis during TE differentiation in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Funk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Avci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Arabidopsis metacaspase 9 (AtMC9) is a xylem-specific metacaspase involved in regulating TE autolysis, and its loss of function results in defects in this process (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bollh&#246;ner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although several proteases have been characterized in PCD during xylem development, the full extent of the involvement of cysteine proteases remains unknown.</p><p>It has been previously determined that CEP1, a papain-like cysteine protease characterized by a C-terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, is expressed in Arabidopsis roots, flowers, and stems, and is involved in tapetal PCD and pollen development (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that mutations in <italic>CEP1</italic> delayed plant growth and altered xylem cell number. To determine whether <italic>CEP1</italic> is also involved in PCD during xylem development in Arabidopsis, we compared the structure and global transcriptional expression patterns of the inflorescence stem of <italic>cep1</italic> mutants with wild-type plants. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the mutant plants displayed delayed organelle degradation during PCD and had thicker secondary walls in fiber cells and TEs. Many genes regulating the biosynthesis of secondary wall components were up-regulated in the <italic>cep1</italic> mutant. These results indicate that CEP1 is important in degrading the cellular content during PCD of secondary xylem growth and that it affects secondary wall deposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> T-DNA insertion mutants <italic>cep1</italic> (SALK_013036) and <italic>cep1-2</italic> (SALK_137016) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abrc.osu.edu">https://abrc.osu.edu</ext-link>).

Given that the growth of <italic>cep1</italic> mutant plants was delayed by 1 week relative to the WT, we collected material based on developmental stage as described previously (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Altamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), with some modifications. Following anthesis of the first flower, stem development can be divided into four different stages based on morphological landmarks (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Altamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). It took 5 d and 12 d after bolting for WT and <italic>cep1</italic> plants to reach stage 1, respectively, and it took 30 d and 38 d after bolting for WT and <italic>cep1</italic> mutants to reach stage 4, respectively. Hence, stems from the <italic>cep1</italic> mutant were collected 1 week later than those of the WT plants at each stage. At stage 1, the first flower was observed. At stage 2, the first silique differentiated on the inflorescence stem. At stage 3, about 10 green siliques were observed on the inflorescence stem and apical floral buds were still present. At stage 4, when the inflorescence stem stopped flowering and elongating, most siliques were dehiscent and no apical buds were present. The heights of inflorescence stems from stages 1&#8211;4 were approximately 2, 12, 22, and 35 cm in both the WT and the <italic>cep1</italic> plants. Histological analyses revealed that both the <italic>cep1</italic> and <italic>cep1-2</italic> mutants and the WT plants differed in the shape and number of xylem cells at the different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). The xylem cells in the <italic>cep1</italic> mutants were irregularly shaped compared to the WT. In particular, at stage 4 the TEs in the WT exhibited a polygon shape, while those in the <italic>cep1</italic> mutant appeared round.

Our results indicated that CEP1 acts as an executor for post-mortem events to clear cell contents during PCD and that it plays an important role in regulating PCD during xylem development. Delayed PCD in <italic>cep1</italic> mutant plants led to an increase in secondary wall thickness in the fiber cells and TEs during xylogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Premature CEP1 is present in the vacuole in an inactive form, and it is transformed into a mature enzyme in an acidic environment through a proteolytic process of cleavage of pre- and pro-peptides. The mature form plays a role in tapetal degradation and pollen development (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Activated CEP1 and other hydrolytic enzymes released during vacuolar rupture result in the rapid degradation of cell contents. We speculate that CEP1 has a similar function in PCD during xylem development as tapetal degradation.</p><p>The phenotype of the <italic>cep1</italic> mutation suggested that CEP1 is directly involved in xylem PCD. However, because the <italic>cep1</italic> mutation did not completely inhibit differentiation of the TE by PCD, this suggests that CEP1 may not be the only protease involved in xylem PCD. Other proteases may need to catalyse premature CEP1 into its mature active form. It has been shown that &#947;-vacuolar processing enzyme (&#947;VPE) is critical for maturation of the plant vacuolar protease AtCPY (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Rojo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). &#947;VPE is a vegetative VPE that is highly expressed in the stem (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Gruis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and thus might be an ideal candidate to mediate the maturation process of CEP1 during xylem development. However, whether CEP1 is a direct substrate of &#947;VPE needs to be determined. Alternatively, other proteases may work in parallel with CEP1 to regulate PCD during xylem development. Non-degraded cellular remnants persist in the TE lumen following autolysis in <italic>xcp1</italic> and <italic>xcp1/xcp2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Funk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Avci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, whether CEP1 and other proteases are involved in the same pathway or function in independent pathways during xylem PCD remains to be determined.</p><sec id="s17"><title>CEP1 is involved in co-regulating both PCD and secondary wall deposition during xylem development</title><p>Indirect evidence has indicated that pharmacological agents that block xylem cell death also block secondary wall formation (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Groover and Jones, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Twumasi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our data showed that CEP1 not only regulated the degradation of cellular content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) but also affected secondary cell wall deposition during xylem development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3S</xref>), suggesting that CEP1 co-regulated the processes of cell death and secondary wall deposition. CEP1 acts as an executor in clearing cellular content during PCD, and the digested cellular constituents could be used as substrates for the synthesis of new secondary walls (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Groover and Jones, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Helm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our transcriptome data revealed that many genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary wall components, including cellulose, lignin, and xylan, were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>); however, these genes may not have been directly regulated by CEP1, but instead may have been to the result of the delayed xylem cell maturation or the thicker secondary cell walls.</p><p>We observed more organelles in fiber cells than in TEs in the <italic>cep1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).

In TE differentiation, rupture of the vacuole leads to rapid degradation of the cell contents and partial degradation of the primary wall. By contrast, the cytoplasmic contents of fiber cells begin to hydrolyse gradually ahead of vacuolar disintegration, and the cellular debris is retained for a long period of time before it is completely cleared (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Courtois-Moreau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Because the duration of PCD in fiber cells is longer than in TEs, this might account for more organelles being observed in in the former during xylem development.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>
