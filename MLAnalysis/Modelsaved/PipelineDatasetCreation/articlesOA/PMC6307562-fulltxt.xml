Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean right atrial pressure, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), diastolic PAP, mean PAP and cardiac output (CO) were measured at rest and peak exercise. PCWP (mid A-wave pressure) at rest was measured at end-expiration; during exercise PCWP was averaged over 10 s avoiding prominent V-waves. If large V-waves were present this was also measured (defined as V-wave &#8805;7 mm Hg higher than mean PCWP).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> CO was measured using thermodilution as the average of three measurements with &lt;10% difference.

Although this method has been reported to yield higher regurgitant volumes than direct measurements, it has highest reproducibility.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6 19</xref> In the clinical setting this method has been demonstrated to carry important information both in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#8211;9</xref> and is the method recommended in the AHA/ACC guidelines for management of valvular disease,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Haemodynamically, regurgitant volume correlated positively with PCWP, mPAP, V-wave and LV stroke work at rest. This provides a clear link between the severity of MR assessed with CMRI and the haemodynamic consequence of MR.</p><p>Regurgitant volume was also closely associated with severity of LA dilatation, but not LA function, where both LA active emptying and fractional change were preserved despite severe MR. LA enlargement is a hallmark of severe MR,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> where it can be conceptualised as an adaptive response to volume overload. Thus, LA dilatation will result in increased atrial compliance in an attempt to maintain normal LA (and pulmonary) pressures. In the present study we found extensive LA dilatation in all subjects. As expected LA size was associated with mitral regurgitant volume. In addition we also found at rest a good association between LA size (LA maximal, minimal and preatrial contraction volumes) and PCWP at rest. This demonstrates that LA volume in primary MR carries important information of the haemodynamic burden of the valve disease.</p><p>In patients with LV pressure overload such as severe aortic stenosis,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> patients with heart failure with preserved EF,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and patients with diastolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> we and others have demonstrated that even if PCWP at rest is normal, exercise with increased CO induces a considerable and uniform increase in PCWP, thereby unmasking the severity of diastolic dysfunction with exercise. In line with this, LA maximal volume and non-invasive surrogates of filling pressure on echocardiography have been shown to be associated with PCWP both at rest and with exercise in these conditions, where a severely enlarged LA will predict an abnormally increased PCWP with exercise.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21 23</xref> Contrary to these disorders, we found no association between LA volumes or function with exercise PCWP in the volume-overload heart due to compensated significant MR. None of the associations detected at rest could be found with exercise. To further understand determinants of exercise PCWP we sought to determine EDPVR, which by definition indicates the amount of diastolic filling that will occur for a specified filling pressure and therefore is a key physiological determinant of preload.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We adopted the method for estimating EDPVR from a single end-diastolic pressure-volume point which has been described and validated previously in detail.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Doing this we found that patients with an increased PCWP at rest had a right-shifted EDPVR; thus, for a given EDPVR, LVEDV was increased suggesting a more compliant LV. This compares well with higher mitral regurgitant volume in patients with increased resting PCWP; thus, the right shift of EDPVR signifies the expected adaption to volume overload in significant MR. However, patients, where exercise PCWP was abnormally increased, had a left shift of the resting EDPVR and a steeper slope than patients with normal PCWP with exercise, thus, adaption to significant MR could not be detected at rest based on conventional assessment of severity of chamber dilatation, severity of MR or resting PCWP. So where resting PCWP seems to reflect the severity of valve disease per se, exercise PCWP seems to a greater extent to reflect intrinsic diastolic LV function. Thus, people with exercise PCWP elevation display a physiology more like heart failure with preserved EF, and thus smaller, stiffer hearts and no plasma volume expansion.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 22</xref> This physiology was also associated with higher rate of referral for sugery even though the heart team was unaware of the result of catheterisation in most cases. Thus even though the number of patients is too low to draw any conclusion of therapeutic consequences, exercise haemodynamic assessment may provide additional information in the patient with ambiguous symptoms.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>All patients were required to undergo a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a significant number of patients declined participation, which may introduce selection bias by excluding more sedentary patients. Patients with pulmonary congestion or unstable haemodynamics were also excluded. Thus the present study only reflects ambulatory patients with significantly compensated MR.</p><p>A further limitation is that CMRI was done only at rest, thus we cannot measure the EDPVR during exercise. Previous data suggest an acute shift up and to the left of EDPVR in patients with heart failure and preserved EF.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Whether the EDPVR in patients with elevated exercise PCWP showed a further upward left shift of EDPVR is speculative. The subjects were examined with right heart catheterisation during semisupine exercise, and results may differ with exercise in the upright position, as venous return is increased in the semisupine position. We used a cut-off of 28 mm Hg in PCWP for abnormal PCWP with exercise based on a previous study by Wolsk <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which is higher than the often used threshold of 25 mm Hg. This was done to ensure the group with increased exercise PCWP truly were abnormal.</p><p>Measurement of aortic flow at the sinotubular junction (instead of at the level of the valve) might underestimate the aortic flow by 10%&#8211;15%<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and thus cause modest overestimation of the regurgitant volume on CMRI. However, quantification of MR severity by CMRI is generally associated with high accuracy and reproducibility.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 19</xref> The relative small sample size increases the risk of statistical uncertainty but to our knowledge this is the first study to describe invasively measured haemodynamic characteristics and associations with LV and LA morphology obtained with CMRI in patients with significant MR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with significant primary MR, the degree of LV and especially LA dilatation is associated with resting PCWP, V-wave and PAP at rest. In contrast, exercise haemodynamics have little relationship to MR severity, and alterations in LV diastolic chamber compliance are the more important determinant. Estimation of EDPVR suggests lower LV compliance in patients with elevated PCWP with exercise, an association that was not seen for patients with increased resting PCWP, thus, suggesting that filling pressures with exercise are determined by intrinsic LV diastolic properties in primary MR, whereas resting haemodynamics are more closely associated with severity of MR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Conception or design of the work: RB, JEM, BAB, MJA.
