EBV is normally present in the latent state in the peripheral blood B cell compartment. The EBV latent-to-lytic switch is required for virus spread and virus-induced carinogenesis. Immunosuppression or DNA damage can induce the reactivation of EBV replication. EBV alone is rarely sufficient to cause cancer. In this study, we investigated the roles of host microRNAs and environmental factors, such as DNA-damage agents, in EBV reactivation and its association with lymphomagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We first analyzed the publicly available microRNA array data containing 45 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and 10 control lymph nodes or B cells with or without EBV infection. In situ hybridization for miR-18a and immunohistochemitry were performed to evaluate the correlation between the expression of miR-18a and nuclear EBV protein EBNA1 in lymphoid neoplasm. The proliferative effects of miR-18a were investigated in EBV-positive or &#8211;negative lymphoid neoplasm cell lines. EBV viral load was measured by a quantitative real-time EBV PCR and FISH assay. The genomic instability was evaluated by CGH-array.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In this study, we analyzed the publicly available microRNA array data and observed that the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster was associated with EBV status. In situ hybridization for miR-18a, which is a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, showed a significant upregulation in lymphoma samples. miR-18a, which shares the homolog sequence with EBV-encoded BART-5, promoted the proliferation of lymphoma cells in an EBV status-dependent manner. The DNA-damaging agent UV or hypoxia stress induced EBV activation, and miR-18a contributed to DNA damaging-induced EBV reactivation. In contrast to the promoting effect of ATM on the lytic EBV reactivation in normoxia, ATM inhibited lytic EBV gene expression and decreased the EBV viral load in the prescence of hypoxia-induced DNA damage. miR-18a reactivated EBV through inhibiting the ATM-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and caused genomic instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Taken together, these results indicate that DNA-damaging agents and host microRNAs play roles in EBV reactivation. Our study supported the interplay between host cell DDR, environmental genotoxic stress and EBV.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12885-018-5205-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>miR-18a</kwd><kwd>EBV reactivation</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>Genomic instability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81272255,81472695,81773147</award-id><award-id>81402249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Liyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Juanjuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004735</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of&#160;Hunan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015JJ2181</award-id><award-id>2013JJ3039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Juanjuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hunan provincial scientific research innovation special key project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2012TT2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yanjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>111 project</institution></funding-source><award-id>111-2-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guiyuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The project of Innovation-driven Plan of Central South University</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016CX023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shuai</surname><given-names>Cijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of Central South University</institution></funding-source><award-id>ZLXD2017004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Juanjuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects nearly all humans. Although EBV injection is asymptomatic in most individuals, EBV is closely associated with several types of malignancies, including lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to the tropism for B lymphocytes, the most common forms of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders are B-cell lymphomas: Hodgkin lymphomas (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), including Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. EBV also plays a complex and multifaceted role in T/NK cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The virus is present in two stages: an active lytic state and latent state, and the virus can only be spread during the active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. During primary EBV infection, a portion of individuals, particularly adolescents, develop infectious mononucleosis (IM). EBV infection in vitro can transform resting B cells into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL).Under normal conditions, EBV is present in the latent state in the peripheral blood B cell compartment. EBV can be reactivated under certain circumstances. Reactivation of the viral replication plays an important role in the development of EBV-associated malignancy. Oral hairy leukoplakia is unequivocally due to lytic EBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Except for hematological malignancies, the lytic form of EBV infection was also observed in malignant breast epithelial cells in certain cases of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. EBV reactivation-induced cell proliferation and migration caused the relapse of NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Elevated levels of EBV DNA is observed in EBV-positive lymphoma patients with active disease but not in EBV-positive patients in remission or those with EBV-negative tumors, indicating that the EBV viral load at lymphoma diagnosis is an indicator of disease activity and biological characteristics associated with a negative prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Environmental factors serve to promote EBV-driven tumors, which are primarily of B cell origin but also of epithelial and NK or T cell origin. Immunosuppression or DNA-damaging agents, including chemotherapy, certain HDAC inhibitors, and radiation, can induce the reactivation of EBV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. EBV infection in turn has been implicated in DNA damage. Phosphorylated H2AX, a reporter of DNA damage was increased in EBV-carrying cells in the absence of exogenous stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Deregulation of the cellular Myc proto-oncogene is the hallmark of all types of Burkitt lymphoma. The Myc-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway regulates miRNAs, especially miR-17-92 clusters. miR-17-92 is transcribed as a polycistron, which is subsequently processed into 7 mature miRNAs: miR-17-3p and -5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a. The miR-17-92 cluster is frequently amplified or overexpressed in lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Compared with the other miR-17-92 members,which showed distinct functional interplays with Myc, the role of miR-18a remains unexplained. In our previous study, miR-18a was shown to promote malignant progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is closely related to EBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. miR-18a shares a homologous sequence with EBV-encoded BART 5. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the roles of miR-18a in the tumorigenesis of lymphoma and determine whether they are mediated by EBV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and patients samples</title><p id="Par22">Human Burkitt lymphomas cell lines P3HR-1, Raji(EBV positive)and BJAB(EBV negative) were cultured in RPMI-1640 (HyClone, Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with penicillin G (100&#8201;U/mL), streptomycin (100&#8201;mg/mL) and 10% fetal calf serum.

Our data showed that miR-18a caused a burst of lytic gene expression and concomitant transcription of EBV latent gene expression. miR-18a promoted the proliferation of EBV-positive lymphoma cells but not EBV-negative lymphoma cells, suggesting that miR-18a-induced EBV reactivation mediated the increase in lymphoma cell growth.</p><p id="Par65">Although EBV infection is related to B cell malignancy, the slow course of cancer induction and infections worldwide suggest that EBV alone is rarely sufficient to cause lymphoma. EBV infection, endogenous and exogenous damages in DNA and host repair mechanisms play synergistic effects on tumorigenesis of lymphomas. Exposure to DNA damaging agents, such as certain chemotherapy, ultraviolet or hypoxia, can induce the reactivation of viral replication, causing fold increases in the EBV viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The replication of EBV, in turn, increases replicative stress, similar to oncogene activation, leading to the induction of the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR emerges as a barrier to tumor progression responding to cellular DNA replicative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The host DDR, which is orchestrated by ATM and ATR kinase, senses EBV-induced oncogenic stress,causes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and blocks long-term outgrowth of most infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Inhibition of the DDR kinase ATM markedly increases the transformation efficiency of primary B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ATM kinase expression is reduced in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It was reported that the DNA repair sensor ATM causes EBV lytic reactivation in Burkitt lymphoma cells in p53-dependent and non-dependent ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The EBV latent-to-lytic switch is mediated by the viral proteins BZLF1, BRLF1 and BRRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability of the EBV BRLF1 and BRRF1 proteins to induce lytic reactivation in EBV-infected AGS cells is ATM dependent. However, overexpression of BZLF1 induces lytic gene expression in the presence or absence of ATM activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ATM enhances BZLF1 promoter activity in the context of the intact EBV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, under normoxia, ATM induced the overexpression of BRLF1 and BMRF1, however, decreased the expression of BZLF1 in EBV-positive Raji cells. Under DNA damage stress, ATM decreased lytic and latent EBV gene expressions and reversed the induction of miR-18a on the EBV viral load. We speculated that ATM decreased EBV gene expression, including lytic or latent genes in the context of EBV- or DNA damage agents-induced genomic stress. As a host mechanism, miR-18a acts as a sensor to DNA damage stress induced by hypoxia, UV and EBV infection, inhibiting DDR and promoting genomic instability. miR-18a inhibited ATM-mediated DDR and increased the virus proliferation, increasing the growth of lymphomas and indicating the oncogenic effect of EBV is dependent on the host microenvironment. DNA damage that is not repaired leads to genomic instability and cancer. It is now generally accepted that oncoproteins encoded by tumor viruses can drive genomic instability and initiate tumorigenesis. EBV infection promotes genomic instability and telomere dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Repeated malarial infection helps EBV to cause lymphomas. However, it was reported that antibodies to fight malaria cause DNA damage that can lead to Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma because of the ligation of inappropriate segments of chromosomes during antibody affinity maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, host factors contribute to the genomic instability induced by viral replication.</p><p id="Par66">There are three EBV-encoded microRNAs that share sequences with human miRNAs: EBV miRNA BART1-3p with human miRNA miR-29a/b/c; BART5-5p with miR-18a/b and BART22-3p with miR-520d-5p, and miR-524-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. EBV-encoded microRNAs have been reported to regulate human and viral transcripts. EBV can also alter host miRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. BART miRNAs are present in all EBV-infected cells, with much higher expression in epithelial cells than in infected B lymphocytes. BART miRNAs act as repressors of EBV lytic replication and probably maintain a balance between the virus and its host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, EBV can enhance the expression of miR-18a (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). In contrast to the roles of BART miRNAs, the host miR-18a promoted EBV replication. Most EBV miRNAs co-target mRNAs with host miRNAs, in particular with members of the miR-17-92 miRNA cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our study found that ATM is targeted by miR-18a in EBV-infected BJAB cells but not in EBV negative BJAB, indicating that EBV miRNAs co-target mRNAs with host miRNAs. Although sharing seed sequence identity, miR-18a and BART5-5p showed different potential to regulate expression of LMP1. BART5-5p can repress the expression of LMP1 and not miR-18a-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par67">Taken together, this study&#8217;s results demonstrate the interplay of host factors, environmental factors and EBV infection status. Environmental genotoxic stresses, such as UV and we found the interplay of host factors, environmental factors and EBV infection status. Environmental genotoxic stresses, such as UV and hypoxia, caused EBV reactivation and overexpression of miR-18a. miR-18a targeted ATM and inhibited host DDR, thereby causing EBV reactivation and genomic instability and contributing to the development of lymphoproliferative diseases. Inhibition of miR-18a may be a novel approach to prevent the reactivation of EBV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
