specimens are challenging due to the technical limitations and low quantities of starting material, often resulting in low enrichments and poor signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we present an optimized protocol for transcription factor ChIP-seq analyses in human tissue, yielding an &#8764;100% success rate for all transcription factors analyzed. As proof of concept and to illustrate general applicability of the approach, human tissue from the breast, prostate, and endometrial cancers were analyzed. In addition to standard formaldehyde fixation, disuccinimidyl glutarate was included in the procedure, greatly increasing data quality. To illustrate the sensitivity of the optimized protocol, we provide high-quality ChIP-seq data for three independent factors (AR, FOXA1, and H3K27ac) from a single core needle prostate cancer biopsy specimen. In summary, double-cross-linking strongly improved transcription factor ChIP-seq quality on human tumor samples, further facilitating and enhancing translational research on limited amounts of tissue.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Cancer Society KWF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zwart</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KWF/Alpe d&#8217;HuZes Bas Mulder Award</institution><institution>Dutch Scientific Organization NWO VIDI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Steroid hormone receptors are not only critical regulators in human physiology, but also central players in multiple diseases, including cancer. The steroid hormone receptor family is composed of multiple members, including estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;), estrogen receptor &#946;, androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor. Around 75% of all human breast tumors are positive for, and considered dependent on, ER&#945;. ER&#945; is a hormone-dependent transcription factor, which upon activation by its natural ligand estradiol, binds regulatory regions throughout the genome to orchestrate responsive gene activity by chromatin looping (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fullwood et al, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Flach &amp; Zwart, 2016</xref>). This mode of activation is shared by practically all steroid hormone receptors, including AR. AR is considered the oncogenic driver in prostate cancer development and progression (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lonergan &amp; Tindall, 2011</xref>). Both ER&#945; and AR require direct functional involvement of pioneer factors, such as Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), to facilitate chromatin accessibility at designated binding sites for ER&#945; and AR (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Robinson &amp; Carroll, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many transcription factors, such as steroid hormone receptors and FOXA1 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Swinstead et al, 2016</xref>), are intrinsically dynamic when it comes to chromatin interactions. ER&#945; chromatin interactions are stabilized upon ligand binding, a step crucial for estradiol-mediated gene transcription and breast cancer cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al, 2011</xref>). Analogous to this, AR in prostate cancer cells is confined in the cytosol prior to testosterone binding (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Brinkmann et al, 1999</xref>). When activated, AR translocates into the nucleus to facilitate chromatin binding and testosterone-driven transcription. But even when activated, ER&#945; (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Swinstead et al, 2016</xref>) as well as AR (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al, 2002</xref>) binds the chromatin in a dynamic and transient fashion, which is in contrast to the stable histone modifications that make up a structural and stable factor of the chromatin.</p><p>To date, most reports on hormone receptor genomics, including ER&#945; and AR, made use of cell line models, and only slowly, reports on genome-wide chromatin binding in the context of human tumor tissue are being released. In breast cancer, we (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al, 2018</xref>) and others (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ross-Innes et al, 2012</xref>) identified distinct subsets of ER&#945; chromatin binding profiles with prognostic potential, enabling the stratification of patients on outcome. Comparable observations were reported in prostate cancer, in which AR chromatin binding signatures were indicative of patient outcome (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Stelloo et al, 2015</xref>). However, due to technical limitations in working with human tumor tissue, most reports were typically limited to large quantities of starting material derived from surgery.</p><p>Over the recent years, many laboratories have developed novel technologies to further optimize Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq analyses for low quantities of cells, including the addition of carriers (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zwart et al, 2013</xref>) and improved sequencing library preparation using transposase-mediated sequence indexing (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Marine et al, 2011</xref>). More recently, a micro-fluidics/barcoding technology has been reported to enable ChIP-seq analyses for histone modifications on a single-cell level (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rotem et al, 2015</xref>). These and other technological advances have greatly improved immunoprecipitation efficiency and found intelligent ways to resolve a &#8220;minimal quantity of cells&#8221; problem. Still, when applying these approaches in clinical specimens, other challenges exist, which currently prevent the generation of high-quality ChIP-seq profiles for transcription factors, including suboptimal tissue fixation. Recently, the use of additional fixatives next to standard formaldehyde (FA) has been reported to increase ChIP efficiency in cell line models (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Engelen et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Puc et al, 2015</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aoki et al, 2014</xref>). The application of this novel approach in human tissue specimens remains unexplored.</p><p>Here, we report an improved ChIP-seq procedure, which involves implementation of disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) as an additional fixative next to standard FA fixation, greatly enhancing the quality of hormone receptor ChIP-seq analyses in human tumor tissue. Since data quality for histone modifications was not affected, the altered procedure exclusively increased the data quality for factors transiently interacting with the chromatin, including ER&#945; and AR. With improved protocols for tissue ChIP-seq data analyses, results generated in cell lines and tissue may be better compared, further facilitating translational research in hormone-dependent cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Cell culture and clinical specimens</title><p>The luminal breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and prostate cancer cell line LNCaP were cultured in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich).

During cryosectioning, alternating slices were collected for fixation by DSG+FA or FA only, respectively, to prevent differences in samples due to tissue heterogeneity.

For FA only, tissue sections were fixed in solution A containing 1% FA for 20 min at room temperature while rotating, followed by the addition of glycine for quenching. For DSG+FA, fixation was started by adding solution A containing 2 mM DSG to the tissue sections and rotating for 25 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of FA to 1% final concentration and another 20-min incubation at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding a surplus of glycine. Further sample processing was identical for DSG+FA and FA only samples.

Even though FA is classically used to cross-link protein/DNA complexes to enable immunoprecipitation of DNA regions of interest, other fixatives are available. Previously, a &#8220;two-step&#8221; double-cross-linking method was reported, in which sequentially protein&#8211;protein interactions were fixed using DSG, followed by a protein&#8211;DNA cross-linking (FA) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al, 2012</xref>). As this approach was reported to significantly increase ChIP efficiency, we applied this procedure to the most frequently used model systems in breast and prostate cancer research: MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, respectively. Proliferating cells were used in these analyses and fixed either using standard 1% FA or through a two-step fixation procedure with 45-min 2-mM DSG fixation, of which the last 10 min the cells are co-incubated with 1% FA (see the Materials and Methods section, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). Between fixation methods, no clear effect was seen on DNA fragment size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1A</xref>). For AR (in LNCaP) and ER&#945; (in MCF-7), clear peaks were observed proximal to their classic target genes in the corresponding cell lines: KLK3 for AR while IGFBP4 and XBP1 for ER&#945;. As expected, these peaks were shared with FOXA1 and histone modification H3K27ac, while this histone modification was also found at promoter regions along with H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). ChIP signal for ER&#945;, AR, and FOXA1 was substantially increased when cells were fixed using DSG, both on a single-locus scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>) and genome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B and C</xref>). These results were confirmed by ChIP-QPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2A and B</xref>), where clear enrichment over IgG-negative control was observed for all ChIP samples analysed. For all transcription factors, consistent higher enrichment was found in samples fixed with DSG and FA as compared to FA alone, while results for both histone modifications were more variable. In concordance with this, the Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP score) was clearly increased for ER&#945;, AR, and FOXA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). Importantly, the increased ChIP-seq signal was uniformly found on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3B</xref>). No clear bias in peak distribution is observed for specific genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>), even though an increased percentage of promoter-enriched peaks was found for both ER&#945; and AR, which is possibly related to the low number of peaks analysed for these subsets. The relative orientation to the most proximal canonical motif remained largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3A</xref>). For the studied histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in both cell lines, the vast majority of peaks were shared between the two fixation methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A&#8211;D</xref>). However, still regions were found selectively enriched for cells only fixed with FA versus those fixed with FA and DSG. Therefore, these findings were further confirmed using ChIP-QPCR. For some of the &#8220;DSG only&#8221; or &#8220;FA only&#8221; peaks, enrichment was found using this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig S4</xref>). These data suggest potential false-negative peaks with the currently applied peak calling algorithms, as we have reported previously (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Zwart et al, 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Overview of experimental design for cell lines <bold>(A)</bold> and human tumor tissue <bold>(B)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="LSA-2018-00115_Fig1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DSG increases TF ChIP-seq quality in cell line models.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Left: Genome browser snapshots of AR, FOXA1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac binding in LNCAP cells (left) with and without DSG treatment (FA: blue.

With a large quantity of breast tissue available, we expanded our analyses to H3K4me3, comparing both fixation methods. The results were in line with H3K27ac results in cell lines and tumors, i.e., no consistent significant differences were observed in terms of number of peaks detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig S9A</xref>), signal enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig S9B</xref>), distribution of the peaks relative to the most proximal gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig S9C</xref>), and signal distribution over all chromatin binding sites studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig S9E</xref>). However, in contrast to cell line data, for tumor samples a substantial number of histone modification peaks were preferentially identified in either FA or DSG fixed samples.

As a direct consequence, the vast majority of studies are based on a relatively low number of cell line models and it becomes increasingly relevant to study steroid hormone receptor genomics in the context of human tissue specimens.</p><p>Gaining access to human tumor tissue is typically challenging, and tissue availability for translational research is typically limited. The development of early detection-screening programs, involving mammography screening for breast cancer, resulted in the detection and removal of tumors that are often small. Furthermore, due to limited clinical benefit of surgery on metastatic disease, tissue availability at this stage of the disease is low. With this, there is a strong need in translational research to further improve protocols that enable transcription factor profiling in very low amounts of human tumor specimens.</p><p>Over the recent years, multiple technological advances have greatly increased the sensitivity of ChIP-seq analyses for small sample numbers. These include the addition of carriers which diminish background and improve chromatin immunoprecipitation efficiency (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zwart et al, 2013</xref>). Also, sequencing library preparation procedures have improved significantly by incorporating tagmentation for adaptor annealing (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Picelli et al, 2014</xref>). Improvements in sample barcoding in conjunction with microfluidics resulted in the development of ultra-sensitive protocols to enable single-cell ChIP-seq analyses on histone modifications (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rotem et al, 2015</xref>). Yet, since histones are an intrinsic part of the chromatin, proteins that dynamically interact with the DNA such as transcription factors are captured less easily.</p><p>Protein&#8211;DNA cross-linking in ChIP-seq experiments is typically performed using FA. However, proteins with rapid dynamics and transient chromatin interactions are inefficiently cross-linked, which directly affects ChIP efficiency (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Schmiedeberg et al, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, as FA is a short-range cross-linker, protein&#8211;protein interactions are not very well stabilized using this method. As the transcription factor complex is composed of a large number of proteins, both for ER&#945; (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">D'Santos et al, 2015</xref>) and for AR (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Paltoglou et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Stelloo et al, 2018</xref>), stabilizing the entire complex would potentially also stabilize DNA interactions thereof throughout the immunoprecipitation procedure.</p><p>We present an optimized protocol to enhance the transcription factor profiling in human tumor tissue and successfully performed ChIP-seq for ER&#945;, AR, and FOXA1 in primary breast, endometrium, and prostate cancer specimens. Importantly, incorporation of DSG as an additional cross-linker and a sole variable sufficed to provide high-quality ChIP-seq data for samples, which would hardly yield any peaks using the standard protocol. This update in the protocol not only greatly increased the success-rate of ChIP-seq experiments when using precious human samples, but also enabled the use of small 18G core needle biopsies for ChIP-seq analyses on multiple factors.</p><p>With this, we present an easily implementable modification of the standard ChIP-seq procedure to substantially increase both data quality and quantity when studying transcription factor chromatin interactions in hormone-dependent cancers, facilitating translational research of hormone receptor cistromics in human samples.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data are available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="geo" xlink:href="GSE114737">GSE114737</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e263" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="LSA-2018-00115_review_history.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the NKI Core Facility Molecular Pathology and Biobanking for technical support and providing tissue specimens.
