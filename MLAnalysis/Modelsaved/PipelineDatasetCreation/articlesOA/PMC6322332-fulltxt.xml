Here we investigated the temporal dynamics and diversity of the bacterial composition in the anterior nares in children attending daycare centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">For our investigation, we considered 76 parental-taken nasal swabs of 26 children (aged 13 to 36&#8201;months) collected over a study period of 3 months. Overall, there was no significant age-specific effect or seasonal shift in the nasal bacterial community structure. In a sub-sample of 14 healthy children the relative abundance of individual taxa as well as the overall diversity did not reveal relevant changes, indicating a stable community structure over the entire study period. Moreover, the nasal bacterial profiles clustered subject-specific with Bray-Curtis similarities being elevated in intra-subject calculations compared to between-subject calculations. The remaining subset of 12 children provided samples taken during picornavirus infection (PVI) and either before or after a PVI. We detected an association between the relative abundance of members of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and PV when comparing both (i) samples taken during PVI with samples out of 14 healthy children and (ii) samples taken during PVI with samples taken after PVI within the same individual. In addition, the diversity was higher during PVI than after infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our findings suggest that a personalized structure of the nasal bacterial community is established already in early childhood and could be detected over a timeframe of 3 months.

Since anterior nares are permanently exposed to the outside environment and represent an initial entry point of potential viral and bacterial pathogens, the role of the anterior nares&#8217; microbial community in disease development is of great interest, particularly in infancy when the burden of respiratory infections is highest. Two recent longitudinal studies have investigated the dynamics in bacterial composition of the healthy nostrils in early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], describing a high heterogeneity across individuals, and indicating age and season as most influencing factors for the microbial diversity. Distinct bacterial community structures in the anterior nares of children and adults were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accordingly, the anterior nares&#8217; microbiome seems to undergo dramatic changes with age. Still, further investigations are required to assess its development during infancy.</p><p id="Par14">Disturbance of the bacterial homeostasis, including that of the nares, might enhance the overgrowing of pathogens and lead to a higher susceptibility to diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Possible dysbioses of the nasal microbiome were investigated in children with pre-existing diseases, such as cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, an interaction of specific pathogens and the nasal microbial flora was studied, but predominately in cross-sectional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By now, only one study focused on the impact of respiratory infections on the global bacterial community structure in the anterior nares in healthy children during the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The aim of our study was to assess the temporal dynamics and diversity of the nasal bacterial community in children attending daycare centers and to study the effects of picornaviruses (PV), the most common viral respiratory pathogen identified in our samples during symptomatic infections, on the nasal community composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and collection of samples</title><p id="Par15">This analysis is a secondary data analysis of nasal swabs from a feasibility study for a birth cohort study focusing on infections, the microbiome, and the development of the immune system in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In brief, 75 families with children aged 13 to 36&#8201;months were recruited in daycare centers in Braunschweig, Germany, between November 2013 and March 2014. Parents were asked to answer a baseline questionnaire (covering information about e.g. sex and age), to keep a daily symptom diary on respiratory symptoms, and to take monthly nasal swabs (routine samples) on assigned days (independent from the occurrence of symptoms) over a period of 3 months (see Additional file 1 in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). Parents received the required equipment as well as detailed instructions for the use of Liquid Amies Elution anterior nasal swabs (ESwab, Copan, Italy). After sampling, the parents transferred the swab back into the tube, which was filled with 1&#8201;ml Amies medium. They were asked to store the samples in a 4&#8201;&#176;C fridge until mailing to the study center. The time between swab sampling and final storage at the study center was in median 2 days (interquartile range (IQR): 1 to 2&#8201;days). For the analysis of the bacterial community structure in healthy children, we included only children who displayed no symptoms of respiratory infection on any of the three swab collection days, roughly 1 month apart. Besides collecting routine samples, parents were also asked to take one nasal swab during a respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To assess the impact of viral infection on the bacterial composition, we selected picornaviruses, the most common viral pathogen associated with respiratory infections in our study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Samples and questionnaire data were collected after obtaining written informed consent from all guardians and parents as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>DNA preparation and amplicon sequencing</title><p id="Par16">After arrival of the samples at the study center, nasal swabs were vortexed for 20&#8201;s to allow further dissemination from the swab into the medium. The samples were aliquoted and stored at &#8722;&#8201;80&#8201;&#176;C until analysis. For investigating the bacterial community structure the swab was used for DNA extraction using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) based on the manufacturers&#8217; instruction. The hypervariable region V1/V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was subsequently amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;250 bp, Illumina, Hayward, California, USA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Bioinformatic analysis</title><p id="Par17">Bioinformatic processing was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Raw reads were merged with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) assembler. Overall, 2,351,406 reads were obtained with a mean of 30,939 (&#177; 13,453 standard deviation) reads per sample. Sequences were aligned within MOTHUR (gotoh algorithm using the SILVA reference database) and subjected to pre-clustering (diffs&#8201;=&#8201;2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) yielding phylotypes that were filtered for an average abundance of &#8805;0.001% and a sequence length&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;250&#8201;bp before analysis. All samples were re-sampled to equal the smallest read size of 12,761 reads using the phyloseq package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Phylotypes were assigned to a taxonomic affiliation based on the na&#239;ve Bayesian classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with a threshold of 80% followed by manual curation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Detection of viral pathogens</title><p id="Par18">The identification of viral pathogens was performed at the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony (NLGA) using 200&#8201;&#956;l of the sample. The samples were tested for six different viruses (adenovirus, metapneumovirus, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B virus) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given the small sample size and the low number of laboratory confirmed infections, we decided to focus only on the most frequently detected virus, which was picornavirus (PV) (including human rhino- and enteroviruses) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The detection of PV was performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the help of a Rhino- &amp; Enterovirus-Kit/Cc r-gene (BioM&#233;rieux/ARGENE) using a Light-Cycler (Roche).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par19">A dataset comprising the relative abundance of all phylotypes for each sample with aggregated levels for phylum and genera was created using PRIMER 6 software (v.6.1.6, PRIMER-E, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, UK). Genera with a mean relative abundance across all samples below 1% as well as unclassified bacteria were summarized as &#8220;Others&#8221;. Anterior nare community diversity was analyzed using total phylotype number, Simpson index (1-Lambda), Pielou&#8217;s evenness (J&#8217;) and Shannon diversity (H&#8242; loge) using PRIMER 6 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For the detection of differences in the relative abundance between infected and healthy children, samples from healthy children were randomly selected by generating a random number sorted in ascending order. For each child only one single sample was selected. Statistical testing was conducted applying Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney-U-Tests using Stata IC for Windows, version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The findings were subsequently corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (also known as the false discovery rate approach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">To assess similarity between microbial community profiles of each child the Bray-Curtis similarity algorithm (with square root transformation) on the phylotype level was used and visualized in non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). Significant differences between the predefined groups were analyzed using One-way Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) with 999 permutations with corresponding Global-R statistics. <italic>R</italic>-values indicate the degree of separation between groups; values closer to 1 indicate clear distinct groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For investigating variation within subjects, the index of multivariate dispersion (IMD) and similarity percentages (SIMPER) was calculated based on the Bray-Curtis similarity algorithm with square root transformation on phylotype level. Higher values of IMD indicate a higher heterogeneity of the bacterial profile over time. These investigations were performed with PRIMER v6 software.</p><p id="Par21">In order to assess whether the intra-individual distances in the healthy children were smaller than random distances, we used a permutation-based stochastic simulation with 10,000 runs via R (Version 3.2.). For this, samples of the healthy children were randomly exchanged (10,000 times) across all children and the mean of the mean Bray-Curtis similarities of these runs was calculated. These findings were compared with the actual Bray-Curtis similarity of the bacterial profiles in the samples of the healthy children.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population and effects of age and season on bacterial community structure</title><p id="Par22">We included 14 children (aged 19 to 33&#8201;months) in this study who displayed no symptoms of respiratory infection (&#8220;healthy children&#8221;) on any of the three swab collection days (42 swabs, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which were roughly 1 month apart (days between sampling: 28, IQR: 27 to 31). To assess the impact of viral infections on bacterial community structures, we selected 12 additional children (aged 13 to 34&#8201;months) with a positive PCR-result for PV and reported respiratory symptoms in the symptom diary (minimum symptoms were cough or a runny/blocked nose) (&#8220;infected children&#8221;).

Analyzing 76 nasal swabs of 26 children, we found no age-specific or seasonal clustering of the bacterial structure. Even though PVI did not lead to a global change of the bacterial composition, we found an association between PVI and the members of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and longitudinal effects on the alpha-diversity.</p><p id="Par31">In a previous study, it was reported that developmental age is a major factor affecting the dynamics of the nasal microbiome during the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since our study population consisted of children of different ages (13 to 36&#8201;months of age), we investigated whether the bacterial community structure was associated with age. However, we found no significant effects between the pre-defined age-groups (13 to 19, 20 to 29, and 30 to 36&#8201;months of age). One reason could be that the high inter-individual heterogeneity superimposed an actual age-specific relation. Furthermore, it is possible that in the investigated age-range of 13 to 36&#8201;months the bacterial structure did not significantly differ by age because it had already developed a stable individual signature at this age. In previous studies, distinct age-specific differences were detected comparing the nasal bacterial structure during childhood and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, we also investigated effects of season on the microbial composition and found no differences between samples taken in winter and spring. Previous studies described different bacterial profiles between summer and winter months in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and a shift in community profile of the anterior nares in adults between the months February and March [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The fact that we could not observe distinct seasonal bacterial profiles could be due to the comparatively mild winter in Lower Saxony in the recruitment year, with a small temperature difference between winter and spring (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S2).</p><p id="Par32">The relative abundance of phyla in the anterior nares of the 14 healthy children were in line with findings from a previous study among children from Gabon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To assess the temporal bacterial stability in healthy children we considered various approaches. The visualization of the bacterial profiles via nMDS depicted a high heterogeneity between children; however, based on IMD and SIMPER we found clustering on intra-individual level for a study period of 3 months for some children. This observation was confirmed by findings from the random permutation showing that on average there was some clustering effect within individuals. The observed variation of the temporal bacterial stability between the children has already been reported in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, we could show significantly higher Bray-Curtis similarity within-subjects than between-subjects, which is in line with findings of Mika et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our data suggests that a personalized structure of the nasal microbiome establishes already in early childhood, despite microorganisms inhabiting the anterior nares are permanently facing changing conditions of the external environment.</p><p id="Par33">To our knowledge, we are one of the first groups investigating the effect of a viral infection on the bacterial community of the anterior nostril. Within our study we did not observe a global effect of PVI on the bacterial community structure. However, the presence of PV was associated with a higher relative abundance of members of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. This observed association is in line with previous studies. In healthy children attending daycare, a positive association between <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> colonization density and viral load of PV in the nasopharynx was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, a positive association has previously been shown between <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and the abundance of human rhinovirus (HRV) in nasopharyngeal samples of 6 to 24&#8201;months old healthy children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. HRV belongs to PV and represents the most common cause for upper respiratory tract infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In children aged 4&#160;to 7 years with and without asthma, Kloepfer et al. detected a greater quantity of bacterial species, including <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, during an HRV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. HRV is known to affect the cell adhesion molecules and therefore the bacterial adherence in human nasal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In presence of HRV, fibronectin expression is increased which is associated with better adhesion of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The observed comparatively lower abundance of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> after PVI might be due to a decrease in fibronectin protein expression that leads to a reduction of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> adhesion. However, this hypothesis has to be further tested.</p><p id="Par34">Besides changes of the relative abundance, we also investigated effects on the bacterial diversity. We observed no significant difference in Shannon diversity between healthy and infected children. In a previous study on adults&#8217; nasopharynx microbiota a significantly lower alpha-diversity (Shannon diversity index) during HRV infection was found compared to not infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the study was based on ten subjects (seven infected and three non-infected adults), who have been sampled several times, making the study susceptible for potential outliers. Since for this investigation, we had a small sample size, potential effects of a PVI on the bacterial diversity could have been masked by high inter-individual variation. Additionally, we considered samples taken within the same individuals. We found a higher Shannon diversity after a PVI than during a PVI. This is in contrast to the findings of Korten et al., reporting a lower Shannon diversity of the nasal microbiome during symptomatic HRV infection compared to the diversity of samples taken 3 weeks after HRV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In our study, we were able to investigate the bacterial composition in a longitudinal manner considering both, bacterial composition and viral pathogens. Further, we compared the anterior bacterial community structure in healthy as well as in infected children. Nonetheless, there are various limitations in our study. The sample size for our investigation is relatively small, making our findings more susceptible to distortion by individual outliers. While it might have been of interest to use a broader approach in our analysis, we restricted ourselves to 16S rRNA based approach at genera level and performed PCR based identification of selected viral pathogens rather than realizing whole virome analysis. We investigated longitudinal effects of viral infections approximately 1 month after PVI. Over this period, short time changes of the nasal bacterial composition could have already been reversed to the pre-infection state. A more frequent and dense sampling (e.g. on daily or weekly base) after respiratory infections would allow a much more precise time-depended analysis but would require a different study design. Since our study was carried out during winter/spring season, we did not have data on the bacterial composition in summer/autumn, thus restricting the possibility of analyzing seasonal effects on the nasal microbiome. In addition, there might be different host and environmental factors affecting the individual bacterial profile, also during respiratory infections such as medication or co-infections. Especially regarding the long-term investigations on the individual nasal bacterial composition after respiratory infections, the use of drugs such as nasal spray or antibiotics is highly relevant. To better understand the effects of various environmental factors on the temporal dynamics and diversity of the nasal bacterial community additional longitudinal studies are needed with a higher number of study participants covering continuous data collection on these factors and information on respiratory symptoms, as planned for the prospective cohort study L&#246;wenKIDS (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02654210).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">Overall, our findings revealed no changes of the anterior nares bacterial profile of healthy children visiting daycare centers aged 13 to 36&#8201;months over a timeframe of 3 months. Although the stability within children varied, our data showed high subject-specific signatures suggesting a stable community structure within the study period. This adds evidence towards a personalized and stable bacterial composition in the anterior nares that is established already in early childhood. While PVI did not lead to overall changes of the bacterial ecosystem of the nostril, we detected an association between PVI and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> carriage. Whether certain parameters of bacterial communities such as temporal variability are related to viral infections has to be investigated within studies that follow infants over a longer time. This will allow disentangling the complex relationships between the nasal microbiota and susceptibility to infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
