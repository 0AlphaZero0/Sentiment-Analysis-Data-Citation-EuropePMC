Patients were enrolled by study site personnel at 99 centers in the United States.</p><p>At the screening visit (visit 1), patient eligibility was assessed, and patients were randomized (1:1:1) to a first dose of lasmiditan 200 mg, lasmiditan 100 mg, or placebo. Patients were also randomly allocated to a second dose of lasmiditan or placebo for rescue or recurrence of migraine (patients in the lasmiditan 200 mg group were randomized [2:1] to lasmiditan 200 mg or placebo as the second dose; patients in the lasmiditan 100 mg group were randomized [2:1] to lasmiditan 100 mg or placebo as the second dose; and all patients in the placebo group received placebo as the second dose). Patients were instructed not to treat an attack until their eligibility had been confirmed by phone (within 7 days) after completion of all screening evaluations, including laboratory tests.</p><p>Patients were randomized through a central randomization process by interactive response technology. Patients were stratified (yes or no) for use of concomitant migraine preventive medication. A randomization number and study drug card number were assigned to each patient. Study drugs (lasmiditan and matching placebo, manufactured by Aptuit, Verona, Italy) took the form of white, film-coated tablets with no markings provided in double-blinded treatment packs containing 2 doses.</p><p>Ineligible patients had their end-of-study visit (visit 2) within 7 days of phone contact to return the study drug.</p><p>Eligible patients entered an outpatient treatment period in which they were asked to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of onset, provided that the headache severity was either moderate or severe and not improving.

If the migraine responded within 2 hours (i.e., the headache became pain free) but then recurred after 2 hours, the second dose of study drug could be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose. The electronic diary was restarted if a patient took a second dose.</p><p>Patients who entered the treatment period had their end-of-study visit (visit 2) within 7 days of the treated attack or after 8 weeks if no attack was treated.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>At the time of migraine attack, before dosing, patients used the electronic diary to record the date and time of migraine onset and the level of headache pain and indicated the presence or absence of associated symptoms of migraine (nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia). Headache pain was rated by patients using the International Headache Society 4-point headache severity rating scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> From the list of associated symptoms, patients selected the one they considered to be the MBS. Patients also recorded the date and time of taking the first dose of study drug. Baseline was defined as the last available measurement before the first dose.</p><p>With regard to efficacy, the electronic diary collected the following data at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 hours after dose: the current level of headache pain, the presence or absence of associated symptoms of migraine (nausea, phonophobia, photophobia), the presence or absence of vomiting, and the level of disability. Patient-reported level of disability (degree of interference with normal activities) was rated with a 4-point scale: not at all (0); mild interference (1); marked interference (2); and completely, needs bed rest (3). In addition, at 2 hours after dose, patients recorded their global impression of change using a 7-point scale: very much better, much better, a little better, no change, a little worse, much worse, or very much worse.</p><p>With regard to safety and tolerability, the electronic diary asked patients if they felt &#8220;anything unusual&#8221; since taking the study medication that they had not felt with a migraine before; if yes, they received a follow-up phone call from the site. At the end-of-study visit, safety was assessed by adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an event that started or worsened after the first dose of study medication (i.e., it did not present with the migraine) and occurred within 48 hours of the last dose.</p><p>The electronic diary also documented the use of rescue/recurrence medication and any other concomitant medication that had not been recorded at the screening visit.</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The sample size was determined on the basis of the proportion of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours in a phase 2B study (18.8% for lasmiditan 200 mg, 13.6% for lasmiditan 100 mg, and 7.4% for placebo).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> With a 1-sided, 2-sample comparison at the 2.5% level of significance, a sample size of 570 patients per treatment group (as defined by the first dose) provided &gt;90% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours for lasmiditan 200 mg and lasmiditan 100 mg.</p><p>The safety population was defined as all randomized patients who used at least 1 dose of study drug, regardless of whether they underwent any study assessments. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all patients in the safety population who recorded any postdose headache severity or symptom assessments in the electronic diary, and the mITT population was defined as all patients in the ITT population who treated a migraine attack within 4 hours of onset.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo of the proportion of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours after the first dose of study medication (in the mITT population). Endpoints were analyzed in a sequential gatekeeping procedure to prevent Type I error inflation. As such, the 100 mg endpoints were considered secondary to 200 mg endpoints. Headache pain free was defined as a reduction in headache severity from mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) at baseline to none (0). If a second dose was taken within 2 hours, the patient was considered to be a nonresponder to the first dose.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy endpoints were (1) a comparison between lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo of the proportion of patients who were MBS free at 2 hours after the first dose of study medication (MBS free was defined as a change from &#8220;yes&#8221; to &#8220;no&#8221; for the presence of the patient's baseline MBS [nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia]); (2) a comparison between lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo of the proportion of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours after the first dose; and (3) a comparison between lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo of the proportion of patients who were MBS free at 2 hours after the first dose (all in the mITT population). For the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses, patients with missing data were assumed to be nonresponders.</p><p>Other secondary efficacy endpoints included comparisons between lasmiditan 200 mg/100 mg and placebo of the proportion of patients who were headache pain free and MBS free at other time points (in the mITT population); the proportion of patients with sustained pain freedom (defined as being headache pain free at 2 hours after the first dose and at the indicated assessment time, having not used any medications after the first dose) (mITT population); the proportion of patients with headache pain relief (defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate [2] or severe [3] at baseline to mild [1] or none [0] or a reduction in headache severity from mild [1] at baseline, to none [0]); the proportion of patients who were free of migraine symptoms (vomiting, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia); patient global impression of change; level of disability; and the proportion of patients who used a second dose of study drug for rescue or recurrence (all in the ITT population).</p><p>All primary and secondary efficacy analyses were made with a logistic regression model (Wald &#967;<sup>2</sup> test), with treatment group and background use of migraine preventive medication as covariates. For treatment comparisons, an estimate of the odds ratio of achieving a response, as well as the corresponding confidence interval and <italic>p</italic> value with the Wald test, was computed. Exceptions to this were global impression of change and level of disability, which used a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test controlling for background use of migraine preventive medication. The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025. A testing hierarchy was used to prevent type I error inflation for multiple comparisons: the primary efficacy endpoint was tested first, and if it was statistically significant, the key secondary efficacy endpoints were tested sequentially. Continuous variables were summarized with descriptive statistics; categorical variables were summarized with counts and percentages. Other secondary efficacy endpoints were tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, and the data are available here (identifier NCT02439320).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 2,231 patients were randomized, of whom 1,856 (83.2%) used the first dose of study drug and were included in the safety population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).

A post hoc analysis of the incidence of TEAEs in patients with &#8805;2 cardiovascular risk factors at baseline is shown in table e-2 (available from Dryad, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s3p3m0d">doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s3p3m0d</ext-link>); a similar pattern of TEAEs was observed in the full population.</p><p>There were no clinically meaningful differences in hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, physical examination, or ECGs across treatment groups or with regard to changes from baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this first phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraines, statistically significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (200 and 100 mg) experienced freedom from headache pain and MBS at 2 hours than patients who took placebo. These primary/key secondary outcomes were approved by the US FDA in a Special Protocol Assessment before the release of its draft guidance for studies of the acute treatment of migraines.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Previously, migraine drugs needed to demonstrate statistically significant benefits for pain and all 3 associated symptoms (nausea, phonophobia and photophobia) to be granted approval by the FDA,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> despite a high proportion of patients not having nausea at baseline. The present study reports MBS as a major endpoint, an approach that reduces multiple comparisons and may improve statistical power to detect treatment effects. Individual associated symptoms were assessed as secondary endpoints and showed benefits for lasmiditan on phonophobia and photophobia but not nausea. Photophobia was the most commonly reported MBS at baseline, reported by more than half of patients, whereas nausea was the MBS for only around a quarter of patients. The use of patient-centric endpoints such as the MBS in clinical trials is important to allow meaningful benefits to the patient to be measured.</p><p>The outcomes were measured with real-time data captured by electronic diaries. The diaries did not allow retrospective data entry (each time point became available on the basis of the patient-recorded time of dosing and was available for &#177;5 minutes), offering an advantage over paper diaries. Of note, the placebo response rate for freedom from headache pain at 2 hours after dosing was higher in this study (15.3%) than in studies of oral triptans (generally &lt;10%),<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which may be partly attributed to increased patient contact by the site (investigators were asked to call patients who did not feel well, who reported unusual symptoms, and who were not compliant).</p><p>Secondary analyses were supportive of the efficacy of lasmiditan. Rates of sustained pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours showed benefits for lasmiditan over placebo, but differences were smaller than expected, perhaps because of poor diary adherence at 24 hours. Patients who received lasmiditan as a first dose were less likely to take a second dose of study drug for rescue or recurrence than patients who received placebo as a first dose (31.9% of the lasmiditan 200 mg group, 39.0% of the lasmiditan 100 mg group, and 59.9% of the placebo group compared with 20%&#8211;34% in studies of oral triptans<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>).</p><p>Treatment with lasmiditan was generally well tolerated and safe. Adverse events were captured with the real-time electronic diaries: if the patients felt anything unusual since taking the study medication that they had not felt with a migraine before, this was recorded, and they were contacted by an investigator within 24 hours for further discussion. Adverse events were also discussed at the end-of-study visit. The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the lasmiditan 200 and 100 mg groups compared with the placebo group; however, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Activity limitations did not differ within treatment groups among those with treatment-emergent dizziness and those who did not have treatment-emergent dizziness. These data will be reported in detail separately. There were no deaths during the treatment period; no serious TEAEs related to study drug were reported; and no TEAEs resulted in discontinuation of the study among those patients who had used study drug. Most TEAEs were nervous system related, and the incidence of cardiovascular TEAEs with lasmiditan was low. Overall, the safety profile of lasmiditan was consistent with the phase 2 studies.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and many stable forms of cardiovascular disease were eligible to participate in this clinical study, and the majority of patients (77.9%) had at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor at baseline.
