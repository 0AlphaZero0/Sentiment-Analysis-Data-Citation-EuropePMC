metabolizing neutral and polar <sc>d-</sc>amino acids. Unlike <sc>l</sc>-amino acids, the amounts of <sc>d-</sc>amino acids in mammalian tissues are extremely low, and therefore, little has been investigated regarding the physiological role of DAO. We have recently identified <italic>DAO</italic> to be up-regulated in cellular senescence, a permanent cell cycle arrest induced by various stresses, such as persistent DNA damage and oxidative stress. Because DAO produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts of substrate oxidation and the accumulation of ROS mediates the senescence induction, we explored the relationship between DAO and senescence. We found that inhibition of DAO impaired senescence induced by DNA damage, and ectopic expression of wild-type DAO, but not enzymatically inactive mutant, enhanced it in an ROS-dependent manner. Furthermore, addition of <sc>d-</sc>amino acids and riboflavin, a metabolic precursor of FAD, to the medium potentiated the senescence-promoting effect of DAO. These results indicate that DAO promotes senescence through the enzymatic ROS generation, and its activity is regulated by the availability of its substrate and coenzyme.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">25640063</award-id><award-id rid="sp1">17K15595</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><sc>d-</sc>amino acid oxidase (DAO) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)&#8211;dependent peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of neutral and polar <sc>d-</sc>amino acids with a strict stereospecificity to give &#945;-keto acids, ammonia, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pollegioni et al, 2007</xref>). <sc>d-</sc>amino acids are usually present only in very low amounts in higher organisms, including human beings, but are increasingly recognized as physiologically functional regulators involved in several biological processes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ohide et al, 2011</xref>). For example, <sc>d-</sc>serine acts as an agonist of NMDA receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels mediating excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, and hence, alteration of <sc>d-</sc>serine metabolism is relevant for neurological diseases, such as schizophrenia, ischemia, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schell et al, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Katsuki et al, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Billard, 2012</xref>). Because DAO controls the <sc>d-</sc>serine concentration in the brain, the relationships between DAO and these neurological diseases have been extensively investigated (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Maekawa et al, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Madeira et al, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Verrall et al, 2010</xref>). However, despite the broad expression pattern of DAO in human tissues such as the kidney and liver, much less is known about its function other than in the nervous system.</p><p>Cellular senescence is defined as a persistent form of cell cycle arrest induced by various genotoxic stresses, such as DNA-damaging agents, ROS, and activation of oncogenes, and is implicated in both tumor inhibition and age-related disorders presumably through the secretion of a variety of inflammatory factors, referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">d'Adda di Fagagna, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Yanai &amp; Fraifeld, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kuilman et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Salama et al, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lu &amp; Finkel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Serrano et al, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen &amp; Ames, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Di Leonardo et al, 1994</xref>). In response to genotoxic stresses, the DNA damage response pathway activates the tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor whose activity is required for the initiation and maintenance of senescence (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Vousden &amp; Prives, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rufini et al, 2013</xref>). The activated p53 induces a large number of genes involved in senescence, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>proline dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>PRODH</italic>) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">el-Deiry et al, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Romanov et al, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although p21 has been considered as a central mediator of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, the full set of p53 target genes needed for senescence remains to be elucidated (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Noda et al, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Romanov et al, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Valente et al, 2013</xref>). Besides the activation of p53, ROS also critically contribute to senescence (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lu &amp; Finkel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Salama et al, 2014</xref>). The accumulation of ROS is widely observed in senescence induced by various types of stress. ROS can hasten senescence through induction of oxidative DNA damage, and a recent study has shown that a positive feedback loop between ROS production and DNA damage response establishes senescence with the contribution of p21 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Passos et al, 2010</xref>). Although ROS are reported to mediate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kulawiec et al, 2009</xref>), the mechanism by which p53 regulates ROS production in the process of senescence induction remains mostly unclear. We have recently identified <italic>DAO</italic> to be up-regulated specifically in senescent cells and shown the direct transcriptional regulation of <italic>DAO</italic> by p53 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>). Although we have revealed that ectopic expression of DAO inhibited proliferation of normal and tumor cells, it is still unknown whether and how DAO functionally contributes to the senescence process.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the functional association of DAO with the senescence process. We revealed that DAO accelerates senescence via enzymatic generation of ROS and that <sc>d-</sc>arginine, a substrate for DAO, is abundantly present in cultured cancer cells. DAO is activated in response to DNA damage presumably due to an increase in availability of its coenzyme, FAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>DAO promotes DNA damage&#8211; and oncogene-induced senescence through its enzymatic activity</title><p>To investigate whether DAO contributes to the senescence program, we evaluated the effect of <italic>DAO</italic> knockdown on DNA damage&#8211;induced senescence using two human tumor cell lines expressing the wild-type p53, osteosarcoma U2OS cells, and hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). U2OS and HepG2 cells transfected with two different siRNAs for <italic>DAO</italic> (DAO-1 and DAO-2) were treated with etoposide, an anticancer drug that induces DNA double-strand breaks (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wozniak &amp; Ross, 1983</xref>), and the efficacy of <italic>DAO</italic> knockdown was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). Because we could not reproducibly detect the DAO protein by immunoblot analysis in U2OS cells possibly because of its low expression level, we validated <italic>DAO</italic> knockdown by qPCR. In both cell lines, the DAO expression level was up-regulated in response to a sublethal dose of etoposide (2 &#956;M and 10 &#956;M, respectively) as observed previously (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>), which was effectively abolished by the treatment with siRNAs. Next, the extent of etoposide-induced senescence in the <italic>DAO</italic>-depleted cells was measured by two widely used senescence markers, senescence-associated &#946;-galactosidase (SA-&#946;-gal) staining (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dimri et al, 1995</xref>) and loss of proliferative capacity determined by colony-formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C&#8211;E</xref>). We observed that the percentage of SA-&#946;-gal&#8211;positive cells was increased after the treatment with etoposide both in U2OS and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C and D</xref>), which is consistent with previous observations by us and others (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">te Poele et al, 2002</xref>). More importantly, siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>DAO</italic> impaired the etoposide-induced SA-&#946;-gal activation in both cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of DAO partially restored etoposide-induced loss of proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E</xref>). Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed that etoposide-induced up-regulation of p21, a critical mediator of senescence, was also impaired by <italic>DAO</italic> knockdown, although siRNAs of DAO-1 and DAO-2 may cause weak cellular stress because the p21 levels were slightly increased even in the absence of etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1F</xref>), raising the possibility that DAO plays a role in inducing senescence. To confirm this, we next tested the impact of inhibiting DAO activity on senescence using 6-chlorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol (CBIO), previously characterized for the ability to inhibit enzymatic activity of DAO (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ferraris et al, 2008</xref>). CBIO suppressed the SA-&#946;-gal activation and loss of proliferative capacity following etoposide treatment in both U2OS and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A&#8211;D</xref>). In accordance, immunoblot analysis revealed that etoposide-induced up-regulation of the p53 phosphorylation level at Ser15, which is crucial for p53 stabilization, and of the p53 and p21 protein levels were impaired by the CBIO treatment in U2OS and HepG2 cells, confirming the DAO role in senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E and F</xref>). To further explore these findings, we examined the CBIO effect on etoposide-induced senescence in normal human fibroblast Hs68 cells. CBIO was also effective in suppressing senescence of Hs68 cells, as judged by SA-&#946;-gal, EdU incorporation proliferation assays, and immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G&#8211;I</xref>), which suggests that the DAO role in senescence is common in both tumor and normal cells. In addition, oncogenic Ras&#8211;induced senescence of normal human fibroblast WI-38 cells was also impaired by the treatment with CBIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2J&#8211;L</xref>), all implying the general role of DAO in the regulation of senescence.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of <italic>DAO</italic> inhibits DNA damage&#8211;induced senescence.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> U2OS cells transfected with siRNAs for <italic>DAO</italic> (DAO-1 and DAO-2) were treated with 2 &#956;M etoposide for 7 d, and the expression levels of <italic>DAO</italic> were determined by qPCR. <bold>(B)</bold> HepG2 cells transfected with siRNAs for <italic>DAO</italic> (DAO-1 and DAO-2) were treated with 10 &#956;M etoposide for 48 h, and the expression levels of DAO were determined by immunoblot analysis. <bold>(C, D)</bold> U2OS (C) and HepG2 (D) cells depleted of <italic>DAO</italic> were treated with 2 and 10 &#956;M etoposide for 7 d and 48 h, respectively, and subjected to SA-&#946;-gal staining.

We also observed that the addition of <sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine by itself did not affect senescence induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C and D</xref>; compare bars 5 and 9 with bar 1). Furthermore, the treatment with <sc>l</sc>-arginine and <sc>l</sc>-serine did not enhance the senescence promotion by DAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C and D</xref>; compare bars 13 and 14 with bar 4), indicating the specific effect of <sc>d-</sc>forms of arginine and serine. These results suggest that <sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine can mediate the senescence-promoting effect of DAO. We further noted here that the dual treatment of the <sc>d-</sc>amino acids and etoposide fully induced senescence to the level of the triple treatment with <sc>d-</sc>amino acids, etoposide, and DAO overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C and D</xref>; compare bar 6 with bar 8, and bar 10 with bar 12), whereas the combined treatment with <sc>d-</sc>amino acids and DAO overexpression hardly induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C and D</xref>; bars 7 and 11). These results suggest that the high DAO expression and the substrate <sc>d-</sc>amino acids are not enough to induce senescence and that there is another regulatory factor that activates DAO in response to DNA damage.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine enhances the senescence-promoting effect of DAO.</title><p><bold>(A, B)</bold> U2OS cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA containing wt-<italic>DAO</italic>, selected with 800 &#956;g/ml G418, and treated with each of seven <sc>d-</sc>amino acids at 5 mM (except for <sc>d-</sc>tyrosine which was used at 2.5 mM) in the presence of 2 &#956;M etoposide as indicated.

More importantly, knockdown of <italic>DAO</italic> partially suppressed the etoposide-induced ROS accumulation with a statistical significance, although the effects were modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when DAO was inhibited by CBIO in U2OS and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B and C</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of DAO strongly potentiated the etoposide-induced increase in ROS levels, yet DAO overexpression alone resulted in only a slight elevation of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that DAO overexpression alone was insufficient to induce senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with N-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (NAC), a potent ROS scavenger, suppressed senescence induced by DAO overexpression to a similar extent in the cells transfected with empty vector, suggesting that the promotion of senescence by DAO is completely dependent on enzymatic ROS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E&#8211;G</xref>). Consistent with this, combined treatment with NAC and CBIO had no synergistic effect on senescence repression when compared with the single treatment with NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6H&#8211;J</xref>).

Besides the brain, DAO is highly expressed in the kidney and liver in mammals, but much less attention has been devoted to investigating the DAO roles in other tissues and systems. In particular, the relationship between DAO and senescence is yet to be described. We have recently reported that the <italic>DAO</italic> gene is transcriptionally activated by p53 in response to senescence-inducing stimuli, but our previous study did not fully explore the direct relationship between DAO and senescence (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>). In the present study, we found that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DAO abrogated DNA damage&#8211;induced senescence, whereas ectopic expression of DAO promoted it. Furthermore, DAO overexpression increased intracellular ROS levels, and the senescence-promoting effect of DAO was abolished by treatment with NAC, an ROS scavenger, indicating that acceleration of senescence by DAO is dependent on ROS production.</p><p>ROS are recognized as critical initiators of senescence, and their accumulation is widely observed in senescent cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lu &amp; Finkel, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kuilman et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Salama et al, 2014</xref>). It has been reported that several ROS-producing enzymes, such as PRODH and NADPH oxidases, act to promote senescence (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Geiszt et al, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jun &amp; Lau, 2010</xref>). In line with these findings, we observed that inhibition of DAO alone partially (i.e., not fully) suppressed etoposide-induced ROS accumulation and senescence and that combined treatment with CBIO and THFA, a potent inhibitor of PRODH, had an additive effect on senescence suppression. These results suggest that ROS produced by DAO alone are insufficient to initiate the senescence program and that DAO works cooperatively with other ROS-producing enzyme(s) to increase the intracellular ROS level beyond a threshold triggering senescence. In addition, because the etoposide-induced up-regulation of p53 and p21 protein levels was impaired by the CBIO treatment in U2OS and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E and F</xref>), we would like to claim the formation of a positive feedback loop, in which DNA damage activates p53, which in turn transactivates DAO-producing ROS, finally leading to further activation of p53 through oxidative stress and enhancement of senescence. Moreover, we should emphasize here that only DAO overexpression did not induce senescence, but when combined with etoposide, it promoted etoposide-induced senescence, implying the DNA damage&#8211;induced mechanism of DAO activation. Given that the <sc>d-</sc>amino acid levels are unchanged during senescence (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it is likely that DAO activity in itself is potentiated by DNA damage.</p><p>In striking contrast to DAO, it has been shown that overexpression of PRODH, another flavin-dependent oxidase, by itself induces senescence through enzymatic ROS production (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2017</xref>). What causes this difference between DAO and PRODH? One possible explanation is the difference in subcellular localization. Whereas DAO is localized in peroxisome (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pollegioni et al, 2007</xref>), PRODH is localized in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Phang et al, 2008</xref>). It has been revealed by a subcellular fractionation study that FAD is abundantly present in mitochondria and cytoplasm but less in peroxisome (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Leighton et al, 1982</xref>), which raises the possibility that the DAO activity in the absence of etoposide is limited because of the low FAD concentration in peroxisome. FAD is a redox cofactor of a large number of oxidases, dehydrogenases, and reductases (termed &#8220;flavoenzymes&#8221;) that are compartmentalized in appropriate cellular organelles (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rivlin, 1970</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Depeint et al, 2006</xref>), and DAO is a peroxisome-localized one (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pollegioni et al, 2007</xref>). In cells, FAD is enzymatically produced from its precursor, riboflavin, through FAD synthase that catalyzes the FAD biosynthesis in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, but proteins responsible for FAD synthesis in peroxisome have not been described to date (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Torchetti et al, 2010</xref>). This compartment-specific biosynthesis seems to reflect the intracellular demand of FAD. For example, FAD is essential for &#946;-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Depeint et al, 2006</xref>), whereas peroxisomal fatty acid &#946;-oxidation requires oxygen, but not FAD, as an electron acceptor to form hydrogen peroxide. Considering this intracellular demand and supply mechanism, the FAD concentration in peroxisome appears to be relatively low compared with other subcellular compartments. In fact, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Leighton et al (1982)</xref> have shown that the peroxisomal FAD level is about 8 and 13 times less than that in mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively, in rat liver (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Leighton et al, 1982</xref>), which leads us to speculate that the DAO activity is regulated by peroxisomal FAD level. Consistently, we found that when combined with riboflavin treatment, overexpression of DAO induced senescence. These results suggest that DAO could not fully exert its enzymatic activity owing to the low level of peroxisomal FAD in the absence of DNA damage, but upon DNA damage, peroxisomal FAD level is elevated to the extent that DAO can become activated and promote senescence. In support of this model, we have previously found a plasma membrane riboflavin transporter, RFVT1 (also known as GPR172B or SLC52A1), to be up-regulated in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in the present study, we observed that the intracellular FAD level was increased upon DNA damage in an RFVT1-dependent manner. However, it is still an open question how DAO activity is regulated upon DNA damage, because we have not compared the peroxisomal FAD levels between normal and DNA-damaged cells yet. Further studies are needed to determine whether the DAO activity is controlled by peroxisomal FAD level or not.</p><p>Consistent with the DAO role in ROS production, antitumor therapies with the introduction of DAO have been reported (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">El Sayed et al, 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). El Sayed et al have demonstrated that stable expression of DAO enhances the anticancer effect of 3-bromopyruvate, a hexokinase II inhibitor that interferes with glycolysis, through induction of oxidative stress. Because senescence can be a potent tumor suppressive mechanism, the novel relationship between DAO and senescence provides new insights into the DAO role as a tumor suppressor, that is, DAO can inhibit tumor formation not merely through the promotion of oxidative stress but through the induction of senescence, which may hopefully facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies and applications for cancer.</p><p>As mentioned previously, <sc>d-</sc>amino acids are considered to be much less abundant than <sc>l</sc>-amino acids in mammals. Surprisingly, however, we found that <sc>d-</sc>arginine was abundantly present in HepG2 cells, whose level was comparable with that of <sc>l</sc>-arginine. <sc>d-</sc>arginine has been reported to be present in the brain and to act as a protector of the central nervous system against neurotoxicity induced by high levels of glucocorticoids (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Canteros, 2014</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no studies have described the presence of <sc>d-</sc>arginine in cultured cells, and hence, its biological role is presently uncertain. In the present study, we showed that the addition of <sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine facilitated the DAO effect on senescence promotion, suggesting their possible role as the substrates of DAO in DNA damage&#8211;induced senescence. Although further analysis is needed to determine whether <sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine mediate the effect of DAO on senescence in vitro and in vivo, our results may shed new light on the role of these <sc>d-</sc>amino acids. At the same time, we do not exclude the possibility that DAO metabolizes <sc>d-</sc>amino acids other than those tested in our present study because DAO can oxidize a wide range of <sc>d-</sc>amino acids including <sc>d-</sc>norleucine and <sc>d-</sc>ornithine (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">D&#8217;Aniello et al, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Molla et al, 2006</xref>). Actually, so far, we have been unable to detect <sc>d-</sc>arginine and <sc>d-</sc>serine at quantifiable levels in normally proliferating U2OS cells, suggesting that the <sc>d-</sc>amino acid(s) required for DAO-mediated senescence promotion varies depending on the cell type and/or on the senescence stage.
