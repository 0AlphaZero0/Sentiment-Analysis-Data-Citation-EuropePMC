The secretory Ca-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster at 4q13 encodes structurally related phosphoproteins of which some are specifically expressed at high levels in the salivary glands and constitute major components of saliva.

We show that NR4A3 is specifically upregulated in AciCCs, and that active chromatin regions and gene expression signatures in AciCCs are highly correlated with the NR4A3 transcription factor binding motif. Overexpression of NR4A3 in mouse salivary gland cells increases expression of known NR4A3 target genes and has a stimulatory functional effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that NR4A3 is upregulated through enhancer hijacking and has important oncogenic functions in AciCC.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) is a rare salivary gland carcinoma that is poorly understood.

These genes evolved from a common ancestor gene by tandem duplication events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The encoded salivary proteins, milk caseins and enamel matrix proteins are functionally related through their ability to regulate the calcium phosphate levels in the extracellular environment. The function of the salivary proteins includes protection of tooth enamel by stabilizing saliva supersaturated with calcium salts, as well as antimicrobial and antifungal properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

While no recurrent molecular genetic event in AciCC has been reported yet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, several other salivary gland neoplasms are characterized by specific recurrent genomic rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These typically result in the generation of oncogenic chimeric fusion genes, e.g., the <italic>NFIB</italic>-<italic>MYB</italic> gene fusion in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Only recently, an alternate mechanism of oncogenic upregulation of the same transcription factor MYB through genomic rearrangements involving the translocation of enhancer regions has been demonstrated in ACC lacking the <italic>NFIB</italic>-<italic>MYB</italic> gene fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, &#8220;regulatory rearrangements&#8221; driving oncogene overexpression through enhancer hijacking or insulator dysfunction are increasingly recognized in other cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">For the current study, we employ comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling of AciCCs and normal parotid gland tissue to decipher the molecular genetic events in AciCC. We show that AciCCs harbor recurrent and specific rearrangements [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] that bring active enhancer regions from the SCPP gene cluster in close proximity to the transcription start site (TSS) of transcription factor <italic>Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 3 (NR4A3)</italic> at 9q31. The genomic breakpoints within the SCPP gene cluster correlate with high H3K27ac active chromatin marks that are present in both normal parotid gland and AciCC tumor tissues, and we demonstrate significant enhancer activity within the breakpoint region in a functional analysis. We show that NR4A3 is specifically and consistently upregulated in AciCCs. There is an increase in active chromatin marks and upregulation of gene expression in AciCC tumor tissues compared to normal parotid gland that is significantly correlated with the NR4A3 transcription factor binding motif. Functional analyses of mouse salivary gland and human mammary gland cells with NR4A3 overexpression show significant effects on gene expression including known NR4A3 target genes, as well as stimulatory effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle. We conclude that the genomic rearrangements [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] are the initiating tumorigenic events in AciCCs and that these rearrangements enable upregulation of NR4A3 through inappropriate influence of active chromatin regions derived from the SCPP gene cluster. We suggest that NR4A3 upregulation is an early oncogenic event in AciCCs through constitutive stimulation of cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of recurrent rearrangements [t(4;9)(q13;q31)]</title><p id="Par6">Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of four paired tumor/normal AciCC cases and tumor WGS in two additional AciCCs revealed that copy number changes were few and broadly distributed among the tumor genomes without recurrent gains or losses present in all cases (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The tumors carried very few somatic non-synonymous variants in the exonic fraction (SNVs: mean 14, range 7&#8211;17; InDels mean: 3, range 2&#8211;7), and no gene was mutated in more than one tumor (Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In contrast, a specific inter-chromosomal rearrangement [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] was present in all six AciCCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The 4q13 breakpoints were distributed within ~&#8201;340&#8201;kb at the SCPP gene cluster spanning eight genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, upper panel left side). All of the 9q31 breakpoints were located upstream of <italic>NR4A3</italic>, with four events located within a ~&#8201;600&#8201;bp region directly upstream of the TSS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, upper panel right side).

We employed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using antibodies against core histone modifications H3K27ac (active promoter/enhancer), H3K4me3 (active promoter), H3K27me3 (repressed chromatin), and against the transcription factors NR4A3 and CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), as well as whole genome bisulfite sequencing (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), to decipher epigenetic regulatory marks around the breakpoint regions. This data were complemented with published data on topologically associated domains (TADs) and chromatin contacts (HiC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We observed enrichment of active H3K27ac and H3K4me3 chromatin marks and low DNA methylation levels broadly distributed throughout the 4q13 SCPP gene cluster in normal parotid gland tissue, consistent with abundant expression of the SCPP salivary gland genes mapping there (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> left panel). Comparison with published chromatin contact data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> indicated three sub-TAD domains within a larger TAD, encompassing the majority of the highly expressed salivary gland genes (e.g., <italic>STATH</italic>, <italic>HTN3</italic>, <italic>HTN1</italic>) within a single sub-TAD region characterized by abundant active chromatin marks, with inversely orientated CTCF binding sites correlating well with the borders of the sub-TAD regions. In contrast, there were both active H3K27ac/H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 chromatin marks at the 9q31 locus upstream of the <italic>NR4A3</italic> TSS and very-low DNA methylation levels at the promoter region in the normal parotid tissue, indicating a bivalent/poised promoter (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> right panel).

Adding the additional nine AciCCs with rearrangement [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] identified by the hybrid capture assay, three distinct patterns of rearrangements could be established (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In four AciCCs (AciCC5, AciCC4, AciCC3, AciCC19), the 4q13 breakpoint was located in a small genomic region that fell between two inversely oriented CTCF binding sites that were characterized by active H3K27ac peaks and correlated with the border between two sub-TAD regions as indicated by published chromatin contact data (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In all four samples the breakpoints were orientated in the same direction, e.g., the 4q13 reverse strand was fused to the 9q31 forward strand, so that in all four cases the resulting rearranged sequence included the genomic region of the SCPP gene cluster. The second and most frequent pattern was present in ten AciCCs, which all harbored the 4q13 breakpoint within a genomic region encompassing the three most abundantly expressed salivary gland genes <italic>STATH</italic>, <italic>HTN3</italic>, and <italic>HTN1</italic> with correlating highly active chromatin marks (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast to the tumors with the first pattern, both orientations of rearrangements of the 4q13 genomic region were observed in this group, with three tumors having the 4q13 forward strand fused to the <italic>NR4A3</italic> upstream region, and seven the 4q13 reverse strand. The third pattern was identified in only one sample (AciCC2) where the 4q13 breakpoint fell directly within the first intron of the salivary gland gene <italic>FDCSP</italic>, but no chimeric fusion reads between FDCSP and NR4A3 were detected on the RNA level. Further exploiting the ChIP-seq data, we next modeled the potential interaction of active H3K27ac and H3K4me3 chromatin marks from the 4q13 SCPP gene cluster and the <italic>NR4A3</italic> gene locus as a result of the genomic rearrangements for three individual tumor samples AciCC3, AciCC1 and AciCC2, representing the three different breakpoint patterns, respectively, (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In AciCC3 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) representing the second most common group with breakpoints between two CTCF binding sites, active chromatin marks from the SCPP gene cluster were situated directly at the breakpoint as well as ~&#8201;90&#8201;kb, ~&#8201;130&#8201;kb and ~&#8201;290&#8201;kb upstream of the breakpoint, with the latter three peaks ranking among the highest 5% of peaks and thus fulfilling the criteria of super-enhancers (Supplemental Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>).

In AciCC2 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) representing its own pattern with the breakpoint directly within the <italic>FDCSP</italic> gene, active chromatin marks from the <italic>FDCSP</italic> promoter region were directly located at the breakpoint region, as well as more distal at ~&#8201;28&#8201;kb, ~&#8201;174&#8201;kb, and ~&#8201;228&#8201;kb upstream of the breakpoint.

Second, to test for potential functional consequences of NR4A3 expression in the mouse salivary gland cells, cell viability and proliferation were evaluated.

Immortalized mouse salivary gland cells stably transduced with human NR4A3 revealed higher mRNA expression and protein levels of mouse Ccnd1 and Eno3 compared to controls, thus confirming a transcriptional effect of NR4A3 upregulation on its known target genes in this cell model.

This, however, did not result in a chimeric fusion transcript. Instead, we suggest that the highly active chromatin marks we have observed at the SCPP salivary gland gene cluster enable upregulation of NR4A3 through inappropriate regulation of the <italic>NR4A3</italic> gene. Indeed, the comparison of 15 AciCCs with the [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] aberration revealed a relatively broad distribution of the 4q13 breakpoints among the SCPP salivary gland gene cluster and no minimal overlapping genomic region was present across all cases, excluding the possibility of a single shared genomic region influencing the expression of NR4A3 in all samples. In contrast, we identified three distinct subgroups according to the location of the breakpoints within specific genomic regions, and different mechanisms of regulatory influence of 4q13 genomic regions are possible. We focused on the largest group of tumors and functionally validated a distal enhancer located within a 4q13 genomic region included in the translocation in the majority of the cases, thus indirectly presenting reasonable evidence that indeed the 4q13 enhancer activity is the major factor enabling NR4A3 upregulation. In conclusion we suggest that our comprehensive patient and in vitro data provides strong evidence that the recurrent [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] aberration enables upregulation of NR4A3 through enhancer hijacking and constitutes the initial oncogenic driver event in AciCC.

The raw calls were further annotated using several publicly available data tracks, such as 1000 Genome variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms database (dbSNP), repeats, and other elements. For annotation of functional impact we used Annovar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and further assessed for the variants confidence.

Calculation of genomic translocations was done using the CREST software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In short, we first extracted soft clipped parts of the aligned reads, and then applied crest following the default parameters. In order to filter out germline events we used the -g option allowing for a comparison with a control bam file. In case we had no matched control a fake control was used to filter noise. The resulting translocation events were then annotated using annovar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. For visualizing the genomic context of the translocations we defined common TAD regions on the basis of 29 published HiC maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In summary, we first segmented the genome into 40&#8201;kb bins, and counted how many of the 29 samples contained a TAD boundary within each bin and its directly neighboring bins. If the count exceeded a number of 2 we checked if the next bin and its direct neighbors also exceeded a number of two and extended the boundary region by the end of the next bin. This was repeated until a subsequent bin did not fulfill the count criterion anymore, and then the TAD boundary position was defined as the boundary region start position plus the length of the boundary region divided by two. Furthermore, we used the HiC map of the mesoendoderm cell line replicate two for visualizing fine grained TAD structures.

Both reads of a paired fragment were used in a strand-unspecific manner for counting and the quality threshold was set to 255 (which indicates that STAR found a unique alignment). A custom script was used to calculate FPKM and TPM expression values. For total library abundance calculations, all genes on chromosomes X, Y, MT, as well as rRNA and tRNA genes were omitted as they are likely to introduce library size estimation biases.

After a final PCR amplification step, the resulting DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced on Illumina&#8217;s NextSeq 500 (75 nt reads, single end). ChIP-sequencing reads were aligned against the 1000 genomes phase 2 assembly using bwa aln (version 0.7.12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> with default parameters. Afterwards duplicate removal was performed by samtools rmdup (version 0.1.19)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> with parameter -s. Since the 5&#8242;-ends of aligned reads (=&#8221;tags&#8221;) represent the end of ChIP/IP-fragments, the tags were extended in-silico (using custom software) at the 3&#8242;-ends to a length of 150&#8211;250&#8201;bp, depending on the average fragment length in the size selected library (normally 200&#8201;bp). To identify the density of fragments (extended tags) along the genome, the genome was divided into 32&#8201;bp bins and the number of fragments in each bin was determined. This information was stored in bedGraph files and used for visualization. For finding regions of local enrichment in ChIP-seq read density, so-called peaks, we used MACS (version 2.1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> with parameters effective genome size&#8201;=&#8201;2.7e&#8201;+&#8201;09, band width&#8201;=&#8201;200, model fold&#8201;=&#8201;[5, 50], p-value cutoff&#8201;=&#8201;1e-07, and broad calling&#8201;=&#8201;off, or SICER (version 1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> with parameters window size&#8201;=&#8201;200, fragment size&#8201;=&#8201;200, effective genome size as a fraction of hs37d5&#8201;=&#8201;0.86, gap size&#8201;=&#8201;0, evalue for identification of candidate islands that exhibit clustering&#8201;=&#8201;1000, FDR&#8201;=&#8201;1e-10, depending on the expected breadth of the peaks. Before applying peak calling, we normalized all samples for a particular ChIP/IP by sampling down all samples to have the same tag counts as the sample with the lowest tag count. Afterwards, we removed peaks residing in ENCODE blacklisted regions. Since MACS was particularly made for finding narrow peaks we used it for peak calling on ChIP-Seq data of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, CTCF, and NR4A3. SICER was only used for broad H3K27me3 signals. For the identification of super enhancers we used a proprietary software implemented by Active Motif that gives very similar results as the ROSE super-enhancer software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In a first step, MACS peaks of H3K27ac were merged if their distance was equal or less than 12,500&#8201;bp. In a second step, the merged peak regions with the strongest signals (top 5%) were identified as super enhancers. For defining differential peaks between tumor and normal samples we first calculated for each histone mark extended regions for which at least one of the samples contains a peak (i.e., the union of peaks). Afterwards, we calculated for each sample and each extended peak interval the average fragment density among all bins within the region. This enabled us to determine the log2 fold change of average fragment density between tumor samples and the normal sample. We then defined the intervals with log2 ratio smaller or equal than &#8722;2 as downregulated in tumors and the intervals with log2 ratio greater or equal than 2 as upregulated in tumors. Detection of enriched TFBS motifs in differential peaks was performed using the HOMER software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The perl script findMotifsGenome.pl was applied using default parameters except for -size given and -keepFiles. As background we used the complete set of extended regions per histone mark. We scanned for CTCF motifs within the individual samples&#8217; peaks using the motif package of the BioPython module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The position weight matrix (PWM) of CTCF was obtained from the HOCOMOCO database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. To avoid overfitting of the PWM we introduced pseudocounts according to an approximate CG content in the human genome of about 40%. As scanning background we used a global distribution of A,T&#8201;=&#8201;30% and C,G&#8201;=&#8201;20%. Scanning of the motifs according the PWM was done using a precision of 10e4 and a FPR of 10e-4.
