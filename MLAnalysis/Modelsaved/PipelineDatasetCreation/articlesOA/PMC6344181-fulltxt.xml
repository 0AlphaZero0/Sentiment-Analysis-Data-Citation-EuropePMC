Although many endometriosis patients had no significant symptoms, it is mainly characterized by dysmenorrhea and infertility.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Recent years, the incidence rate of endometriosis is increased and it shows a younger trend.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> This disease bring high physical and mental wellbeing for the patients and family members.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> There is a popular belief that endometriosis is caused by the activated endometrial cells grows outside the endometrium.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The development of endometriosis is similar to the malignant tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the etiology of it.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> In spite of the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still unclear, multiple factors have been found contribute to the occurrence and development of endometriosis, including the alteration of the peritoneal microenvironment, disorders of inflammatory response, DNA methylation, lifestyle, and others.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> As an estrogen-dependent disease, endometriosis might be regulated by the metabolism of estrogen.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Thus any factors contribute to the disorders of estrogen metabolism may be associated with the development of endometriosis.</p><p>Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is one of the key enzymes for estrogen metabolism and widely expressed in different organs. It could inactivate the catechol estrogen via catalyzing the methylation of it.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> The methylated products could inhibit the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells and angiogenesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Human <italic>COMT</italic> gene is located at chromosome 22q11.21, and encode soluble COMT and membrane-bound COMT 2 isoforms. Alteration of <italic>COMT</italic> expression might cause some disorders. Polymorphisms in <italic>COMT</italic> gene have been found associated with different estrogen-dependent diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, the association between <italic>COMT</italic> gene polymorphisms and endometriosis still obscure.</p><p>From the 1000 genomes project, we found that the minor allele frequencies of <italic>COMT</italic> gene rs4680 (Val158Met, G1947A), rs4646312, and rs2020917 (&#8722;922C&#8202;&gt;T) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were higher than 0.1 in Chinese Han in Beijing (CHB) population.

However, there was no previous study analyzed the association of them with the endometriosis susceptibility.</p><p>In present study, no significant association has been discovered between rs4680 genotypes and endometriosis. Meanwhile, we found a significant association between rs4680 A allele and 1.450 times increased risk of endometriosis. That was accorded with the meta-analysis performed by Tong et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> They suggested that rs4680 was significantly correlated with increased susceptibility of endometriosis both in AA versus GG and A versus G genetic models. In addition, the positive association between them also has been discovered by Juo and colleagues in another Chinese Han population.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> However, no significant association has been discovered between rs4680 and endometriosis in Australian and Brazilian populations.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> These difference might be caused by the different sample size, ethnicity, or other factors.</p><p>TT genotype and T allele of rs2020917 SNP were slightly correlated with enhanced susceptibility of endometriosis. Meanwhile, we failed to find any significant association between rs4646312 genotypes and endometriosis risk. C allele of rs4646312 SNP had obviously higher frequency in endometriosis patients, suggested 1.502 times increased susceptibility for endometriosis. There was no previous study focused on the association of these 2 SNPs with endometriosis susceptibility.</p><p>Age, BMI, age of menarche, menstrual cycle, intrauterine device use, oral contraceptive use, coffee, tea, drinking, cigarette smoking, and secondhand smoking were used as confounding factors to adjust the association strength. Then the crude results were altered. Both the genotypes and alleles of rs4680 SNP had no significant association after the adjustment. TT genotype of rs2020917 SNP was significantly associated with 2.894 times increased risk of endometriosis. At the same time, approximately 1.481 times elevated endometriosis risk might be correlated with rs2020917 T allele. No significant correlation was discovered between rs4646312 genotypes and the susceptibility of endometriosis. <italic>COMT</italic> gene rs4646312&#8202;C allele was distinctly correlated with 1.564 times increased endometriosis risk. These adjustments might increase the reliablility of current results via included the confounding factors in the analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, <italic>COMT</italic> gene polymorphisms act as the risk factor for endometriosis occurrence. This result will help us to select the susceptible population for endometriosis. However, the limitations in this study should not be ignored. First of all, sample size was not large enough to obtain high statistical power. Second, polymorphisms distributions were different in various regions and ethnicity, but only one ethnicity was analyzed in this study might limit the application rage of the results. Third, a variety of factors involve in the development of endometriosis; however, the interaction analysis between genetic and environmental factors was not detected in this research. Finally, functional analysis for the <italic>COMT</italic> gene polymorphisms and the causality between <italic>COMT</italic> polymorphisms and endometriosis risk were not ascertained in present study. Thus, well-designed studies with enlarged sample size and ethnicity numbers should be carried out in the future. In addition, the causality between <italic>COMT</italic> polymorphisms and endometriosis development should be probed both in vivo and in vitro in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang, Jingde Jia, Bo Fan.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang, Aiping Wen, Jingde Jia, Lili Zhu, Bo Fan.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang, Aiping Wen, Jingde Jia, Lili Zhu, Bo Fan.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Jingde Jia, Lili Zhu.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; original draft:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang, Aiping Wen.</p><p><bold>Writing &#8211; review and editing:</bold> Jiajia Zhai, Lei Jiang, Aiping Wen.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 95% CIs = 95% confidence intervals, BMI = body mass index, CHB = Chinese Han in Beijing, COMT = catechol-O-methyltransferase, HWE = Hardy&#8211;Weinberg equilibrium, ORs = odds ratios, SNPs = single nucleotide polymorphisms.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>JZ, LJ, AW, and JJ contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The authors of this work have nothing to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rafique</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Decherney</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group>
