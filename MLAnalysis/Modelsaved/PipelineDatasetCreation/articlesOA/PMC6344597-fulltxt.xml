Two potential mechanisms are the higher protein level in formula compared with breast milk and the removal of the milk fat and associated milk fat globule membranes (MFGM) during production of infant formula. To determine whether MFGM may impact metabolism, formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive either an MFGM isolate-supplemented experimental formula (EF) or a standard formula (SF) from 2 until 6 months and compared with a BF reference&#160;group. Infants consuming EF had higher levels of fatty acid oxidation products compared to infants consuming SF. Although the protein level in the study formula was approximately 12&#8201;g/L (lower than most commercial formulas), a metabolic difference between FF and BF remained such that FF infants had higher levels of amino acid catabolism by-products and a low efficiency of amino acid clearance (preference for&#160;protein metabolism). BF infants had higher levels of fatty acid oxidation products (preference for&#160;fat metabolism). These unique, energy substrate-driven metabolic outcomes did not persist after diet was shifted to weaning foods and appeared to be disrupted by complementary feeding. Our results suggest that MFGM may have a role in directing infant metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Sweden&amp;apos;s Innovation Agency (Vinova), Semper/Hero, and V&amp;amp;#x00E4;sterbotten County Council</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Breast milk is considered to be the best source of cellular fuel and essential nutrients for the rapidly growing brain of the infant. Indeed, the infant brain requires approximately 74% of the total dietary energy intake, whereas in adults, only 20&#8211;23% of dietary energy is used to nourish the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Human infants have higher brain:body mass ratios and have more body fat than offspring of many other mammalian species. Indeed, a normally developing infant&#8217;s body fat continuously increases from 15&#8211;16% of their body weight at birth to 25%-26% of their body weight at 12&#8211;18 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. During this time, the metabolic phenotype of the infant is geared toward compensating the high energy demands of the developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Human brain development accelerates in the first few months after birth, when a temporal neurodevelopmental window paralleled by major shifts in metabolism is observed. Several studies support the benefits of breastfeeding on improving cognitive developmental outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and preventing overweight and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. While human milk is the ideal source of nutrition for infants, the decision to breast-fed and its duration are highly personal and influenced by historical, socioeconomic, cultural and individual-level factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A metabolic phenotype characterized by high levels of circulating amino acids, insulin and urea has consistently been observed in formula-fed (FF) infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We hypothesize this is an outcome of &#8220;too much protein in infant formula and insufficient use of fat&#8221;. However, whether this is a temporal reflection of differences in nutrient intake during this specific time frame of feeding, or whether this may have profound long-lasting effects remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par4">Reducing the protein content of formula has been shown to decrease later risk of childhood overweight and obesity at school age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Efforts have therefore been made to successively lower the protein content of infant formula while maintaining adequate growth and plasma amino acids at levels similar to those of breast-fed infants. Milk fat globule membranes (MFGM), an important component of milk, have historically been discarded with the milk fat during production of infant formula. The MFGM contains numerous complex lipids such as phospholipids, sphingolipids and gangliosides, sialic acid and cholesterol, as well as bioactive glycoproteins such as mucin (MUC1), lactadherin, butyrophilin and xanthine oxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, supplementing infant formula with a bovine MFGM isolate may provide an efficacious and sustainable approach to address the current nutritional and developmental gaps observed between breast-fed and formula-fed infants.</p><p id="Par5">Previously, we conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial where 240 infants were enrolled at less than 2 months of age. All infants were, based on parental reporting, exclusively breast-fed (BF) or formula-fed (FF) prior to enrollment. The FF&#160;infants were subsequently assigned to consume either an MFGM-supplemented, low-energy, low-protein experimental formula (EF) or a standard formula (SF) from 2 until 6 months of age (baseline demographics and clinical characteristics for each group are available elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). To access the impact of this dietary intervention on metabolism, serum samples were collected at 2 (baseline), 4, 6 and 12 (post-intervention) months of age.</p><p id="Par6">In this cohort, we reported that during the intervention period, FF infants displayed higher growth velocity compared to the BF infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This elevated growth in the FF infants was coupled with higher plasma insulin and blood urea nitrogen levels. In contrast, BF infants had higher levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in serum, as well as higher LDL:HDL ratios and leptin:fat mass ratios. Furthermore, infants who consumed EF showed a different circulating lipidomics profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, as well as higher serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the SF-fed infants that approached what was observed in the BF infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Primary and secondary outcome measures from this cohort were previously published, and are summarized in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Differences between breast-fed (BF), SF (Standard Formula) and EF (Experimental Formula) fed infants previously reported in this cohort.</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>Footnote: NS: not significant.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par7">Here, we further explored three aims within this cohort: (1) whether a comprehensive evaluation of the serum metabolome will reflect the effect of early diet at 12 months of age; (2) whether a metabolic signature is present that indicates improved cognitive development as previously reported in this cohort; and (3) whether consumption of a formula supplemented with a bovine MFGM isolate (EF) improves the overall metabolic outcome when compared to infants fed SF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">To expand our understanding of dietary-driven metabolic changes in early development, both plasma and serum samples from this randomized controlled trial were subjected to a comprehensive metabolomics analysis.

Circulating lipids are more rapidly cleared in infants as their post-meal triglyceride levels return to baseline within 180&#8201;min in an infant, compared to 8&#8201;h in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We previously showed that at 120&#8201;min post-meal, plasma NEFA levels of infants were similar to pre-prandial (~3&#8201;h of fasting) levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, the profile of circulating fatty acids and triglycerides reported here (at approximately 165&#8201;min post-meal, SI Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) reflects fasting conditions. In this study, we observed higher circulating fatty acids (C12:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C20:4, from Figs&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>) and medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine species (C10, C16, C18:1) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) in BF infants. Kirchberg <italic>et al</italic>. also observed higher long-chain acylcarnitine (C14, C16 and C18) to free carnitine ratios in the plasma of BF infants, with lower levels found in infants consuming a higher fat, lower protein formula, and the lowest levels in infants consuming a lower fat, higher protein formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, higher circulating triglycerides were also reported in exclusively BF compared with mixed-fed infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">The higher serum levels of long- and medium- chain fatty acids, along with increased levels of acylcarnitine species (derived from skeletal muscles and other tissues such as liver and cardiac muscles), are suggestive of fatty acid oxidation flux. The levels of acetate and formate, as products of fatty acid oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, were higher in the serum of BF infants before 6 months of age regardless of introduction of complementary food (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). This observation is consistent with our previous metabolomics work on breast-fed infants in both the semi-fasting and postprandial states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

We believe that this represents a unique case of ketone production when glucose is sufficient and diet is not restricted. The positive relationship between circulating 3-hydroxybutyrate and NEFA&#160;observed here provides additional evidence toward fat-based ketogenesis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c&#8211;g</xref>). Although the ketogenic state is generally associated with a fasting state, we believe that the high levels of ketone bodies found in the blood of breast-fed infants uniquely supplies substrate for the rapidly growing brain. It has been previously hypothesized that the fatty acid oxidative activity in the brain is low to prevent generation of oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. While glucose transport into, and utilization in, the brain during the breast-fed period is lower than in the adult state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the brain can take up and metabolize ketone bodies in proportion to blood levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. As there is no significant intracellular pool, circulating 3-hydroxybutyrate (the primary ketone body) accurately reflects the levels of brain 3-hydroxybutyrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Ketone bodies not only provide an alternative source of fuel for the brain (other than glucose), they serve as building blocks for endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and long chain fatty acids that are important for the developing brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Since acetyl-CoA can also be synthesized from even-chain fatty acids, glucose, and acetoacetate, in concert with elevated amino acids, the increase in circulating acylcarnitine C3 observed here (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) potentially reflects promotion of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis under higher insulin levels.

This can be partly explained by a reduction of the total intake of breast milk or infant formula (high fat and low carbohydrate) and introduction of additional carbohydrate into the diet. Through the process of supplying more carbohydrate into the diet, infants progressively move toward utilization of carbohydrates as the main energy source, and eventually, the brain takes up and utilizes less ketone bodies, switching to using glucose as the predominant fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.
