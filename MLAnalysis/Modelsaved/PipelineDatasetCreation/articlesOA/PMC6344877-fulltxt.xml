This is also the reason why its regulon has not been investigated so far. To overcome experimental obstacles, for investigating the HrdB regulon, we constructed a strain whose HrdB protein was tagged by an HA epitope. ChIP-seq experiment, done in 3 repeats, identified 2137 protein-coding genes organized in 337 operons, 75 small RNAs, 62 tRNAs, 6 rRNAs and 3 miscellaneous RNAs. Subsequent kinetic modeling of regulation of protein-coding genes with HrdB alone and with a complex of HrdB and a transcriptional cofactor RbpA, using gene expression time series, identified 1694 genes that were under their direct control. When using the HrdB&#8211;RbpA complex in the model, an increase of the model fidelity was found for 322 genes. Functional analysis revealed that HrdB controls the majority of gene groups essential for the primary metabolism and the vegetative growth. Particularly, almost all ribosomal protein-coding genes were found in the HrdB regulon. Analysis of promoter binding sites revealed binding motif at the&#160;&#8722;10 region and suggested the possible role of mono- or di-nucleotides upstream of the &#8722;10 element.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Univerzite J.

Different developmental complexities are controlled by a proportional number of sigma factors. Thus, the number of sigma 70 (&#963;<sup>70</sup>) family members varies from 1 in <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) to about 66 in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are gram-positive soil bacteria that undergo a complex multicellular development. Their growth starts with the germination of spores that develop into a vegetative mycelium of branching hyphae. The aerial hyphae are further dissected by sporulation septa into chains of uninucleoid spores. This is reflected by the fact that their genome was shown to encode more than 900 transcriptional regulators, among them the astonishing 66 sigma factors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), the largest number found in a bacterium to date.</p><p>Promoter-recognition properties differ between the housekeeping sigma factor and a variable number of alternative sigma factors, which coordinate gene expression in response to various environmental signals. The housekeeping sigma factor in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is HrdB (encoded by SCO5820 gene in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>), whose presence is essential across the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus. HrdB, as well as HrdA, HrdC and HrdD sigma factors, is orthologous to RpoD (&#963;<sup>70</sup>) of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and &#963;<sup>A</sup> of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the principal sigma factors of these bacteria (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#8211;10</xref>). However, neither HrdA-D regulons nor their role in developmental control have been studied so far in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p><p>The RbpA protein (RNA polymerase binding protein A) is one of the transcriptional factors that are directly bound to sigma factor&#8211;RNAP (RNA polymerase) complex. RbpA binds to the &#946; subunit of RNAP and modifies the enzyme core structure, which improves the affinity of RNAP to principal sigma factors HrdB and HrdA (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These results are consistent with <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>, where RbpA is associated with sigma factor A or B (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Deleting the <italic>rbpA</italic> gene is lethal for <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>, but not for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the absence of RbpA in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> leads to significantly impaired growth and increased sensitivity to rifampicin, an antibiotic which impedes transcription initiation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;17</xref>). Interestingly, RbpA helps housekeeping sigma factors bind to RNAP but the <italic>rbpA</italic> gene itself is regulated by RNAP holoenzyme with alternative or stress response sigma factors (&#963;<sup>R</sup> in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and &#963;<sup>E</sup> in <italic>Mycobacteria</italic>) and its expression is increased during oxidative stress (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In summary, published results suggest that the complex of HrdB/RbpA with RNAP stimulates the transcription of genes controlled by HrdB, ensuring important cell functions.</p><p>In this paper, we focused on a systems level analysis of the HrdB regulon during the vegetative growth phase of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. Using insertional mutagenesis, the HrdB was adapted to carry an epitope tag which allowed the promoter binding to be determined by a ChIP-seq experiment. The resulting data were complemented with the gene expression kinetics analysis using data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The data were used to evaluate the expression kinetic of the genes discovered by ChIP-seq. Computational modeling of gene expression kinetics were used, with a HrdB or HrdB&#8211;RbpA complex as regulators. The analysis helped us assess for which genes does binding of HrdB to the gene promoter actually results in transcriptional control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>The strains used in our work are <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> A3(2), <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and derivatives from GM2929 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BW25113/pIJ790 has a &#955; Red recombination system under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter and this strain was used to propagate the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> cosmid. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ET12567/pUZ8002, which is a methylation-deficient strain for intergeneric conjugation with <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>.

It was shown that the majority of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> promoters lack the &#8722;35 elements (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This observation was recently confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches where the impact of RbpA for transcription initiation at promoters lacking the &#8722;35 region was proved. The importance of guanosines at the position &#8722;13 and &#8722;14 was shown in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as well (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Supporting this fact, the crystallographic studies of mycobacterial transcription initiation complex revealed that RNAP is bound to &#8722;10 element by a sigma factor and this interaction is improved by RbpA binding to RNAP holoenzyme and to the upstream of &#8722;10 region, especially to the positions &#8722;13 and &#8722;14 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). For these reasons, we performed a statistical analysis of guanosines in the mentioned positions (&#8722;14 and &#8722;13) of HrdB-dependent promoters to find out if they can play a similar role in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p><p>Therefore, for the sites with the motif identified by the method 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) we examined positions &#8722;14 and &#8722;13 for the occurrence of G mono- and di-nucleotides. The region was divided into three groups according to occurrence of GG in the region - GG dinucleotide, only one G and no G (see Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> also shows the occurrence of T at position &#8722;12 which was shown to be potentially significant. In order to enumerate the significance of occurrence of GG/G in the &#8722;14, &#8722;13 positions, we also calculated the frequency of GG dinucleotide occurrence in the whole genome and calculated the expected number of sites containing GG by chance in 954 sites (the same number as the number of analyzed sites). When the frequency of occurrence of GG in whole genome is 0.114 the proportion of expected sites in the 954 sites containing GG by chance is 109.The number of sites found in our data was about twice as high (see Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

This finding was supported by the information that of the four <italic>hrd</italic> genes, only <italic>hrdB</italic> is present in all the investigated streptomycete species. Authors also suggest that HrdB could be a functional homolog of <italic>E. coli</italic>&#8217;s &#963;<sup>70</sup>. It was supposed that HrdB regulates the expression of housekeeping genes whose products are essential for the growth of streptomycetes.</p><p>However, due to the lethality of the cells after the deletion of <italic>hrdB</italic>, the native function of HrdB has not been investigated to date. A possible methodical solution to overcoming this difficulty is in tagging the protein of interest with a heterologous epitope. The epitope-tagging strategy eliminates the risk of cross-reactivity between the respective antibody and proteins with similar epitopes, which would be the case of various sigma factors in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Of the two existing approaches we used insertion of an epitope tag into the native chromosomal site of the protein-coding gene. Similar approach had been used before. For example, Petrone <italic>et&#160;al</italic>., (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) inserted FLAG3 tag to HilD protein to identify HilD regulon in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. Similarly, Qian <italic>et&#160;al</italic>. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) created a TAP-tagged GalR strain to identify GalR binding sites in <italic>E. coli</italic> and Stringer <italic>et&#160;al</italic>. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) constructed a TAP-tagged AraC to map AraC binding sites in <italic>E. coli</italic>. For our purposes, we successfully adapted the method of PCR-targeting mutagenesis in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) in order to introduce an epitope tag to the <italic>hrdB</italic> gene directly in the chromosome. Similarly, but independently, the method was presented by Kim <italic>et&#160;al</italic>. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) who used tandem epitope tagging to insert a myc tag into the transcription factors ScbR and NdgR; this despite the fact that the longer repeated myc epitope tags have been shown to possibly affect the functionality of DNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). For this reason, we preferred the hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The HA tag, together with its specific and efficient commercially available antibody, exhibits valuable immunoprecipitation results while minimally affecting the target protein's function (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Our created HA-HrdB strain was then subjected to ChIP-seq analysis, done in three repeats with a wild-type as a control. For this we used the same cultivation conditions as described in Nieselt <italic>et&#160;al</italic>. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in order to be able to exploit their gene expression database for the kinetics analysis.</p><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Model</title><p>The fact that a sigma factor is able to bind a promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic> does not always mean that the gene expression is actually switched on. Thus the &#963;<sup>70</sup> subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> may induce transcriptional pausing at promoter motifs (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Also, our binding analysis was performed at one specific point, other conditions, or a different developmental stage, may involve other transcriptional regulators that might influence the HrdB-promoter affinities. The search for HrdB-regulated genes was performed with the assumption that HrdB is the principal regulator of mRNA accumulation during transcription. We have also modeled the situation when the gene expression rate is independent of the amount of HrdB altogether. As discussed below, it has been observed that RbpA forms a complex with HrdB and RNA polymerase enhancing expression of the regulated gene (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#8211;13</xref>). We have therefore extended the model to incorporate the complex of HrdB&#8211;RbpA as the regulator as well. All three models (i.e. independent constitutive rate of expression, HrdB-dependent, and RbpA&#8211;HrdB complex-dependent) were utilized to prove or disprove the ability of HrdB to regulate the genes to whose promoters it bound, as discovered by the ChIP-seq experiment. The modeling of the found protein-coding genes revealed that HrdB was not strictly required only for 322 genes, as their expression rate was found to be independent of HrdB expression changes. Additional 121 genes could not be modeled with any of the three models. Here they are considered as false positives. We proved that the remaining 1694 genes could be controlled by HrdB, not only by the ChIP-seq, but also from the point of view of the expression kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>RbpA</title><p>The importance of the RbpA-HrdB complex is the reason why, as mentioned above, we included RbpA in the model. Looking at the expression profiles of HrdB and RbpA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the influence of RbpA is pronounced mainly in the later phases of growth when the RbpA profile peaks while the profile of HrdB slowly decays. The profiles of genes that reach higher levels in the later phase are thus better modeled with the addition of RbpA to the model, enhancing goodness of the fit to the given mRNA profile. The inclusion of RbpA as an additional regulator acting in complex with HrdB increased the model fidelity for 322 genes of the 1694 found to be controlled by HrdB. If less stringent criterion is used, the number of genes giving better modeling results for the complex of HrdB&#8211;RbpA increased to 579 genes. We therefore consider the activity of RbpA for the expression of HrdB regulated genes as substantial; this corresponds well with the previously described significance of the regulator in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#8211;17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Promoters</title><p>Based on transcriptional analyses and S1 nuclease mapping, only 20% of streptomycete promoters have similar sequences to those recognized by <italic>E. coli</italic> &#963;<sup>70</sup> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As its regulon had not been identified earlier, the promoter specificity of HrdB sigma factor remained unclear. Several HrdB-binding sites had been published before (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Using mostly <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription or by S1-nuclease mapping, these analyses revealed following genes: <italic>furA, sigBp2, tuf3, chiD, gltBp1, ftsZp2, dagAp4, chiA, chiC, chiB, chiF, rrnDp2</italic>&#160;and <italic>rrnAp1</italic>. From these, five genes (<italic>tuf3, gltBp1, ftsZp2, rrnDp2, rrnAp1</italic>) belonged to our HrdB regulon as well. The other genes were not transcribed by HrdB <italic>in vivo</italic> or they were transcribed by HrdB in other growth conditions or growth phases. Our dataset of HrdB-binding regions enabled us to search for specific binding motifs within the promoter sequences. For this, we compared the data we obtained using ChIP-seq with the published analysis of TSS&#160;(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and we determined an HrdB&#8211;dependent promoter consensus sequence. Our search suggested that the majority of promoters in the HrdB regulon either lack the &#8722;35 element, or it has low conservation. On the other hand, the &#8722;10 element is highly conserved having thymine at &#8722;7 and adenine at &#8722;11 positions which perfectly correlates with motifs found by Jeong <italic>et&#160;al</italic>. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The shown similarity of the &#8722;10 region motifs between the published general motif search and our HrdB-dependent motif analysis supports the conclusion that HrdB is the predominant sigma factor for the vegetative growth phase. The conservation of the &#8722;10 element was also observed in <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, where the majority of mycobacterial promoters lack the &#8722;35 element (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>The previous studies revealed the importance of guanines that are located at the &#8722;14 and &#8722;13 positions upstream of the mycobacterial &#8722;10 element (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We therefore performed a search to identify guanines at the mentioned positions. We analyzed the &#8722;14 or &#8722;13 position for 954 promoter sequences and at least a single guanine was identified in 77% of cases and in 23% of cases guanine was found in both positions. That suggests that promoter design in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is very similar to that of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>. Interestingly, search for guanines revealed the possibly important thymine at the &#8722;12 position. Percentage conservation of thymine at this position was increased by a decreasing number of guanines upstream. However, this hypothesis remains unconfirmed and will be subject to further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-4"><title>Functional characterization of the HrdB regulon</title><sec id="SEC4-4-1"><title>HrdB targets involved in the morphological development</title><p>Within the HrdB regulon we identified genes that are involved in regulations of morphological differentiation and perhaps surprisingly in antibiotic production as well.

Important developmental regulators belonging to the HrdB regulon were RNase III and AdpA. AdpA is a key regulator of morphological differentiation in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, which was originally discovered in <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic> (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Less is known about its role in&#160;<italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, where its mutation induces a bald phenotype and a reduction in actinorhodin production (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Recently it was found that a <italic>cis-</italic>antisense transcript regulates the expression of AdpA (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The regulatory mechanism probably relies on an RNA duplex formation which is recognized by RNase III endoribonuclease.

However, disruption of HrdD does not exhibit any obvious phenotypic defect (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). HrdD is very closely related to HrdB in its amino acid sequence and promoter specificity (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).

No specific promoter sequence other than the conserved &#8722;10 sequence was found for the genes of glycolysis and TCA cycle, irrespective of the dependency of HrdB. Among others, citrate synthase CitA (SCO2736) has been previously shown to be crucial for maintaining the physiological balance of the cells. Its proper function is linked with cellular differentiation as its mutant loses abilities to form aerial mycelium and to produce antibiotics when grown on glucose (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). HrdB also participated in the expression of 46,5% genes from the electron transport system (ferredoxin-NADP-reductase, several types of cytochromes including cytochrome P450, cytochrome oxidase, oxidoreductases, NADH dehydrogenases, and electron transport proteins). Subsequently, the proton motive force is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The key enzyme, F0F1 ATPase, consists of a hydrophobic F0 component (formed from integral membrane proteins A, B and C) and a hydrophilic F1 component (formed from five subunits &#945;, &#946;, &#955;, &#948;&#160;and &#1013;) (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>).

Other than the biological interpretation of the function of HrdB, the computational modeling, allowed us to associate the binding data with the actual expression of the incident genes and their regulator HrdB. The model and the computed parameters also allow for modeling changes in the expression of the target genes after artificial perturbations, performed by a computer, simulating a real experiment. This approach is a prerequisite for the construction of a general computational model for the control network of a studied organism.</p><p>Although the method was able to identify kinetically plausible interactions between a sigma factor and its target gene, it has some limitations. The model, in principle, can consider competition among sigma factors (or other factors), but they must be known. Without such independent knowledge, we are not able to add additional terms to the equations of the model. The model, therefore, is able to discover genes directly controlled by the sigma factor (here HrdB) and identify those, for which the regulation is more complex. The ChIP-seq data showed massive binding of HrdB&#8211;RNAP holoenzyme to HrdB-dependent promoters. These data suggested very strong affinity of HrdB to RNAP core. However, in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, HrdB competes with other 65 sigma factors and the affinity of HrdB to the individual promoters plays a crucial role in its ability to control transcription of the particular gene. The competition of HrdB with other sigma factors for the binding site on RNAP core and the HrdB&#8211;RNAP holoenzyme binding affinity to HrdB-dependent promoters should be considered for more accurate analysis in future.</p><p>We show here that HrdB is indispensable because it delineates the key processes in the cells via expression control of genes responsible for central intermediary metabolism (gluconeogenesis, sulphur metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, pentose phosphate pathway and energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication), signal sensing and transduction (like PhoP-PhoR two component system or signal recognition particle complex), genes coding for other regulatory proteins and small RNAs (including tmRNA and RNase P RNA), pleiotropic developmental regulators and structural proteins involved in the morphogenesis, including cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in cell division, among other processes.</p><p>The number of identified essential genes found in its regulon prove the crucial role of HrdB in the life cycle of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC6"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Gene expression time series published by Nieselt (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>): GEO accession number GSE18489.
