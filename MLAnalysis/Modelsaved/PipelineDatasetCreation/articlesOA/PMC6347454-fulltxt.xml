However, possible risks of EQ used in aquafeed for fish health have not yet been characterized. The present study investigated the toxicity and dose-response of subchronic dietary EQ exposure at doses ranging from 41 to 9666 mg EQ/kg feed in Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic> L.). Feed at concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg were rejected by the fish, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth performance. No mortality was observed in fish exposed to any of the doses. A multi-omic screening of metabolome and proteome in salmon liver indicated an effect of dietary EQ on bioenergetics pathways and hepatic redox homeostasis in fish fed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed. Increased energy expenditure associated with an upregulation of hepatic fatty acid &#946;-oxidation and induction and carbohydrate catabolic pathways resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in liver histological sections, decreasing whole body lipid levels and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Increased GSH and TBARS in the liver indicated a state of oxidative stress, which was associated with activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and glutathione-mediated detoxification processes. However, no oxidative DNA damage was observed. As manifestation of altered energy metabolism, the depletion of liver intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles was considered the critical endpoint for benchmark dose assessment, and a BMDL<sub>10</sub> of 243 mg EQ/kg feed was derived as a safe upper limit of EQ exposure in Atlantic salmon.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010197</institution-id><institution>Fiskeri - og havbruksn&#230;ringens forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>901327</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was financed by the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhf.no/">https://www.fhf.no/</ext-link>), the Marine Ingredients Organisation (IFFO) Marine Harvest ASA, EWOS AS/Cargill Aqua Nutrition, Biomar AS, Skretting AS and Europharma (FHF project no. 901327).

Ethoxyquin (6-Ethoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline; EQ) is one of a number of technological antioxidant feed additives added to animal feeds to prevent this process from happening. Because of its high antioxidant capacity [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], EQ has commonly been used in fishmeal to prevent rancidity, but also to prevent self-ignition under long-distance sea transport and storage. In addition, EQ has routinely been added to fish silage as well as vitamin and pigment premixes in order to preserve nutritive value, freshness, flavor and color of these products. In the European Union (EU), the upper limit (UL) for use of EQ alone or in combination with two other authorized synthetic antioxidants, namely butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), in animal feed was previously established at 150 mg/kg (Council Directive 70/524/EEC, replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1831/2003 [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Results from an annual feed monitoring program commissioned by the Norwegian Food Safety Authorities showed that during the years 2003&#8211;2017 the average EQ concentration in Norwegian fish feeds was 20 &#177; 25 mg/kg (including both EQ and its main metabolite ethoxyquin dimer (EQDM); <italic>n</italic> = 607) [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Few non-compliant feeds exceeding authorized levels have been found during these years, with a maximum deteced concentration of 180 mg EQ/kg (224 mg &#8721;EQ+EQDM/kg) [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the presence of EQ in feed may result in an accumulation of both EQ and its breakdown products in the edible parts of farmed animals [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In several farmed fish species including, Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>), Atlantic halibut (<italic>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</italic>) and brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic>), the presence of EQ and its metabolites was confirmed [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the EU, the authorization of EQ as a feed additive in the food production chain is currently under re-evaluation, and has meanwhile been formally suspended, because of a substantial lack of relevant toxicological data required for a risk assessment [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have indicated undesirable health-effects in animals fed diets containing EQ [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Yet, to date limited information is available on possible effects and effect levels of EQ present in fish feed [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the large yellow croaker (<italic>Pseudosciaena crocea</italic>), ten weeks dietary exposure to 1350 mg EQ/kg feed decreased specific growth rate, condition factor and hepatosomatic index [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, indications of perturbation of the lipid metabolism were seen at whole fish level with a curvilinear dose-response of crude lipid content to increasing concentrations of EQ. In turbot (<italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic> L.), disturbed iono-regulatory mechanisms were suggested in fish exposed for 16 days to 200 and 400 mg EQ/kg feed, affecting plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride and calcium [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>), 30 days of dietary exposure to 150 mg EQ/kg feed was found to have immunosuppressive effects and cause histopathological changes in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic> L.), EQ was shown to affect gene and protein expression patterns associated with the hepatic biotransformation of EQ through Phase I and II catalytic enzymes such as CYP1A1, CYP3A, GST and UDPGT after 90 days exposure to doses of up to 1800 mg/kg feed. However, no differences were seen in growth rate, feed conversion rate, hepato-somatic index or mortality [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In light of the scarce and conflicting data on EQ toxicity in farmed fish, the aim of the present study was to comprehensively investigate the toxicity and mode of action of subchronic dietary exposure to EQ in Atlantic salmon, using a systems biological approach. Five graded doses of EQ were administered to salmon through the diet and effects on health status were screened in liver, kidney, spleen and plasma. As a primary screening, metabolomic and proteomic profiling were performed and integrated in order to explore possible treatment-related changes and the interactions between different interconnected metabolic pathways. Identified target pathways were subsequently investigated by more targeted analyses using traditional physiological and biochemical measures to consolidate if these candidate pathways were of significance for the development of adverse outcomes. In order to characterize the risk from the dietary intake of EQ in Atlantic salmon, experimental data of toxicological responses were analyzed using benchmark dose models (BMD). The dose threshold for a toxic effect [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was determined from the BMD of the critical endpoint of the study from which a safe upper level of intake for EQ for Atlantic salmon was proposed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The experiment was approved by the Norwegian National Animal Research Authority (Mattilsynet; FOTS ID: 9004) and was performed in compliance with national and international ethical standards.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Diet preparation</title><p>The experiment was designed as a subchronic oral toxicity study according to [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], including six dietary treatments. EQ-free diets were produced in one batch as 5 mm extruded pellets by EWOS Innovation (Bergen, Norway), according to an established recipe (Harmony Debio, organic fish feed; <xref rid="pone.0211128.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The levels of EQ were adjusted by dissolving commercially available EQ (Capsoquin batch no. S-5162, 99% purity; courtesy of Industrial T&#233;cnica Pecuaria, S.A., Spain) directly into oil with subsequent coating of the pellets, aiming to obtain nominal EQ concentrations of 0, 50, 150, 1500, 5000 and 10 000 mg EQ/kg feed. Uncoated feed pellets with a lipid content 20% below the target level were mixed with EQ-containing fish oil and exposed to a reduced pressure of 0.1 bar for 10 min. The resulting oil-coated pellets were stored at -20&#176;C throughout the experimental period. Concentrations of EQ and its main metabolite EQDM were measured in samples from each feed batch taken immediately after production (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and again after the 90 days feeding experiment. Ethoxyquin concentrations in feed were 0.47 mg (EQ 0), 41 &#177; 2 mg (EQ 1), 119 &#177; 7 mg (EQ 2), 1173 &#177; 113 mg (EQ 3), 3985 &#177; 228 mg (EQ 4) and 9666 &#177; 979 mg/kg feed at trial start, and did not show any degradation during the experimental period. Concentrations of EQDM were below the limit of quantification (LOQ &lt;0.07 mg EQDM/kg feed) at both time points. To ensure nutritive stability of the control feed containing no added EQ, Vitamin E (500 mg/kg) and C (1 g/kg) were added as antioxidants to all diets. Analyses of the experimental diets confirmed equality of the proximate dietary composition between the different feeds.

Unconsumed feed pellets were collected and weighed once per day, and feed intake, feed conversion and EQ exposure were calculated.</p><p>Ten fish per tank (<italic>n</italic> = 30 per treatment group) were collected after both 45 and 90 days of exposure for tissue sampling. In addition, five fish per tank from the dietary group receiving an EQ concentration of ~150 mg/kg feed (EQ 2) were sampled at T = 0, and after 2, 4, 10, 20, 45 and 90 days of exposure, in order to monitor accumulation kinetics in fish fillet (results not reported here). In order to ensure equal treatment of all tanks, the number of fish in the other treatment groups was adjusted accordingly.</p><p>During sampling, fish were randomly collected from the tanks, anesthetized in a bath of tricaine methanesulfonate (FINQUEL MS-222; ~ 60mg L<sup>-1</sup>). Fish were sacrificed by a blow on the head and body weight and length of each fish were recorded. Five fish of each tank were homogenized to one pooled sample per tank for analysis of proximate composition. Of the five remaining fish, blood samples were taken from the caudal vein quickly following the initial anesthetization, using a heparinized VACUETTE blood collection tube with 21G x 1&#8217; needle and kept on ice until further analyses and plasma separation. Liver, kidney, heart and spleen were collected and organ weights were recorded. Defined pieces of liver, kidney and spleen were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (in PBS) for histopathological evaluation, while the rest of the tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80&#176;C until further analysis. Individual muscle samples (Norwegian quality cut; NQC) were taken, homogenized, frozen and stored at -80&#176;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Calculations</title><p>In order to assess growth performance and EQ exposure of Atlantic salmon during the 90 days feeding trial, body weight gain, condition factor, specific growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion rate were calculated with the following equations:

Metabolite profiling was performed by Metabolon Inc., USA, according to Metabolon&#8217;s standard methods. Briefly, samples were extracted and prepared for analysis, using the automated MicroLab STAR system (Hamilton Company, NV, USA). To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The sample extracts were then divided into four fractions. The organic solvent was removed, briefly placing the samples on a TurboVap (Zymark), the sample extracts were stored over night under nitrogen. All samples were analyzed using a combination of reverse phase (RP) ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with positive and negative ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI), and hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI along with several internal standards. In preparation for the analyses, the sample extracts were dried and then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of four methods. To quantify more hydrophilic compounds, one aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions, gradient eluting the extract from a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1x100 mm, 1.7 &#956;m) using water and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). Another aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions, but chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds. For this method, the extract was gradient eluted from the same C18 column using methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA and 0.01% FA and was operated at an overall higher organic content. The third aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion optimized conditions, gradient eluting the basic extracts using a separate dedicated C18 column using methanol and water, however with 6.5mM Ammonium Bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1x150 mm, 1.7 &#956;m) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10mM Ammonium Formate at a pH of 10.8. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion. All methods utilized a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer coupled to a heated electrospray ionization source and an Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35 000 mass resolution.</p><p>Instrument variability was 5% for internal standards and total process variability for endogenous metabolites was 10%.

Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 2,000) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of R = 240,000 at m/z 400 (after accumulation to a target value of 1e6 in the linear ion trap with maximum allowed ion accumulation time of 300ms). The 12 most intense eluting peptides above an ion threshold value of 3000 counts, and charge states of two or higher, were sequentially isolated to a target value of 1e4 and fragmented in the high-pressure linear ion trap by low-energy CID (collision-induced-dissociation) with normalized collision energy of 35% and wideband-activation enabled. The maximum allowed accumulation time for CID was 150 ms, the isolation with maintained at 2 Da, activation q = 0.25, and activation time of 10 ms. The resulting fragment ions were scanned out in the low-pressure ion trap at normal scan rate, and recorded with the secondary electron multipliers.

Ninety days of dietary exposure to graded levels of EQ caused a substantial increase in the total glutathione pool (both reduced and oxidized) in livers of Atlantic salmon. The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were elevated in a dose-dependent manner following EQ treatment and to the higher degree than the levels of oxidized species (GSSG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Cysteine, the limiting factor in GSH biosynthesis, is acquired by cells as cystine (cysteine disulfide) or synthesized from methionine through the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. Notably, while hepatic cysteine levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211128.s005">S3 Table</xref>) were not affected by the EQ treatment, levels of cystine were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Concomitantly, altered levels of metabolites involved in transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), including reduced levels of methionine precursors, as well as S-methylcysteine and N-methyltaurine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), and increase in homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and taurine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), were suggestive of increased utilization of these substrates to support GSH biosynthesis. These changes were accompanied by an increase in gamma-glutamyl amino acids (e.g., gamma-glutamylcysteine, gamma-glutamylleucine), which are formed when the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) transfers the gamma-glutamyl moiety from glutathione to an acceptor amino acid, as well as a concentration-dependent increase in 5-oxoproline and cysteinylglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The levels of ophthalmate were significantly increased following exposure to EQ 3, while both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol significantly decreased. Ophthalmate is an endogenous analogue of GSH, which is considered a marker of GSH consumption under oxidative stress conditions. Moreover, a dose-dependent elevation in the levels of dihydroxy fatty acid 9,10-DiHOME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g002">Fig 2</xref>), significantly increased after exposure to EQ 3, was observed. As dihydroxy fatty acids are oxidation products derived from essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, elevated levels of DiHOME fatty acids, derived from linoleic acid (18:2n-6), are reflective of hepatic oxidative stress. Thus, the observed treatment-related changes in salmon liver metabolites reflected increased utilization of glutathione and a compensatory induction of redox capacity, indicating a perturbation of liver redox-homeostasis and presence of oxidative stress.</p><fig id="pone.0211128.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0211128.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Changes in redox homeostasis in livers of Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic> L.) exposed to graded levels of ethoxyquin (EQ) through their diet for 90 days.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Metabolites displaying differential expression (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ANOVA) were grouped according to subpathway annotations.

Because the model fit for some of the plasma markers indicated a poor precision of the estimates (as indicated by broad confidence intervals), the BMR was adjusted to 10% above the modelled background response for AST and plasma total protein, and a 20% was used for ALT, bilirubin, plasma albumin, and plasma creatinine. Of plasma markers of physiological/metabolic effects, creatinine had the lowest BMDL<sub>20</sub> (0.5 mg EQ/kg BW/day). However, as creatinine levels directly correlate with energy turn-over, the observed effect could be the results of reduced feed intake rather than effects of EQ. The lowest BMDL<sub>20</sub> for plasma markers of adverse effects was therefore set for bilirubin with a BMDL<sub>20</sub> of 5.5 mg EQ/kg BW/day. Typical plasma markers of adverse effects on liver such as liver enzymes ALT and AST had a BMDL<sub>20</sub> of 14.5 mg EQ/kg BW/day and BMDL<sub>10</sub> of 10.9 mg EQ/kg BW/day, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).

The toxic potential of EQ in salmon has yet to be addressed. The present study investigated effects of dietary EQ in Atlantic salmon through a 90-day subchronic dose-response study, using a dose range from 0 to 10 000 mg EQ/ kg complete feed.</p><p>Dietary exposure to EQ at concentrations above 1173 mg EQ/kg feed, namely EQ 4 (3985 mg EQ/kg) and EQ 5 (9666mg EQ/kg) significantly affected feed intake and growth performance in Atlantic salmon (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similar to our findings, Bohne et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] found no effects of dietary EQ on growth or feed intake in Atlantic salmon up to a concentration of 1800 mg/kg feed, whereas diets containing a concentration of 15 000 mg/kg feed were rejected by the fish. Since all animals included in the present study came from the same stock and were reared under identical experimental conditions, the differences in feed intake and growth performance can most likely be attributed to dietary EQ levels as the only variable factor. Previous studies have reported inconsistent findings of the effects of dietary EQ exposure on growth response. Improved growth, as observed by several studies on EQ in different animal species [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], may likely be due to preserved nutritional quality of the diet under storage, especially prevention of lipid oxidation by EQ [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which may affect palatability of aquafeed. On the other hand, although preventing lipid oxidation in stored diets, inclusion of 200 mg EQ/kg feed led to reduced growth in shrimp, which was associated with reduced feed intake and altered feeding behavior [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similarly, reduced growth rates in juvenile large yellow croaker (<italic>Pseudosciaena crocea)</italic> after exposure to 1350 mg EQ/kg feed were associated with a trend in decreased feed intake with increasing dietary EQ, although no significant effect was observed [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>As EQ is described to have a mercaptan like scent [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], inclusion of high levels of EQ may have affected diet palatability due to its sensory properties. Indeed, fish receiving diets containing 3985 (EQ 4) and 9666 (EQ 5) mg EQ/kg consumed only 60% and 13% compared to the feed intake of the control group (EQ 0) already during the first week indicating that poor palatability prevented the fish from consuming the diet. Alternatively, altered feeding behavior at higher doses could also be secondary to acute effects of EQ, e.g. due to organ damage caused by EQ exposure. However, there were no mortalities linked to any dietary treatment during the study.</p><p>Excluding EQ 4 and EQ 5 exposed fish and focusing on dietary groups with similar feed intake, integration of data from proteomic and metabolomic screenings revealed distinct and consistent EQ-induced responses in livers of salmon exposed to 119 (EQ 2) and 1173 (EQ 3) mg EQ/kg feed compared to the control group (EQ 0); these were mainly related to changes in energy metabolism, redox homeostasis and purine/pyrimidine metabolism. For other effects, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211128.s007">S5A&#8211;S5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211128.s012">S10A&#8211;S10C</xref> Tables. Observed alterations in the fatty acid metabolism, such as e.g. reduced levels of diacylglycerols and carnitine, and elevated acetyl CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g002">Fig 2</xref>), suggested increased fatty acid &#946;-oxidation in fish exposed to EQ at doses higher than 1.22 mg/kg BW/day (EQ 2). The indications from altered metabolite levels were further supported by the bioinformatic pathway analysis of EQ-induced changes on the liver protein levels using IPA, which predicted an activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;), the master regulator of hepatic fatty acid &#946;-oxidation, from a significant overlap in the response compared to known targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), as well as (PPAR&#945;)/retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR&#945;) activation as an affected canonical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Furthermore, changes in individual metabolite levels displayed an elevation of glucose 6-phosphate and reduced phosphoenolpyruvate, along with significant increases in other glycolytic intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Consistently, functional annotations of altered protein levels in liver were preferentially related to metabolic processes as well as carbohydrate metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The observed changes may reflect a mobilization of hepatic glycogen stores but may also be due to a redirection of glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway, as revealed by the performed pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p><p>The pentose phosphate pathway utilizes glucose 6-phosphate to generate NADPH for biosynthetic reactions and Phase I metabolism of xenobiotics through the cytochrome P450 system. Indeed, induction of CYP1A1 and CYP3A mRNA was affected by dietary EQ indicating Phase I metabolism of EQ as shown by Bohne et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The decrease in pentose sugars and some of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediates may be indicative of a decrease in glucose supply or increased pathway activity to support the demand for NADPH that can be used to support detoxification reactions, which were consistently associated with the observed alterations in metabolite and protein levels in livers of EQ exposed salmon in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the effect of EQ treatment observed on plasma creatinine levels (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), hepatic creatinine levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Lowered plasma creatinine levels are commonly used as biomarker for renal dysfunction, but may also reflect declining hepatic functional capacity and alterations in hepatic energy metabolism. Taken together, the results from metabolomic and proteomic screening indicated that an increased energy expenditure in response to EQ exposure, perhaps due to the costs of detoxification or tissue repair [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Organ damage resulting from EQ exposure has previously been described for many different animals. High concentrations of EQ metabolites have been found in the liver of Atlantic salmon fed graded levels of EQ [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, EQ readily accumulates in the liver, which was shown to be a main target site of EQ-induced adverse effects in other species, as described in a Scientific opinion on safety and efficacy of EQ for all animal species published by EFSA in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In fish, reduced hepatosomatic indices were reported for large yellow croaker receiving 450 and 1350 mg EQ/kg feed for 10 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while Saxena et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that dietary exposure to 200 and 400 mg EQ/kg feed for 16 days increased the hepatosomatic index in turbot. Similar to previous findings in Atlantic salmon by Bohne et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in the present study EQ did not affect liver, spleen or heart weights relative to body size after 90 days exposure with the exception of fish exposed to EQ 5, which had a low feed intake throughout the study.</p><p>As seen from the histological evaluation of liver, kidney, and spleen in the present study, liver seemed to be the main organ for EQ toxicity in Atlantic salmon. Despite the absence of clear EQ-induced changes in relative liver weights, histological evaluation of liver sections in the present study showed a dose-dependent decrease in intracytoplasmic vacuolization at exposure to feed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg (EQ 2), which indicated a loss of cytoplasmic glycogen and/or lipid. While livertoxicity is more commonly associated with increased hepatocellular vacuolization [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the observed histopathological changes with a depletion of hepatocellular vacuoles were consistent with the induction of lipid and carbohydrate catabolic pathways in groups exposed to 119 (EQ 2) and 1173 (EQ 3) mg EQ/kg feed compared to the control group (EQ 0) as indicated from the results of the metabolomic/proteomic screening. Elevated energy expenditure in response to dietary EQ exposure was further corroborated by the observed dose-dependent decrease in lipid content in whole fish at doses above 119 mg EQ/kg (EQ 2). Other changes observed in the liver were moderate congestion and mild inflammatory infiltrate (mainly lymphocytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), although these findings seemed casual and not treatment-related. The number of mitosis/apoptosis observed was within the normal range and did not appear to be affected by the treatment, which does not seem to indicate increased cytotoxicity by EQ as previously described <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The metabolomic and proteomic screening indicated changes associated with redox-homeostasis mediated through increased utilization of glutathione (GSH). GSH is an important endogenous antioxidant that participates both directly and indirectly in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GSH may react directly with ROS with subsequent formation of glutathionyl radicals, but is also an electron donor for antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase where GSH is oxidized to GSSG. To maintain the levels of reduced GSH for continued antioxidant defense, a redox cycle is formed where GSSG is reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase using NADPH [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In line with previous evidence from a study in mice [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the canonical pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8</xref>) of salmon liver metabolome and proteome suggested that EQ activates the NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) signaling pathway, resulting, primarily, in an increase in the transcription of detoxifying enzymes such as certain glutathione-S transferase (GSTs) isoenzymes or NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1).</p><p>Quantitative analyses of GSH and GSSG (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) confirmed increased concentrations of GSH in livers of fish exposed to EQ at concentrations higher than 119 mg/kg feed (EQ 2), while increased concentrations of GSSG were observed in fish exposed to concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg feed (EQ 3). GSH is synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> via the SAM cycle and the trans-sulfuration pathway from the amino acids cysteine, glutamate and glycine. The first step is catalyzed by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). Oxidative stress increases the GCL activity to produce more GSH [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although a depletion of cellular GSH storage is more commonly used as a marker for oxidative stress, the observed shift in the cellular redox equilibrium may reflect compensatory induction of GSH biosynthesis and thus indicate a situation of oxidative stress. Indeed, a dose-dependent depletion of vitamin E was seen for EQ doses above 119 mg EQ/kg (EQ 2) for &#945;-tocopherol and above 0.5 mg EQ/kg (EQ 0) for &#947;-tocopherol. A consequence of reduced levels of vitamin E is a reduced capacity to protect against oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. A common method of detecting oxidative damage to lipids is by determining products of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde (MDA) using the TBARS assay [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Elevated levels of TBARS were found for EQ doses above 119 mg EQ/kg (EQ 2) indicating increased levels of MDA, though the TBARS method has been criticized for having low specificity for MDA detection [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Nevertheless, the findings were consistent with other markers of oxidative stress.</p><p>MDA has the capacity to impair several physiological mechanisms of the human body through its ability to react with molecules such as DNA and proteins. MDA can react with DNA and form nucleic acid adducts and are associated with a variety of pathological events [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the metabolomic screening, alterations in the purine and pyrimidine metabolism were found for all dietary inclusion levels of EQ for adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These alterations in pyrimidine and purine metabolism could imply an increased requirement for nucleotides for DNA or RNA repair due to oxidative stress. The formation of 8-hydroxy-2&#8217;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) is considered a predominant DNA alteration in oxidative DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, DNA damage can manifest in the formation of apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP or abasic) sites. EQ has been shown to induce chromosome aberrations including breaks, dicentrics, atypical translocated chromosomes and chromatid exchanges <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, in the present study no significant changes were observed in DNA oxidation in either of the two included biomarkers of DNA damage (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). On the other hand, adenine is also a precursor of several intermediates involved in energy metabolism; ATP, FAD, NADH and NADPH. However, the derived structures adenosine, AMP and ADP were not elevated in a dose-dependent manner and thus appeared not-treatment related. Conversely, the mono- and di-phosporylated forms of guanine nucleotide (GTP), which also serves as an energy source for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis, were decreased at dose levels above EQ 1, but not for EQ 5. Orotate, a precursor in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines, was elevated at doses above EQ 0, but no clear dose-related pattern could be seen for cytidine and uracil containing pyrimidines. Taken together, these changes could be related to the direct effects of EQ on purine and pyrimidine synthesis but might also be related to the altered activity of pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211128.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Given the observed changes in purine/pyrimidine metabolism, independent studies should address if these changes are due to genotoxic effects of EQ, increased cell proliferation, changes in repair mechanism, or are secondary to alteration in pentose phosphate pathway activity.</p><sec id="sec034"><title>Benchmark dose assessment and derivation of a safe upper intake level</title><p>The benchmark dose (BMD) approach was used to characterize toxicity risk and derive a reference point for the upper level of intake of EQ for salmon. Using the experimental data to model a dose-response relationship for an adverse outcome, low but detectable increases can be used to determine the dose threshold for a toxic effect. When deriving a reference point, the EFSA recommends to replace the traditionally used no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) with the 90% lower confidence limit of the BMD model (BMDL) [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the histopathological findings, metabolomic and proteomic screenings and a range of biomarkers were measured to evaluate the toxic mode of action for EQ. In 2017, the EFSA published a new guidance document, in which the difference between adverse effect, biomarkers of exposure or effect, and mode of action (MOA) were defined [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The use of biomarkers of exposure in an adverse effect assessement should be assessed cautiously since changes in biomarkers of effect do not necessarily reflect an adverse effect, but rather a result of homeostatic regulation or adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This is particularly true for&#8211;omics data; although useful for gaining new insights in mechanistic toxicology and generating hypotheses about disease pathways, their semi-quantitative nature calls for a conservative approach when using them in assessing severity of effects [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For this reason, BMD modelling was not performed for the&#8211;omics data. The use of biomarkers of effects that are related to EQ specific modes of toxic actions and occur prior to the development of overall adverse effect, are however relavant to use in assessing adverse effects in subchronic (30% of life time; 3 months) exposure studies.</p><p>The most significant responses observed in the present study were a perturbation of energy metabolism, induction of oxidative stress and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. All quantitative biomarkers, possibly representing an impairment of functional capacity (i.e. the hematological parameters, biomarkers of liver function and the biomarkers of oxidative stress), were subjected to BMD modelling. However, representing a manifestation of physiological effects, effects on the growth response and the morphological changes observed in the histopathological evaluation of spleen, kidney and liver in the present study were regarded the most biologically relevant effects [<xref rid="pone.0211128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and thus considered as critical endpoints for this study (<xref rid="pone.0211128.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Although the lowest BMDL was estimated for a decreased condition factor (k) (BMDL<sub>05</sub>: 0.8 mg EQ/kg BW/day), in addition to its high biological relevance, the &#8222;severe depletion of intracytoplasmic vacuoles&#8221;observed in the liver had the lowest BMDU/BMDL, and was thus the most reliable BMDL estimate. Hence, the BMDL<sub>10</sub> of 3.2 mg EQ/kg BW/day was considered the critical BMDL and is proposed as reference point for a safe upper exposure level of EQ in Atlantic salmon.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from the present study indicated that subchronic dietary exposure to concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed perturb hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, leading to a depletion of hepatic energy stores, which was associated with alterations in purine/pyrimidine metabolism in Atlantic salmon. EQ-induced effects were associated with presence of oxidative stress in the liver and activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response.</p><p>Although some changes in adaptive redox biomarkers were observed at lower doses, no signs of adverse effects were observed in Atlantic salmon exposed to feed concentrations below 119 mg EQ/kg feed. A critical BMDL<sub>10</sub> of 3.2 mg EQ/kg BW/day was established for the depletion of intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the liver as the critical endpoint in this study. The BMDL<sub>10</sub> corresponds to a feed concentration of around 240 mg EQ/kg. However, maximum surveyed EQ levels in fish feed show that this concentration is within the range of detected levels, thus warranting the control of the level EQ supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0211128.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Histopathological findings in kidney sections from Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic> L.) exposed to ethoxyquin (EQ) through their diet for 90 days.</title><p>Animals exposed to 0.47 mg EQ/kg (EQ 0; A) and 9666 mg EQ/kg (EQ 5; B) show presence of pigmented macrophages aggregates (PMAs) to a different degree.
