Here we show that UVR8 adopts multiple conformations to generate the signaling active state. The conformational diversity of UVR8 was revealed using a native mass spectrometry approach, where the photoreceptor was photoactivated in the ion source. Our analyses show that not only disordered but also ostensibly well-folded regions of UVR8 can adopt highly extended conformations that are likely to enhance interactions with partner proteins to facilitate signal propagation. The methodology employed could be used to investigate the structural dynamics of other proteins that are activated by light.</p></abstract><abstract><p>UVR8 is a plant photoreceptor protein that regulates photomorphogenic and protective responses to UV light. The inactive, homodimeric state absorbs UV-B light, resulting in dissociation into monomers, which are considered to be the active state and comprise a &#946;-propeller core domain and intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal tails. The C terminus is required for functional binding to signaling partner COP1. To date, however, structural studies have only been conducted with the core domain where the terminal tails have been truncated. Here, we report structural investigations of full-length UVR8 using native ion mobility mass spectrometry adapted for photoactivation. We show that, while truncated UVR8 photoconverts from a single conformation of dimers to a single monomer conformation, the full-length protein exists in numerous conformational families. The full-length dimer adopts both a compact state and an extended state where the C terminus is primed for activation. In the monomer the extended C terminus destabilizes the core domain to produce highly extended yet stable conformations, which we propose are the fully active states that bind COP1. Our results reveal the conformational diversity of full-length UVR8. We also demonstrate the potential power of native mass spectrometry to probe functionally important structural dynamics of photoreceptor proteins throughout nature.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>UVR8</kwd><kwd>native mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>ion mobility</kwd><kwd>plant photoreception</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">BB/L002655/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Alina Theisen</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Bruno Bellina</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Perdita E.

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) have been found to play a particularly important role in cell-signaling pathways, where the lack of structural order provides accessible and often versatile sites for binding to signaling partners and for posttranslational modification (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Consistent with this, it is becoming increasingly apparent that IDRs facilitate signal propagation following activation of photoreceptor proteins by environmental light cues (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The plant photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) serves as an illustrative example. It comprises a structurally well-defined seven-blade &#946;-propeller core domain (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) alongside what are predicted to be conformationally flexible C- and N-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the dark UVR8 adopts a homodimeric structure, which is stabilized by cross-dimer salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Absorption of UV-B light (280&#8211;315 nm) by chromophores made up of clusters of tryptophan residues at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) results in disruption of these salt bridges, which in turn leads to dissociation into monomers (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and accumulation of UVR8 in the nucleus (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although it is widely accepted that monomerization is necessary for UVR8 activation, it is now clear that the C-terminal tail is vital for subsequent signal transduction and for regulation of UVR8 function (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Structural features of the UVR8 photoreceptor.

Together they regulate over 100 genes involved in UV-B acclimation (e.g., biosynthesis of UV-absorbing flavonoids) and photomorphogenic responses such as suppression of hypocotyl growth (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The C terminus contains a highly conserved sequence of 27 amino acids (aa) (residues 397&#8211;423 of 440) that is known to be required not only for functional binding to COP1 but is also necessary and sufficient for binding to the REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS proteins, RUP1 and RUP2, which are negative regulators of UVR8 (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Indeed, expression of just the final 44 aa of the C terminus (residues 397&#8211;440) in plants is sufficient to trigger expression of the transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which mediates many of the responses triggered by UVR8 (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Despite these data supporting a functional role for the C-terminal IDR, little is known about the extent of disorder of the C terminus or about its structural dynamics and how they relate to the active state of UVR8. Crystal structures have been solved for the UVR8 core domain (residues 12&#8211;381, UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup>) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and have yielded significant mechanistic information regarding light-induced monomerization. In order for the protein to crystallize, however, it was necessary to truncate the N- and C-terminal tails, both implying structural disorder in these regions of UVR8 and precluding their detailed study. Here, we have acquired data of both UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> and full-length UVR8 using native ion mobility mass spectrometry instrumentation that incorporates illumination of the sample solution at the ion source. These data not only enable monitoring of the UV-B&#8211;induced dissociation of the UVR8 dimer but also reveal the conformational diversity of the full-length protein. We believe this method will prove to be a widely applicable and powerful technique with which to investigate both photoreceptor activation mechanisms and their signaling conformations.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>A Simple Optical Assembly Enables the Investigation of Photoreceptor Structural Dynamics by Native Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.</title><p>Native ion mobility mass spectrometry was used to investigate the photoactivation of UVR8 using a simple, versatile, and modular illumination assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). A high-power LED (25 mW, 350 mA; Thorlabs) emitting at a peak wavelength of 280 nm was mounted above the ion source. The output was focused onto the nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) tip of the ion source using convex lenses, allowing irradiation of the sample solution before desolvation and before it enters the mass spectrometer. This illumination assembly is compatible with a range of commercial spectrometers and has been used with spectrometers from three different manufacturers in this study (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). All known photoreceptor proteins are activated with wavelengths corresponding to the solar emission spectrum that reaches the Earth&#8217;s surface. This range (near UV&#8211;visible&#8211;near IR) is covered by inexpensive and readily available LEDs similar to the one used here. In principle, therefore, the illumination assembly can be straightforwardly adapted for investigation of the structural changes that follow photoactivation of all light-responsive proteins&#8212;and indeed many other photochemical reactions.</p><fig id="fig02" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Photo-ion mobility mass spectrometry.

The electric field axially drives ions through the drift cell while the buffer gas retards their motion via numerous collisions. The result is a temporal separation of ions based upon the interaction of that ion with the gas, which in turn is dependent on its shape and charge (z), which is recorded as an arrival time distribution. The arrival time distribution of any given ion can be converted to a collision cross-section (CCS) distribution (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The shape of this distribution for a species with a given nominal <italic>m/z</italic> is made up of the expected diffusion of the initial ion pulse as the ions traverse the cell as well as contributions from conformers or <italic>m/z</italic> coincident species, which may be higher-order oligomers or isomers. In general, a narrow drift time peak often relates to a compact and well-defined structure where broader distributions reveal the presence of more conformers and a more dynamic structure in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>The UVR8 Core Domain Exists in a Single Conformational Family.</title><p>Crystal structures have been solved for UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> where the N- and C-terminal tails were truncated from the full-length protein (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

These data strongly suggest that the compact and extended forms of the full-length UVR8 dimer do indeed reflect different conformational states of the terminal tails, in particular the C terminus (which is substantially longer than the N terminus). It is worth noting at this stage that the purpose of our MD simulations was to explore whether the measured CCS values can be accounted for by different conformations of the C- and N-terminal tails, which in the dimer they can. They were not intended to thoroughly explore the conformational space accessible to the different forms of UVR8, but rather to provide candidate geometries to compare with experimental data. We therefore do not necessarily expect these precise geometries to be among the most significant populations found in nature. Consistent with our interpretation, lowering the concentration of the sample from 5 &#956;M to &#8804;2.5 &#956;M results in an increase in the proportion of extended species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), and some variation in the compact-to-extended ratio could also be observed upon changing instrumentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9</ext-link>).

Much like the extended dimer, the z = 15+ to 32+ range for the full-length monomer comprises two subpopulations (with apexes at z = 19+ and z = 23+). Interestingly, the second population spans a very broad <sup>DT</sup>CCS<sub>He</sub> range (&#8764;1,000 &#197;<sup>2</sup>), which suggests the monomer is highly dynamic and exists in a range of conformational states.

The beginning of this process is evident in the representative structure of the extended monomer following MD simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>iv</italic>. The core domain is unconstrained during these simulations and is clearly becoming less well-ordered than in the dimer structures (both UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>Inset</italic> and full-length, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>ii</italic>), the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>, <italic>Inset</italic>), and the compact full-length monomer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>iii</italic>). It therefore appears that the homodimeric interface not only maintains the quaternary structure in the dark but also stabilizes the tertiary structure of the core domain in each full-length monomer. Because similar unfolding of the core domain is not evident in the monomer where the C and N termini have been truncated (i.e., the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>, <italic>Inset</italic>), we hypothesized that the extended IDRs of full-length UVR8 serve to destabilize the &#946;-propeller structure in the absence of the stabilizing cross-dimer interactions. Overall, we conclude from these data that the full-length UVR8 structure has access to conformations where one or more of the C and N termini are extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>ii</italic> and <italic>iv</italic>) and even the core, &#946;-propeller structure can adopt more extended states.

Interestingly, our data indicate that the UVR8 dimer is a highly stable state. To investigate this further, collisional activation before ion mobility (aIMS) of full-length UVR8 was conducted in the absence of UV-B light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Here, the drift time of a mass-selected charge state is measured as a function of trap collision voltage (i.e., activation energy). It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref> that the initial compact dimer structure of z = 19+ is stable up to an activation energy of &#8764;1,000 eV, after which there is a transition to longer drift times, which are consistent with a more extended dimer structure. A briefly stable, transitional distribution is evident at &#8764;1,300 eV which then unfolds further and remains stable up to 3,000 eV. The mass spectrum at this energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>Inset</italic>) reveals that whereas fragments corresponding to parts of the disordered tails are abundant in the spectrum no monomer is observed. These data follow a remarkably consistent pattern with the <sup>DT</sup>CCS<sub>He</sub> trend measured for the charge states of the full-length UVR8 dimer before photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5<italic>A</italic></ext-link>): a compact, stable conformation and a transitional configuration leading to a second stable, extended state. The remarkable resilience of the dimer form in the absence of light was also shown by collision-induced dissociation (CID) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>), with the terminal tails being fragmented under collision while the dimer interface remained intact (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S12</ext-link>).

The initial conformation is only stable up to an activation energy of &#8764;500 eV (compared with &#8764;1,000 eV for the compact dimer) and the subsequent transition is far more abrupt. Moreover, it transitions to drift times that are indicative of highly extended monomer conformations, consistent with the ion mobility data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figs. 4<italic>D</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5<italic>D</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). The aIMS data also suggest that there are two stable conformational families of highly extended monomer, whose drift times remain relatively constant as the laboratory frame energy is increased from &#8764;800 to &#8764;2,000 eV. This is supported by the native ion mobility data of the full-length monomer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>, where the two dominant populations of the extended monomer are present in the ions that present with z = 20+ to 24+ and 26+ to 30 +, respectively. In combination, the aIMS and ion mobility data of the full-length UVR8 monomer strongly suggest that, in the absence of the stabilizing cross-dimer interactions, the &#946;-propeller fold of the core domain becomes destabilized when the terminal tails are extended.</p><p>It should be noted again that the core of the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer, which lacks the IDRs, does not present with such conformational diversity of the core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). To test our previously stated hypothesis that the IDRs of UVR8, and in particular the longer C terminus, destabilize the tertiary structure of core domain in the full-length monomer, we conducted simulated unfolding of both the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> and full-length monomers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S13</ext-link>). These data confirm that the core domain of the full-length UVR8 monomer is substantially less stable than when the terminal tails are absent (i.e., for the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer). This is starkly illustrated by representative structures of the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>i</italic>) and full-length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>ii</italic>) monomers following these unfolding simulations. Whereas the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer remains well-folded, with little deviation from the &#946;-propeller fold of the published crystal structures (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), the core domain of the full-length UVR8 monomer has become significantly disordered.

It is highly likely, therefore, that water molecules are required for the successful photoactivation of UVR8. The interfacial region of each monomer is highly charged and the dimeric structure is maintained in the dark by cross-dimer salt bridges (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

SID of compact dimers (e.g., z = 19+ and 20+) results in an asymmetric dissociation pattern in the resulting monomer spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, orange panels), with many charge states of the monomer evident. Extended dimers (e.g., z = 25+ and 26+), however, give a symmetric dissociation pattern in the resulting monomer spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, purple panels) in which only a narrow range of charge states is produced. The broader charge-state distribution in the SID spectra resulting from the compact dimer state results from &#8220;scrambling&#8221; of charges along the interface. Such scrambling reflects the fact that more protons are transferred to one monomer of the dissociating dimer than to the other (hence the asymmetric charge distribution). Remarkably, what these data reveal is that the extended dimers dissociate into monomers much more readily than do the compact dimers, suggesting additional interactions between the monomers in the compact dimer. Indeed, MD simulations of the full-length dimer reveal a number of different H-bonding patterns are possible in the compact dimer between residues of the C-terminal tail that were missing in the published crystal structures (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and residues on the core domain of the opposite monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S15</ext-link>). Moreover, an asymmetric pattern suggests that there is a significant population of compact dimers where the number of interactions involving each C terminus is not equivalent, consistent with their predicted disorder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). By contrast, the extended dimers dissociate in a far more facile manner, which leads to a lower number of charge states in the dissociated monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, purple spectra).</p><fig id="fig06" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>SID of the UVR8 dimer in the gas phase.

Crystal structures of the core domain (UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup>) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reveal that photoexcitation of a pyramid of four tryptophan residues disrupts a network of salt bridges that stabilizes the homodimeric structure, leading to dissociation into monomers. We have shown here that the evolution of the dimer and monomer signals of UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> under UV-B illumination can be monitored using native ion mobility mass spectrometry, and that the decay of the former is correlated with the appearance of the latter. Furthermore, in the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> variant a single conformational family of dimers converts to a single conformational family of monomers (i.e., both are well-folded structures).</p><p>By contrast, we have revealed that full-length UVR8 possesses considerable conformational diversity, which is likely to be necessary for functional binding to signaling components. Full-length UVR8 and COP1 interact in the nucleus following UV-B illumination both <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and in protein extracts (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> can also monomerize, accumulate in the nucleus (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and then interact with COP1 (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), it is missing a highly conserved 27-residue region of the C terminus (C27) that is required for the binding to be functional. We show that the full-length UVR8 dimer exists in two main conformational families, one compact and one extended, with a transitional state between them. The compact and extended forms of the dimer are defined by different conformational states of the intrinsically disordered terminal tails, in particular the longer C terminus, and the extended form is far more conformationally diverse. Access to extended conformations is consistent with published size-exclusion chromatography, where the full-length dimer elutes at an apparent molecular mass of &#8764;150 kDa (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (cf. the sequence mass of &#8764;100 kDa), and with small-angle X-ray scattering analysis (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The fact that we observe two main populations of compact and extended forms and not a continuum of states suggests there is at least an element of order to the C-terminal flexibility. Consistent with this, our MD simulations of the compact dimer reveal these conformations are likely to be stabilized by interactions between the C terminus of one monomer and the core domain of the opposite monomer. Moreover, previous modeling of the C terminus suggested that residues 400&#8211;421 and 432&#8211;440 are likely to be &#945;-helical, with the remaining, unfolded residues predicted to be flexible (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of UV illumination the UVR8 homodimeric structure is very stable. Indeed, we show that the dimer remains intact following CID, despite the C- and N-terminal tails undergoing fragmentation. This is consistent with that fact that unboiled samples of the isolated protein in solution remain dimeric in the dark even under the denaturing conditions of SDS/PAGE (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Remarkably, we further reveal that in the gas phase even UV-B illumination is insufficient to cause significant dimer dissociation. This observation suggests that photoconversion to monomers is likely to proceed in two stages. First, photoexcitation in solution triggers disruption of the cross-dimer salt bridges, causing initial separation of the monomers. Second, water molecules surrounding the homodimer and within the central, water-filled tunnel (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) are required to enter the interfacial space to shield the salt bridge partners from one another and thus enable the monomers to separate completely. These water molecules will mostly be absent in the gas phase and are therefore not available in sufficient numbers to stop the salt bridges from reforming. We found that SID provided sufficient energy to cause the dimer to dissociate into monomers in the gas phase. SID is equivalent to a substantial increase in temperature, which is consistent with boiling of unilluminated aqueous samples of dimer being necessary to produce monomers on SDS/PAGE (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). SID also reveals that the extended dimer converts to monomers more readily than the compact dimers do. This may well be owing to the additional interactions evident between the C terminus of one monomer and the core domain of the other monomer in the compact form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S15</ext-link>). The extended dimer conformation could therefore represent a state &#8220;primed&#8221; for activation, leading to a monomeric form with an extended C terminus that is ready for functional interaction with COP1.</p><p>The UVR8/COP1 interaction is UV-B&#8211;dependent (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and the dimer with an extended C terminus is therefore not sufficient to facilitate this interaction. Based on this, both dissociation into monomers and access to the extended conformations of the C terminus that we observe are the minimum requirement for functional binding and therefore signal transduction. Much like for the full-length dimer, and in contrast to the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer, the native mass spectrum and ion mobility data for the full-length monomer reveal numerous conformational states. These are consistent with a single compact form, a transitional state, and two highly extended, but nevertheless stable, states. In contrast to the full-length dimer, the extended monomeric states cannot be accounted for by extended conformations of the C and N termini alone, and also require unfolding of the &#946;-propeller structure of the core domain. Extended monomer conformations are consistent with published in vivo data; an additional band appears above the presumably compact monomer on SDS/PAGE of unboiled protein extracts from <italic>Arabidopsis uvr8-1&#8211;</italic>expressing GFP-UVR8 variants (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This band increases in intensity with UV-B illumination of GFP-UVR8, is present but unresponsive to UV-B in the constitutive monomer GFP-UVR8<sup>R286A</sup>, and is apparently not detected for the constitutive dimer GFP-UVR8<sup>W285F</sup>. All of these trends are consistent with our data. Although one might expect that the adoption of such highly extended conformations would make the UVR8 monomer more susceptible to degradation in vivo, this seems not to be the case (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Highly extended monomeric states suggest that the cross-dimer salt bridges not only serve to stabilize the homodimeric structure in full-length UVR8 but also the &#946;-propeller structure of the core domain. We show that the presence of the terminal tails, and in particular the longer C terminus, destabilizes the core fold in the absence of the cross-dimer interactions. It has been previously demonstrated that COP1 interacts not only with the C terminus of UVR8 but also with the UVR8 core domain (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We therefore propose that in order for the rather large COP1 protein (658 residues) (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to successfully interact with the UVR8 core domain the latter must unfold to a highly extended conformation. To achieve full, functional binding with COP1, it appears that the intrinsically disordered C terminus not only interacts directly with COP1 but also serves as an &#8220;intramolecular allosteric effector&#8221; (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) that enables the core domain to form additional, stabilizing protein&#8211;protein interactions. Such a role in allosteric control is analogous to those reported recently for IDRs in the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription factor (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and similar systems where allosteric mechanisms reflect changes to the ensemble-average structure of proteins (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Indeed, similar to GR, the full-length UVR8 homodimer appears to be in a state of &#8220;energetic frustration&#8221; (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) where the destabilizing effect of the C terminus on the core domain is negated by the stabilizing effect of the cross-dimer interactions. The balance of these opposing forces is then tipped toward the destabilizing effect of the C terminus IDR upon light-activated dimer dissociation.</p><p>It is possible that light plays a dual role in this regard. Dynamic crystallography of UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> reported partial unwinding of the &#946;-propeller fold in response to UV-B (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which appears to be driven by motions in blades 5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), which contain the key residues of the chromophore, W285 and W233, respectively. In combination with our data, this suggests that structural rearrangement of the core domain is triggered by light not only to effect dimer dissociation but also to actively trigger destabilization of the core fold. In support of this proposal are data from the W285A variant, which is a photoinactive constitutive monomer. It interacts functionally with COP1 in vivo (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but this interaction is not as strong as that of WT UVR8 (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) because it only does so via its C terminus (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This is consistent with one role of photoactivation&#8217;s being to trigger the unwinding of the &#946;-propeller core. Further, one cannot rule out the possibility that full activation of UVR8 is a two-photon process, with the second photon absorbed by the monomers to effect a more complete unfolding of the core structure. Consistent with this notion, experiments with a monomeric but photoactive double mutant of UVR8 (D96N/D107N) show that the monomer is able to absorb UV-B and initiate responses in vivo, indicating that dimer photoreception is not essential for UVR8 function (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>We thus propose a predictive mechanism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref> that is consistent with our data and the discussion above. The compact and extended UVR8 dimers represent different conformations of the disordered C- and N-terminal tails and are in equilibrium. Photoexcitation of the tryptophan chromophore disrupts the cross-dimer salt bridges and triggers both dimer dissociation and unwinding of the core domain. Dissociation occurs preferentially from the extended dimer and requires water molecules to enter the intermonomer space to shield salt bridge partners from one another. The C terminus in the resulting extended monomers is thus both available for functional interaction with COP1 and serves to further destabilize the core domain to yield highly extended conformations. A two-step mechanism has previously been proposed for subsequent interaction between the UVR8 monomer and COP1 (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>): a stabilizing interaction between COP1 and the UVR8 core domain followed by interaction between COP1 and UVR8 C terminus. Here we propose that for the initial stabilizing interaction to take hold the UVR8 monomer must adopt a highly extended conformation. The entropic loss on forming this interaction from a more extended state may be enthalpically compensated by a very specific interaction with COP1, or may lead to so-called fuzzy interactions (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) at several sites on the receptor.</p><fig id="fig07" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Predictive mechanisms of the protein interactions that mediate UVR8 signaling and regulation.

Presumably RUP needs to displace COP1 to repress UVR8 function, which they could achieve through competitive binding to the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). The RUP proteins could then help bring the UVR8 monomers back together while mitigating the destabilizing influence of the C terminus and enabling the cross-dimer interactions to promote refolding of the &#946;-propeller core. The question has also been asked about whether it is necessary for the RUP proteins to disassociate from UVR8 following reassembly of the homodimer and during subsequent rounds of photoactivation (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref> offers one possible mechanism whereby docking of COP1 to the extended core domain might facilitate displacement of the RUP proteins should they indeed remain bound.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Conclusions and Outlook</title><p content-type="flushleft">Organisms throughout nature respond to their ambient light environment through the action of photoreceptor proteins, with functions as various as shade avoidance by plants, neuronal gating, and circadian photoentrainment. In most cases, absorption of light results in structural changes in the protein that enable interaction with signaling partners. Such interactions are often mediated by disordered regions. We have demonstrated the power of native mass spectrometry to elucidate the conformational diversity of the plant UV photoreceptor UVR8. In addition to monitoring the well-described light-triggered changes to quaternary structure, this approach enabled us to detail the different conformations of the flexible N- and C-terminal tails and how these IDRs influence the structure of the core domain in preparation for signaling. These data also serve as a good example not only of how IDRs are important for signaling interactions but also of how the conformation of ostensibly well-folded, highly stable domains can and do change according to functional requirements. Over recent years, native ion mobility mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful technique with which to &#8220;capture the repertoire of conformational states adopted by protein assemblies&#8221; (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) from a wide variety of biological systems. The experimental approach described here makes use of a simple illumination setup that can be adapted straightforwardly to investigate the structural dynamics of any photoreceptor protein. Moreover, the versatility of photoreceptor function means that they are commonly reengineered as optogenetic tools to enable spatiotemporal control over target processes in biology using light. The approach employed here should also prove a powerful addition to the range of techniques with which to investigate, understand, and optimize the structural dynamics important to optogenetic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Protein Expression and Purification.</title><p>The genes that encode full-length UVR8 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (residues 1&#8211;440) and the variant where the C and N termini are truncated (leaving residues 12&#8211;381, UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup>) were cloned into a modified pET28a (Novagen) expression vector using NcoI and NotI, to provide N-terminal 7xHis and Strep II affinity tags, and expressed as SUMO fusion proteins as described previously (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

Crucially, for both the full-length monomer and dimer two methods were used to generate an extended form&#8212;using solvated and gas phase dynamics from different starting points&#8212;which resulted in similar <sup>Th</sup>CCS<sub>He</sub> values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Figs.

All simulations used a 10-&#197; cutoff for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, the lincs algorithm (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) for bond constraints, a 2-fs time step, particle mesh Ewald electrostatics, and periodic boundary conditions. The system setup was as follows: (<italic>i</italic>) The protein was placed in a solvation box of minimum 12 &#197; around the protein and counter ions were added and (<italic>ii</italic>) energy minimization was carried out and the system was thermalized at 300 K for 100 ps with constant pressure and 100 ps with pressure coupling (using the Parrinello&#8211;Rahman barostat), with constraints on the protein. All subsequent MD simulations in solvent were carried out using pressure coupling. First, 50 ns of conventional MD simulations were run, followed by 20 ns of simulated annealing to encourage additional conformational sampling, with the following 1.25-ns cycles: 1 ns at 300 K, 50 ps of heating to 350 K and 150 ps at 350 K, and 50 ps of cooling to 300 K. To analyze the hydrogen bonding patterns between UVR8 monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S15</ext-link>), we ran additional MD simulations starting from the structure at the end of 20 ns of annealing. Running simulations with different starting velocities allows for greater sampling, so we ran two 80-ns simulations, one using the velocities from the end of the annealing simulation and the other randomized velocities, as shown in shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S15</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Calculating the Theoretical CCS (<sup>Th</sup>CCS<sub>He</sub>).</title><p>To obtain structures for CCS calculations, gas phase simulations were run at 310 K. These were run using double-precision Gromacs 4.6.1 (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) using twin range cut-offs for electrostatic interactions, infinite coulombic and van der Waals cut-offs (technically 999.0 nm), and a 2-fs time step. The setup consisted of energy minimization followed by 50 ps of thermalization at 250, 280, 290, and 300 K. For the UVR8<sup>12&#8211;381</sup> monomer and dimer, the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 4dnw) was used as the starting point. For the full-length monomer and dimer, the starting point was the I-TASSER model after the 20-ns simulated annealing described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s17"><italic>Constructing an Initial Model of Full-Length UVR8</italic></xref>. CCS values were calculated using EHSSrot (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

This structure was then relaxed for 20 ns using the same annealing procedure as described above for the compact dimer, which was sufficient for convergence of the radius of gyration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7<italic>E</italic></ext-link>). The resulting structure was taken as a starting point for generating gas phase structures for calculating CCS values for the dimer as well as the monomer. To test the effect of maximally extending the C-terminal region of the dimer and monomer, the C terminus was pulled during gas phase simulations (since the water box would be prohibitively large for the fully extended state) at a rate of 0.02 &#197;/ns for 10 ns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813254116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S11 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></ext-link>). Here, position constraints were applied to the core structure, as otherwise partial unfolding of the protein was observed (presumably, unfolding the C terminus in the gas phase requires significantly more energy than in solution).
