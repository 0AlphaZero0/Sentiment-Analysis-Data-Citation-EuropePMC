After an incubation period of 10&#8211;14&#8201;days, measles is characterized by respiratory infection symptoms such as fever (38&#8201;&#176;C), cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a maculopapular rash and high fever (39&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C). Measles complications which include pneumonia, diarrhea, vomiting and encephalitis are more common among children under five years old and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The measles virus&#8217; genetic phylogeny is divided into 8 clades (A-H) and subdivided into 24 genotypes based on the diversity of the C-terminal hypervariable domain (a 456 nucleotide sequence) of the nucleoprotein gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Measles is one of the most infectious diseases with a high mortality rate worldwide. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a molecular surveillance of measles strains and established a vaccination program for measles elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2010, the World Health Assembly planned to increase routine coverage with the first dose of measles vaccine for children aged one year old to &#8805;90% nationally and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;80% in every district, reduce and maintain annual measles incidence at &lt;&#8201;5 cases per million and reduce mortality by 95% from a 2000 estimate in order to reach eradication by 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. From 2000 to 2015, the number of measles cases reported annually worldwide decreased by 70%, from 853,479 to 254,928 cases, and measles incidence decreased by 75%, from 146 to 36 cases per million population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. From 2000 to 2016, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths. Global measles deaths have decreased by 84% from an estimated 550,100 in 2000 to 89,780 in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on reducing measles deaths, and yet from 2016 to 2017, more than 66,000 laboratory-confirmed measles cases have been reported from the different regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, several reports concluded that measles continued to spread across many countries because the vaccination coverage was sub-optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In Gabon, several outbreaks of measles were reported, especially in 1984, 1992 and 2001, of which 7234, 1245 and 5129 reported cases occurred, respectively.

In 2012, WHO set up supplementary measles immunization activities nationwide in Gabon in children aged 9&#8201;months &#8722;&#8201;5&#8201;years old in order to protect children who did not respond to the first measles vaccination. This program reached 168,769 (67%) children in the targeted age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A study performed on clinical specimens collected during the 1984 measles outbreak in Libreville, the capital of Gabon, showed that the strains investigated belonged to genotype B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

In Central Africa, Cameroon reported the endemic circulation of the B3 MeV genotype between 2010 and 2011 and during a recent measles outbreak in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In Gabon, this study is the first to describe the circulation of genotype B3. Data on measles outbreaks showed circulation of genotype B2 in 1984 in the capital Libreville. Furthermore, several suspected patients were reported in Libreville and Oyem (Northern Gabon) in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However there was no data available on the molecular characterization of these strains. In this study, more than half of the positive cases were children under five years old, suggesting that vaccination coverage is not sufficient. The vaccination program in Gabon provides one dose of vaccine between 9 and 12&#8201;months old, and the second dose should be administered at 18&#8201;months. The 6 children under 9&#8201;months old accounted for 13% of positive measles cases. This finding suggests that these young children did not have maternal antibodies and they were susceptible to measles infection until they received the first dose of vaccine. Among these 6 children, 4 were aged 5&#8211;6&#8201;months. Considering that maternal immunity should last 4&#8211;6&#8201;months, it would seem that the mothers of these 4 children might also be unprotected and susceptible to measles. A study mentioned that the high rate among young infants suggested low prevalence of maternal measles antibodies due to a large number of measles-susceptible mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More than half of the children aged 6 to 14&#8201;years old and the adults infected with the measles virus had received only one dose of vaccine. Our results are compatible with studies describing outbreaks showing that measles is likely endemic until a vaccination coverage of at least 95% is reached in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Measles was most frequently confirmed in suspected cases aged 15&#8201;years and over. Our results are compatible with those of Namibian and Chinese studies showing that the highest age incidence occurred among young adults and infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">There were no significant differences in measles symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated laboratory-confirmed cases for cough, coryza, rash and vomiting. However, there was an inversely proportional relationship between high fever and vaccination status. High fever (39&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C) was most frequent in unvaccinated patients. Likewise, the percentage of patients with diarrhea was highest among unvaccinated cases and lowest among patients who had received two doses. A less severe symptom profile in these latter cases could probably be due to a secondary failure of the vaccination. The severity of the disease seemed to depend on the vaccination status and the immunity of the patient. One review mentioned that mild form of measles could be observed in subjects with higher immunity to the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The fact that the number of laboratory&#8211;confirmed cases continue to spread despite vaccination could probably be due to the fact that vaccination coverage was sub-optimal, as is the case in many countries of the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Failure in vaccine protection may not be due to the circulating genotype but to the number of vaccine doses received. Indeed, children who received only one dose of vaccine develop measles due to vaccine failures (as expected in 10% of cases). A second dose of vaccine to all children would reduce the expected vaccine failure rate to around 1%. The measles virus only has one serotype. As a result, the anti-measles immune response protects against the disease regardless of the genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Among the 36 sequences from patients infected with the measles virus, 10 strains displayed one or two nucleotides difference. These 10 strains that have been compared with the WHO measles surveillance network (MeaNS) formed a cluster belonging to genotype B3. According to the World Health Organization, the global distribution of the measles genotype from 2010 to 2015 revealed that the B3 genotype was spread worldwide. However, this genotype is endemic and the most frequent reported on the African continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Molecular characterization of MeV strain from Nigeria and Ghana suggested that clade B was prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In Gabon, data showed that the B2 genotype was the only once circulating in 1984 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The B2 genotype seemed to disappear in the 2000s and was declared inactive by WHO in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The insufficient molecular surveillance of measles in Central Africa could explain these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, several studies reported evidence of the continued circulation of B2 on the African continent, in South Africa (2002), Angola (2003), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, a co-circulation of the B2 and B3.1 genotypes of the measles virus in the Central African Republic was reported in the 2000 measles epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the last 10&#8201;years, most studies reported the circulation of genotype B3, particularly B3.1, in Central Africa, especially in Cameroon between 2010 and 2011, and then in 2014. Our finding was consistent with the results which reported the circulation of the B3 genotype in Central Africa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">The syndromic surveillance of infectious diseases allowed us to describe a measles outbreak which occurred from April to June 2017 in the Haut- Ogooue province, in Gabon. Measles was commonly confirmed in patients who had received one dose of vaccine, due to the expected failure rate of around 10%. Molecular characterization of the strains showed the circulation of the B3 genotype, the same strain circulating in several neighboring countries.</p><p id="Par31">These data enhanced our knowledge on the measles virus strains circulating in Gabon and suggest that surveillance and molecular investigation of measles strains should be pursued to better understand the burden of measles outbreaks. Following this epidemic, the Gabonese Ministry of Health immediately set up a vaccination program.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>MeV</term><def><p id="Par5">Measles virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par6">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We acknowledge He&#239;di Lan&#231;on for the English revision of the manuscript.
