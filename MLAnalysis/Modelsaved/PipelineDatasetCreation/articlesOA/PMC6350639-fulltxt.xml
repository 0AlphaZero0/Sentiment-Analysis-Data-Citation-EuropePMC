Daily patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments included daytime and night-time symptoms reported previously,<xref rid="b14-jaa-12-021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-jaa-12-021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> as well as daytime and night-time rescue medication use; night-time awakenings requiring rescue medication; activity limitations, activity avoidance, need to self-pace during activities; and perceived tiredness. Content of the Asthma Daily Diary was informed by a previously reported patient interview study that indicated these concepts were salient, distinct, and variable.<xref rid="b3-jaa-12-021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The Asthma Daily Diary was completed in the morning upon awakening and evening before going to bed from the evening of the screening visit to the last morning of the treatment period (SIROCCO, week 48; CALIMA, week 56). Night-time rescue medication use and night-time awakenings requiring rescue medication were recorded in the morning diary, whereas daytime rescue medication use, activity impairments, and perceived tiredness were captured in the evening diary.</p><p>Patient responses to the three activity impairment questions and the perceived tiredness item were captured using a 5-point categorical response scale of 0&#8211;4, in which 0 indicated no limitation/none of the time and 4 indicated totally limited/all of the time. Rescue medication use was recorded as the total number of puffs used in each recall period (night-time and daytime). Daily rescue medication use was the sum of the two daily measures. Night-time awakening requiring rescue medication use was assessed with a yes (1)/no (0) response. Baseline for daily measures was the 10-day period before randomization at week 0. Daily assessments were summarized as biweekly means if &#8805;7 of 14 daily assessments were available. On days 3 and 7, 3-day and 7-day averages were calculated if &#8805;2 and &#8805;4 daily assessments were available, respectively. Night-time awakening requiring rescue medication use was calculated as the percentage of nights with awakening requiring rescue medication use during the summary time periods (ie, 3 days, 7 days, and 2 weeks). Outcome measures consisted of changes in biweekly mean item scores from baseline to EOT and changes in mean item scores from baseline to days 1, 3, and 7 of the study. Analyses were performed for patient populations with BECs &#8805; and &lt; 300 cells/&#181;L and &#8805; and &lt; 150 cells/&#181;L.

This set included all randomized patients who received any study treatment and continued participation in the study, regardless of protocol adherence. Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 and above (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>Each PRO measure was compared across treatment arms from baseline to EOT for patients in the pooled data set using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures analysis, with adjustments for treatment, study code, baseline value, region, oral corticosteroids use, visit, and treatment &#215; visit. For days 1, 3, and 7 analyses, comparisons across treatment arms used analysis of covariance, with adjustments for treatment, study code, baseline value, oral corticosteroid use, and geographic region. Least squares (LS) means, treatment differences in LS means, 95% confidence intervals, and <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated. Because these analyses were not part of the formal testing strategy, all <italic>P</italic>-values were nominal. To account for the 2:1 stratification for baseline BECs (&#8805;300 and &lt;300 cells/&#181;L) in analyses for all patients, patients with baseline BECs &lt;300 cells/&#181;L were reweighted using the ratio of the number of patients with baseline BECs &#8805;300 cells/&#181;L to the number of those who had counts &lt;300 cells/&#181;L.

First, this post hoc analysis was not designed to compare daily PRO changes between different BEC groups or the two benralizumab treatment cohorts. Second, improvements for patients in the placebo group may be explained by their participation in a clinical trial. Patients in clinical trials receive more intensive treatment and are closely monitored. Also, being in a clinical trial may, from a psychological aspect, positively influence a patient&#8217;s perceived tiredness and activity impairment.
