Voltage-gated sodium channels from <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> are differentially sensitive to pyrethroids. In both bee species, the level of neuronal activity played an important role in their relative sensitivity to pyrethroids.

Deactivation of the voltage-gated sodium channels, mainly directed by K<sub>oB</sub> was affected in both species, giving rise to this slow-deactivating tail current, but <italic>Am</italic> was more sensitive by a factor ~7 (q values of 17,000 and 2,200 for <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic>, respectively). Important changes in the forward and backward rates to fast inactivation (transition from O to If) were also recorded: the forward transition (O to If, r) was decreased by factors 1,300 and 2,500 for <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic>, (r&#8201;=&#8201;7 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> and 5 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>), respectively, with no major difference between the two species; the reverse transition (If to O, s) was almost unaffected in <italic>Am</italic> (a decrease by a factor 2, i.e. s&#8201;=&#8201;0.5), but markedly impacted by a factor greater than 25000 (s&#8201;=&#8201;3.8 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>) in <italic>Bt</italic>. The slow pore-dependent inactivation (Is) can develop either from the Open state (O, Slow inactivation Mode 1) or the fast inactivated state (If<sub>,</sub> Slow inactivation Mode 2). The changes in the forward and backward transition rates to Slow inactivation Mode 1 produced by tetramethrin (factors t and u, respectively) were of minor amplitude, and not dramatically different between the two species (t&#8201;=&#8201;0.2 and 1.13, u&#8201;=&#8201;0.15 and 8.8 for <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic>, respectively).

Furthermore, since, we did not see any difference between the two bee species in terms of the total amount of sodium charges (Qtot, see Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) we wondered whether the level of neuronal activity can differentially influence that parameter in the two species. Using the Markovian model, we simulated an increase in the neuronal activity by increasing the number of depolarizing pulses to 50 while keeping the frequency at 13&#8201;Hz. This exacerbated the differences between <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> that were first seen during the smaller train of depolarizations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). With tetramethrin, the amplitude of the tail current decreased and was nullified rapidly in <italic>Am</italic> whereas in <italic>Bt</italic>, the amplitude of the tail current gradually decreased upon the first ten consecutive depolarizations then it reached a plateau. As with our experimental data (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), the tail current generated with the Markovian model decayed much slower in <italic>Bt</italic> than in <italic>Am</italic>. We also noticed a large increase in the total sodium charges (Qtot, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). As compared to 10 pulses, Qtot in the presence of tetramethrin was increased by factors 5 and 7.5 in <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic>, respectively, when we increased the number of depolarizations to 50. All the above does suggest two different modes of action, with a rapid inhibition of functional channels in the case of <italic>Am</italic>, while the channels in <italic>Bt</italic> are still active. In the latter case, sodium channels will still end-up completely inactivated in non-voltage-clamp conditions due to massive entry of sodium into neurons, and the consecutive strong depolarization of the neuron. Using extracted Kcpyr and Kopyr dissociation constants, we simulated an increase in ligand concentration and constructed a concentration-dependent increase in Qtot in both bee species. The EC50 values obtained from these curves were 0.97&#8201;&#181;M for <italic>Am</italic> and 0.47&#8201;&#181;M for <italic>Bt</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). The small leftward shift of the curve and the higher Qtot values in <italic>Bt</italic> suggest a greater sensitivity of the bumblebee sodium channels to tetramethrin than those from honey bee.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Effect of an increase in neuronal activity in the presence of tetramethrin.

Esfenvalerate is a type II pyrethroid used in orchards for protection against beetles and lepidopterans among others. In the presence of esfenvalerate, the sodium peak current amplitude decreased after one depolarization by 44&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8% (Wilcoxon match paired rank test, n&#8201;=&#8201;8; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0078) in <italic>Am</italic> and by 28&#8201;&#177;&#8201;24% (n&#8201;=&#8201;3; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.5) in <italic>Bt</italic>. This decrease was amplified by repeated depolarizations (13&#8201;Hz) in <italic>Am</italic> (Mann- Whitney, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0011) and no species-wise difference was observed since the remaining sodium current at the tenth depolarization was 45&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4% (n&#8201;=&#8201;8) and 54&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14% (n&#8201;=&#8201;3) for <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic>, respectively (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.6303; Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). We then calculated the percentage modified channels in esfenvalerate-exposed neurons. Again, we did not detect any significant species-wise difference (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). In both species, esfenvalerate modified significantly less voltage-gated sodium channels than tetramethrin and the difference between tetramethrin and esfenvalerate was more pronounced with <italic>Am</italic> (see Supplementary Figure&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

The homology in the sodium channels amino acids sequences between the two bee species is 98%, with most of the differences restricted to the intracellular loops between domains I-II and III-IV and S4 from domain III (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These locations may not be critical for channel permeability, but could be involved in some aspects of the channel gating. However, sodium channels from <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> have very similar biophysical properties under control conditions, suggesting that in the absence of pyrethroids, the differences in amino acids sequences do not impact the channel activity in a significant way.We compared the cellular efficiency of representative pyrethroids on <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> to explore their differential effects on bee species. For this purpose, esfenvalerate was chosen because it is currently used in agriculture (including in the EU) so that <italic>Apis</italic> and <italic>Bombus</italic> have a similar risk to be exposed to it. It possesses a phenoxyphenyl radical just like 85% of pyrethroids authorized in Europe (this radical is involved in the molecular interaction with sodium channels) and it has a unique chlorobenzyle radical (a property it shares with no other pyrethroid, except the tau-fluvalinate molecule). In addition, it is a type II pyrethroid since it has a cyanide radical (-CN), and it induces specific type II toxicological symptoms in insects. Importantly, its persistence in the field is intermediate (DT50 of 19 days, as compared with 3.5 days for tau-fluvalinate according to the PPDB database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>) and its toxicity for bees is quite high (LD50 equals 0.06&#8201;&#181;g/bee). The other molecule we have selected &#8211; tetramethrin - is a type I pyrethroid (no cyanide radical) inducing type I toxicological symptoms and it possesses the dimethylcyclopropane radical, an important toxophore in 70% of authorized pyrethroids, involved in the molecular interaction with sodium channels. Whilst tetramethrin has been withdrawn (not approved anymore for field use in the EU, but may be used elsewhere around the world), i) it is probably one of the most canonical pyrethroids initially used to characterize the mode of action of this insecticide class on neurons (works from the group of Narahashi) and ii) it is still widely used in household aerosol insecticides, as it is very efficient and with a rapid action on wasps and hornets (instantaneous knockdown), iii) its toxicity for honey bees is pretty high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">During pyrethroids perfusion, channels from both species were affected in their slow inactivation and deactivation kinetics with a pronounced slowing of these two parameters. Channels from both species were also more sensitive to tetramethrin (a type I pyrethroid) than to esfenvalerate (a type II pyrethroid) with regard to the percentage of modified channels. Conversely, the esfenvalerate-induced tail current decayed slower than the tetramethrin-induced tail current, which is consistent with the properties of type I pyrethroids, known to induce a faster decaying tail current than type II pyrethroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Besides these qualitative similarities in between the two species, experimental recordings revealed however profound interspecific differences in the behaviour of the channels of these two species when challenged with tetramethrin. Indeed, the percentage of modified channels by tetramethrin was higher in <italic>Am</italic> neurons than in <italic>Bt</italic> neurons, but on the contrary, the slowing of the deactivation tail current was more pronounced in <italic>Bt</italic>. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, the honey bee sodium channels are differentially sensitive to fenvalerate and permethrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which concurs with our present results with tetramethrin and esfenvalerate. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, 10&#8201;&#181;M tau-fluvalinate modified 50% of AmNa<sub>V</sub> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and ~55% of <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> after a 100-pulses protocol. This suggests that <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> are equally susceptible to tau-fluvalinate. Interestingly, the group of Dong showed evidence that <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> Na<sub>V</sub>s were less sensitive to etofenprox (1&#8201;&#181;M), another synthetic pyrethroid, than Na<sub>V</sub>s from cockroach, fruit fly and mosquito<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, a result which concurs with our results showing differential effects of tetramethrin on <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> neurons.</p><p id="Par19">The computer modelling allowed us to confirm our experimental data and detect differences in the kinetics parameters of the sodium channel that were harder to notice using conventional analysis. We were able to evaluate both the changes in the kinetics parameters produced by the drug and the differences in the response between the two bee species. Transitions rates from the Open state were the most affected in the two bee species with striking differences in the kinetics parameters governing the deactivation (O to C, q), the slow inactivation Mode 2 (If to Is, v) and the recovery from fast inactivation (If to O, s). In addition to the deactivation, the most outstanding difference between the two species is undoubtedly the recovery from fast inactivation, which is almost not affected in <italic>Am</italic>, but decreased by 25,000 in <italic>Bt</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The functional effect of the drugs over longer stimulations was clearly different in the two species. In <italic>Am</italic>, the cumulative decrease of the amplitude of the tail current probably due to slow inactivation (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> for instance) and the rapid decay of that tail current led to a rapid extinction of channel activity. In <italic>Bt</italic>, despite the slow inactivation of the sodium current, the plateau-like decay of the tail current allows sodium channels to remain active during the period of the stimulation. In physiological situation, the larger amount of sodium ions entering the neurons in <italic>Bt</italic> may produce a stronger membrane depolarization, and thus a rapid inactivation of the sodium channels. Therefore, albeit the functional effect at the channel level <italic>per se</italic> appears quite different between the two species one can speculate that the final result in both cases will be a neuronal depolarization ending up with sodium channel inactivation and blockade of action potential propagation. The amino acids sequences of the sodium channels from the two species are perfectly conserved in the putative pyrethroids binding sites (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>), but the non-conservation of some amino acids residues in helices S2, S3 and S4 of the domain III between <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> sodium channels (see Supplementary Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) may in part explain these functional differences. These data suggest that the structure of the pyrethroids binding site within the channel pore is probably not the only factor modulating the effect of the drugs. Amino acid variations in regions distant from the putative pyrethroids binding site may for instance decrease the accession of the molecule to its binding site within the channel, induce changes in some gating parameters affecting the efficiency, but not the affinity of the drug, or affect, <italic>via</italic> long-distance allosteric mechanisms the binding site.</p><p id="Par20">Although the percentage of modified channels is the traditional way of estimating the effects of pyrethroids on voltage-gated sodium channels, it is mainly related to channel affinity for pyrethroids and other factors can affect the relative toxicity of pyrethroids from one species to another. As we have seen, the decay of the tail current can greatly influence the functionality of voltage-gated sodium channels and eventually the amount of sodium charges (Qtot) that enters the neuron&#8217;s cytoplasm. Qtot is a composite parameter that takes both the percentage of modified channels (i.e. channel affinity for the drug) and the speed of the decay of the tail -current (drug efficiency) into account; therefore, Qtot may be a more appropriate parameter to estimate the effects of pyrethroids on neurons. Our results suggest that <italic>Bt</italic> is more susceptible to pyrethroids than <italic>Am</italic>. Classical toxicological data with the pyrethroid &#955;-cyhalothrin support this result, but not with other members of the pyrethroid class such as deltamethrin and permethrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. When considering available LD50 for all wild bee species (including <italic>Bt</italic>), it turns out that the toxicological profile is not clear for several pyrethroids. For instance, whereas &#945;-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin and deltamethrin are consistently more toxic for <italic>Am</italic>, other pyrethroids such as cyhalothrin, &#955;-cyhalothrin and permethrin are either more or less toxic for <italic>Am</italic>, revealing the difficulty of establishing general toxicological rules between <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and other bee species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Yet it should be noted that the mortality rate is not necessarily the only relevant parameter to assess long term risks associated with pyrethroids since bees can also be exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, that parameter does not reflect the subtleties in the action of insecticides when bees are exposed to small doses of these compounds. The sublethal effects of pyrethroids on <italic>Am</italic> have been extensively investigated and they include impairment in memory and learning performances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, disorientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and loss in locomotor capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This can possibly lead to subtle, but persistent adverse consequences on the colony since insecticides can interfere with facets of the colony properties such as the larval development, the feeding behaviour or olfactory discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, for review, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Regarding the bumblebees, sublethal data are rather scarce, but some behavioural aspects of the action of pyrethroids have been investigated. In an experiment in which the foraging activity of bumble bees was monitored using RFID tracking, individuals exposed to pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin carried out longer foraging expeditions than unexposed individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This could be the sign of impairments in the bumblebee&#8217;s memory, orientation and/or flight performances. More behavioural studies need to be carried out to root out eventual differences in sensitivity of <italic>Am</italic> and <italic>Bt</italic> at sublethal level. Other factors for instance, the ability of pyrethroids to get through the cuticle barrier or the metabolism of pyrethroids may also influence the sensitivity of the bees to these compounds. Life history traits of bee species and their level of sociality may impact their vulnerability as well, with <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> being a complex eusocial species (like <italic>Apis dorsata</italic>, <italic>Apis florea</italic> and <italic>Melipona quadrifasciata</italic>), <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> showing an obligate simple eusociality and other species being solitary species such as <italic>Habropoda laboriosa</italic> or <italic>Megachile rotundata</italic>. The life cycles of <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> differ in numerous aspects: unlike domestic honey bees, bumblebee queens live part of the year outside of a colony and exposure to pesticides may have a greater impact on bumblebees&#8217; colony fitness as compared with that of honey bees. For a period in their life cycle, bumblebees lack the &#8220;buffer&#8221; that domestic honey bees benefit from in their colony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> approaches provide essential clues as to the differences in sensitivity between the domesticated honey bee <italic>Am</italic>, the bumblebee <italic>Bt</italic> and possibly other bee species to pyrethroid insecticides. <italic>Am</italic> cannot necessarily be considered as a proxy for other bee species and the effect of one particular pyrethroid cannot be extrapolated to those of other members of the family.

The pipette solution contained (in mM): 135 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 90 Sucrose (pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH, 380&#8201;mOsm/l). We used a glass tubing inspired by procedures from Tatebayashi and Narahashi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> to superfuse neurons with pyrethroids. Perfusion rate was approximately 1&#8201;ml/min. Only one neuron was recorded per dish and then the tubing system was discarded after each series of perfusion and the reference electrode were abundantly rinsed with running 70% ethanol and distilled water. Tetramethrin (CAS number: 7696-12-0) and esfenvalerate (CAS number: 66230-04-4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St-Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions (10&#8201;mM) were prepared in DMSO (vortexed and briefly sonicated to fully dissolve the compounds) and dissolved in the perfusion solution. Drugs were applied 1&#8201;min prior the beginning of the train of depolarizations (3&#8201;ms long at 13&#8201;Hz as above).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Markovian model</title><p id="Par28">The Markovian model used in this work is essentially the same as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, left). The 3 voltage-dependent activations (forward &#945; and backward &#946;) of the three similar S4 segments necessary for the channel to open, connect the 4 Closed states (C), with a final transition, also voltage-dependent (with forward K<sub>oF</sub>, and backward K<sub>oB</sub> rates) to the open state (O)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Voltage-dependent fast inactivation (due to the loop between III and IV domains) relies in the activation of the fourth S4 (DIVS4, with transition rates K<sub>ifF</sub>, K<sub>ifB</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). Non voltage-dependent transition rates to and from the slow, pore-dependent inactivated state (Is) are K<sub>isF</sub> and K<sub>isB</sub> for transition to (O), and K<sub>is2F</sub> and K<sub>is2B</sub> for transition to (If), respectively. Voltage-dependent transition rates are set as A.exp(V/k), where A is the value at V&#8201;=&#8201;0, k is the voltage dependency, and V the membrane potential. The fit to the experimental data recorded in control conditions with this set of differential equations, gives a set of values able to reproduce most of the channel properties. Pyrethroids binding can occur on the Open state, as suggested from their use-dependent effects and the location of the putative pyrethroids binding site within the channel pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The possibility of the pyrethroids binding to the Closed states also exists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. These two possibilities are introduced in our study.</p><p id="Par29">We limit the change in the kinetic parameters affected by pyrethroid binding to the channel, to those affecting the pore module where the putative binding site is located (S4-S5 linkers of the DI and DII, and S5 of DI and DII, and S6 of DII and DIII)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>

The p, q, r, s, t, u, v and w parameters (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, right) are therefore the factors affecting K<sub>oF</sub>, K<sub>oB</sub>, K<sub>ifF</sub>, K<sub>ifB</sub>, K<sub>isF</sub>, K<sub>isB</sub>, K<sub>is2F</sub> and K<sub>is2B</sub>, respectively, giving the drug-bound values K<sub>oFb</sub>, K<sub>oBb</sub>, K<sub>ifFb</sub>, K<sub>ifBb</sub>, K<sub>isFb</sub>, K<sub>isBb</sub>, K<sub>is2Fb</sub> and K<sub>is2Bb</sub>. This model was then used to fit current recorded on the same neurons as before, but in the presence of tetramethrin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).
