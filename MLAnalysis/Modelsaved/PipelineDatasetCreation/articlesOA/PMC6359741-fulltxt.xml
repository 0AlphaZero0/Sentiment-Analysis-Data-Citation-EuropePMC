In two systematic reviews, one of studies assessing the STOPP criteria and another on the economic impact of inappropriate drug prescribing more generally, only direct medication costs of PIP drugs were assessed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Increased life expectancy has called into question the use of 65 years and above as a threshold for old age; however, the literature on PIP (including STOPP) still focuses on this population due to physiological changes in ageing and the prevalence of multiple comorbidities which can predispose to medication harm.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>Furthermore, in only assessing the direct cost of inappropriate drugs, the economic consequences of appropriate prescriptions used as an alternative to PIP medicines are not accounted for.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The costs of managing any resulting adverse events have yet to be quantified for PIP as a whole and have only been assessed for individual medication classes to date, such as benzodiazepines and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#8211;8</xref> The economic impact of PIP is important when considering whether interventions to reduce PIP are an efficient use of resources and health professionals&#8217; time relative to other competing priorities. Few economic evaluations of trials to optimise prescribing for older people have been published,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 9 10</xref> which may limit implementation of such interventions by decision-makers, given scarce healthcare resources.</p><p>A recent analysis of PIP among older adults in Ireland found that the most common indicators related to long-term use of NSAIDs, benzodiazepines and maximal dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> NSAIDs are indicated for treating pain in arthritis and low back pain for example; however, due to their gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, they are not recommended for long-term use. Benzodiazepines are sedative agents used to treat insomnia, but carry risks of day-time drowsiness as well as tolerance and dependence following long-term use. PPIs are used for gastrointestinal conditions such as peptic ulcer disease and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. While maximal doses are indicated for up to 8 weeks in the majority of cases, following this a maintenance dose has comparable efficacy if continued treatment is necessary. Despite strong evidence that the balance of benefits and harms for such prescriptions is unfavourable, the prevalence of these indicators ranged from 4% to 24% in a primary care population analysis (where most prescribing of these agents occurs).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>The aim of this study is to estimate and compare the economic impact of these three common indicators of PIP: long-term use of NSAIDs, benzodiazepines and maximal dose PPIs. Specifically, we compare each of the three PIP drugs to a more appropriate treatment using Markov models to assess differences in quality and quantity of life and cost to the health system. We then apply the models to explore the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions based on recently published trials targeting these PIP drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Markov models</title><p>The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used in the design and reporting of this research (included as online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A Markov model was developed for each of the included PIP drugs using TreeAge Pro 2015 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, Massachusetts, USA). This type of decision-analytic model was chosen to allow for time dependency, a particularly important consideration in the context of older people on long-term medicines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The base case analysis used a target population of hypothetical 65&#8201;year olds who were community-dwelling in Ireland and had no current or previous adverse events relating to these PIP drugs. A health system perspective was used over a time horizon of 35 1-year cycles (ie, to age 100) with a half cycle correction.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This perspective is recommended in national guidelines on economic evaluation,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and therefore only direct costs to the health system (including those relating to residential care) were considered. The primary decision maker is therefore Ireland&#8217;s Health Service Executive which makes funding allocation decisions relating to health technologies. In each of the three cases, the PIP strategy was compared with an alternative strategy, selected as an appropriate therapeutic option instead of the PIP drug (with respect to effectiveness and safety). The models incorporated the principal adverse drug events relating to each PIP (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The primary outcomes evaluated were costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Life years (LYs) and number/rate of adverse events were also quantified as secondary outcomes. A discount rate for costs, QALYs and LYs was applied at 5% per annum and was varied from 0% to 6% in sensitivity analysis, in line with guideline recommendations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

Health states only related to the adverse events of each PIP, so it was assumed that there was no significant differences in efficacy between each PIP and the appropriate alternative, and no significant adverse effects of the appropriate alternative. In the NSAID model, following an adverse event, it was assumed that individuals would be switched to an appropriate alternative. In the other models, it was assumed that individuals remained on therapy regardless of adverse events, due to unlikely attribution of the adverse events in the case of PPIs and dependence and withdrawal effects in the case of benzodiazepines.

An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was also calculated for each PIP, indicating the expected additional cost per additional QALY in the PIP scenario relative to the appropriate alternative scenario. Differences in the total number of adverse events for the PIP scenario compared with the appropriate scenario were also determined. Uncertainty associated with imprecision of the parameter inputs was incorporated into the model using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to allow 95% credible intervals (CIs) to be fitted (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary appendix 2</xref>, section 4 for further details). The impact of varying specific parameter inputs, including costs and discount rates, was assessed in one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Although not prespecified, we also considered treatment adherence in one-way sensitivity analysis.

The intervention was delivered once at the beginning of the model to all individuals on a long-term NSAID and resulted in a proportion of these people being switched to paracetamol for the duration of the model time horizon. The intervention cost per person and effectiveness (ie, the relative reduction in the proportion on a long-term NSAID) were varied to determine circumstances in which the intervention would be preferred to no intervention at a willingness-to-pay or cost-effectiveness threshold of &#8364;45&#160;000/QALY (the conventionally used threshold in Ireland)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> as well as thresholds of &#8364;20&#160;000/QALY and &#8364;0/QALY. These results were plotted and this was then repeated for benzodiazepine and PPIs. Threshold analysis was conducted using effectiveness estimates from recent primary care trials targeting these PIP drugs which have no published economic evaluation to date to determine maximal costs at which each medicines optimisation intervention would be cost-effective (see section 5 of online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary appendix 2</xref> for a description of these trials).<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47&#8211;49</xref>

Several recent trials of primary care interventions have successfully reduced PIP drugs.

The use of Markov models allowed for available evidence on harm relating to PIP criteria from the published literature to be combined. The analysis also incorporated uncertainty in these estimates and a number of model validation steps were conducted. This study directly compared three types of suboptimal prescribing with distinct adverse effects on a common scale of costs and QALYs. Similarly, it illustrates that the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to improve prescribing in older people can be assessed using Markov modelling to capture the long-term consequences of medicines optimisation.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Only the principal adverse effects of each PIP were included to reduce the complexity and increase transparency of the models. Similarly, although prevalent among older adults, we did not consider drug-drug and drug-disease interactions or exacerbations of underlying conditions within the models. A number of model assumptions were applied to address this study&#8217;s aim. First, as the STOPP criteria refer to drug classes, we used pooled estimates for each class for the risk of adverse effects to provide the average economic impact of each PIP, and heterogeneity within drug classes was beyond the scope of this study. Similarly, we did not consider strategies that modify risks, such as gastroprotection with NSAIDs to prevent GI adverse events with NSAIDs. Second, the cohort under consideration were 65&#8201;year olds, assumed to be continuous users of each PIP, and in the intervention evaluation, the reduction in PIP was assumed to be sustained over the full time horizon. In reality, patients may spend some time exposed and unexposed; however, these assumptions allowed comparison of the overall effects of each PIP. We considered treatment adherence in sensitivity analysis and although adherence to these medication classes is likely to be high given their symptomatic effects, adherence may&#160;be lower in some cases than is considered here. The analyses were performed on a cohort basis to assess the average costs and effects, which does not reflect the variability of these outcomes among individuals, where some patients may incur large costs and have a greater reduction in QALYs. Heterogeneity was also not considered, as the research did not aim to evaluate how the economic impact may vary among patient subgroups. Further research should determine the extent to which differences in individual patient characteristics may alter the economic impact of PIP. This analysis focused only on adverse effects of prescribing deemed to be potentially inappropriate; however, appropriate alternatives were selected on the basis of similar effectiveness and limited adverse effects. Although these types of prescribing are generally regarded as inappropriate for older adults, there may be circumstances where patients and their doctors weigh the benefits and harms and decide that the &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; prescription is optimal for them individually.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p>Trial-based economic evaluations may not always be informative for policy-maker decisions due to, for example, relevant comparators not being included, an insufficient time horizon or measurement of intermediary endpoints (eg, serum cholesterol) or process measures (eg, PIP) rather than final outcomes.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Modelling approaches can overcome these weaknesses, by allowing all relevant evidence to be synthesised, incorporating alternative treatments not directly compared in a trial and extrapolating beyond the duration of the trial to assess long-term outcomes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Adoption of economic modelling approaches could increase the number of informative economic evaluations of prescribing safety interventions, such as in the PINCER trial.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Such methods may be particularly useful in evaluating services to improve other aspects of medicines use where the benefits may not manifest during the period of a trial, for example, interventions to improve adherence to preventative medicines.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Future trials of new or expanded services should conduct robust economic evaluations and include long-term consequences to inform policy-makers&#8217; decisions on implementation and funding allocation. Cost-utility analyses presenting results as cost per QALY are most informative, allowing policy-makers to compare interventions and make funding decisions across therapeutic domains. Model-based approaches, as illustrated here, are an effective method to produce these estimates and evaluate interventions which affect outcomes across physiological systems.</p><p>Prescribing of potentially inappropriate medicines has significant economic implications, and interventions to reduce PIP are likely to be cost-effective if implemented into primary care for older people. The 95% CIs for cost and QALY differences in the PPI model both included zero, which, similar to the PINCER trial, was due to uncertainty relating to the adverse effects.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This indicates that more information is needed on the safety of maximal compared with maintenance doses,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and therefore these results should not deter efforts to deprescribe PPIs where their use is potentially inappropriate.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 47</xref> As illustrated in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>, the CE threshold being used by policy-makers (ie, the cost they are willing to pay for a QALY) can influence which interventions are funded. Placing a greater monetary value on each QALY will favour interventions that improve quality and quantity of life over those that reduce healthcare costs. While an explicit CE threshold exists for new drugs in the Irish health system, it is less clear whether the same applies to other interventions, such as those to improve prescribing.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> It may be that a lower CE threshold applies to these, for instance, if no additional funding is available for medicines optimisation services and only cost-saving interventions are acceptable to decision-makers. Using a different CE threshold may alter healthcare decisions and potentially result in less net benefit for patients across the health system.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>

Maximal dose PPI use is highly prevalent but evidence of harms is less certain, and so further studies should consider whether continuing maximal dose PPI is associated with increased risks compared with maintenance dose prescribing in order to establish whether targeting this is an efficient use of resources. Future research should also evaluate which patient subgroups inappropriate medication use have the greatest economic impact on, and thus, which patients would most benefit from prescribing optimisation interventions to maximise cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e171" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-021832.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e172" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-021832.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> @FrankMoriarty</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> FM, CC, KB and TF contributed to the conception and design of this study.
