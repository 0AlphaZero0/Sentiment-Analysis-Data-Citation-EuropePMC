NSD is triggered by ribosomes stalled at the very 3&#8217; end of an mRNA in the absence of translation termination, typically due to aberrant pre-mRNA cleavage or stop codon mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. NGD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> is typically caused by ribosome stalling within the open reading frame (ORF), resulting from mRNA secondary structure, RNA damage, aminoacyl-tRNA deficiency or translation through polybasic stretches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

The rapid identification and dissociation of stalled complexes, and degradation of stalling-prone mRNAs, are therefore important activities. Ribosome stalling also triggers another surveillance pathway, termed ribosome-associated quality control (RQC; reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>), which targets truncated nascent peptides to proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Each of these pathways encompasses detection of stalling, splitting of 80S ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and degradation of either faulty mRNA or nascent peptide, whereas the ribosomal subunits and any associated tRNAs are recycled. However, it remains unclear exactly how translational aberrations are sensed and downstream responses triggered.</p><p id="Par4">Recent research has focussed on two early-acting factors: Asc1 (RACK1 in mammals) is required for NGD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, NSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and RQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and is an integral component of the ribosomal 40S subunit. Hel2 (also known as Rqt1 in yeast; ZNF598 in mammals) is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that is required for RQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, while Hel2 was reported to be ribosome associated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, it has only ~0.6% of the abundance of ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Both Hel2 and human ZNF598 (hZNF598) are non-essential but their deletion increases full-length (FL) translation on stalling-prone, poly(CGA)- or poly(A)-containing mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and modestly reduces ribosome stalling on reporter constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. A group of Hel2-associated proteins, Slh1/Rqt2, Cue3/Rqt3 and Ykr023W/Rqt4, also function in triggering RQC, but their precise roles remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Following the triggering of surveillance, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 modifies the nascent polypeptide with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. In contrast, hZNF598 ubiquitinates the 40S ribosomal subunit, with major substrates at two lysine residues in Rps10 (eS10) and additional sites in Rps3 (eS3) and Rps20 (uS10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, while Hel2 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ubiquitinates Rps20 (uS10) and Rps3 (eS3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Previous work also implicated Hel2 in K63-linked polyubiquitination, important for turnover of truncated peptides following translation stalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

However, our data for Hel2 crosslinking to RNA offer no support for a nuclear function of Hel2. The major targets of Hel2 binding are within 18S ribosomal RNA, and this interaction is lost upon deletion of the crosslinked region from Hel2, which also leads to a loss of polysomal association, RQC and NGD.

In the recently reported identification of RNA-associated peptides (iRAP) technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, RNA&#8211;protein crosslinking sites can be identified with amino acid resolution from all RNA classes. Briefly, RNA&#8211;protein complexes are covalently crosslinked with 254&#8201;nm UV irradiation in actively growing yeast cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Following initial protein digestion with LysC, RNA&#8211;protein conjugates are separated from proteins by centrifugation through a density gradient of caesium trifluoroacetate. Following RNA digestion, peptides are analysed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis, searching for the specific addition of mass corresponding to the residual mononucleotide that remains following nuclease digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Consistent with this, Rps3 and Rps20, which are ubiquitinated by Hel2, are located at the entrance channel. Indeed, Rps3 directly contacts a nucleotide crosslinked to Hel2 in the major rRNA interaction site. hZNF598 also ubiquitinates hRPS3 and hRPS20 but has most activity against hRPS10, similarly located close to the entry channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Rps10 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and related yeasts lack the C-terminal region including the ubiquitinated lysine residues (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This correlates with changes in the pattern of Hel2 conservation, suggesting coevolution of Hel2 and its ubiquitination targets. Binding of Hel2 to 18S rRNA was largely lost in the absence of the ribosome-associated protein Asc1 (homologous to hRACK1) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

However, the second minor crosslink site (U494 in yeast; U542 in human) would be buried between the collided ribosomes.

We postulate that surveillance activity predominately involves 40S-associated Hel2 scanning all translation termination complexes for aberrant features. This model would be in agreement with findings of increased ribosome densities in 3&#8217; untranslated regions (UTRs) in the absence of splitting factors Dom34/Hbs1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and Rli1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which function downstream of Hel2 in RQC.</p><p id="Par47">In contrast, Hel2 binding was very low over the initial ~150 nt of most ORFs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>).

Before plotting, the area under the curve was then set to 1 for wild-type and accordingly for the other samples. Alternatively, data were not normalized to the ratio of total reads in sample to wild-type Hel2-HTP but the area under the curve was set to 1 for all samples.</p><p id="Par61">For 2D plots, summed data sets for each sample were normalized to the number of total reads (from metagene plot calculations) over all 275 genes in the corresponding wild-type Hel2-HTP data set. Following this normalization, all data sets corresponding to the same strain background were summed and divided by the number of data sets. Resulting files were converted back to bigwig format and processed as described for metagene plots. plotHeatmap was then used to generate the 2D plots.</p><p id="Par62">Poly(A) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> was performed on reads containing the 3&#8217;-adapter using a custom script. From reads identified to contain a non-encoded oligo(A) tail, the tail, as well as any trailing As were removed. Resulting adapter-containing and A-tail removed fasta files were subjected to alignment and metagene analyses for reads and deletions and plotted as described above. To determine the percentages of oligo-adenylated reads at the pA site, the numbers of reads from the metagene total at the pA site in oligo-adenylated reads were divided by the numbers of reads in adapter-containing reads.</p><p id="Par63">To compare Hel2 binding to RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, data sequencing reads were mapped to a database of mature transcripts. The database was created by addition of the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; UTRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, excising introns and arbitrary addition of 10 adenine nucleotides at the 3&#8217; end to mimic the poly(A) tail of mature mRNAs. Coverage of reads mapped to each mature mRNA was normalized to 1&#8201;kb per million and median value for each type of experiment (RNASeq, RiboSeq or Hel2 CRAC) was used for comparison. Median value was log2 transformed to reduce the effect of outliers. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for median values. Finally, Hel2 CRAC data were divided into five quintiles and RiboSeq-to-RNASeq ratio was calculated for genes included in each quintile. For other analyses, alignment to the genome was preferred, as this accounts for use of alternative transcription start or polyadenylation sites, as well as for included introns (e.g. for HAC1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ribosome and polysome association of Hel2</title><p id="Par64">Analyses were performed similar to a recent publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

For RT-qPCR experiments with sucrose-fractionated RNA, fractions from sucrose gradients (see above) for wild-type Hel2-HTP or Hel2<sub>1-492</sub>-HTP were pooled into three groups: polysomal, monosomal, and earlier (free).
