There is still no recommended treatment for these hearing deficits, and most options considered rely on the transfer of sound from the poor ear to the better ear, using Contralateral Routing of the Signal (CROS) hearing aids or bone conduction (BC) devices. In contrast, cochlear implantation allows the poor ear to be stimulated and binaural hearing abilities to be partially restored. Indeed, most recently published studies have reported an improvement in the spatial localisation of an incoming sound and better speech recognition in noisy environments after cochlear implantation in SSD/AHL subjects. It also provides consistent relief of tinnitus when associated. These encouraging hearing outcomes raise the question of the cost-utility of this expensive treatment in an extended indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The final endpoint of this national multicentre study is to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of cochlear implantation in comparison to the current standard of care in France through simple observation, using a randomised controlled trial. Firstly, the study comprises a prospective and descriptive part, where 150 SSD/AHL subjects try CROS hearing aids and a BC device for three weeks each. Secondly, the choice is made between CROS hearing aids, BC implanted device and cochlear implantation. Hearing outcomes and quality of life measurements are described after 6&#8201;months for the subjects who chose CROS, BC or declined any option. The subjects who opt for cochlear implantation are randomised between one group where the cochlear implant is inserted without delay and one group of simple initial observation. Hearing outcomes and quality of life measurements are compared after 6&#8201;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The present study was designed to assess the efficiency of cochlear implantation in SSD/AHL.

Although the level of handicap generated varies, SSD and AHL are actually disabling conditions in both children and adults. In the paediatric population, several case-control studies have demonstrated the impact of such hearing deficits on cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and schooling with higher rates of grade failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In adults, quality of life is often assessed using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities Hearing scale (SSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and it has been repeatedly shown that more than 75% of SSD/AHL subjects experience hearing difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interaural asymmetry of hearing is the common factor to SSD and AHL, with SSD being defined as a unilateral severe-to-profound deafness (pure-tone average PTA &#8805;70&#8201;dB HL), with a better, normal or near-normal ear (PTA&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;30&#8201;dB HL). The term &#8220;AHL&#8221; is used when hearing in the better ear is not normal, but can be restored using a conventional hearing aid (PTA between 30&#8201;dB HL and 55&#8211;60&#8201;dB HL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">From a physiological point of view, the deficit produced by SSD and AHL is first related to the disruption of binaural hearing and its binaural advantages. Indeed, in normal hearing subjects, an incoming sound arrives with differences between the two ears in terms of timing (interaural time difference) and amplitude (interaural level difference), depending on its spatial position and spectral content (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] for review). These interaural differences can be used to localise a sound source in the horizontal plane and generate binaural effects. Three main effects are described, one being purely peripheral while the two others arise from the central auditory system. Thus, the head shadow effect is mainly related to the physical presence of the head, which reduces the competing noise for the ear closer to the sound source. Summation and binaural unmasking are the two central effects generated to optimise the global signal/noise ratio (SNR) if speech and noise are collocated (summation) or spatially separated (binaural unmasking or squelch). Altogether, these processes facilitate speech recognition in noisy environments which is one of the main complaints of SSD/AHL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">But the loss of binaural hearing is often not isolated and several disabling symptoms can accompany the unilateral profound deafness. Tinnitus is probably the most frequently reported, affecting 67 to 100% of subjects with profound deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because it can lead to severe psychological comorbidities such as depression and anxiety, it may be the most prominent complaint in some SSD/AHL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hyperacusia can also be associated with the symptoms and further impairs social interaction in noisy places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The treatment of SSD and AHL is still debated. Although Controlateral Routing of the Signal (CROS) hearing aids system are considered to be the standard care in several countries, French authorities have not yet recommended any official guideline. Clinical experience shows that some patients adapt to this condition or simply use a conventional hearing aid for the better ear in cases of AHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but recent consensus papers have suggested that trials of more specific treatments should be included in the assessment protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Among the different specific treatment options, one strategy indeed relies on the transfer of the sound surrounding the poor ear to the better ear so that it can be perceived, through medical devices such as CROS hearing aids or Bone Conduction (BC) devices. CROS hearing aids thus transmit the sound via Bluetooth. The most widespread BC devices are bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA), which use the conductive properties of the skull to convey sounds to the better ear. Both devices allow better recognition when speech is presented to the poor ear, even in noisy settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In some subjects, this can lead to significant improvements in the appreciation of the quality of sounds perceived in background noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. But these devices only provide a unilateral auditory input by stimulating the better ear and, consequently, cannot restore binaural hearing. In the same way, the absence of auditory stimulation in the poor ear explains why the impact on tinnitus, when associated, is merely assessed and most plausibly absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Although cochlear implantation is traditionally used to treat bilateral profound deafness, it has recently been proposed as a new treatment option in SSD/AHL, specifically because it ensures the stimulation of the poor ear. Bilateral auditory input can therefore be restored in those patients, which is a major difference to CROS hearing aids and BC devices and is the theoretical prerequisite for an improvement of binaural hearing. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of cochlear implant on tinnitus has been consistently demonstrated in numerous studies on bilateral profound deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and can be expected in SSD/AHL subjects. The treatment of tinnitus was in fact the main objective of the first report on cochlear implantation in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the initial promising results were confirmed by other teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and maintained several years after the procedure with a significant relief observed in the vast majority of subjects. Early studies on binaural hearing abilities after cochlear implantation showed, on average, an improvement for localisation performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and speech recognition in noise with the CI &#8220;on&#8221; compared to the CI &#8220;off&#8221; condition, with a significant inter-individual heterogeneity. Recent reviews of the literature and meta-analyses have underlined the effect of CI use on tinnitus relief, which appears more significant and consistent than the modifications of binaural hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An emphasis has also been put on the need for larger prospective randomised controlled studies to improve the level of evidence for CI efficiency in SSD/AHL.</p><p id="Par30">In a prospective pilot study, Arndt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] showed that CI provided better performance than CROS or BAHAs previously tested by the same subjects, for several assessments of binaural hearing abilities. Several national multicentre trials have begun to compare hearing results after CI to those obtained with a CROS or BAHA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These trials also assess the utility of the different treatments as a secondary objective, through their impact on quality of life with respect to their cost. The question of the cost/utility ratio of each treatment should indeed be raised because it is estimated that the global cost of cochlear implantation is approximately EUR 30,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] while rehabilitation by CROS hearing aids or BAHA may cost EUR 2000 to EUR 3800. This gap between devices in terms of cost adds another substantial difference between CROS systems, BAHA and a cochlear implantation. Furthermore, treatment with cochlear implant involves a significant commitment on the patients&#8217; part for the surgical procedure as well as for the rehabilitation programme; and although treatment by CROS hearing aids is not trivial, its consequences are much less significant.</p><p id="Par31">All these differences between the possible treatments of SSD/AHL probably make cochlear implantation an option that is set apart from the others. Therefore in the recent consensus papers, it is not considered as an alternative among different options, but as a second-line treatment, in the event CROS or BAHA systems fail.</p><p id="Par32">The present article describes a prospective multicentre randomised controlled trial initiated in France, which allows the subjects to choose their treatment option (observation, CROS, BAHA, or CI). The decision was made to randomise CI versus observation after a consecutive trial of CROS hearing aids and BAHA on a headband (Baha&#174; or Ponto&#174;)&#160;(see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Eventually, it aims to determine if CI is cost-effective in SSD/AHL, in subjects where CROS hearing aids and BAHA trials have failed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial design:the choice of the treatment option is made after a consecutive trial of CROS hearing aids and BAHA on a headband; subjects who opt for a cochlear implant are randomized between initial observation and cochlear implantation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12901_2019_66_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par33">The main objective of this study is to assess the efficiency of CI in SSD/AHL, compared to the current standard of care in France (observation), after failure of CROS and BC trials, using a cost-utility analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par34">This study also aims to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par35">assess the changes in quality of life and binaural hearing performance for each successive intervention (CROS, BC and CI);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">search for associations between changes in hearing performance scores and changes in quality of life for each intervention (CROS, BC and CI);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">assess the evolution of tinnitus intensity and the level of annoyance for each intervention (CROS, BC and CI).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par38">The cost-utility ratio of other treatment options (CROS, BC) will be determined.

Once the inclusion/criteria are checked and the consent from the subject is obtained by one of the investigators, a reference evaluation is made for quality of life, binaural hearing performances (i.e. speech recognition in noise and horizontal localisation) and tinnitus severity. Then, CROS hearing aids and a BC device on a headband are successively tried by the subjects for three weeks each. The evaluation of quality of life, binaural hearing abilities, and tinnitus severity is repeated after the first trial (CROS) and the second trial (BC). At this point, the subject may choose the treatment he/she is willing to continue. If one of the trials (CROS or BC) is considered to be successful and the subject is willing to continue with the corresponding device, it is then provided and a new evaluation is performed 6&#8201;months later. If none of the trials is considered to be successful and the subject does not want any other treatment, then only a new evaluation is performed 6&#8201;months later. If none of the trials is considered to be successful and the subject wants treatment by cochlear implantation, the second major step of the study begins with the randomisation procedure.</p><p id="Par44">Subjects who chose a cochlear implant are thus randomised between two arms: in the first one (&#8220;CI&#8221; arm), a cochlear implantation is performed within a month and a new evaluation on quality of life, binaural hearing performances, and tinnitus severity is planned 6&#8201;months after CI activation. Subjects of the second arm (&#8220;observation&#8221; arm) simply undergo the new evaluation 6&#8201;months after randomisation, without any intercurrent treatment for SSD/AHL. For obvious ethical reasons, subjects of the second arm benefit from a cochlear implantation after this 6-month evaluation.</p><p id="Par45">Data from all the subjects included will be anonymised, collected and analysed.

In a pilot study performed in our centre (unpublished), 40 to 50% of SSD/AHL subjects declined both CROS and BC devices after a three-week trial. This rate is consistent with previous studies performed on BC implantation after a headband trial (45% in Desmet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). An improvement in quality of life is expected in these subjects after cochlear implantation, but it is not as significant as in patients with bilateral severe-to-profound deafness. A recent meta-analysis performed on traditional CI candidates with severe-to-profound deafness demonstrated an improvement of 1.05 standard deviations. To detect an improvement of 0.8 standard deviations with an alpha risk of 5% and an 80% power, 50 subjects (25 per arm) are necessary. Altogether, and to compensate the risk of dropouts, 150 subjects are included in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par60">The purpose of this study is to assess the cost-utility ratio of CI in subjects with SSD/AHL after failure of more conventional treatments. Therefore, every subject will successively try CROS hearing aids and a BC device placed on a headband, for three weeks each. The baseline assessment of each trial relies on auditory measures (speech recognition in noise and horizontal localisation) and quality of life questionnaires. Once each trial has been performed, the subject will decide which treatment he/she opts for. This choice is mainly based on the subjective feelings of the subject after the two trials, but also guided by the auditory outcomes obtained with each device, and the counselling of the physician. The programme provides all costs directly related to the treatment, i.e. the cost of the medical device and the following fitting sessions.</p><p id="Par61">The information regarding the results which may be expected from a cochlear implant is critical.

The surgery consists of the placement of the implant which aims at being osteo-integrated, on which an abutment is screwed. The processor may be used for 3 to 6&#8201;weeks following the surgery according to wound healing. It is then fitted by an experienced audiologist following the company&#8217;s guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Cochlear implant</title><p id="Par71">A surgical procedure is performed to allow the placement of the receptor under the temporal muscle and the introduction of the electrode array into the scala tympani via the round window or a cochleostomy. According to the company, the electrode array supports 12 to 22 intra-cochlear electrodes which aim at stimulating the first neurons of the auditory nerve. Four cochlear implant companies are involved in this study: Advanced Bionics, Cochlear, MedEl and Oticon. The choice of the brand will depend on the physician in charge of the patient. Approximately four weeks after surgery, the external processor can be activated and the patient will therefore receive electric auditory stimulation of the implanted ear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p id="Par72">The primary outcome measure will be applied to the two randomised arms to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of cochlear implantation versus initial observation at 6&#8201;months. The utility is defined in this study as survival weighted by the quality of life of patients at 6&#8201;months (QALY). Quality of life will be measured using a generic questionnaire, the EuroQol-5D-3&#8201;L scale. This instrument is recommended by the national French agency (Haute Autorit&#233; de Sant&#233;) for cost-utility studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">The EQ-5D-3&#8201;L is a self-administered, generic and multidimensional questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It has two components, a descriptive component and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive component is composed of 5 dimensions described by three levels that define 243 health states. The EQ-5D-3&#8201;L is translated and validated into the French language and it has a utility function calculated on the basis of known preferences of the French population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The utility-preference approach of the EQ-5D-3&#8201;L provides a cardinal measuring instrument available to calculate the cost-utility ratios.</p><p id="Par74">Healthcare costs will be assessed from the French health insurance perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Direct medical and non-medical costs will be included in this study. Costs related to productivity loss will also be analysed. Direct medical costs correspond to hospitalisation costs, outpatient costs (i.e. visits and medical acts, paramedical acts), medication and medical device costs, especially the cost of the CI. Non-medical costs include transportation costs. Data linked to the number of days the patient has missed work will also be gathered from the French health insurance databases. Costs will be estimated by multiplying the number of units used for each resource with the corresponding unit cost.</p><p id="Par75">Consumption of healthcare resources will be retrospectively gathered from the French Social Health Insurance databases, using a bottom-up approach. Administrative data corresponding to the name, surname, date of birth, place of living and gender were recorded for patients included in the study.</p><p id="Par76">Inpatient stays will be valued using the French Disease Related Groups (DRGs). Outpatient care, which includes visits, medical and paramedical acts, will be valued using the tariffs reimbursed by the French health insurance. Visits and paramedical acts will be valued using the French General Nomenclature of Professional Acts. Medical acts will be valued using the French Common Classification of Medical Acts, except for laboratory tests for which valuation will be based on the Nomenclature of Biological Acts. For all these fees, we will apply the corresponding reimbursement rate and we will subtract, if necessary, the medical deductible that is due by the patient and not reimbursed by the French Social Health Insurance (FSHI).</p><p id="Par77">A cost-utility analysis will be performed. This study will establish a link between costs and medical consequences, expressed in QALY gained, at 6&#8201;months between the two care management strategies. The ICUR between SSD/AHL patients treated by CI and those that are only followed-up, will be calculated as follows (Drummond et al., 2005):<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Hearing-specific quality of life questionnaires will also be administered.</p><p id="Par88">The Nijmegen Cochlear implant questionnaire (NCIQ) contains 60 questions exploring 6 areas concerned with the quality of auditory perception (basic perception, complex perception, speech production, self-esteem, social activities and interactions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Indeed, the perception of basic environmental sounds such as bells or footsteps is assessed as well as oral communication with new contacts. Each item is formulated as a statement with a 5 point response scale to indicate the degree to which this statement is judged true (from &#8220;never&#8221;:1 to &#8220;always&#8221;:5). An extra point can be chosen if none of the points fits.</p><p id="Par89">An evaluation of the discomfort related to the possible tinnitus associated with the deafness will rely on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10. This scale is presented as a 17&#8201;cm plastic ruler with a vertical arrow on one side and a graduated scale on the other side (0 to 10&#8201;cm). The subject first indicates the level of annoyance generated by the tinnitus on the vertical arrow using a cursor and the corresponding numeric value is reported by the evaluator. Then, the intensity of tinnitus is assessed using another ruler with the same dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Speech understanding in noise</title><p id="Par90">Speech recognition in competing noise is measured using the French Matrix test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] in sound field (IAC 120A-1 sound booth). The French Matrix test is a closed-set sentence test that uses 50 well-known words in French. Each sentence has the same syntactic structure: name - verb - number - object &#8211; colour, for example: &#8220;Felix draws six blue bikes&#8221;. The number of combinations of five words is large enough to eliminate memory-based responses. Speech and noise signals are generated from an IBM PC running the OMA software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hoertech.de">www.hoertech.de</ext-link>) and presented via loudspeakers and amplifier (Studio Lab, SLB sat 200). Speech signal is presented at a fixed level of 65&#8201;dB SPL and the level of competing noise is adjusted using the adaptive procedure described by Jansen et al. to obtain the signal-to-noise ratio in dB for 50% correct word recognition (SNR50).</p><p id="Par91">SNR50 is obtained in three different spatial configurations: one with speech and noise presented from a single loudspeaker in front of the subject at 0&#176; and two conditions with speech and noise presented from separate loudspeakers at 60&#176; to the left and right of the subject. The choice of a spatial configuration (&#8722;&#8201;60&#176;, 0&#176; and&#8201;+&#8201;60&#176;) was selected based on previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] showing that when such positions are used, the head-shadow effect is reduced while the binaural unmasking is maximised compared to a&#8201;&#177;&#8201;90&#176; configuration. The &#8220;dichotic&#8221; condition is defined as speech presented to the poorer hearing ear and the noise to the contralateral, normal hearing ear; the diotic condition as both the signal and the noise presented from the loudspeaker located in front of the subject; and the reverse dichotic condition with speech presented to the normal hearing ear and noise to the poorer ear. Subjects will be asked to repeat any word which is heard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Auditory horizontal localisation</title><p id="Par92">Horizontal localisation ability is assessed using an array of 7 horizontal loudspeakers and an amplifier (Studio Lab, SLB sat 200) located at intervals of 30 degrees from &#8211; 90 degrees to 90 degrees in a frontal semicircle diameter of 1.2&#8201;m at the subject&#8217;s head level. The stimulus comprises two 150&#8201;msec white gaussian noises from 20&#8201;Hz to 20&#8201;kHz with a 0.05&#8201;msec ramp. A silence of 150&#8201;msec is inserted between the two noises for total stimulus duration of 450&#8201;msec. This stimulus is similar to the one used by Slattery and Middlebrooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and is presented 63 times (9 presentations per loudspeaker) with a period of 2&#8201;s silence between each presentation to allow the subjects to indicate orally the loudspeaker location. Subjects are asked to not move their head during the experiment: this was controlled by the examiner. Localisation ability measurements are the rate of correct localisation and the root mean square error.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical methods, data reporting and analysis</title><p id="Par93">Once the validity of the database is double-checked, descriptive analyses will be carried out for each treatment option (observation, CROS hearing aids, bone conduction device, cochlear implant). Quantitative variables will be described as means, standard deviations, and percentile distribution. The number and proportion of subjects will be used to describe categorical data.</p><p id="Par94">Regarding the randomised controlled trial phase comparing CI versus observation, the analysis will be conducted on all subjects who were randomised on an intention-to-treat basis. For each outcome (quality of life, hearing performances indicators), the value measured at 6&#8201;months will be compared between the two groups using bivariate analyses (Student&#8217;s T test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests) and linear regressions adjusted for the baseline value.</p><p id="Par95">For each intervention, we will assess the associations between changes in hearing performances and changes in quality of life.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, performed using the non-parametric bootstrap method, identified the uncertainty around the ICUR by estimating its confidence interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, a Cost-Utility Acceptability Curve (CUAC) will be built to summarise the impact of uncertainty on the ICUR in relation to possible values of the cost-effectiveness threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par98">The detrimental consequences of SSD and AHL have been demonstrated for auditory performances as well as for the quality of life experienced by the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, most studies emphasise the large variability of these consequences, with SSD subjects achieving near-normal localisation accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] or speech understanding in noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Likewise, the impact on quality of life varies considerably both on specific and generic questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and the role of associated incapacitating symptoms such as tinnitus should be underlined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par99">The present protocol attempts to give account for this heterogeneity through the wide inclusion criteria which have been chosen. The choice of treatment and the outcomes of different subgroups (subjects with incapacitating tinnitus, SSD subjects, AHL subjects, and subjects with long lasting profound deafness) will therefore be specifically described. The theoretical advantage of cochlear implantation over CROS hearing aids and BC implants is to restore an auditory stimulation of the poor ear. This represents the mandatory condition to restore, at least partially, the perception of interaural differences. Further, alleviation of tinnitus is an established side-effect of CI, and subjects with incapacitating tinnitus associated with SSD/AHL might benefit more from this treatment than other SSD/AHL subpopulations.</p><p id="Par100">The current study falls within the framework of validation of SSD/AHL as a new indication of cochlear implantation in France. In this line, the NCIQ was chosen as specific subjective evaluation of hearing before and after treatment, to refer to previous studies on benefits of CI in bilateral severe-to-profound deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Even though most reports on CI in SSD/AHL used the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of hearing to assess binaural benefits of CI in this population, the NCIQ allows a global evaluation of hearing handicap with several items referring to social limitations and psychological consequences of deafness. Further, this instrument was also used in several studies on CI in SSD/AHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">The calculation of an intervention utility relies on a generic evaluation of quality of life. Among the different instruments which may be used, the Health Utility Index Mark 3 has been identified as sensitive to detect hearing changes after a treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Nevertheless, the EQ-5D is still the instrument which is recommended by the French Health Authority (HAS, Haute Autorit&#233; de Sant&#233;) as well as the preferred instrument recommended by NICE in the UK and the FDA in the USA in the framework of the Health Technology Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. It yields an exhaustive measure combining into a single score, both the symptoms of the disease, with its various physical, sensory, cognitive effects and the adverse effects of treatment.</p><p id="Par102">The present study is the first randomised controlled trial on CI in SSD/AHL with the determination of the cost-utility ratio as a primary endpoint. It also provides an assessment of hearing modifications which may be expected from most of treatments for SSD/AHL, such as CROS systems and BAHA.
