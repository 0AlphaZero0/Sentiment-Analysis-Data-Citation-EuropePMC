In many immunity- and predation-related proteins, they frequently experience positive selection for dealing with the changes of their targets from competitors. However, some sites that are far away from the interface between proteins and their targets are also identified to evolve under positive selection. Here, we explore the evolutionary implication of such a site in scorpion &#945;-type toxins affecting sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channels (abbreviated as &#945;-ScNaTxs) using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We found that despite no direct involvement in interaction with Na<sup>+</sup> channels, mutations at this site by different types of amino acids led to toxicity change on both rats and insects in three &#945;-ScNaTxs, accompanying differential effects on their structures. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the mutations changed the conformational dynamics of the positively selected bioactive site-containing functional regions by allosteric communication, suggesting a potential evolutionary correlation between these bioactive sites and the distant nonbioactive site. Our results reveal for the first time the cause of fast evolution at nonbioactive sites of scorpion neurotoxins, which is presumably to adapt to the change of their bioactive sites through coevolution to maintain an active conformation for channel binding. This might aid rational design of scorpion Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins with improved phyletic selectivity via modification of a distant nonbioactive site.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bioactive site</kwd><kwd>distal site</kwd><kwd>toxin&#8211;channel interface</kwd><kwd>long-range communication</kwd><kwd>positive selection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31870766</award-id><award-id>31570773</award-id><award-id>31501862</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins perform various biological functions through their bioactive sites to interact directly with their targets. Although these sites have been a focus of studies on the structure&#8211;function relationship of proteins and their evolution, the roles of the sites distant from the bioactive sites (herein termed distant sites) in modulating the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of enzymes are now being recognized (<xref rid="msy223-B3" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B43" ref-type="bibr">Whitney et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahuja et al. 2017</xref>). Directed evolution combined with structural and functional studies has revealed that some mutations leading to high activity are scattered remotely from the active sites of enzymes and especially mutations at these distant sites can markedly alter conformational dynamics of the catalytic residues of enzymes (<xref rid="msy223-B13" ref-type="bibr">Jim&#233;nez-Os&#233;s et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B3" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B43" ref-type="bibr">Whitney et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahuja et al. 2017</xref>). However, whether mutations at distant sites can modulate functions of nonenzymatic proteins, and how they exert effects are poorly understood. To address these two questions, one needs to rapidly identify distant nonbioactive sites associated with the protein function change and then to study their communication with the active site. In this regard, distant sites in nonenzymatic proteins evolved under positive selection may be particularly attractive candidates, as accelerated substitutions at a protein site is generally related to functional adaptation and they can be easily detected by statistical methods in the genomic era (<xref rid="msy223-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang 2002</xref>).</p><p>Positively selected sites (PSSs) refer to a class of amino acid sites with an excess of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, which are indicators of adaptive evolution, arms races, or compensatory substitutions (<xref rid="msy223-B21" ref-type="bibr">P&#225;l et al. 2006</xref>). PSSs have been identified in various protein families involved in a diversity of biological processes, such as immunity and predation (<xref rid="msy223-B28" ref-type="bibr">Sawyer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B14" ref-type="bibr">Juarez et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B33" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B26" ref-type="bibr">Puillandre et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kozminsky-Atias and Zilberberg 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B44" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Belov 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B36" ref-type="bibr">Vonk et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B30" ref-type="bibr">Sironi et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B24" ref-type="bibr">Pontremoli et al. 2016</xref>). In these examples, positive selection primarily acts on the bioactive sites to exert effects on the diversity of protein functions. A paradigm in this aspect is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a set of cell surface proteins essential for binding pathogen-derived oligopeptides (antigens), where nearly all PSSs fall in the antigen recognition site (ARS) domain (<xref rid="msy223-B12" ref-type="bibr">Hughes and Nei 1988</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Swanson 2002</xref>). In addition to these positively selected bioactive sites, some sites far away from bioactive sites have also been detected to be under positive selection (<xref rid="msy223-B16" ref-type="bibr">Kapralov and Filatov 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B33" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kozminsky-Atias and Zilberberg 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B31" ref-type="bibr">Sunagar et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B27" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B54" ref-type="bibr">Zupunski and Kordis 2016</xref>). Because of their distant locations, few mutational experiments have been conducted to uncover their functional and evolutionary implications.</p><p>The &#945;-ScNaTxs are a group of evolutionarily conserved neurotoxins specifically affecting voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) (<xref rid="msy223-B25" ref-type="bibr">Possani et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bosmans and Tytgat 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>), a class of transmembrane proteins responsible for the initiation of action potentials in neurons and other excitable cells (<xref rid="msy223-B55" ref-type="bibr">Catterall 2000</xref>). They adopt the cysteine-stabilized &#945;-helix and &#946;-sheet (CS&#945;&#946;) fold cross-linked by four disulfide bridges (<xref rid="msy223-B5" ref-type="bibr">Fontecilla-Camps et al. 1980</xref>). As the essential lethal components of the venom of the Old World scorpions (<xref rid="msy223-B25" ref-type="bibr">Possani et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>), they are involved in predation of these scorpions on their prey (e.g., insects and spiders) and defense against their predators (e.g., birds, lizards, and small rodents) (<xref rid="msy223-B23" ref-type="bibr">Polis 1990</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B6" ref-type="bibr">Gao and Zhu 2018</xref>). These toxins function as modulators of voltage gating of Na<sub>v</sub>s via binding to the receptor site 3 to prevent the outward movement of the S4 segment in DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) and thus slow down the rapid inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>s (<xref rid="msy223-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cest&#232;le and Catterall 2000</xref>). According to their preference for insect and mammalian Na<sub>v</sub>s, &#945;-ScNaTxs can be divided into three subtypes: 1) Classical &#945;-toxins that are highly toxic on mammals but nontoxic to insects; 2) Anti-insect &#945;-toxins that are especially toxic on insects but weakly toxic on mammals; and 3) &#945;-Like toxins that act on both mammalian and insect Na<sub>v</sub>s (<xref rid="msy223-B25" ref-type="bibr">Possani et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>). Mutational analyses of different &#945;-ScNaTxs have revealed a common bioactive surface that is primarily located on two loops (i.e., B-loop and J-loop) (termed &#8220;core-domain&#8221;) for receptor binding. Another bioactive surface that makes up of the N-terminal five-residue turn and the C-tail (named &#8220;NC-domain&#8221;) acts as an entirety only in some members, such as Lqh&#945;IT and BmKM1 (<xref rid="msy223-B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B17" ref-type="bibr">Karbat et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B8" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>). In other &#945;-ScNaTxs, for example, Lqh2, Lqh3, and MT&#945;-5, the N-turn is not indispensable in receptor binding (<xref rid="msy223-B18" ref-type="bibr">Karbat et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B15" ref-type="bibr">Kahn et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>). As the common bioactive surface of &#945;-ScNaTxs, the core-domain contributes multiple hot-spot residues to interaction with the primary site of the receptor located on the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) in DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F1">fig. 1</xref>). A short SS2&#8211;S6 loop in D1 that is structurally adjacent to the primary receptor site could provide the secondary site for toxin binding via their NC-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) (<xref rid="msy223-B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="msy223-F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><sc>Fig</sc>. 1.</label><caption><p>Site 52 is a distal site far from the toxin-channel interface.

Four repeat domains (DI&#8211;DIV) are shown in different colors where four transmembrane segments (S1&#8211;S4) of each domain comprise the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and S5 and S6 of each domain commonly forms the pore module (<xref rid="msy223-B29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. 2017</xref>). The receptor is primarily located on the VSD of DIV, including two extracellular loops linking S1, S2 and S3, S4 fragments (the area circled by dotted line). For some toxins, the short SS2&#8211;S6 loop in D1 (shown in <italic>yellow</italic> and marked by a pentagram) is also likely involved in toxin binding (<xref rid="msy223-B4" ref-type="bibr">Cest&#232;le and Catterall 2000</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2011</xref>).

To date, there are at least five studies reporting PSSs of &#945;-ScNaTxs with similar statistical methods but different data sets (<xref rid="msy223-B49" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B42" ref-type="bibr">Weinberger et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kozminsky-Atias and Zilberberg 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>). All these studies indicate that positive selection frequently acts on the core domain (<xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>), in line with its functional importance in receptor binding. We have previously identified nine PSSs in the &#945;-ScNaTxs from two <italic>Mesobuthus</italic> species (i.e., <italic>M. eupeus</italic> and <italic>M. martensii</italic>) with CodeML, a program for inference of positive selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes (<xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>). By using site-directed mutagenesis, we defined the functional roles of these PSSs in MT&#945;-5, an &#945;-like toxin from <italic>M. eupeus</italic> (initially abbreviated as MT-5 [<xref rid="msy223-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>] and herein renamed MT&#945;-5 to distinguish from the &#946;-toxins in the same venom), in which sites I<sup>40</sup> and L<sup>41</sup> located at the core domain (B-loop) serve as two hot-spot residues directly interacting with the receptor. Remarkably, site 52 is the only PSS that is located at the opposite side of the toxin&#8211;channel interface, and its location belongs neither to the core domain, nor to the NC-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F1">fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), thus representing an ideal candidate for studying the roles of a distant site in modulating the structure and function of a nonenzymatic protein.</p><p>In this work, we carried out mutational analysis of site 52 in three &#945;-ScNaTxs. In combination with molecular dynamics simulations (<xref rid="msy223-B47" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. 2017</xref>) and statistical coupling analysis (SCA) (<xref rid="msy223-B10" ref-type="bibr">Halabi et al. 2009</xref>), our experimental data demonstrated that the accelerated substitutions of site 52 is a result of adaptation to the evolutionary change of the bioactive PSSs, and that such coevolution may help the substituted bioactive sites to maintain an active conformation for receptor binding. Our study thus suggests that within one nonenzymatic protein, there exists also allosteric communication between its bioactive and nonbioactive distant sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we chose three &#945;-like toxins from <italic>M. eupeus</italic> (MT&#945;-5, MT&#945;-12 and MT&#945;-13) to construct multiple site 52 mutants, including MT&#945;-5(A52F), MT&#945;-5(A52G), MT&#945;-5(A52L), MT&#945;-5(A52N), and MT&#945;-5(A52P); MT&#945;-12(E50V) (site 50 in this toxin structurally equivalent to site 52 in other toxins described here); and MT&#945;-13(E52V). The introduction of a valine in MT&#945;-12 and MT&#945;-13 was inspired by the observation that two natural neurotoxins (MT&#945;-4 and MT&#945;-5) in the <italic>M. eupeus</italic> venom, differing by only one amino acid substitution at site 52 (V52A), exhibit different species selectivity (<xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>). This mutation was to test whether a valine at this site would evoke a shift of species selection to insects. For MT&#945;-5, more mutations were introduced into site 52 in view of the availability of its experimental 3D structure (<xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>), allowing further analysis of the mutational effects by molecular dynamics simulations. These mutations included three different types of amino acids: 1) Hydrophobic leucine and proline; 2) Hydrophilic glycine and asparagine; 3) Aromatic phenylalanine. The choice of houseflies and a rat Na<sub>v</sub> as targets for functional assays was based on an ecological consideration on the roles of &#945;-ScNaTxs in scorpion predation and defense, where insects are the prey and rats are the predators (<xref rid="msy223-B23" ref-type="bibr">Polis 1990</xref>).

To address this issue, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, a technique classically used to assess the secondary structure of proteins (<xref rid="msy223-B9" ref-type="bibr">Greenfield 2006</xref>), to compare potential structural effects of the mutations. From the CD spectra shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">figure 3</xref>
, we observed three categories of mutation-induced structural effects: 1) Mutations without destroying the structure of a parental peptide. These include A52F and A52N of MT&#945;-5 and E50V of MT&#945;-12. They all had a very similar CD spectrum to their respective parental toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">D</xref>); 2) Mutations destroying the structure of a parental peptide, such as A52L and A52P in MT&#945;-5. For these two mutants, their CD spectra remarkably changed relative to the unmodified peptide which had a spectral signature at 208&#8201;nm (negative maximum) and 230&#8201;nm (positive maximum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). This provides a rational explanation for MT&#945;-5(A52L) aggregation in solution and the complete activity loss in MT&#945;-5(A52P); 3) Mutations changing the stability of a parental peptide, such as A52G in MT&#945;-5 and E52V in MT&#945;-13. Although these two mutants had an overall similar CD spectrum to those of their respective wild-type toxins, their positive maximum at 230&#8201;nm markedly altered in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">fig. 3<italic>B</italic> and E</xref>). The intensity at 230&#8201;nm increased in A52G(MT&#945;-5) but decreased in MT&#945;-13(E52V), indicating that the mutation from Ala to Gly enhanced the stability of MT&#945;-5 whereas the mutation from Glu to Val reduced the stability of MT&#945;-13. This conclusion is further supported by our variable-temperature CD analysis of MT&#945;-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>). Obviously, its CD band at 230&#8201;nm decreased in intensity with increasing temperature and virtually disappeared at 60&#160;&#176;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F3">fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>). Taken together, our CD data revealed a differential structural effect induced by mutations at site 52, which appears to depend on the amino-acid type introduced and toxin individuals used.</p><fig id="msy223-F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><sc>Fi</sc><sc>g</sc>. 3.</label><caption><p>Comparison of CD spectra between wild-type toxins and mutants.

Quantitatively, the values of I<sup>40</sup> position changes were 3.24&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.52 &#197; for A52N and 3.87&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.61 &#197; for A52F; For L<sup>41</sup>, the values were 4.65&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.61 &#197; for A52N and 5.76&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.76 &#197; for A52F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F4">fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Compared with A52N, A52F showed a greater position change in the two bioactive sites, highlighting the importance of a proper rigidity in these residues for the toxicity of MT&#945;-5 on rNa<sub>v</sub>1.1. The declined insecticidal activity in A52N also hints a putative functional role of the C-tail because its conformation was also influenced by the mutation. However, even without obvious change in the C-tail, the A52F mutant also showed a decreased insect toxicity, suggesting that the insect toxicity of ScNaTxs may require multiple functional regions in a proper rigidity. In parallel, we also calculated the position change of C&#945; atoms at site 52 of the two mutants, the values were 5.51&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.05 &#197; for A52N and 3.70&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.74 &#197; for A52F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F4">fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>), indicating that relative to the unmodified toxin, the two mutants showed some position changes at this site. Such changes may stem from local structural rearrangement in the context of different side chains, which is obviously different from the position changes observed in I<sup>40</sup> and L<sup>41</sup> where there exists no side-chain difference between the wild-type peptide and its two mutants. Since site 52 is not involved in a direct interaction with Na<sub>v</sub>s, we assume that this kind of position changes could exert minor direct impact on the toxin function. All these observations indicated that mutations at a distant site can change the functional property of a ScNaTx through allosteric effect to affect the conformation of its functional regions.

Here, we show that positive selection at a distal site of the scorpion &#945;-type toxin family can modulate its functional evolution at a bioactive site. In our previous studies, we have observed a weak impact of the site 52 mutation (A52K) on the function of MT&#945;-5 (<xref rid="msy223-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>). In this work, we report extensive mutational effects of this site on the structures and functions of different ScNaTxs through introduction of more mutations and using more toxins. We found that the site 52 mutation-induced changes in toxin structure and function are amino acid type- and toxin individual-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msy223-F5">fig. 5</xref>
). For MT&#945;-5, the introduction of Pro or Leu resulted in structural perturbation, suggesting their deleterious effect and highlighting a key role of this site in preservation of the global structure of &#945;-ScNaTxs. Mutations by other residues (e.g., Phe and Asn) retained the structure but caused different functional consequences. For example, the toxicity of A52F on both rNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 and houseflies diminished whereas the insecticidal activity of A52N significantly decreased but its toxicity on rNa<sub>v</sub>1.1, by and large, remained. In addition, the stability of A52G increased but its toxicity decreased, suggesting a stability-function tradeoff. For MT&#945;-12 and MT&#945;-13, although the same mutation caused the activity decline on rNa<sub>v</sub>1.1, an opposite effect was observed for their insecticidal activity. This difference might arise from epistatic interactions (<xref rid="msy223-B22" ref-type="bibr">Parera and Martinez 2014</xref>) between site 52 and other sites in different genetic contexts.</p><fig id="msy223-F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><sc>Fig</sc>. 5.</label><caption><p>Site 52 mutation-induced structural and functional changes of toxins.

This clearly shows a key role of this site in regulating the species selectivity of the toxins, as previously observed in two natural variants (<xref rid="msy223-B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2012</xref>). The discovery of the amino acid type- and toxin individual-dependency in determining the mutational effects of a distant site indicates more possibilities for toxin retrofitting. Considering that the number of nonbioactive sites occupies an absolute majority in a protein, it is practically impossible to analyze mutational effects of all the sites and to study their interactions with bioactive sites. Alternatively, statistical methods, such positive selection and SCA used here, can narrow down possibilities to be tested in lab to quickly find such distant sites.</p><p>Based on the observation that positively selected bioactive sites in ScNaTxs directly bind to the highly variable channel residues, it has been proposed that an essential selection agent for these toxins comes from the evolutionary variability of the toxin-bound regions at Na<sub>v</sub>s from both predators and prey of scorpions (<xref rid="msy223-B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="msy223-B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>). However, site 52 is not a site directly involved in toxin&#8211;channel interactions, which may exclude the involvement of channels in providing a force driving the evolution of this distant site. The presence of allosteric communication between this site and the bioactive surface undergoing positive selection suggests that the evolution of site 52 is a consequence of dealing with the changes of the positively selected bioactive sites. Therefore, compensatory mutation-mediated coevolution (<xref rid="msy223-B21" ref-type="bibr">P&#225;l et al. 2006</xref>) within one toxin molecule could be a more plausible explanation. In our opinion, when one amino acid substitution occurs at a toxin&#8217;s bioactive site for adapting to the channel variation, its distant site 52 must follow change for maintaining an active conformation of the mutated bioactive site for channel binding. Their correlation is further revealed by our SCA, which identified two PSSs (I40 and A52) belonging to the same sector (i.e., a group of coevolving residues), suggesting that natural selection can drive accelerated substitutions of multiple sites simultaneously.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that a distant PSS can contribute to its roles in toxins&#8217; structure and function via allosteric communication with the bioactive sites. Although scorpion toxins and enzymes are by no means comparable, we observed a strategic commonality in their functional evolution, both via interactions between bioactive and distant nonbioactive sites. These findings would promote more studies on the evolution of protein inner life (functional interactions among sites within a molecule) (<xref rid="msy223-B37" ref-type="bibr">Wagner 2012</xref>) for better understanding of their functional innovation.

MD simulations (40&#8201;ns) were performed with GROMACS 5.1.4 with the OPLS-(AA)/L all-atom force field (<xref rid="msy223-B35" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Spoel et al. 2005</xref>). Each peptide was immersed in a cubic box extending to at least 1.0&#8201;nm from the protein surface and solvated with explicit SPC water molecular. Sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the total charge of the system, which was then simulated with periodic boundary conditions. Each solved structure was energy minimized for 5,000 steps of steepest descent minimization termination with a maximum force &lt;1,000&#8201;KJ/mol/nm. The system was then subject to equilibration phase of 100&#8201;ps NVT (Number of particles, volume, and temperature) equilibration and 100 ps NPT (Number of particles, pressure, and temperature) equilibration. The velocity rescaling method (also called modified Berendsen thermostat) was used to maintain the temperature at 300&#8201;K, and the Parrinello&#8211;Rahman methods were employed to maintain the pressure at 1 bar. The particle mesh Ewald method was used for long-range electrostatic interactions and the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm constrained all bonds (<xref rid="msy223-B11" ref-type="bibr">Hess 2008</xref>). Trajectories were saved every 10 ps for analysis. RMSD, RMSF, and the distances of atoms were extracted to compare structural deviations between MT&#945;-5 and its mutants after simulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein Sector Identification</title><p>The <italic>Mesobuthus</italic> ScNaTxs were collected from the GenBank database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>, last accessed August 15, 2017) by using MT&#945;-5 as a query and aligned by ClustalX2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clustal.org/Clustal2/">http://www.clustal.org/Clustal2/</ext-link>, last accessed August 20 2017) with default parameters. The SCA toolbox was obtained from Rama Ranganathan. We modified the MATLAB script to analyze the test cases. The method of identifying protein sectors has been previously described in <xref rid="msy223-B10" ref-type="bibr">Halabi et al. (2009)</xref>. In brief, the toolbox firstly calculated the degree of conservation of each amino acid in the alignment and then generated a positional correlation, a sequence correlation matrix, a spectral decomposition with analysis of the statistically significant eigenvalues and an independent component analysis. Finally, this method identified protein sectors and mapped them onto the primary structure of the toxin based on their position in the structure file.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
