We assessed the pathological and molecular characteristics of 94 higher-grade meningiomas (85 grade II, 9 grade III) to identify novel prognostic parameters. Higher mitotic count (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.018), diffuse (&#8805;50%) prominent nucleoli (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), and sheeting (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001) were associated with recurrence. Lower SSTR2a-positive cells median rate (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.048) and <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.014) were associated with recurrence and patient death, respectively; further analyses did not identify other outcome associations. Presence of Ki67 hot spots was associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS), independently of WHO grade at multivariate analysis (HR&#8201;=&#8201;3.35, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.008). Necrosis was related to a poorer overall survival (OS) at univariate (focal: HR&#8201;=&#8201;4.55, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.041 and diffuse: HR&#8201;=&#8201;7.38, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.020) and Kaplan-Meier analyses. A prognostic score was designed based on previous results: Presence of diffuse (&#8805;50%) prominent nucleoli (0/1 point), diffuse (&#8805;50%) sheeting (0/1 point), focal (&lt;50%) or diffuse (&#8805;50%) necrosis (0/1/2 points), and Ki67 hot spots (0/1 point). A total score &#8805;4 predicted poorer PFS and OS by Kaplan-Meier (PFS: 1.7 vs 6.4&#8201;years, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 and OS: 5.2 vs 10.8&#8201;years, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) and multivariate (PFS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;5.98, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 and OS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;2.99, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.048) analyses. These results were confirmed in an independent series of 58 grade II meningiomas (PFS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;7.22, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002 and OS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;9.69, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.003).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria, a tumor grade between I and III is assigned based upon the assessment of specific morphological features (<xref rid="nly127-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Diagnosis of atypical grade II meningioma is defined by an increased mitotic count (&#8805;4/10 high-power fields [HPF]) or histological evidence of brain invasion or the presence of 3 out of 5 characteristics: Prominent nucleoli, sheeting, hypercellularity, small cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, and foci of spontaneous necrosis. Grade III anaplastic meningiomas are defined by elevated mitotic activity (&#8805;20/HPF) or overtly malignant cytology. Also, some histotypes harbor an independent grading implication. Overall, higher-grade meningiomas (II and III) represent a significant subgroup of patients, amounting to 25% and 5% of all meningiomas, respectively (<xref rid="nly127-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;5</xref>).</p><p>Surgical resection is considered the first-line option for patients needing treatment and gross total resection should be achieved whenever possible, limiting patient observation to selected cases (i.e., small asymptomatic meningiomas). Although most grade I meningiomas are cured by resection alone, grade II and grade III tumors show high recurrence rates and may thus require adjuvant treatments (<xref rid="nly127-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Adjuvant radiotherapy is usually advised for incompletely resected grade II and for all grade III meningiomas (<xref rid="nly127-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); however, this approach is not universally agreed upon and grey zones do exist, thus making meaningful and reproducible prognostic factors especially warranted when tailoring patient treatment. For recurrent meningiomas, if additional surgery or re-irradiation is not feasible or indicated, medical therapies can be considered although efficacy is usually very limited (<xref rid="nly127-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#8211;11</xref>); however, this could change in the near future thanks to targeted approaches (<xref rid="nly127-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>WHO grading criteria suffer from subjective interpretation, which could explain the different frequencies of grade II and III tumors observed among institutions and, more importantly, the wide differences in patients&#8217; outcome reported within the same grade group. Although phospho-histone H3 (PHH3)-based mitotic count can improve interobserver reproducibility and prognostic stratification by increasing mitotic count reliability (<xref rid="nly127-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="nly127-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the evaluation of other criteria heavily depends on pathologists&#8217; subjective evaluation. Correlation between tumor grade and Ki67 labeling index is known, but at present it is not considered a grading variable (<xref rid="nly127-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, in our experience, a significant number of meningiomas show Ki67 hot spots (i.e., focal areas of high Ki67 labeling index) despite a low overall median index, but no data have been reported about the possible prognostic significance of this feature. Regarding other immunohistochemical prognostic factors, expression of the progesterone receptor was found to be associated with a better outcome, but its prognostic role could overlap with tumor grade (<xref rid="nly127-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Somatostatin receptors are commonly expressed by meningiomas and their prognostic role has been shown in other tumors (<xref rid="nly127-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In meningiomas, no relationship with outcome was found, but most of the analyzed cases were grade I meningiomas, thus it could be of interest to specifically evaluate a larger series of higher-grade meningiomas (<xref rid="nly127-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). More recently, the absence of H3K27 trimethylation, detected by immunohistochemistry, was found to be prognostic of a poorer outcome (<xref rid="nly127-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Besides morphological and immunohistochemical features, molecular factors could play a prognostic role as well. In particular, both DNA methylation-based classification (<xref rid="nly127-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="nly127-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (<italic>TERT</italic>) promoter mutations (a common alteration of many human cancers, although rare in meningiomas) (<xref rid="nly127-B20" ref-type="bibr">20&#8211;23</xref>) showed promising results. However, the cost of comprehensive molecular analyses like methylation-based classification is not negligible, thus its widespread implementation for routine diagnostic workup will require some time, especially for a pathology with a relatively high incidence like meningioma.</p><p>Lastly, most studies focused on discerning between benign (grade I) and aggressive (grade II&#8211;III) meningiomas, while only few data are available regarding possible prognosticators within the latter group, despite the potential clinical usefulness.</p><p>Thus, we analyzed a retrospective series of grade II and III meningiomas with the aim of improving their prognostic characterization. Specifically, we (<xref rid="nly127-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) assessed the prognostic significance of the morphological features currently used for meningioma grading adopting specific predetermined definitions and cut-off values; (<xref rid="nly127-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) evaluated the role of Ki67 labeling index (including the specific assessment of Ki67 hot spots), somatostatin receptor subtype 2a (SSTR2a) expression and <italic>TERT</italic> promoter status; and (<xref rid="nly127-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) built and evaluated an integrated score based upon the association of the previous variables and aimed at predicting patients&#8217; outcome in addition to WHO grade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case Series and Tissue Samples</title><p>Grade II and grade III meningiomas, diagnosed at the Pathology Unit of AOU Citt&#224; della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital of Turin between January 1994 and December 2015, were retrospectively collected.

Histological diagnosis was reviewed and confirmed by a senior neuropathologist (P.C.) according to the 2016 WHO classification. Follow up data were retrieved from patients&#8217; charts and the Piedmont Tumor Registry. The study was conducted in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans and within the guidelines and regulations defined by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Turin.

Small cell presence was defined as presence of meningioma cells with a size up to 3 times that of a lymphocyte, involving &#8805;5% tumor sample. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 (clone 30&#8211;9, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) and SSTR2a (clone UMB1, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were performed on the BenchMark ULTRA platform (Ventana Medical Systems). Ki67 labeling index was assessed by manually counting 1000 cells, while Ki67 hot-spots were arbitrarily defined as intermediate power fields (&#215;200) displaying at least a triple labeling index compared with the mean tumor labeling index. SSTR2a expression was evaluated both as the overall rate of positive cells and scored as previously described (<xref rid="nly127-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>): Score 0: absence of immunoreactivity; score 1: pure cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, either focal or diffuse; score 2: membranous reactivity in &lt;50% of tumor cells, irrespective of the presence of cytoplasmic staining; and score 3: circumferential membranous reactivity in &gt;50% of tumor cells, irrespective of the presence of cytoplasmic staining.</p></sec><sec><title>

PFS was calculated from the initial diagnosis until there was radiologically confirmed tumor progression, with data censored at the last available date of follow-up. OS was defined as the interval from the initial diagnosis until death, with data censored at the last available date of follow-up. All patient data were updated as of December 31, 2016. Survival distribution curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical comparisons were performed using the log-rank test. Cox regression analyses were carried out on PFS and OS to calculate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for the different study groups. A model was created for evaluating the prognostic role of different variables. The proportional hazard assumption was assessed with the Schoenfeld residuals which gave no reason to suspect violation of this assumption.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Clinical Characteristics</title><p>Ninety-four grade II and III meningiomas were retrospectively collected: 50/94 (53.2%) were female, median age at diagnosis was 61 (range: 25&#8211;83).

<italic>TERT</italic> Promoter Sequencing</title><p>
<italic>TERT</italic> promoter was successfully analyzed in 64/94 cases (68%). In the remaining cases (30/94, 32%), Sanger sequencing results were not conclusive or the available material was insufficient for analysis. Canonical <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations were detected in 5/64 (8%) cases (4 grade II and 1 grade III): The 1&#8201;295&#8201;228 C&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T (C228T) and the 1&#8201;295&#8201;250 C&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T (C250T) mutations, positioned respectively at 124 and 146 base pairs upstream of the ATG translational start site of <italic>TERT</italic>, were observed in 4/5 and 1/5 cases, respectively. In 23/64 (36%) noncanonical mutations were found, while the remaining 36/64 (56%) cases were wild type (<xref rid="nly127-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Approximately half of the cases (31/64 [48%]) cases harbored the rs2853669 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), while other SNPs were present in 9/64 (14%) cases (<xref rid="nly127-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Different SNPs were mutually exclusives. In our series, no association was identified between <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations and SNP or between them and clinical variables, histopathological features or outcome, except for <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations and patients&#8217; death (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.014 when considering canonical mutations [C228T and C250T]; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.045 when considering all the observed mutations). Regarding this association, 4/5 patients with canonical <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations were no longer alive at the end of follow up: 2 died because of meningioma progression, while the cause of death of the remaining 2 patients was not available.

Moreover, based on the results of this analysis, a possible prognostic score predictive of both PFS and OS is proposed and validated in an independent series. These results could prove useful for the management of these tumors in addition to WHO grade.</p><p>According to the latest WHO classification, grade II and III meningiomas represent 20%&#8211;25% and 1%&#8211;6% of all meningiomas (<xref rid="nly127-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), respectively, with a significant increment compared with the previous classifications (4.7%&#8211;7.2% for grade II and 1%&#8211;2.8% for grade III meningiomas) (<xref rid="nly127-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It is difficult to ascertain the exact reasons behind this rise, but changes in the diagnostic criteria probably played a significant role (<xref rid="nly127-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Whatever the reason, these data mean that the diagnosis of a higher-grade meningioma is a frequent occurrence in the clinical practice.</p><p>Higher-grade meningiomas, however, represent a peculiar grey zone both in terms of diagnosis and therapeutic management: The diagnostic criteria provided by the WHO classification are based, at least in part, upon a subjective evaluation and the clinical outcome can vary significantly among patients (<xref rid="nly127-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In fact, reliability and reproducibility of many of the diagnostic criteria have been extensively questioned over time (<xref rid="nly127-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="nly127-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and cut-off values or clear definitions are still lacking, possibly favoring diagnostic inconsistencies between different institutions. In our study, trying to overcome this limitation, morphological traits were evaluated according to predetermined qualitative/quantitative criteria.</p><p>In terms of patient follow up and treatment, current guidelines suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for partially resected grade II and all grade III meningiomas (<xref rid="nly127-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but the decision is not always easy, such as in completely resected grade II meningiomas with higher Ki67 labeling index. A better understanding of prognostic factors in this group of tumors is therefore warranted.</p><p>Our results show that only some of the routinely assessed morphological features are associated with tumor recurrence in higher-grade meningiomas: Higher mitotic count, diffuse prominent nucleoli and sheeting. In our series, no association was found between brain invasion and tumor recurrence. This parameter was added as a sufficient criterion for the diagnosis of atypical meningioma in the latest WHO classification based on its relationship with tumor recurrence (<xref rid="nly127-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), but conflicting evidence about its significance exists (<xref rid="nly127-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>); differences in meningioma resection technique and sampling could explain, at least in part, our results as well as the discrepancies reported in literature (<xref rid="nly127-B33" ref-type="bibr">33&#8211;36</xref>). Accordingly, extensive sampling could be recommended in future prospective studies to reduce this possible source of variability.</p><p>Reduced expression of somatostatin receptors in higher-grade meningiomas has been reported in literature (<xref rid="nly127-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A lower median rate of SSTR2a-positive cells was associated with tumor recurrence (40% vs 70%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.048) in our series, but we did not find significant associations between SSTR2a expression and other outcome measures.</p><p>
<italic>TERT</italic> promoter status is reported to be mutated in a minority of meningiomas. As initially showed by Koelsche et&#160;al, this alteration is usually present in higher-grade meningiomas (<xref rid="nly127-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Subsequent studies have demonstrated a relationship between this alteration and both malignant histological progression at recurrence (<xref rid="nly127-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and a shorter time to progression (<xref rid="nly127-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our analysis found an association with patient death (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.014 when considering canonical mutations only); recent data, specifically concerning nonbenign meningiomas, also support these negative prognostic correlations (<xref rid="nly127-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Considering the overall limited number of mutated cases even in atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, evaluation of <italic>TERT</italic> promoter status does not seem to be warranted in routine diagnostics, but it can be taken into consideration in selected cases. Moreover, we also wanted to check for any possible effect of the <italic>TERT</italic> rs2853669 SNP considering its high frequency in the general population (&#8764;50%), but no relationship with outcome was observed.</p><p>In terms of survival analysis, presence of Ki67 hot spots and necrosis resulted associated with PFS and OS, respectively. In our experience, presence of brisk Ki67 hot spots is a relatively common finding, even in meningiomas with low average Ki67 indices. The prognostic role of Ki67 labeling index in hot spots has been taken into consideration for many other tumors (<xref rid="nly127-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), but it is difficult to decide whether to integrate the hot spot index in the overall quantification or not (<xref rid="nly127-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). To overcome this problem, we decided to assess the prognostic significance of Ki67 hot spots presence irrespective of the specific labeling index values. In our series, this feature resulted significantly associated with a shorter PFS at univariate (HR&#8201;=&#8201;2.93) and Kaplan-Meier analyses (2.7 vs 8.3&#8201;years, log-rank test p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0103); even more interestingly, this association was confirmed at multivariate analysis (HR&#8201;=&#8201;3.35) and resulted independent of WHO grade. In the future, the role of Ki67 hot spots could also be explored in benign (grade I) meningiomas to verify if this variable could help distinguish a subgroup with worse outcome. Regarding necrosis, its extent is a well-known prognosticator in many tumors (<xref rid="nly127-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="nly127-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>): Thus, the observed association with a poorer OS is consistent with previous data.</p><p>In our case series, the variables associated with tumor recurrence differ from those associated with PFS/OS, likely due to sample size and to the overall limited strength of the associations. To overcome this limit, we reconsidered the factors associated with tumor recurrence (prominent nucleoli and sheeting), PFS (Ki67 hot spots) and OS (necrosis) in an integrated score. On the basis of previous results and to reduce subjectivity in evaluation, prominent nucleoli and sheeting were only considered if diffuse (&#8805;50% vs absent/&lt;50%). A score value &#8805;4 was associated with both poorer PFS and OS at univariate (PFS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;5.44 and OS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;4.03) and Kaplan-Meier (PFS: 1.7 vs 6.4&#8201;years and OS: 5.2 vs 10.8&#8201;years) analyses. These associations were also confirmed by multivariate analysis (PFS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;5.98, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 and OS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;2.99, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.048) and by validation in an external series (PFS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;7.22, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002 and OS: HR&#8201;=&#8201;9.69, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.003), thus this tool could provide valuable information, in addition to WHO grade. In particular, it could be useful for the management of grade II meningiomas or to &#8220;screen&#8221; cases in which additional testing, like DNA methylation-based classification, could be most useful. Further studies could specifically explore the reproducibility of this approach and possibly optimize the score parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="nly127_supp.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Francesca Veneziano and Chiara Musuraca for their excellent technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><title>Footnotes</title><fn><p>The authors have no duality or conflicts of interest to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="nly127s1"><title/><p>Funding was received by Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research (Ministero dell&#8217;Istruzione, dell&#8217;Universit&#224; e della Ricerca&#8212;MIUR): &#8220;Fondi di Ricerca Locale ex-60% 2016&#8211;2017&#8221; to C.B. and funding specifically dedicated to the Department of Medical Sciences, University&#160;of Turin under the programme &#8220;Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018 &#8211; 2022&#8221;, Project n&#176; D15D18000410001 and by the Dipartimento Rete Oncologica Piemonte e Valle d&#8217;Aosta to P.C.</p></sec><ref-list id="ref1"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="nly127-B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
