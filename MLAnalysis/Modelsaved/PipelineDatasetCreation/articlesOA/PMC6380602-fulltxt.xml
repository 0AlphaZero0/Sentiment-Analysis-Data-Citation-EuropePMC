Viral entry starts with virion attachment, and binding to receptors. Receptor binding viruses either directly release their genome into the cell, or enter cells through endocytosis. For DNA viruses and a few RNA viruses, the endocytosed viruses will transport from cytoplasm into the nucleus followed by gene expression. Receptors on the cell membrane play a crucial role in viral infection. Although several attachment factors, or candidate receptors, for the infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) were identified in shrimp, the authentic entry receptors for WSSV infection and the intracellular signaling triggering by interaction of WSSV with receptors remain unclear. In the present study, a receptor for WSSV infection in kuruma shrimp, <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic>, was identified. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with a transmembrane region, and is similar to the vertebrate polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR); therefore, it was designated as a pIgR-like protein (<italic>Mj</italic>pIgR for short). <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR was detected in all tissues tested, and its expression was significantly induced by WSSV infection at the mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of <italic>MjpIgR</italic>, and blocking <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR with its antibody inhibited WSSV infection in shrimp and overexpression of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR facilitated the invasion of WSSV. Further analyses indicated that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR could independently render non-permissive cells susceptible to WSSV infection. The extracellular domain of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR interacts with envelope protein VP24 of WSSV and the intracellular domain interacts with calmodulin (<italic>Mj</italic>CaM). <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR was oligomerized and internalized following WSSV infection and the internalization was associated with endocytosis of WSSV. The viral internalization facilitating ability of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR could be blocked using chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin dependent endocytosis. Knockdown of <italic>Mjclathrin</italic> and its adaptor protein <italic>AP-2</italic> also inhibited WSSV internalization. All the results indicated that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR-mediated WSSV endocytosis was clathrin dependent. The results suggested that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR is a WSSV receptor, and that WSSV enters shrimp cells via the pIgR-CaM-Clathrin endocytosis pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is one of the most virulent pathogens in shrimp farming.

It starts with virion attachment to the host cell membrane, followed by specific binding to receptors. Viral receptor engagement allows viruses either to release their genome into the cell directly at the plasma membrane, or to enter cells through endocytosis. Endocytosis is highly complex and dynamic, and involves recycling, trafficking, maturation and fusion of endocytic vesicles [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For DNA viruses and a few RNA viruses, the endocytosed viruses will traffic from cytoplasm into the nucleus for gene expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To enter the cytoplasm of host cells, viruses can adopt two main strategies, receptor-mediated endocytosis and endocytosis-independent receptor-mediated entry [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Viruses can use specific cell membrane receptors to enter and infect host cells, which determines the host specificity, tissue tropism and cell type a virus can infect [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several classes of molecules are utilized as receptors by different viruses, such as sialic acid moieties, integrins, and some immunoglobulin-like superfamily (IgSF) proteins in vertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some viruses use various types of receptors to attach to and enter into cells. For example, the receptors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection include heparin sulfate [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], low-density lipoprotein receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], transferrin receptor 1 [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], B type scavenger receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and occludin [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in mammals.</p><p>Cell-adhesion molecules can be divided into four protein families: Integrins, selectins, IgSF, and cadherins [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They are usually expressed on the cell surface and have diverse functions. Among them, the IgSF is a large protein superfamily of cell surface and soluble proteins that are involved in recognition, binding, adhesion, and immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IgSF members have diverged in sequence and function; however, the definitive characteristic of the members is the presence of one or more immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor identified in vertebrates is a member of the IgSF. As a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is widely expressed in epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The pIgR protein in different species shares four similar components: An intracellular region, a transmembrane region, a cleavage region, and an extracellular ligand-binding region (secretory component, SC) [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Ig domains are located in the extracellular region; therefore, the N-terminal ligand-binding domain plays central roles in binding polymeric immunoglobulins (pIg). PIgR acts as the receptor for pIg and transports pIgA/pIgM across intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, pIgR and SC-mediated protection prevent the invasion of pathogenic microorganism at mucosal surfaces [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Compared with polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), the domain architecture of the IgSF member from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic> is quite similar to vertebrate pIgRs.

These IgSF proteins can mediate adhesion through their N-terminal Ig-like domains, which usually bind other Ig-like domains of the same structure on the cell surface, or interact with other molecules, such as integrins and carbohydrates [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This suggested that the IgSF molecules could form homopolymers. In our study, we found that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR formed tetramer <italic>in vivo</italic> and interacts with VP24 of WSSV.</p><p>Several classes of molecules are exploited as receptors by diverse groups of viruses, including sialic acid moieties [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and integrins [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In particular, many IgSF proteins, such as pIgRs, have been identified as viral receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], such as the HIV receptor (T-cell surface glycoprotein CD<sub>4</sub>) [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], main rhinovirus receptors (intracellular adhesion molecule-1), and poliovirus receptor and adeno-associated virus receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, we found that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR interacted with VP24 of WSSV, and was used by WSSV as a receptor for its entry into cells.</p><p>As one of the key processes of infection, DNA virus entry into host cells requires distinct cellular processes, including attachment to receptors; signaling; movement of the virus on the cell surface; endocytic uptake and trafficking; and uncoating of the genome, followed by replication, and, finally, particle assembly and release [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Usually, virus entry starts with binding to attachment factors, followed by association with receptors. The attachment factors merely bind the viruses and thus help to concentrate the viruses on the cell surface. The virus receptors can trigger changes in the virus, induce cellular signaling, promote endocytosis, and accompany the virus into the cell. However, the differentiation of attachment factors and receptors is often difficult in practice because both of them contribute to effective infection. Many viruses have evolved multi-step attachment processes, and a requirement for more than one receptor molecule is not uncommon. An extreme example is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which requires more than ten molecules for cell entry [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For WSSV infection, Verbruggen et al. (2016) summarized the possible receptors or receptor complexes for WSSV, which include Chitin-binding protein, glucose transporter 1, integrin, calreticulin, and C-type lectins (such as <italic>Mj</italic>scCL, <italic>Mj</italic>LecA-C) [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, among the reported WSSV receptors, few molecules are genuine transmembrane proteins. We inferred that certain soluble molecules of the &#8220;receptors&#8221;, such as C-type lectin (<italic>Mj</italic>svCL, <italic>Mj</italic>LecA-C), Rab proteins, and Chitin-binding proteins, might be the attachment factors for WSSV, and that membrane proteins such as integrins [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and scavenger receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were the receptors for WSSV. In the present study, our results might hint that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR is not the only receptor involved in viral entry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007558.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the difference of survival rate of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR-silenced shrimp and the control group although shows significant, a moderate improvement in survival of the two groups is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007558.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). This might suggest that there are other receptors and pathways may function in WSSV adhesion/entry processes. To answer the questions, we knocked down the expression of <italic>&#946;-Integrin</italic> (a previously reported WSSV receptor) in shrimp, WSSV replication and survival rate were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The results showed that after knockdown of <italic>&#946;-Integrin</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), WSSV replication declined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) and survival rate of the shrimp was higher than that of control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Comparing the results of <italic>MjpIgR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007558.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and <italic>&#946;-Integrin</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007558.s005">S5C Fig</xref>) experiments, a similar moderate survival improvement was observed. These results suggested that like other viruses, WSSV has evolved multi-step attachment processes, and a requirement for more than one receptor in its infection. To date, however, no IgSF member has been reported to be a WSSV receptor. Therefore, this is the first report of a WSSV IgSF receptor.</p><p>Receptors play a crucial role in determining the cell specificity and tissue tropism of viruses. WSSV exhibits a much broader cell tropism and can infect most cell types from organs of ectodermal and mesodermal origin, including those of the epidermis, gills, foregut, hindgut, lymphoid organ, muscle, heart, and gonads [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As a transmembrane receptor, <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR was ubiquitously distributed in shrimp. The wide distribution of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR corresponded with WSSV&#8217;s broad cell tropism in shrimp. To ascertain whether <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR is the WSSV receptor, we detected the WSSV entry in non-permissive cells (HEK 293T) with <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR overexpression. The result showed that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR can independently render non-permissive cells (HEK 293T) susceptible to WSSV infection, and suggesting that <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR is one of the receptors of WSSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007558.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).</p><p>After binding to receptors on the cell surface, the enveloped virus can either penetrate the membrane directly by lipid fusion and membrane perforation, or enter the host cell by endocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. How does the endocytosis take place? The extracellular signal should be transferred to the cell cytoplasm by the receptor. The C-terminal intracellular domains of IgSF members often interact with cytoskeletal or adaptor proteins. This interaction can lead to the extracellular interaction signal being transmitted to the inside of the cells, which enables IgSF proteins to function in a wide range of biological processes [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the present study, we identified that the intracellular domain of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR interacts with calmodulin (<italic>Mj</italic>CaM). Several studies have reported that calmodulin could interact with clathrin [<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007558.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the immunocytochemical analysis, the membrane <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR moved to the cytoplasm. In addition, <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR and clathrin colocalized with WSSV in the cells. This suggested that the endocytosis of WSSV was pIgR-calmodulin-clathrin dependent. The AP-2 adaptor complex is a multimeric protein that has been considered one of the core components of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We also knocked down the AP-2&#945;, a large subunit of the complex, and found that WSSV replication and co-localization of <italic>Mj</italic>pIgR with VP28 were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007558.g009">Fig 9</xref>).
