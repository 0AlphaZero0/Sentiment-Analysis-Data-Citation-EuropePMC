numerous species. We previously indicated that particular behavioral traits contributing
to the genotype at the agouti locus manifest only when possessing a wild-type allele at
the albino (i.e., tyrosinase: <italic>Tyr</italic>) locus. The present study was performed
to investigate tyrosinase expression with marked activity in central nervous systems. The
whole brain of male B10 and B10-c mice, a B10 congenic strain of the albino locus from
BALB/c, at 8 to 9 weeks of age was removed, and obtained several regions of brain,
especially catecholaminergic. Comparatively large amounts of <italic>Tyr</italic> mRNA and
its translation products of approximately 68 kDa were found in the regions obtained, and
definitely possessed the enzyme activity for the oxidation of L-tyrosine. The present
results indicate the possibility that the amount of catecholamines produced in albino mice
is higher than that of colored mice due to the deficit in tyrosinase heritably.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>albino</kwd><kwd>central nervous system</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>tyrosinase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As of October 2011, there were 378 loci known to be correlated with the expression of coat
color phenotypes in mice, and genes of more than 150 have been cloned [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Among them, the <italic>c</italic> or albino (tyrosinase<italic>:
Tyr</italic>) locus located on mouse Chromosome 7 [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as an important determinant of the expression of coat color is known to encode
tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase: EC 1.14.18.1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic
pathway of melanin pigments [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The start point of
the melanin synthetic pathway is to oxidize the aromatic amino acid L-tyrosine by
tyrosinase, generally expressed in melanocytes of the skin, hair follicles, and the choroid,
ciliary body, and iris of the eye, and the retinal pigment epithelium [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>Tyr</italic> gene brings
about an albino phenotype characterized by a white coat and pinkish-red eyes. Representative
albino mouse strains such as inbred BALB/c or outbred ICR originated from Swiss strain mice
possess the classic albino mutation, <italic>Tyr<sup>c</sup></italic>, which is considered
to be a null mutation, explaining why the mutated protein has no activity <italic>in
vivo</italic> and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A point mutation in
<italic>Tyr<sup>c</sup></italic> is identified at the residue +387, G-to-C, which
results in the substitution of a cysteine for a serine residue at position 103 [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Meanwhile, a relationship between coat color and temperament, namely behavioral and
emotional characteristics, has been reported for several species. Much attention has focused
on the role of the specified subset of the gene locus, e.g., agouti locus, in the docility
of animals including foxes [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Norway rats [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and deermice [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many reports indicated the characteristic behavioral traits in mice with an
albino phenotype when compared with a colored mice [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We
also indicated that novel exploratory activity was suppressed in a manner dependent on the
frequency of the dominant wild-type allele at the agouti locus, and the allele-dependent
suppression was only observed in colored mice, and not in albino mice [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These reports point out that the governance of the
<italic>Tyr</italic> locus extends not only the apparent behavioral phenotype, but also
central nervous systems controlling behavioral traits markedly. However, the underlying
mechanism remains unclear. In particular, the detailed expression profiles have not been
confirmed whether tyrosinase in fact has enzyme activity in the central nervous system. The
aim of the present study was to investigate tyrosinase expression and its marked activity in
central nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and dissection of specific brain regions</title><p>C57BL/10JMsHir (B10) mice, and B10.C-<italic>Tyr<sup>c</sup></italic>/Hir (B10-c) mice, a

expresses in the brain regions observed. Particularly, the expression in Str was
approximately 39% of the skin, while no brain organs such as the adrenal and thyroid glands,
which produce biologically active substances from L-tyrosine, had extremely low levels.
Tyrosinase protein in accordance with the molecular weight observed in the skin was also
identified in the brain, and clearly possessed the enzyme activity for the oxidation of
L-tyrosine. In melanocytes, it is clear that the mouse tyrosinase gene consists of 5 exons
which contain protein-coding sequences in all exons, bracketing 4 introns, and processes
approximately 1.8 Kb mRNA, but over 10% of <italic>Tyr</italic> transcripts are generally
mis-spliced [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as described above. Furthermore, at
least twelve alternatively spliced transcripts of the <italic>Tyr</italic> gene have been
confirmed in melanocytes from wild-type mouse skin, which are considered to be variants with
loss-of-function [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The <italic>Tyr</italic> gene
that has been processed normally is translated as a 55-kDa protein, and the mature protein
is converted to about 67 to 75 kDa with glycosylation [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study,
<italic>Tyr</italic> mRNA detected in Str closely corresponded with the sequence of
<italic>Mus musculus</italic> tyrosinase mRNA (NM_011661) except for a variant skipping
exon 3, and the gene/translation products with an approximately 68-kDa molecular weight
possess oxidization properties for L-tyrosine. Meanwhile, another tyrosinase protein signal
of 62 kDa was detected only in the Hip of all B10 mice analyzed. Generally in melanocytes,
tyrosinase translational products undergo complex post-translational processing before
reaching the melanosomal membrane. In mice, this processing including N-glycosylation arises
in at least four of the six available sites for glycolsylation [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and abnormal glycosylation
is involved in the depigmented phenotype, indicating that the acquisition of enzymatic
activity is closely associated with the glycosylation state of tyrosinase. The present
results may indicate the possibility of distinct glycolsylation among brain regions. In
addition, primer pair Exon 1&#8211;3 failed to amplify any PCR products from LC, where is the
nuclei of origin of the noradrenergic neurons, not dopaminergic. Moreover,
<italic>Tyr</italic> mis-spliced transcripts were only found in FC and Str, even though in
dopaminergic neurons. These findings indicate the neuron- and/or region-specific expression
of <italic>Tyr</italic> gene, but remains unexplained.</p><p>The study of the relationship between albino mutation and behavioral traits began
approximately 50 years ago. Very earlier finding in relation to behavioral characteristics
observed in albino mice was regarded to be photophobia by a lack of retinal pigmentation
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, subsequent works using non-visual
learning tasks indicated behavioral differences between albino and non-albino mice, and
concluded that the behavioral traits in albino mice might be attributed to an inability to
respond efficiently to the environmental changes, rather than photophobia [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is
well-recognized that L-tyrosine as the start point of the melanin synthetic pathway is also
a major source of neurotransmitter catecholamines. In general, catecholaminergic neurons,
which include dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic neurons, are located in discrete
regions of the central nervous system and have an important role in a wide range of brain
functions, such as locomotion, sleep, memory, and learning. Particularly, the motility is
tightly governed by the substantia nigro-striatum dopaminergic system [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The present results provided the potential possibility that the
different behavioral traits observed in previous reports between non-albino and albino
strains is attributed to the amount of catecholamines produced and/or released into the
synaptic cleft, which was influences by the presence of tyrosinase.</p><p>As well as melanin pigments produced in melanocytes of the peripheral organs, neuromelanin,
which is thought to be an inert cellular by-product, is produced from L-tyrosine in specific
catecholaminergic neurons, noradrenergic and dopaminergic but not adrenergic [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In mice
with albinism, it is likely that much of the L-tyrosine is introduced by tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) into the catecholaminergic biosynthesis pathway, but fails to progress
toward neuromelanin because of the lack of tyrosinase, except for a simple autoxidation
pathway in both colored and albino mice. TH, the enzyme catalyzing the primary reaction in
catecholamine synthesis, can convert L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is the sole precursor of
the neurotransmitter catecholamines. Although an albino line of the TH-null embryo could not
be rescued unless pregnant dams received supplementation with catecholamine precursors,
catecholamines were readily detected in embryos or pups from a pigmented line of TH-null
mice [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings indicate and support the
hypothesis that tyrosinase participates in the oxidation of L-tyrosine in place of TH or in
coordination with TH [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In consequence, the amount
of catecholamines produced in albino mice is higher than that of colored mice, which are
eventual phenotypes reflected by the brain function, but it remains unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pdf_001"><caption><title>Supplement table</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="expanim-68-049-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e591" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Beninger</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name></person-group><year>1983</year>. <article-title>The role of dopamine in locomotor
