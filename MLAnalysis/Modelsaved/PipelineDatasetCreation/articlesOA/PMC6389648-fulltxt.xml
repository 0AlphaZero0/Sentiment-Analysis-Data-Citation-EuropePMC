Teleosts have been reported to possess two paralogs as a likely result of the teleost-wide whole genome duplication (WGD) event, but functional divergence of G-CSF paralogs remains poorly understood. Common carp are an allotetraploid species owing to an additional WGD event in the carp lineage and here, we report on genomic synteny, sequence similarity, and phylogeny of four common carp G-CSF paralogs (<italic>g-csfa1</italic> and <italic>g-csfa2</italic>; <italic>g-csfb1</italic> and <italic>g-csfb2</italic>). <italic>G-csfa1</italic> and <italic>g-csfa2</italic> show differential and relatively high gene expression levels, while <italic>g-csfb1</italic> and <italic>g-csfb2</italic> show low basal gene expression levels in most tissues. All paralogs are expressed higher in macrophages than in other leukocyte sub-types and are highly up-regulated by treatment of macrophages with mitogens. Recombinant G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 both promoted the proliferation of kidney hematopoietic cells, while only G-CSFb1 induced the differentiation of kidney cells along the neutrophil-lineage. Colony-forming unit assays revealed that G-CSFb1 alone stimulates the formation of CFU-G colonies from head- and trunk-kidney whereas the combination of G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 stimulates the formation of both CFU-G and CFU-GM colonies. Recombinant G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 also exhibit chemotactic activity against kidney neutrophils and up-regulation of <italic>cxcr1</italic> mRNA expression was highest in neutrophils after G-CSFb1 stimulation. Furthermore, G-CSFb1 more than G-CSFa1 induced priming of kidney neutrophils through up-regulation of a NADPH-oxidase component p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> administration of G-CSF paralogs increased the number of circulating blood neutrophils of carp. Our findings demonstrate that gene duplications in teleosts can lead to functional divergence between paralogs and shed light on the sub-functionalization of G-CSF paralogs in cyprinid fish.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>teleost</kwd><kwd>granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>respiratory burst</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="12764"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), also called colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), is a primary cytokine that promotes the proliferation, differentiation and survival of neutrophil progenitors and enhances trafficking and immunological functions of mature neutrophils in mammals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Human G-CSF is produced mainly by monocytes and macrophages (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), but is also produced by fibroblasts (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), endothelial cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and bone marrow stromal cells (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although healthy individuals express low G-CSF protein levels in serum, remarkable elevations of G-CSF production can be induced by several inflammatory stimuli, including increased presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and LPS during infections (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Effects are mediated by the binding of G-CSF with its cognate receptor G-CSFR on neutrophils and their progenitors, activating downstream signaling cascades and thereby influencing subsequent gene expression and cellular immune responses [reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)]. Mice lacking G-CSF/G-CSFR signaling (<italic>G-csf</italic>-deficient or <italic>G-csfr</italic>-deficient mice) exhibit a reduction in myeloid progenitors and impaired neutrophil mobilization into the circulation, resulting in chronic neutropenia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This suggests that G-CSF is a major regulator of neutrophil development and contributes to the regulation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. At the same time, G-CSF also influences the phenotype and function of mature neutrophils and does so by modulating expression of for example chemokine receptors, up-regulating phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing bactericidal activity of neutrophils (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>G-CSF was first purified and characterized in mice (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), only later followed by studies in non-mammalian vertebrates such as chicken (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), African-clawed frog (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and a number of teleost fish species including flounder, fugu, green-spotted pufferfish (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), black rockfish (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and zebrafish (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Owing to a teleost-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) event (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), teleost can generally be expected to express two G-CSF paralogs, type A (G-CSFa) and type B (G-CSFb), which may not necessarily have the same function. Indeed, zebrafish express an A and B paralog and earlier studies suggest that both G-CSFa and G-CSFb are required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) emergence and expansion of primitive and mature neutrophils and macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). <italic>G-csfr</italic> morphants were affected on early myeloid cell migration and development, but had functionally normal myeloid cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Zebrafish G-CSFb was involved in neutrophil mobilization toward an injury site (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), but the contribution of G-CSFa remained unclear. Therefore, the exact role of teleost G-CSF paralogs as regulators of diverse markers of neutrophil activation and/or regulators of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor development has remained unresolved.</p><p>In this study, we report on the molecular and functional characterization of G-CSF paralogs from the common carp. The close kinship of zebrafish and carp (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) allows for comparative use of genetic information from the well-described zebrafish genome whereas the large size of carp allowed us to perform cell type specific gene expression and <italic>ex vivo</italic> functional studies on large number of cells. Because common carp is an allotetraploid species owing to an additional WGD event in the carp lineage (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), we report on the cloning and molecular characterization of two type A copies (<italic>g-csfa1</italic> and <italic>g-csfa2</italic>) and two type B copies (<italic>g-csfb1</italic> and <italic>g-csfb2</italic>). For functional characterization we chose to produce recombinant proteins for two G-CSF paralogs particularly highly expressed in macrophages (G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1) and examined their ability to drive proliferation, differentiation and colony-formation of carp hematopoietic kidney cells along the neutrophil lineage. We also studied the effect of these G-CSF paralogs on neutrophil function including phenotype, chemotaxis and production of ROS. <italic>In vivo</italic> effects of G-CSF paralogs on circulating blood neutrophils were further investigated. We discuss the functions of teleost G-CSF regarding development, trafficking and activation of neutrophils and discuss the importance of studying paralogs of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Common Carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic> L.) were kept at Nihon University (NU) and at Wageningen University (WU).

Strikingly, G-CSF paralogs were always highest expressed in macrophages of carp.</p><p>Basal gene expression levels of <italic>g-csfa1</italic> in macrophages were higher than those of <italic>g-csfa2</italic> and gene expression levels of <italic>g-csfb1</italic> in macrophages were higher than those of <italic>g-csfb2</italic>, which prompted us to further investigate function of G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 by production of these molecules as recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins were produced in a bacterial expression system with the limitation that proteins are non-glycosylated and could possibly be contaminated with traces derived from bacteria. However, previous studies on mammalian G-CSF reported that glycosylation is not required for its activity and indeed, the non-glycosylated form is utilized in recombinant therapeutics (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Even though the relative insensitivity to LPS has been reported in fish living in the aquatic environment with high pathogenic pressure (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), the recombinant proteins used in our assays were extensively purified up to the absence of LPS traces. Similar to mammalian G-CSF and zebrafish G-CSF (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), carp G-CSF induced proliferation of hematopoietic cells in a dose-dependent manner, albeit with apparent different activities for the two paralogs studied: G-CSFa1 induced proliferation of blast-like cells adhesive to culture dishes, whereas G-CSFb1 induced proliferation of cells with neutrophil characteristics. Indeed, treatment with G-CSFb1 showed up-regulation of the transcription factor <italic>cebp</italic>&#945; involved in neutrophil development (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Also, we investigated at least two carp G-CSF receptor genes (data not shown) and found that only G-CSFb1 enhanced <italic>gcsfr1</italic> and <italic>myeloperoxidase</italic> (<italic>mpx</italic>) gene expression. Our data indicate that G-CSFb1 and G-CSFR1 are the main players involved with neutrophil development in carp. In zebrafish, both G-CSFa and G-CSFb may bind to the G-CSF receptor, expressed in both neutrophils and macrophages, and promote cell proliferation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In contrast to the latter study, carp G-CSFa1 alone did not stimulate colony formation in our semi-solid culture system, in which an agarose layer prevented natural formation of a stromal and an adherent cell layer. This possibly restricted access to spontaneously secreted growth factors from adherent macrophages (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), which are possibly required for colony formation. Further studies would be required to determine if G-CSFa1 directly induces macrophages to produce autocrine growth factors or that G-CSFa1 synergizes with some factors spontaneously secreted from adherent macrophages to synergistically stimulate macrophage development. Meanwhile, carp G-CSFb1 alone did stimulate CFU-G colony formation, whereas the combination of G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 stimulated formation of not only CFU-G but also CFU-GM colonies. Our data indicate that carp G-CSFb1 may drive granulopoiesis restricted to neutrophil-lineage development, whereas carp G-CSFa1 may be a cytokine with proliferative effect stimulating CFU-GM or earlier stem/progenitor cells. The functional differences between the G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 cytokine preparations make it highly unlikely that the induced cell responses could be due to traces of bacterial contaminations and thus appear cytokine-specific. No matter the indicative differences in biological function between paralogs, carp G-CSFs appears to act as a hematopoietic growth factors.</p><p>Mammalian G-CSF is chemo-attractive to neutrophils (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In zebrafish, G-CSFb but not G-CSFa could be linked to <italic>in vivo</italic> trafficking of neutrophils to the site of severe injury (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Our results indicate that carp kidney neutrophils are strongly attracted to G-CSFb1 and are moderately attracted to G-CSFa1, possibly under influence of IL-8 (or CXCL8) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Indeed, treatment of carp kidney neutrophil with G-CSF paralogs showed a significant up-regulation of CXCR1 as the IL-8 receptor required for neutrophil recruitment, but not CXCR2 required for neutrophil reverse migration and resolution (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Unlike mammalian G-CSF, carp G-CSF paralogs did not mediate transcription of CXCR4, important for retention of neutrophils in the hematopoietic tissue in mammalian models (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In conclusion, carp G-CSFb appears to be the most important G-CSF paralog to induce neutrophil migration.</p><p>Once neutrophils receive inflammatory cytokine signals, they become &#8220;primed&#8221; and capable of promptly and vigorously exerting antimicrobial responses (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). We could not find a significant change of phagocytic activity in neutrophils against beads and zymosan particles following stimulation of G-CSF paralogs for any period tested (data not shown), indicating that neutrophil phagocytosis is regulated by other signals in fish. Although mammalian G-CSF alone is not able to initiate a respiratory burst in na&#239;ve neutrophils, pre-incubation with this cytokine primes the cell for an enhanced superoxide anion production following stimulation with physiological stimuli such as fMLP and PMA (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). In fish, following stimulation of phagocytes with inflammatory cytokines, ROS production is activated through at least three sequential steps: (i) activation of protein kinase C (PKC), (ii) phosphorylation of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, and (iii) the production of ROS catalyzed by the NADPH oxidase complex (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In our hands, expression analysis of NADPH oxidase components in neutrophils treated with carp G-CSF paralogs exhibited up-regulation of especially p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>, indicating that the priming effect of carp G-CSF paralogs on neutrophils was regulated through the increase of p47<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>. Our study provides the first report in teleost fish on the priming effects of G-CSF on neutrophils and analysis of respiratory burst indicated that G-CSFb1 primed neutrophils more effectively than G-CSFa1.</p><p>Previous studies in cyprinids showed that circulating blood neutrophils increased in number 6 to 18 h after i.p. injection with killed <italic>E. coli</italic> or zymosan and then quickly decreased after 24 h, indicating that an intraperitoneal inflammation in fish induces a temporal mobilization of kidney-derived neutrophils into the circulation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In our study, administration of G-CSF paralogs increased the number of circulating blood neutrophils 6 and 24 h after i.p. injection, suggesting that also <italic>in vivo</italic> G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 work as chemoattractants and granulopoietic growth factors, in agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results. However, it remains unclear whether <italic>in vivo</italic> excess of G-CSF paralogs induce the expression of other inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines in immune cells. In human clinical medicine, recombinant G-CSF is used as a biophylatic agent to specifically induce granulopoiesis in patients with chemotherapy- and radiation-induced neutropenia to prevent bacterial and fungal infections (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Further studies will be required to investigate if fish G-CSF paralogs can act as biophylatic agents against infectious diseases in a similar way. Here, functional analyses were limited to G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1, and we can only speculate that G-CSFa2 and G-CSFb2 could have similar, different, or combinatorial functions in common carp. Additional biochemical investigations involving all native carp G-CSF paralog proteins will be needed to elucidate the full and complicated picture of immune regulation in this polyploid species.</p><p>In summary, we identified four carp G-CSF paralogs, studied their gene expression patterns and characterized the functional differences between A and B types of G-CSF on carp hematopoietic cells and neutrophils. We report important differences in their regulation: A type G-CSFs have a relatively high constitutive gene expression and could thus be involved in maintenance of a homeostatic state, whereas B type G-CSFs have a low gene expression and require induction and could thus have a responsive, immunological role associated with a state of infection. In general, G-CSFa1 alone stimulates proliferation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, while G-CSFb1 promotes proliferation, differentiation and colony formation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors and granulocyte progenitors in kidney of carp, similar to the G-CSF mammalian counterpart. G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 act as chemo-attractants to neutrophils modulating the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR1, suggesting a role for G-CSF paralogs in neutrophil trafficking. Both, G-CSFa1 and G-CSFb1 appear to induce neutrophil &#8220;priming.&#8221; The carp G-CSF paralogs reported herein provide us with valuable tools to further study the immune system of teleost fish.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FK and KN: conceived and designed the experiments; FK, KN, AW, and EH: performed the experiments; FK, KN, AW, JM, and MO: analyzed the data; FK, KN, AW, GW, and TM: wrote and edited the paper.</p><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors greatly appreciate Dr. Maria Forlenza and Mr. Jules Petit (Wageningen University) for helpful discussion and advice.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This work was supported in part by a Grant-in Aid for Young Scientists (B) (16K18752) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to FK and a grant of International joint research and training of young researchers for zoonosis control in the globalized world (S1491007) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan.
