Grade 3 events with neratinib were uncommon (&lt;&#8201;4%), and grade 4 events were rare (&lt;&#8201;1%). The incidence of dehydration in the neratinib group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) decreased over time, with the overall incidence of dehydration showing a marked drop-off as for grade 3 diarrhea. The incidence of weight loss in the neratinib group (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) appeared to show little correlation with the occurrence of diarrhea, and the number of events, predominantly grade 1, was consistently small throughout the study.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Clinical adverse events potentially associated with complicated diarrhea (safety population)</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Missing grades: vomiting (placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1), fatigue (placebo, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1), abdominal pain (neratinib, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2), and decreased appetite (neratinib, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Incidence of treatment-emergent <bold>a</bold> dehydration and <bold>b</bold> weight loss by grade over time in the neratinib group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13058_2019_1112_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par39">Blood chemistry results outside the normal range are summarized in Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5.

The observed rate of grade 3 neratinib-associated diarrhea was high, but had a distinct clinical course. Diarrhea tended to occur early (median time to onset 2&#8201;days for all-grade events), and most grade &#8805;&#8201;3 events occurred within the first month, with a marked drop-off in frequency thereafter. The cumulative duration of grade &#8805;&#8201;3 diarrhea with neratinib was short (median 5&#8201;days). Importantly, neratinib-associated diarrhea did not appear to adversely affect clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par42">In ExteNET, diarrhea was treated with loperamide when symptoms became apparent, and neratinib dose modifications were recommended in cases of grade 2 or 3 diarrhea. A structured regimen of loperamide prophylaxis during the first 1&#8211;2&#8201;cycles of neratinib therapy has since been shown to reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrheal events in the phase II CONTROL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] compared with those observed in ExteNET and is now recommended for the management of neratinib-associated diarrhea. In the CONTROL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], no diarrhea was reported in 20% of patients with loperamide prophylaxis versus 5% in ExteNET, and grade 2 or 3 diarrhea occurred in 55% of patients versus 72% in ExteNET; the median cumulative duration of any-grade diarrhea was 14&#8201;days in CONTROL versus 59&#8201;days in ExteNET. Efforts to further improve the effectiveness of loperamide prophylaxis are continuing through the addition of agents targeting inflammation (budesonide) and bile acid malabsorption (colestipol). Interim data suggest grade 3 diarrhea rates of 27% with loperamide plus budesonide and 11% with loperamide plus colestipol vs 40% in ExteNET, and treatment discontinuation rates due to diarrhea of 11% and 2% vs 17%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Even without antidiarrheal prophylaxis in ExteNET, neratinib-related diarrhea does not appear to follow a complicated course and is associated with little morbidity. Hospital admissions because of diarrhea (1.4%) and serious diarrheal events (1.6%) with neratinib were rare. A review of unsolicited post-treatment serious adverse events from ExteNET showed no serious late-term consequences from neratinib-associated diarrhea (e.g., renal insufficiency or chronic intestinal disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further, many of the signs and symptoms suggestive of complicated diarrhea (i.e., fever, sepsis, neutropenia, bleeding, and dehydration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were no more frequent with neratinib than placebo, and loss of fluids and changes in electrolytes, which can occur with persistent or severe diarrhea, also generally occurred at similar rates in both groups.</p><p id="Par44">ExteNET included a detailed evaluation of patient-reported outcomes using validated HRQoL questionnaires. According to these assessments, HRQoL impairment with neratinib was maximal at month 1, but returned toward baseline thereafter. These changes were likely attributable to the occurrence of diarrhea during month 1, although they were less than the MID threshold regardless of diarrhea grade, and so are not considered to be clinically meaningful. The FACT-B questionnaire does not include any diarrhea-specific questions and may not be sensitive enough to capture meaningful variations, although a clear incremental decrease in FACT-B total score was evident with increasing diarrhea severity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggestive of some sensitivity to this adverse event. Full HRQoL findings from the ExteNET study are reported separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The pattern of diarrheal events with neratinib appears to differ from other regimens. For pertuzumab, the time to the first onset of diarrhea occurs slightly later than that with neratinib (median 5&#8211;8&#8201;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] versus 2&#8201;days with neratinib); no data on duration of pertuzumab-associated diarrhea are published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For lapatinib, most first diarrhea events occur early (45% of patients within 6&#8201;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as for neratinib, but the median duration of each event appears to be longer (5&#8211;6&#8201;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] vs 2&#8201;days with neratinib). Limited data regarding chemotherapy-associated diarrhea suggest a different course of events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. HRQoL impairment with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea also appears to be greater than with neratinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Race was a prognostic factor for the occurrence of higher-grade diarrhea. Lower bodyweight among Asian patients may have contributed to this outcome, although body mass index was not a significant predictor of diarrhea in the same analysis. Another possible explanation is that Asian patients in ExteNET were less likely to discontinue study treatment because of adverse events compared with the overall safety population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This led to higher rates of some adverse events, including diarrhea, among Asian patients, although importantly efficacy outcomes among Asians were unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Whereas safety was a predefined secondary endpoint, some of the analyses described herein were exploratory. ExteNET included almost 3000 women from Europe, Asia, Americas, and Australasia; therefore, these findings are likely to be broadly generalizable to other populations with HER2-positive breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">In conclusion, neratinib-associated diarrhea has a distinct and predictable clinical course. Grade 3 events are generally short-lived and occur within the first month of treatment, permitting targeted preventive management with antidiarrheal prophylaxis early in the treatment course. Serious diarrheal events and hospital admissions because of diarrhea were rare, suggesting that most cases do not follow a complicated course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
