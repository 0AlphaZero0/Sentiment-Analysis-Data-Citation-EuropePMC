The Red&#946;&#160;CTD forms a three-helix bundle with unexpected structural homology to phage &#955; Orf, a protein that binds to <italic>E. coli</italic> single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) to function as a recombination mediator. Based on this relationship, we found that Red&#946; binds to full-length SSB, and to a peptide corresponding to its nine C-terminal residues, in an interaction that requires the CTD. These results suggest a dual role of the CTD, first in binding to &#955;&#160;Exo to facilitate loading of Red&#946;&#160;directly onto the initial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at a 3&#8242;-overhang, and second in binding to SSB to facilitate annealing of the overhang to SSB-coated ssDNA at the replication fork.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1616105</award-id><award-id>DGE1745303</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>T32GM118291</award-id><award-id>GM122459</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">United States Department of Energy</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-02ER63445</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteriophage &#955; encodes a simple &#8216;SynExo&#8217; (synaptase-exonuclease) recombination system for repair of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks by a single strand annealing (SSA) mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This system, called Red for recombination defective, consists of two proteins: a 5&#8242;-3&#8242;exonuclease, &#955; Exo, that binds to DNA ends and resects the 5&#8242;-strand (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and a synaptase, Red&#946;, that binds the resulting 3&#8242;-overhang to anneal it to a complementary strand from another copy of the chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#8211;6</xref>). In most cases, annealing is thought to occur at a target site that is exposed as ssDNA on the lagging strand of a replication fork (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A third protein, Gam, binds and inactivates the host RecBCD enzyme, to prevent it from degrading the phage genome (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Interest in &#955; Exo and Red&#946; stems in part from their distant homologies with the mammalian recombination proteins Dna2 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and Rad52 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;14</xref>), respectively. The proteins have also been exploited in powerful methods for bacterial genome engineering, most notably recombineering (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Interestingly, &#955; Exo and Red&#946; bind to one another to form a complex that is required for recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). While its exact role is unknown, the complex may serve to integrate the two steps of the SSA reaction, end-resection and annealing, by physically loading Red&#946; onto the 3&#8242;-overhang as it is generated by &#955; Exo. Such a function would be closely analogous to the loading of RecA onto 3&#8242;-overhangs generated by RecBCD (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Model for phage &#955; Red recombination.

The C-terminal domains of each Red&#946; monomer each bind to the &#955; Exo trimer, leaving the N-terminal domains free to bind the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang. According to the model, as the &#955; Exo trimer moves along the DNA from right to left, it loads Red&#946; monomers onto the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang, one after another.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1309fig1"/></fig><p>Little is known about the structure of the &#955;&#160;Exo&#8211;Red&#946; complex. It has an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry, as initially observed by co-purification of the proteins from cell lysates (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The dissociation constant of 7.9 &#956;M measured by isothermal titration calorimetry is consistent with a transient interaction, as implied by the loading mechanism described above (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering suggested a molecular weight ranging from 100 to 800 kDa for the complex (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These differences may arise in part from the dynamic oligomerization behavior of Red&#946;. While &#955; Exo forms a stable trimer under all conditions tested, Red&#946; exists in a variety of different oligomeric states, ranging from monomers (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), to closed rings (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), split lock washers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and helical filaments (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Red&#946; consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28&#8211;29</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD), residues 1&#8211;177, shares distant homology with Rad52 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12&#8211;14</xref>) and is responsible for oligomerization and DNA binding (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The C-terminal domain (CTD), residues 183&#8211;261, shares no significant homology with other proteins, exists as a monomer that does not bind to DNA, and forms the complex with &#955; Exo (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Based on this apparent separation of function, we reasoned that a minimal complex formed by &#955; Exo and just the CTD of Red&#946; might be more amenable to crystallization, but still recapitulate the essential features of the intact complex. To this end, we have determined the crystal structure of &#955; Exo in complex with the Red&#946; CTD. The structure shows the residues of each protein at the interface, and thus provides a framework for mutational analysis, to test the role of the complex in promoting recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>. The structure also reveals an unexpected relationship between the CTD of Red&#946; and phage &#955; Orf (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), a protein that binds to SSB to function as a recombination mediator. Based on this relationship, we found that Red&#946; binds to full-length SSB and to a peptide corresponding to the SSB C-terminus. Through mutational analysis, we established that this interaction is required for recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The gene fragment encoding Red&#946; CTD residues 183&#8211;261 was cloned between the <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pET14b to express an N-terminally 6His-tagged protein with an intervening site for thrombin cleavage (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

The two plasmids were transformed into separate batches of BL21(AI) cells (Life Technologies), and grown in 3 &#215; 1 L cultures at 37&#176;C. When the optical density (O.D.) at 600 nm reached 0.5, expression was induced by addition of 0.2% arabinose (pET14b) or 0.2% arabinose and 0.2 mM IPTG (pET28b). After shaking at 37&#176;C for 4 h post-induction, cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 &#215; g, re-suspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), and frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C.

After incubating at 4&#176;C for 1&#160;h, cells were lysed by sonication on ice for 3 &#215; 3 min using a Branson sonifier at full power, 30% duty. The resulting mixed cell lysate was centrifuged at 48 000 &#215; g three times for 30 min, and the final clarified supernatant was loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 2 &#215; 5 ml HisTrap chelating FF column charged with nickel (GE Healthcare) at 4&#176;C. After extensive washing with sonication buffer, the complex was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mM imidazole in sonication buffer. Fractions containing purified complex were mixed with 100 units of thrombin (GE Healthcare) and dialyzed overnight at 22&#176;C into 4 L of PBS buffer (20 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The resulting protein mixture was clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 &#215; g and loaded back onto the HisTrap FF column. The untagged complex bound loosely to the column and was eluted with low (30 mM) imidazole. Pooled fractions containing purified complex were dialyzed at 4&#176;C into 20 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0, concentrated to 25 mg/ml, and frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C in 100 &#956;l aliquots.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Crystallization and x-ray structure determination</title><p>The complex was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion using a reservoir solution consisting of 25% PEG 3350, 0.2M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&#160;and 0.1M Bis&#8211;Tris pH 6.0, and a hanging drop consisting of 1.5 &#956;l of reservoir mixed with 1.5 &#956;l of 10 mg/ml complex (diluted in 20 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0). Prior to data collection, crystals were exchanged into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of reservoir solution with PEG 3350 increased to 27% and glycerol added to 10%. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops and flash frozen in a nitrogen cryostream at 100&#160;K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.30 &#197; resolution using a Rigaku Compact home source consisting of a MicroMax 003 X-ray generator and a PILATUS3 R 200K detector. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with HKL3000 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Crystals belong to space group P3<sub>1</sub>21 with one complete &#945;<sub>3</sub>&#946;<sub>3</sub> hexamer complex per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the MOLREP function (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) in CCP4 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and the &#955;&#160;Exo trimer (PDB code 1AVQ; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) as a search model. After an initial round of restrained refinement with REFMAC5 version 5.8.0131 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) at 2.3 &#197; resolution, the R- and free R-factors were reduced to 26.0 and 30.0%, respectively, and the resulting electron density maps showed clearly traceable density for three Red&#946; CTDs, one bound to each subunit of the&#160;&#955; Exo trimer. An atomic model for one of the Red&#946; CTDs was built using COOT (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and transformed to the other two non-crystallographic symmetry-related positions. Multiple iterative rounds of refinement and model building reduced the <italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> to 19.5 and 25.3%, respectively. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used in early rounds of refinement, but completely released in later rounds. The weighting term in REFMAC5 was adjusted to achieve the lowest free <italic>R</italic>-factor, and eventually set to 0.05. Side chains for which electron density was weak or absent (at a 0.8&#963; contour level) were truncated to the C&#946; atom. The final model consists of 6910 protein atoms, 604 water molecules (one for every 1.4 protein residues), and 16 sulfate anions.

The complex was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, using N-terminally 6His-tagged Red&#946; CTD (residues 183&#8211;261) to pull-down full-length, untagged &#955; Exo (residues 1&#8211;226). The structure, which contains an &#945;<sub>3</sub>&#946;<sub>3</sub> hexamer in each asymmetric, was refined at 2.30 &#197; resolution to <italic>R</italic>- and free <italic>R</italic>-factors of 19.5 and 25.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The &#955; Exo trimer itself does not undergo any significant conformational changes in the complex relative to the structures of free &#955; Exo (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) or its complex with DNA substrate (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The Red&#946; CTD folds into a 3-helix bundle, as expected from secondary structure prediction and circular dichroism, which suggested a predominance of &#945;-helix (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Residues 183&#8211;194 of the CTD construct in the crystal are disordered in all three copies, in agreement with their being flagged as a low complexity region by sequence analysis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In full-length Red&#946;, these residues are presumably part of a flexible linker connecting the N- and C-terminal domains.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Structure of the complex. (<bold>A</bold>) View from the back of the &#955; Exo trimer, looking into the channel from which the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang would emerge.

The three Red&#946; CTDs are shown in green, each bound to a single &#955;&#160;Exo subunit at the periphery of the complex. (<bold>B</bold>) Side view of the complex, from the left of panel A. The paths of the dsDNA substrate and ssDNA product are indicated. Notice that the C-terminal domains are bound on the side of the &#955; Exo trimer from which the 3&#8242;-overhang would emerge, and that the N-terminal domains, which would connect to Thr-195 (labeled for the CTD in front), would be well positioned to bind to the emerging ssDNA.

The first ordered residue of each CTD (Thr-195), to which the N- terminal DNA binding domain would connect, also points to this side of the trimer. By contrast, the last residue of each CTD points to the opposite side of the trimer, the side at which the dsDNA substrate would enter. Thus, as the N-terminal DNA-binding domains of each Red&#946; monomer would be ideally positioned to bind to the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang as it emerges from the &#955;&#160;Exo trimer, the overall geometry of the complex is consistent with the loading mechanism proposed above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Although no DNA is present in the crystal, modeling of a DNA duplex into the central channel of the &#955; Exo trimer shows that it does not overlap with any of the three copies of the CTD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), as expected from the proposed function.</p><p>A total solvent accessible surface area of 1,400 &#197;<sup>2</sup> is buried at the interface between each Red&#946; CTD and its respective subunit of the &#955; Exo trimer. The interaction mainly involves helix E of &#955; Exo, which wedges into a groove between helices 2 and 3 of the CTD. Specifically, a hydrophobic ridge on the surface of helix E, formed by Thr-90, Leu-91, Phe-94&#160;and Thr-95, inserts into a pocket formed by Leu-223, Ile-227, Phe-249&#160;and Leu-250 of the CTD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This central core of hydrophobic interactions is shielded on one side by a network of electrostatic interactions between Gln-226 and Arg-229 of the CTD, and Gln-83, Asp-87&#160;and Thr-90 of &#955; Exo. On the other side, additional hydrogen bonds are formed, between Gln-252, Lys-253, and Glu-256 of the CTD and Leu-184, Phe-94&#160;and Tyr-186 of &#955; Exo, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>,&#160;D). Lys-253 caps the C-terminal end of helix E to form a charge-dipole interaction that could be particularly stabilizing. A complete listing of all interacting residues is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. Examination of this table shows that the details of the interactions are remarkably consistent across the three independent copies of the CTD in the crystal.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Interactions at the hydrophobic core of the interface are required for complex formation</title><p>To determine the importance of individual residues forming contacts at the interface, a Ni-spin pull-down assay was performed (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), in which 6His-tagged &#955; Exo was used to pull down full-length, un-tagged Red&#946;. Although this assay is qualitative, it allows us to test a large number of mutants without having to purify the proteins, and also tests the interaction in the presence of other cellular components. The two proteins were individually expressed in separate cell cultures, and supernatants from mixed cell lysates were loaded onto each Ni-spin column. A total of 5 &#955; Exo variants at 3 residues and 10 Red&#946; variants at 8 residues were chosen for analysis, based on their location at the interface. A non-interfacial residue, Lys-132 of the NTD of Red&#946;, was included as a control. Most of the mutations result in truncation of a side chain to alanine. For residues forming the central core of hydrophobic interactions, Leu-91 and Phe-94 of &#955; Exo and Leu-223 and Phe-249 of Red&#946;, mutations to both alanine and an acidic side chain (aspartate or glutamate) were introduced. This was intended to test for simple removal of each nonpolar side chain, as well as a more drastic alteration to a charged residue.</p><p>The results of the Ni-spin pull down for each variant are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. All 15 mutants were expressed in soluble form at similar levels as the WT proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes labeled &#8216;S&#8217;). Although soluble expression does not confirm proper folding in the same way that circular dichroism would, it does provide a qualitative assessment of folding, as mis-folded proteins would likely be insoluble. Note that WT 6-His &#955; Exo protein and most of its variants were only marginally soluble. A few of the variants, in particular D87A, L91D and F94A, may have increased solubility, which for L91D and F94A could arise from truncation of exposed apolar side chains. However, the amount of soluble WT &#955;&#160;exo seen in the &#8216;S&#8217; lane also varied in the experiments with different Red&#946; variants, indicating that it may just be sensitive to exact experimental conditions. This variation does not detract from the pull-down experiment however, as 6His-&#160;&#955; Exo protein is always enriched in the elution fractions.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effects of mutations on complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The SDS-PAGE gels (stained with Coomassie) show the results of a Ni-spin assay in which 6His &#955; Exo was used to pull down un-tagged, full-length Red&#946; from mixed cell lysates. An experiment for the two WT proteins is shown at the top left, while results using variants of Red&#946; or &#955; Exo with the respective WT version of the partner protein are shown at the lower left and right, respectively.

This was true for both the alanine and the acidic variants at each of these positions, indicating that simple removal of any one of these four nonpolar side chains is enough to disrupt the complex completely, at least as seen by this assay. By contrast, mutation of residues forming the more peripheral electrostatic interactions, including Asp-87 of &#955; Exo, and Gln-226, Arg-229, Gln-252, Lys-253&#160;and Glu-256 of Red&#946;, did not have any observable effect on complex formation. In summary, these results show that while the central core of hydrophobic interactions is essential for complex formation, the surrounding network of electrostatic interactions is not.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Variants of &#955; Exo and Red&#946; that disrupt complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic> are defective for recombination <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To determine if the complex is required for recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>, the 15 variants of &#955; Exo and Red&#946; described above were tested in dsDNA and ssDNA recombination assays developed previously (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41&#8211;43</xref>). Due to a high degree of variance, even for WT, these assays are not good at detecting small differences in activity among protein variants, but they are good for identifying mutants with large effects. Briefly, DNA encoding kanamycin resistance was electroporated into <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing &#955; Exo and Red&#946; under the control of arabinose, and the number of colonies was counted to score for recombination efficiency. Western blot analysis confirmed that all 15 variants were expressed at similar levels as the WT proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). For dsDNA recombination, the electroporated DNA was a linear PCR-generated &#8764;2 kb neomycin cassette with 50 bp terminal homologies to a target site on a plasmid. For ssDNA recombination, a 100-mer oligonucleotide targeting the lagging strand was used to correct a 4 nt insertion within a neomycin resistance gene on a bacterial artificial chromosome. Whereas dsDNA recombination requires both &#955; Exo and Red&#946; for full activity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), ssDNA recombination only requires Red&#946; (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Therefore, we expected that mutations disrupting the complex would potentially disrupt dsDNA recombination, but not ssDNA recombination.</p><p>For dsDNA recombination, the WT proteins resulted in 8.4 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> recombinants per 10<sup>8</sup> viable cells (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Controls with no arabinose, no DNA, or a Red&#946; deletion gave zero colonies. Deletion of &#955; Exo however did not completely abolish recombination: the number of colonies was 6% of WT. This result is qualitatively consistent with previous data (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47&#8211;48</xref>), and is presumably due to productive resection of the linear input dsDNA by one or more endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> nucleases (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Interestingly, variants of &#955; Exo that were defective for complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (L91A, L91D, F94A and F94E) resulted in only 0.6&#8211;3% of the activity of WT, an even greater reduction than the &#955;&#160;Exo deletion. Apparently, resection of the input dsDNA by &#955;&#160;Exo without coordinated loading of Red&#946; results in either degradation or folding of the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang, so as to block access of Red&#946;. However, it is conceivable that these mutations could also be affecting exonuclease activity, which could in and of itself reduce recombination, particularly if they were to bind and block the dsDNA ends. To rule out this possibility, the purified F94A and L91A variants of &#955;&#160;Exo were tested for their exonuclease activities, and found to be fully active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Variants of Red&#946; that were defective in complex formation (L223A, L223D, F249A and F249D) resulted in similarly low levels of recombination, 0&#8211;0.7% of WT. Collectively, these results show that the protein-protein interaction is indeed required for dsDNA recombination, and further suggest that when &#955; Exo resects the input dsDNA without coordinated loading of Red&#946;, the nascent 3&#8242;-overhang is either unprotected and degraded, or folds up on itself to become inaccessible to annealing.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>

However, one of the variants of Red&#946; that could still form the complex, K253A, gave surprisingly low activity, only 0.2% of WT. As will be discussed below, it is likely that this mutation disrupts an additional function of the CTD, one that is required for recombination, but distinct from its role in binding to &#955; Exo.</p><p>For ssDNA recombination, the WT proteins resulted in 1.0 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> recombinants per 10<sup>8</sup> viable cells, slightly higher than for dsDNA. Controls with no arabinose, no DNA, or a Red&#946; deletion again resulted in no recombinants. Deletion of &#955; Exo resulted in no significant reduction in recombination compared to WT, consistent with previous data showing that &#955;&#160;Exo is dispensable for ssDNA recombination (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Accordingly, all five of the &#955; Exo variants tested were at least as active as WT (some even more so). Surprisingly however, over half of the Red&#946; variants tested, including all that were defective for complex formation, as well as K253A, resulted in dramatically lower levels of ssDNA recombination, only 0.4&#8211;3.5% of WT. This was unexpected, because the mere presence of &#955; Exo, let&#160;alone its interaction with Red&#946;, is not required for ssDNA recombination (the &#955;&#160;Exo deletion was fully active). Four of the Red&#946; variants tested, Q226A, R229A, Q252A and E256A, gave comparable levels of ssDNA recombination as WT, ranging from 13 to&#160;101%. Notably, these four variants also retained high activity for dsDNA recombination.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that the complex is indeed required for dsDNA recombination, but not for ssDNA recombination. However, they also suggest the possibility that the site on the Red&#946; CTD used for binding to &#955;&#160;Exo overlaps with another function of the CTD, one that is necessary for both dsDNA and ssDNA recombination. In the following section, we present data suggesting that this other function may be binding to SSB.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Unexpected homology between the Red&#946; CTD and phage &#955;&#160;Orf</title><p>As described above, the Red&#946; CTD consists of &#8764;67 residues that form a 3-helix bundle. Sequence comparisons of the CTD do not reveal significant homology with other known proteins.

Orf was the top hit from the Dali search, and the only hit for which a functional parallel was apparent.

Although it is not known if the site for binding SSB on Orf is within the three-helix core that shares homology with Red&#946;, the structural similarity suggests the possibility that the Red&#946; CTD may have a similar function as Orf in binding to SSB, perhaps to facilitate access of the NTD to SSB-coated ssDNA.

To test if this other function is binding to SSB, Ni-spin pull downs were performed using 6His-SSB to pull down untagged Red&#946; variants with two of these mutations, K253A and F249D. As shown in Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, both variants completely failed to interact with SSB. This result suggests that the site on the CTD for binding to &#955; Exo overlaps with the site for binding to SSB. Many proteins that interact with SSB bind to its C-terminal tail (C-tail), particularly the last residue of the protein, Phe-177 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54&#8211;58</xref>). To test if this residue is also used for the interaction with Red&#946;, Ni-spin pull downs were performed using the F177A variant of 6His-SSB to pull down untagged Red&#946;. As shown in Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, the F177A mutation completely disrupts the interaction. All together, these results establish an interaction between Red&#946; and SSB that requires the Red&#946; CTD and the SSB C-tail.</p><p>To quantify the binding of Red&#946; to the SSB C-tail, fluorescence anisotropy titrations were performed with purified Red&#946; and a fluorescein-labeled peptide corresponding to the last nine residues of SSB (SSB-Ct). As a positive control, ExoI bound tightly to SSB-Ct with an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 98 &#177; 5 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Red&#946; also bound to SSB-Ct, but less tightly, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 10.6 &#177; 2.3 &#956;M (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and&#160;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). By contrast, &#955; Exo, used as a negative control, showed no interaction with SSB-Ct. Interestingly, neither the individual N- nor the C- terminal domains of Red&#946; showed the interaction with SSB-Ct, indicating that binding requires both domains (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The K253A and F249D variants of Red&#946; also failed to interact with the SSB-Ct peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), in agreement with the results from the Ni-spin pull downs. Moreover, a previously purified variant of Red&#946; lacking the C-terminal 11 residues, Red&#946;<sup>1&#8211;250</sup> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), also lost the ability to bind to SSB-Ct (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Based on the structure of the CTD this deletion would be expected to disrupt its folding, as the deleted residues form part of helix 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Finally, a variant of the SSB-Ct peptide with the F177A mutation was tested for binding to Red&#946;, and it completely failed to interact (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These results, together with the Ni-spin pull downs, suggest that the SSB C-tail binds to the Red&#946; CTD at a site that overlaps with &#955; Exo-binding site.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Fluorescence anisotropy titrations of Red&#946; with SSB-Ct peptide. (<bold>A</bold>) Full-length Red&#946;, its N- and C- terminal domains, or &#955; Exo were titrated into 20 nM fluorescein-labeled SSB-Ct peptide (FAM-WMDFDDDIPF).

To test if this is the case, the complex of &#955;&#160;Exo with full-length Red&#946;&#160;was purified, and titrated into the SSB-Ct peptide to test for binding. Since &#955; Exo is present at equivalent levels as Red&#946; in this experiment (it is a 1:1 complex), and is thus in large excess over the 20 nM peptide, we expected it to block binding of the SSB-Ct peptide. However, an increase in anisotropy was still observed, although only to about half the level observed for Red&#946; alone. Thus, although &#955; Exo did not completely block binding of Red&#946; to the SSB-Ct peptide, it did have a significant effect on the interaction (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Fitting of the titration data for the complex resulted in a similar affinity as Red&#946; alone (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 12.8 &#177; 3.5 &#956;M), even though the anisotropy level was reduced (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and&#160;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The lower anisotropy suggests that the size of the Red&#946;-&#955; Exo complex is smaller than that of the oligomer formed by Red&#946; alone, or that the peptide is bound differently, with the fluorophore more exposed. We do not at present understand the significance of this result, but it is conceivable that the sites on the CTD for binding &#955; Exo and SSB are not completely overlapping, such that the SSB-Ct can still bind in the presence of &#955; Exo. Alternatively, given the high density of negative charge on the peptide, it is also possible that it binds to a new site that is formed in the complex, through non-specific electrostatic interactions.</p><p>In summary, these results reveal an interaction between Red&#946; and SSB that occurs through the Red&#946; CTD and the SSB C-tail. They further suggest that the site on Red&#946; for binding to the SSB C-tail involves both the N- and C-terminal domains of Red&#946;, and that the site on the CTD overlaps with the site for binding to &#955;&#160;Exo. As will be discussed below, this interaction suggests a secondary role of the CTD in helping the NTD to access SSB-coated ssDNA at the replication fork, presumably by binding and displacing SSB, as seen for several other <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54&#8211;58</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Homologs of &#955; Exo and Red&#946; are often encoded as pairs in the genomes of dsDNA bacteriophage, implying that their functions are coordinated. It is well established that both proteins are required for dsDNA recombination (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which is the likely function for which the recombination system has evolved, presumably to generate concatemers of the genome for packaging (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). That the two proteins form a complex was first observed for phage &#955; (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and subsequently for RecET of the <italic>E. coli rac</italic> prophage (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The functional importance of the complex has largely been inferred from experiments showing that combining SynExo proteins from different sources as heterologous pairs, such as &#955; Exo and RecT or RecE and Red&#946;, does not result in successful recombination (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, due in part to a lack of structural information, mutations in &#955; Exo and Red&#946; that specifically disrupt the complex, without affecting other activities of the proteins, have not yet been identified, and thus the functional consequences of disrupting the complex have not been fully assessed.</p><p>In this work, we present the first structural data on the &#955; Exo-Red&#946; interaction. The structure clearly defines the residues of each protein at the interface and provides a framework for designing mutations that are specifically defective in complex formation. Based on this analysis, we have identified variants at two residues of &#955; Exo, Leu-91 and Phe-94, which are completely defective for complex formation, but fully active as exonuclease enzymes. The fact that these variants are strongly and specifically defective for dsDNA recombination supports the conclusion that the complex is essential for function. Mutations in Red&#946; designed by the same rationale were also defective for dsDNA recombination, but non-specifically: they also disrupted ssDNA recombination, presumably by affecting other activities of the protein, such as binding to SSB (see below).</p><p>The structure of the complex also permits mapping and interpretation of prior mutational data. Our group showed that deletion of the C-terminal 11 residues of Red&#946; (to make Red&#946;<sup>1&#8211;250</sup>) completely disrupts the interaction with &#955; Exo, as well as both dsDNA and ssDNA recombination (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The structure shows that this truncation would remove about 1/3 of helix 3 of the CTD, which would very likely disrupt folding. Stewart and colleagues identified four individual mutations in the CTD (E191A, Q252A, E256A, K258A) that decreased dsDNA more than ssDNA recombination, implicating the corresponding residues as being at the interface with &#955;&#160;Exo (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). While two of these residues, Gln-252 and Glu-256, are indeed at the interface, the other two, Glu-191 and Lys-258, are not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>). Another mutation from this study, Q240A, disrupted dsDNA and ssDNA equally, and weakened (but did not abolish) the interaction with &#955; Exo. The structure shows that Gln-240 is not at the interface, but could be important for folding of the CTD, as it forms hydrogen bonds that bridge helices 1&#160;and 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the involvement of helix E of &#955; Exo in forming the complex with Red&#946; had been predicted, based on its exposed location and its homology with a helix in type II restriction endonucleases that is used for dimerization (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). That this is the key region of &#955;&#160;Exo that is used for the interaction with Red&#946; is quite remarkable and speaks to the power of using distant evolutionary relationships to predict protein function. Helix E was also identified as being involved in the interaction by a separate study that used pepSPOT&#8482;&#160;analysis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, several alanine mutations on this helix (L91A, F92A, E93A, F94A and T95A) had little if any effect on the complex in that study, as seen by co-immunoprecipitation, and only mild effects (at most a 2-fold reduction) on dsDNA recombination (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). By contrast, our data show that the L91A and F94A variants are completely defective in complex formation, and severely reduced in dsDNA recombination. We do not at present understand why the results from the two studies are different.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that the crystal structure used just the CTD of Red&#946;, as opposed to the full-length protein. In our structure, the minimal complex exists as an &#945;<sub>3</sub>&#946;<sub>3</sub> hexamer, which would be 165 kDa for the full-length proteins. However, biophysical measurements of the size of the complex indicate that it may be considerably larger, perhaps as large as 800 kDa (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The larger complexes could arise from interactions between the N-terminal domains of Red&#946;, which are known to oligomerize (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28&#8211;29</xref>). The extent to which these larger complexes would exist under cellular conditions however, is unclear (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Also unclear is whether or not the N-terminal domain of Red&#946; participates at all in the interaction with &#955; Exo. Previous data from our lab by Ni-spin pull down showed a clear interaction between &#955;&#160;Exo and the Red&#946; CTD, but no interaction with the NTD (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, Stewart and colleagues identified a region within residues 20&#8211;38 of the NTD that affected complex formation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It is conceivable however that this region is involved in interactions between the N-terminal domains themselves, which could stabilize the complex indirectly, through cooperativity. The structure tends to support the conclusion that the NTD does not form direct interactions with &#955;&#160;Exo, because the first residue of each CTD (Thr-195), to which each NTD would connect, points away from the interface with &#955;&#160;Exo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, as the linker connecting the two domains (residues 178&#8211;194) is likely to be flexible, direct contacts between the N-terminal domains and &#955;&#160;Exo cannot be ruled out.</p><p>An unexpected result from our analysis was the number of&#160;mutations in the Red&#946; CTD that severely reduced ssDNA recombination. Since ssDNA recombination does not even require the presence of &#955; Exo (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), let&#160;alone its interaction with Red&#946;, and the mutations were designed to specifically disrupt the complex, the effect on ssDNA recombination was not expected. However, such mutations in the CTD are not unprecedented. We previously demonstrated that deletion of the last 11 residues of the CTD completely disrupts ssDNA recombination (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and Stewart and colleagues showed that similar C-terminal truncations, as well as mutations at several positions within the CTD, affected ssDNA recombination (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). An interesting observation from our analysis is that the three residues of Red&#946; at which mutations significantly reduced ssDNA recombination (Leu-223, Phe-249&#160;and Lys-253) cluster together on the surface of the CTD, whereas the four residues where there was little effect, Gln-226, Arg-229, Gln-252&#160;and Glu-256, are more peripheral (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The mutational data thus appear to identify a surface of the CTD, overlapping with the surface used for binding to &#955; Exo, that is used for another necessary function of the protein.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Surface view of the Red&#946; CTD showing the binding site for &#955; Exo, which may overlap with a binding site for SSB-Ct.

Residues mutated in this study are shown in cyan if the mutation disrupted ssDNA recombination, or magenta if not. The residues in cyan thus map out a putative site for binding SSB-Ct.

The surface is colored red for negative and blue for positive (&#177;75 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>). The positive charge around Lys-253 binds to the C-terminal end of helix E of &#955; Exo, and putatively to the C-terminus of SSB.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1309fig7"/></fig><p>What could this function be? Prior data from our lab demonstrated that the CTD has no interaction with ssDNA or dsDNA, no interaction with itself (it is a monomer), and no interaction with the NTD (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The structure of the CTD reveals an unexpected homology with &#955;&#160;Orf, a protein that binds to SSB and facilitates binding of RecA to SSB-coated ssDNA (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Based on this relationship, we hypothesized that Red&#946; may also bind to SSB, and found that it binds to both full-length SSB, by Ni-spin pull down, and to a peptide corresponding to the SSB C-tail, by fluorescence anisotropy. The interaction with the C-tail requires both domains of Red&#946;, implying that there is indeed a binding site for the SSB C-tail on the surface of the CTD. Interestingly, the surface on the CTD that is used for binding to &#955; Exo includes a hydrophobic pocket with a neighboring positively charged residue (Lys-253; Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), which is similar to the surfaces used by several other proteins for binding the SSB C-tail (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54&#8211;58</xref>). A key residue of the SSB C-tail in these structures is the terminal phenylalanine (Phe-177), which binds through hydrophobic interactions with its phenyl ring, and electrostatic interactions with its negatively charged carboxylate. One could envision this residue of SSB binding to the CTD through very similar interactions, by taking the place of Phe-94 of &#955;&#160;Exo to bind to the hydrophobic pocket and Lys-253 (Figure&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The observation that the interaction between Red&#946; and SSB is completely disrupted by the K253A and F249D mutations in Red&#946;, and by the F177A mutation in SSB, is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>While Red&#946; displays a moderate affinity for the SSB-Ct peptide (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 10.6 &#956;M), especially as compared to ExoI&#160;(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 98 nM), its affinity is comparable to that of other proteins that interact with SSB, such as RecQ and DNA Pol III, which bind to similar peptides with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 6 and 2.7 &#956;M, respectively (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The different affinities of these proteins for SSB could arise from their different biological functions, which may require a tighter or weaker interaction with SSB, depending on the context. It is also possible that some of these proteins interact with other parts of SSB, in addition to the C-tail, to enhance their affinities.</p><p>If this surface on the CTD of Red&#946; is indeed a site for binding the SSB C-tail, then one might expect the equivalent surface on &#955; Orf to also bind the SSB C-tail. However, mutational analyses have not been able to define the SSB-binding site on Orf, and one study concluded that the SSB C-tail is not required for the interaction (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). On the other hand, the Orf homolog YbcN from <italic>E. Coli</italic> cryptic prophage DLP12, does require the C-tail for its interaction with SSB (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), suggesting that this surface on these proteins may be functionally conserved. Along these lines, residues of the CTD that form the hydrophobic pocket at the center of this surface (Leu-223, Ile-227, Phe-249&#160;and Leu-250), are predominantly conserved as apolar residues in &#955;&#160;Orf and YbcN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, this pocket on Orf is partially plugged by a &#946;-hairpin from the other subunit of the dimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), such that binding of the SSB C-tail to the equivalent pocket on Orf would likely require conformational changes.</p><p>If Red&#946; can bind and displace SSB on its own, as our data indicate, then what is the role of Orf in phage &#955; recombination? De Paepe <italic>et&#160;al.</italic> demonstrated that an Orf deletion causes a 10-fold decrease in Red&#946; dependent recombination with resident prophage during a phage &#955; infection. The authors suggested that in the absence of Orf, Red&#946; may be unable to access DNA coated by SSB (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Orf is not present in the recombination assay that we used, and our data clearly show that a productive interaction between Red&#946; and SSB can occur in the absence of Orf. However, the potential effect of Orf on this recombination system has not yet been tested, and it is conceivable that Orf could bind to SSB and somehow modify it to allow for easier displacement by Red&#946;.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest a dual role for the CTD, first in binding to &#955;&#160;Exo to facilitate loading of Red&#946; directly onto the 3&#8242;-overhang of the first DNA molecule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and second in binding to SSB to gain access to the ssDNA exposed on the second DNA molecule, likely at the lagging strand of a replication fork (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). While direct demonstration of these processes will require further biochemical studies, our mutational data suggest that both of these interactions are required for dsDNA recombination, while only the latter activity, binding to SSB, is required for ssDNA recombination. The crystal structure of the Red&#946;&#160;CTD and its complex with &#955; Exo now provide a framework for probing these activities in more detail.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A revised model for phage &#955; Red recombination that includes an interaction with SSB.
