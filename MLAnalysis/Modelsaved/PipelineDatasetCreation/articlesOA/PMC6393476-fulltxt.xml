Here, we use single cell transcriptomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify changes in cellular activity states&#160;across&#160;30 cell types and chart the lung proteome of young and old mice. We show that aging leads to increased transcriptional noise, indicating deregulated epigenetic control. We observe cell type-specific effects of aging, uncovering increased cholesterol biosynthesis in type-2 pneumocytes and lipofibroblasts and altered relative frequency of airway epithelial cells as hallmarks of lung aging. Proteomic profiling reveals extracellular matrix remodeling in old mice, including increased collagen IV and XVI and decreased Fraser syndrome complex proteins and collagen XIV. Computational integration of the aging proteome with the single cell transcriptomes predicts the cellular source of regulated proteins and creates an unbiased reference map of the aging lung.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Aging impacts lung functionality and makes it more susceptible to chronic diseases.

As the organ with the largest surface area (~70&#8201;m<sup>2</sup> in humans), the lung is constantly exposed to a plethora of environmental insults. A range of protection mechanisms are in place, including a highly specialized set of lung-resident innate and adaptive immune cells that fight off infection, as well as several stem and progenitor cell populations that provide the lung with a remarkable regenerative capacity upon injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These protection mechanisms seem to deteriorate with advanced age, since aging is the main risk factor for developing chronic lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and interstitial lung disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Advanced age causes a progressive impairment of lung function even in otherwise healthy individuals, featuring structural and immunological alterations that affect gas exchange and susceptibility to disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Aging decreases ciliary beat frequency in mice, thereby decreasing mucociliary clearance and partially explaining the predisposition of the elderly to pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Senescence of the immune system in the elderly has been linked to a phenomenon called &#8216;inflammaging', which refers to elevated levels of tissue and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in the absence of an immunological threat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Several previous studies analyzing the effect of aging on pulmonary immunity point to age-dependent changes of the immune repertoire as well as activity and recruitment of immune cells upon infection and injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Vulnerability to oxidative stress, pathological nitric oxide signaling, and deficient recruitment of endothelial stem cell precursors have been described for the aged pulmonary vasculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of old lungs features changes in tensile strength and elasticity, which were discussed to be a possible consequence of fibroblast senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Using atomic force microscopy, age-related increases in stiffness of parenchymal and vessel compartments were demonstrated recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>; however, the causal molecular changes underlying these effects are unknown.</p><p id="Par4">Aging is a multifactorial process that leads to these molecular and cellular changes in a complicated series of events. The hallmarks of aging encompass cell-intrinsic effects, such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and senescence, as well as cell-extrinsic effects, such as altered intercellular communication and extracellular matrix remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The lung contains potentially at least 40 distinct cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and specific effects of age on cell-type level have never been systematically analyzed.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we build on rapid progress in single-cell transcriptomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> which recently enabled the generation of a first cell-type resolved census of murine lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, serving as a starting point for investigating the lung in distinct biological conditions as shown for lung aging in the present work. We computationally integrate single-cell signatures of aging with state-of-the-art whole lung RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry-driven proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> to generate a multi-omics whole organ resource of aging-associated molecular and cellular alterations in the lung.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Lung aging atlas reveals deregulated transcriptional control</title><p id="Par6">To generate a cell-type resolved map of lung aging we performed highly parallel genome-wide expression profiling of individual cells using the Dropseq workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> which uses both molecule and cell-specific barcoding, enabling great cost efficiency and accurate quantification of transcripts without amplification bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Single-cell suspensions of whole lungs were generated from 3-month-old mice (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;8) and 24-month-old mice (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7). After quality control, a total of 14,813 cells (7672 young, 7141 old) were used for downstream analysis (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Quality metrics including number of unique molecular identifiers (UMI), genes detected per cell, and reads aligned to the mouse genome were comparable across mice (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>a&#8211;c). To ensure that cell-type discovery is not confounded by aging effects, we only used highly variable genes between cell types (see Methods for details). Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 36 distinct clusters corresponding to 30 cell types, including all major known epithelial, mesenchymal, and leukocyte lineages (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). We observed very good overlap across mouse samples (Silhouette coefficient: &#8722;0.074) and most clusters were derived from &gt;70% of the mice of both age groups (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">e</xref>). The definition of cell types (clusters in <italic>t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) map) was very comparable between old and young mice, indicating that the cell-type identity was not strongly confounded by the aging effects (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Two clusters exclusively contained cells from a single mouse and were removed from downstream analysis. Interestingly, we identified even rare (&lt;1%, 43 cells) cell types such as megakaryocytes, which were recently identified as an unexpected tissue-resident cell type in mouse lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Of note, some samples contributed as little as a single cell to this megakaryocyte cluster, emphasizing the power and accuracy of the computational workflow used here for data integration from multiple mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A single-cell atlas of mouse lung reveals major cell-type identities. <bold>a</bold> Experimental design&#8212;whole lung single-cell suspensions of young and old mice were analyzed using the Dropseq workflow. <bold>b</bold> The <italic>t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) visualization shows unsupervised transcriptome clustering, revealing 30 distinct cellular identities. <bold>c</bold> The dotplot shows (1) the percentage of cells expressing the respective selected marker gene using dot size and (2) the average expression level of that gene based on unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts.

The clusters were annotated with assumed cell-type identities based on (1) known marker genes derived from expert annotation in literature and (2) enrichment analysis using Fisher&#8217;s exact test of gene expression signatures of isolated cell types from databases including ImmGen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and xCell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Correlation analysis of marker gene signatures revealed that similar cell types clustered together, implying correct cell-type annotation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">We used the matchSCore tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> to compare the cluster identities of our dataset with the lung data in the recently published Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and found very good agreement in cluster identities and annotations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Moreover, when comparing our cluster identities to the MCA peripheral blood data, only weak correspondence was observed (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), which was similar in the MCA peripheral blood versus MCA lung comparison (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). One notable exception in this comparison is the cluster of red blood cells in our dataset which achieved high correspondence with the MCA peripheral blood cluster annotated as Erythroblast_Hbb-a2_high. The red blood cells serve as a control and illustrate matchSC values for a correct overlap (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that very little blood-derived contamination was present.</p><p id="Par9">Additionally, we noticed one cluster of mainly proliferating cells showing high expression levels for S and G2M cell-cycle marker genes (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">b</xref>). Young mice showed a higher fraction of cells in this cluster compared to old mice (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>; Generalized linear binomial model, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Next, we isolated this cluster and corrected the gene expression levels for cell-cycle phase (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3 d</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">e</xref>). Subsequent unsupervised clustering analysis revealed that these proliferating cells belong to T cells, type-2 pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3f&#8211;i</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">It was suggested that aging is a consequence of increased transcriptional instability rather than the result of a coordinated transcriptional program, and that an aging-associated increase in transcriptional noise can lead to fate drifts and ambiguous cell-type identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we quantified transcriptional noise following previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and accounted for differences in total UMI counts and cell-type frequencies (see Methods for details). We observed an increase in transcriptional noise with aging in most cell types (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To further exclude technical confounding we additionally averaged the transcriptional noise scores per mouse and obtained highly concordant results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To further substantiate this finding we quantified transcriptional noise in an alternative manner using Spearman's correlations between cells. This analysis confirmed our finding that transcriptional noise is increased with aging (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>) and is in line with previous reports in the human pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or mouse CD4+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Most cell types show increased transcriptional noise with aging. <bold>a</bold> Boxplot illustrates transcriptional noise by age and cell type for the indicated number of cells.

To compare the whole lung bulk transcriptome with single-cell data we generated in silico bulk samples from the scRNA-seq data by summing expression counts from all cells for each mouse individually (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis from in silico bulks and real whole lung bulk sequencing revealed a total of 2362 and 9245 differentially expressed genes (negative binomial generalized linear model, false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;10%) between the two age groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a, b</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Again, most gene categories regulated by age were showing the same direction in transcriptome and proteome so that the positive Pearson's correlation of the annotation enrichment scores was highly significant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We observed several hallmarks of aging, including a decline in mitochondrial function and upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways (&#8216;inflammaging&#180;).

Many extracellular matrix genes, such as collagen III, were downregulated on both the mRNA and protein levels, while the levels of all basement membrane-associated collagen IV genes were increased on the protein level, but decreased at the mRNA level in both transcriptome datasets (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and in proximity ligation in situ hybridization of mRNA in tissue sections (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). The differential regulation of collagen IV transcripts and proteins highlights the importance of combined RNA and protein analysis.

We analyzed age-dependent alterations of relative frequencies of the 30 cell types represented in our dataset. Since the cell-type frequencies are proportions, the data are compositional. Therefore, it is impossible to statistically discern if a relative change in cell-type frequency is caused by the increase of a given cell type or the decrease of another. However, after performing dimension reduction using multidimensional scaling of the cell-type proportions, we observed a significant association between the first coordinate and age (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>; Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.005), indicating that cell-type frequencies differed between young and old mice. Interestingly, the Dropseq data showed a relative increase in ciliated cells in old mice so that the ratio of club to ciliated cells was altered (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>). Relative frequency differences in scRNA-seq data can be biased by tissue isolation artifacts. We therefore validated the change in club to ciliated cell proportions by deconvolving the whole lung bulk expression data using our single-cell gene expression profiles (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Indeed, we found that the ciliated cell marker genes signature was significantly upregulated in old compared to young mouse lungs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

In order to better understand age-related chronic lung diseases such as COPD, lung cancer, or fibrosis, intense efforts in integrated multi-omics systems biology tools for the analysis of lung aging are needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this work, we present a single-cell survey of mouse lung aging and computationally integrate single-cell transcriptomics data with bulk proteomics and transcriptomics of whole lung to build a draft of an atlas of the aging lung. Atlasing efforts are generally organized in stages so that more detailed maps of cellular phenotypes will be integrated at later stages to initial drafts of the atlas. The intention in this study was to perform an integrated analysis of aging effects at a depth of current state of the art of proteomics and transcriptomics. The lung aging atlas and associated raw data can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://theislab.github.io/LungAgingAtlas">https://theislab.github.io/LungAgingAtlas</ext-link> (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). It features five dimensions that can be navigated through gene and cell type-specific queries: (1) cell type-specific expression of genes and marker signatures for 30 cell types, (2) regulation of gene expression by age on cell-type level, (3) cell type-resolved pathway and gene category enrichment analysis, (4) regulation of protein abundance by age on tissue level, and (5) regulation of protein solubility by age.</p><p id="Par25">The highly multiplexed nature of droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing used in this study allows the direct analysis of thousands of individual cells freshly isolated from whole mouse lungs, providing unbiased classification of cell types and cellular states. Two previous studies have analyzed aging effects using single-cell transcriptomics and found increased transcriptional variability between cells in human pancreas and T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, we identify aging-associated increased transcriptional noise, which may result from deregulated epigenetic control, in most cell types of the lung, indicating that this phenomenon is a general hallmark of aging that likely affects most cell types in both mice and humans. This concept is supported by our study and it will be interesting when and how future investigations will shed light on the molecular mechanisms driving this phenomenon.</p><p id="Par26">We have used three independent cohorts of young and old mice and uncovered remarkably well-conserved aging signatures in both mRNA and protein. Thus, the three datasets validate each other and show that (1) single-cell analysis can be highly representative of biological changes in total tissue, and (2) the analysis of protein and mRNA content can lead to overall similar results with important differences. Hallmarks of aging, such as the downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, were consistently observed in all datasets. On the level of individual genes/proteins, however, we often observed interesting differences, which indicates that for functional analysis of a particular gene/protein, it remains essential to also analyze the protein, which ultimately executes biological functions.</p><p id="Par27">The example of basement membrane collagen IV genes that were all downregulated on the mRNA level but upregulated on the protein level illustrates that protein post-transcriptional regulation is indeed important. In particular, the abundance of ECM proteins, which often have long half-lives and are thus likely more often regulated on the posttranscriptional level, could frequently show decoupling of protein and mRNA. Next to mass spectrometry-based methods, single-cell methods combining mRNA and protein analysis, such as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, will become ever more important in the near future. We show that the combination of single cell-resolved mRNA analysis and bulk proteomics is highly complementary using the single-cell expression data to understand the most likely cellular origin of proteins that showed altered abundance with age.

Traditional antibody-based methods for single-cell protein analysis in situ are however not well multiplexed and do not easily scale for high throughput.

Recent proteomic studies identified at least 150 different ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and modifying enzymes in the lung, and these assemble into intricate composite biomaterials that are characterized by specific biophysical and biochemical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Due to this complexity of the ECM, both in terms of composition and posttranslational modification and the assembly of ECM proteins into supramolecular structures, it is presently unclear on which level and how exactly the aging process affects the lung ECM scaffold. We used detergent solubility profiling to screen for differences in protein crosslinking and complex formation within the ECM. Surprisingly, most solubility profiles were not significantly altered with age, indicating that aging-related ECM remodeling does not involve large differences in covalent protein crosslinks. However, we observed a few very strong changes in the ECM which have not yet been reported in the context of aging and are open for future investigation into their functional implications.</p><p id="Par29">In order to stabilize the alveolar structure during breathing-induced expansion and contraction, type-2 pneumocytes produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant, which is a thin film of phospholipids and surfactant proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Thus, it is possible that part of the chronic inflammation we observed in the aged lung is influenced by deregulation of lipid homeostasis. The inflammatory phenotype may also be related to epithelial senescence, as mice with a type-2 pneumocyte-specific deletion of telomerase, and thus premature aging with increased senescence in these cells, developed a pro-inflammatory tissue microenvironment and were less efficient in resolving acute lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">In summary, we have demonstrated that the lung aging atlas presented here contains a plethora of information on molecular and cellular scale and serves as a reference for the large community of scientists studying chronic lung diseases and the aging process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par31">Pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River and housed in rooms maintained at constant temperature and humidity with a 12&#8201;h light cycle.

As infrequently discussed in the community but not yet addressed, we also observed &#8216;ambient mRNA' effects, which we believe are the consequence of free mRNA released from dying cells hybridizing with beads in droplets during the microfluidic capture of single cells in the Dropseq workflow. The ambient mRNAs are typically derived from highly abundant transcripts and this artifact is inherent to all droplet-based methods (including the commercially available 10&#215; platform). Here, it can be exemplified by the <italic>Scgb1a1</italic> gene in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> that is known to be highly specific for club and goblet cells but was nevertheless detected in almost 100% of the cells in our data. However, the UMI count levels were much higher in club and goblet cells (representing the real source of expression), indicating that the mRNA counts observed in all other clusters were of ambient mRNA background. To independently confirm this we therefore determined all genes that showed ambient mRNA background by analyzing the identity of genes on beads at the tail-end of the total UMI count distribution (on average 10 UMIs per barcode), representing empty beads that were never in contact with a real cell but nevertheless contain information from free-floating ambient mRNA. We identified 153 genes (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>) with an &#8216;ambient mRNA' effect and accounted for this effect in the cell type-resolved differential expression analysis (see below for details).</p><p id="Par40">To aid the assignment of cell type to clusters derived from unsupervised clustering, we performed cell-type enrichment analysis. Cell-type gene signatures obtained from bulk-level gene expression were downloaded from the ImmGen and xCell resources.

Mouse gene symbols were capitalized to map to human gene symbols.

For each cell type with at least 10 old and young cells, we quantified transcriptional noise in the following manner. To account for differences in total UMI counts, all cells were downsampled so that all cells had equal number of total UMI counts. To account for differences in cell-type frequency, cell numbers were down-sampled so that equal numbers of young and old cells were used. Next, genes were divided into 10 equally sized bins based on mean expression and the top and bottom bins excluded. Within each bin, the 10% of genes with the lowest coefficient of variation were selected. Subsampled raw count data were reduced to this set of genes and square-root transformed. Next, the euclidean distance between each cell and the corresponding cell-type mean within each age group was calculated. This euclidean distance was used as one measure of transcriptional noise for each cell. Additionally, we average the euclidean distances for each mouse and calculated the transcriptional noise ratio between young and old mice. Alternatively, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients on the down-sampled expression matrices across all genes between all pairwise cell comparisons within each cell type and age group. To be consistent with the sign of the metric we used 1&#8211;Spearman correlation coefficient as the second measure of transcriptional noise. To statistically assess the association between transcriptional noise and age within each cell type, Wilcoxon&#8217;s rank sum test was used.

Counts were transformed to proportions using the DR_data() function of the DirichletReg R package which causes the values to shrink away from extreme values of 0 and 1. Next, the mouse-wise euclidean distances were calculated based on these proportions using the dist() R function followed by multidimensional scaling using the isoMDS() R function. To statistically assess the association between age and the first coordinate derived from the multidimensional scaling, Wilcoxon test was applied. Relative changes in cell-type frequencies were calculated by subtracting the median cell-type proportion of the young mice from the cell-type proportions of the old mice.</p><p id="Par44">Cell type-resolved differential expression analysis was performed using the Seurat differential gene expression testing framework. Within each cell type, cells were grouped by age and differential testing performed using the Seurat FindMarkers() function. By inspecting barcodes with a very low number of UMI counts, we identified 153 potential ambient mRNAs. However, these mRNAs could represent true housekeeper genes which are constitutively expressed in all cells. Therefore, we removed 41 mRNAs which showed no cell type-specific expression effect (log2 fold change&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1) in any of the cell types in the cell-type marker discovery analysis from this list. Next, to avoid differential testing of a gene in a cell type where expression levels are driven by the ambient effect, cell type-resolved differential expression testing of the remaining 112 ambient mRNAs was limited to cell types in which the ambient mRNA showed moderate cell type-specific expression (adjusted <italic>p</italic> value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.25).</p><p id="Par45">The one-dimensional annotation enrichment analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> was used for cell type-resolved pathway analysis.

As fixed modification cysteine carbamidomethylation and as variable modifications, hydroxylation of proline and methionine oxidation was used. False discovery rate was set to 0.01 for proteins and peptides (minimum length of seven amino acids) and was determined by searching a reverse database. Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine, and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed in the database search. Peptide identification was performed with an allowed precursor mass deviation up to 4.5&#8201;ppm after time-dependent mass calibration and an allowed fragment mass deviation of 20&#8201;ppm. For label-free quantification in MaxQuant the minimum ratio count was set to two. For matching between runs, the retention time alignment window was set to 30&#8201;min and the match time window was 1&#8201;min.
