According to U&#8217;s triangle, <italic>B. juncea</italic> (AABB genome, 2n&#8201;=&#8201;4&#215;&#8201;=&#8201;36) is the allotetraploid derived from the diploid species <italic>B. rapa</italic> (AA, 2n&#8201;=&#8201;2&#215;&#8201;=&#8201;20) and <italic>B. nigra</italic> (BB, 2n&#8201;=&#8201;2&#215;&#8201;=&#8201;16) and arose by natural hybridization and chromosome doubling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This mustard plant can be used in phytoremediation to remove heavy metals and metalloids, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cesium (Cs), and uranium (U), from the soil in hazardous waste sites. Thus, Indian mustard (<italic>Brassica juncea</italic>), a high-biomass-producing plant, has been broadly used as a model system to investigate the physiology and biochemistry of metal and radionuclide accumulation in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism of the hyperaccumulation phenotype remains unclear. HMA4 may play a significant role in the hyperaccumulation-related characteristics of hyperaccumulator species, at least within Brassicaceae plants.</p><p id="Par14">HMA4 (heavy metal ATPase 4) is a member of the type 1<sub>B</sub> heavy metal-transporting P-type ATPase subgroup, whose members transport the divalent cations Cd, Pb (lead), Zn, and Co (cobalt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To date, this divalent class of transports exists only in prokaryotes and plants. There are four members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, HMA1, HMA2, HMA3, and HMA4. AtHMA2 and AtHMA4 both have long C-terminal hydrophilic extensions that seem specific to plant P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the C-terminal extension of AtHMA4, which includes 44 cysteine (Cys) and a terminal stretch of 11 consecutive histidine residues, is longer than that of AtHMA2. Moreover, the N-terminal regions of AtHMA2 and AtHMA4 are highly similar, and they exhibit similar expression patterns (predominantly in the vascular tissues of roots, stems and leaves) and subcellular localization (the plasma membrane) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The sequence of TcHMA4, which is an ortholog of AtHMA4 from <italic>Thlaspi caerulescens</italic>, is 76% similar to that of AtHMA4, has more divergent C-teminal sequence and shares only 43% identity with the counterpart in AtHMA4. Interestingly, two truncated peptides from the TcHMA4 C-terminal domain were expressed in yeast, which resulted in an extremely high level of Cd tolerance and hyperaccumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There are 3 <italic>HMA4</italic> gene copies in the <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic> genome, and the activity of all three <italic>AhHMA4</italic> promoters is much higher than the <italic>AtHMA4</italic> promoter activity, leading to the high <italic>HMA4</italic> transcript levels in <italic>A. halleri</italic>. Moreover, QTL analysis, physiology experiments and reverse genetic studies have demonstrated that <italic>AhHMA4</italic> has played a major role in the natural selection of Zn hyperaccumulation and associated Cd and Zn hypertolerance in <italic>A. halleri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Taken together, the striking differences in gene coding sequence, especially at the 3&#8242;-end, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions and gene copy numbers observed between the hyperaccumulator <italic>T. caerulescens</italic> and <italic>A. halleri</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the latter of which is a close nontolerant nonaccumulator relative, suggest that <italic>HMA4</italic> was subjected to positive selection during adaptive evolution. These differences led to changes in <italic>HMA4</italic> expression levels and physiological function predominantly in substrate specificity and C-terminal heavy metal binding capacity. Generally, HMA4s have a conserved N-terminus and more divergent C-terminus. The functional domains of the N-terminus have been well characterized by sequence alignments and experiments, but the positions and functions of the C-terminal domains have not been well studied.</p><p id="Par17">In the present study, we cloned <italic>BjHMA4</italic> from <italic>B. juncea</italic>. Compared with other HMA4s, BjHMA4 had a more divergent and long C-terminal hydrophilic extension and repeat region (named BjHMA4R, which had 4 CC dipeptides [Cys pairs]). We then characterized BjHMA4R in detail to investigate its function. Our results show that BjHMA4R facilitates a high degree of heavy metal tolerance in yeast via its high binding activity and possibly interacts with other heavy metal transporters as a chaperone, resulting in increased heavy metal flux.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of <italic>BjHMA4</italic></title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Isolation of <italic>B. juncea</italic> HMA4 cDNA</title><p id="Par18">Based on homology cloning strategies and the RACE technique, the <italic>BjHMA4</italic> gene cloned from <italic>B. juncea</italic> was submitted to GenBank (accession No. JQ673430) and was found to encode 1271 amino acids and have six transmembrane domains (predicted using the TMHMM 2.0 server, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/)">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/</ext-link>). The deduced amino acid sequence of BjHMA4 is 61 and 64% identical to that of AtHMA4 (from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>) and TcHMA4 (from <italic>T. caerulescens</italic>), respectively. The low sequence similarity was due to the high divergence of the BjHMA4-C region, i.e., the sequence after the last transmembrane domain. Alignment with AtHMA4 indicated that BjHMA4 contains 5 highly conserved domains of HMA4: the metal-binding domain (binds heavy metals), A-domain (which includes the smaller cytoplasmic loop region; this domain functions as the &#8216;actuator&#8217; of the gating mechanism that regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and release), P-domain (which is homologous to members of the catalytic HAD family of enzymes; this domain contains the phosphorylation site), N-domain (contains the ATP-binding site) and histidine-rich region (which may also participate in heavy metal binding) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

This speculation requires the biochemical characterization of BjHMA4R in vitro, and the results of our <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments supported the above speculation.</p><p id="Par38">On the basis of our findings, we hypothesize that BjHMA4R functions as a sensor or buffer region in BjHMA4 and that its activity is regulated by metal concentration. Functional analysis of AtHMA4 and TcHMA4 by heterologous expression in yeast yielded controversial results. We proposed that the Cd concentration used in the yeast stress experiments was the key factor that caused the opposite results. With respect to AtHMA4, the highest Cd concentration used in the yeast stress experiments was 0.12&#8201;&#956;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; the lowest, 10&#8201;&#956;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With respect to TcHMA4, the lowest Cd concentration used in the yeast stress experiments was 75&#8201;&#956;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; the highest, 50&#8201;&#956;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. From this perspective, we can explain the seemingly paradoxical result that Zn tolerance and Zn accumulation phenotypes occurred simultaneously in the yeast strain expressing AtHMA4 under very high Zn (20&#8201;mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The AhHMA4 C-terminus showed high Zn tolerance and low Cd tolerance. Partial peptides from the TcHMA4 C-terminus showed relatively high Cd tolerance (200&#8201;&#956;M CdCl<sub>2</sub>, but the substrate specificity was not shown in this paper). BjHMA4R presented high Cd tolerance (500 and 600&#8201;&#956;M CdCl<sub>2</sub> in yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively) and low Zn tolerance under limited conditions (such as in the impaired-vacuole-compartmentation yeast YK44 and in the no-vacuole <italic>E. coli</italic>), and BjHMA4R did not improve yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic> Ni, Co or Pb tolerance. Thus, the substrates of BjHMA4R may only be Cd and Zn, but it has high affinity with Cd. Moreover, considering that orthologs of BjHMA4 have a highly conserved N-terminus and more divergent C-terminus and homologous sequences to BjHMA4R only exist in Brassicaceae, we suggest that domains of the HMA4 C-terminus may play important roles in determining substrate specificity and binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Application prospects of BjHMA4R</title><p id="Par40">BjHMA4R may have useful applications with respect to the treatment of wastewater that contains Cd by microbiological methods and enhancing the phytoremediation potential of plants via biotechnology.

The deduced amino acid sequence contains a four-repeat region, named BjHMA4R. BjHMA4R has 4 CC pairs that may be involved in heavy metal binding. Detailed characterization of BjHMA4R indicated that BjHMA4R localized in the yeast cytosol and substantially and specifically improved Cd tolerance and accumulation under low heavy metal concentrations. <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments verified this function.
