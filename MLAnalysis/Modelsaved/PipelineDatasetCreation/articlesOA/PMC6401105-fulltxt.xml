The increase of insecticide resistance in wild populations of <italic>Anopheles</italic> malaria vectors emphasises the need for novel vector control strategies as well as for identifying novel vector targets.

Malaria, the most deadly vector-borne disease still causes about 500,000 deaths annually in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This disease is caused by the Apicomplexa parasite of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and is transmitted to humans by an infective bite of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Most of malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where mosquitoes from the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> sensu lato complex constitute the main vectors of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Vector-targeted strategies accounted for 80% of the gains in malaria reduction in Africa in recent decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and this will very likely remain the case in future. However, with the increase of insecticide resistance in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, new vector control strategies are needed, and a better knowledge of the malaria vector system and of the mosquito biology are thus strongly required.</p><p id="Par3">Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs) constitute a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) family, originally found in the parasite platyhelminth <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, then in a large number of invertebrate species, and particularly in many insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, VKRs were not found in any vertebrate organism and strikingly, they are not present in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> nor in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. VKR proteins possess an atypical structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, with an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain similar to that of insulin receptors (IR) and an extracellular Venus Flytrap (VFT) domain. VFTs were first identified as bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins involved in the transport of small molecules, such as amino acids, sugars or ions and they constitute the ligand binding pocket of different receptor types such as class C G-protein coupled receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

As we found that only CYP314A1 expression level is affected in females silenced for VKR, but not in males (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), we could not exclude that VKR probably acts through another mechanism in <italic>Anopheles</italic>. For instance, it has been demonstrated that in insect ovaries, a phosphorylated form of ecdysteroid (ecdysteroid 22-phosphate), which is physiologically inactive, could serve as a &#8220;reservoir&#8221; in the ovaries that supplies active free ecdysteroids during embryonic development triggered by a phosphatase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The formation of the phosphorylated ecdysteroid (ecdysteroid 22-P) requires the activity of an ecdysteroid kinase. As a kinase receptor, we could hypothesize that VKR would act upstream of this ecdysteroid kinase, or would belong to the kinase pathway that leads to produce the ecdysteroid 22-P (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Hence depleting VKR in <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> would impair the ecdycteroid kinase pathway and reduce the amount of ecdysteroid 22-P. Therefore in VKR silencing background, the reservoir of active free ecdysteroids further required during the larval growth might be reduced and could significantly impair the larval development.</p><p id="Par37">The evolutionary history and function of VKRs might be different between the various organisms in which they have been found. In the case of two phylogenetically close organisms, <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, we did not observe the same function between <italic>Aedes</italic> VKR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> VKR, especially for the reproductive function. <italic>Aedes</italic> VKR displays an important function in fecundity, while <italic>Anopheles</italic> VKR does not. This might also be due to different ecological niches and different pressures acting on VKR genes. Nevertheless, as it was not checked in the study of AeVKR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we could not exclude that the receptor also plays a role in males and in immunity in <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Another study performed on the locust <italic>S. gregaria</italic> showed also different functions of SgVKR as compared to AeVKR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This strengthens the hypothesis of a divergent evolution in VKR functions at least between these three insects (the locust and the two mosquitoes).</p><p id="Par38">Altogether and consistent with the importance of its biological effects (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), <italic>Anopheles</italic> VKR appears, through its dual role and the absence of ortholog in vertebrates, as an interesting novel insect target for controlling mosquito populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
