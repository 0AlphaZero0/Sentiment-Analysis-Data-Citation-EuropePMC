leading to substantial economic loss to worldwide swine industry. These outbreaks urgently call for updated and effective PEDV vaccines. Better understanding in PEDV biology and improvement in technological platforms for virus production can immensely assist and accelerate PEDV vaccine development. In this study, we explored the ability of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein in improving viral yields in cell culture systems. We demonstrated that PEDV N expression positively affected both recovery of PEDV from infectious clones and PEDV propagation in cell culture. Compared to Vero E6 cells, Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N could accelerate growth of a slow-growing PEDV strain to higher peak titers by 12 hours or enhance the yield of a vaccine candidate strain by two orders of magnitude. Interestingly, PEDV N also slightly enhances replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus, a PEDV relative in the Nidovirales order. These results solidify the importance of N in PEDV recovery and propagation and suggest a potentially useful consideration in designing vaccine production platforms for PEDV or closely related pathogens.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011057</institution-id><institution>National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P-15-51261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2354-9883</contrib-id><name><surname>Jongkaewwattana</surname><given-names>Anan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by BIOTEC&#8217;s Fellow Grant (P-15-51261) to A.J. from the Platform Technology Management Section, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand.

Although PEDV can infect pigs of all ages, mortality in infected piglets aged below one week is especially high and could reach 100%. A few strategies have been employed to control PED outbreaks. For instance, feedback of PEDV infected materials to sows can induce lactogenic immunity for piglets [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite being widely adopted in farms, this strategy poses serious safety concerns as contamination of other pathogens, dosage and virulence are often not well-controlled [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Inactivated vaccines have higher safety measures but usually give less robust protection. Especially in Asian countries, antigenic variations between emerging strains (post-2010) and classical strains may have led to failure of traditional attenuated vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These problems urgently call for updated effective PEDV vaccines. Reverse genetics technology can immensely help with creating vaccine seeds that are attenuated and carry matching antigens and bypassing laborious and time-consuming process of tissue culture adaptation. Appropriate cell culture platforms are also critical for virus production at an industrial scale. Although Vero or Vero E6 cells are widely used to propagate PEDV at the moment, improvements in titers and replication kinetics are desirable. Both better understanding of PEDV replication and pathogenesis from basic research and improvement in technologies such as reverse genetics for generation of vaccine candidates and engineered cell lines suitable for efficient propagation of selected candidates could make immense contribution to PEDV vaccine development.</p><p>PEDV is a coronavirus (CoV) with a positive-sense RNA genome of 28 kb [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Its genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab, and five other ORFs encoding five proteins: spike (S), ORF3, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid (N) [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. PEDV entry is mediated by S protein. Once inside the cells, ORF1 and ORF1ab are translated by host ribosomes and cleaved by viral proteases into non-structural proteins which are involved in subsequent viral RNA transcription and replication [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Structural proteins are then produced, and viral assembly commences at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complexes where the viral genome encapsidated by multimers of N is packaged with viral structural proteins into virions [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>CoV N is a multi-functional protein [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Its primary function is to organize the viral genome and help in the viral assembly process [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several lines of evidence suggest that N is required for optimal CoV RNA transcription and/or replication. First, CoV N proteins may act as RNA chaperones [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Second, presence of N enhances recovery of several CoVs from infectious RNA, implying early roles of N during RNA synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Third, for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), N is found to co-localize and/or interact with replicase components, possibly tethering viral RNA to the replicase complex for efficient viral RNA production [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), N is not essential for RNA replication but is required for efficient transcription [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Roles of PEDV N during viral RNA synthesis have not been as extensively studied but are assumed to be similar.</p><p>Besides its function in genome management, CoV N is shown to modulate cellular processes such as cell cycle, translation suppression and host immune response. Particularly for PEDV, N has been reported to induce ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Through interaction with cellular protein nucleophosmin, PEDV N was able to protect cells from induced apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PEDV N has been shown to inhibit interferon-&#946; (IFN-&#946;) production and interferon-stimulating gene (ISG) expression via suppression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our previous work, we demonstrated that, in some PEDV strains, N is an unusual substrate of PEDV 3C-like protease (3Cpro). Notably, we observed growth retardation of a cell culture-adapted PEDV-AVCT12 strain carrying the cleavage-resistant mutation in its nucleocapsid gene [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These data together suggest layers of complexity and multiple roles that PEDV N might be involved during the course of PEDV infection and consequently affect PEDV growth kinetics.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the impact of PEDV N on <italic>in vitro</italic> viral recovery and growth kinetics in tissue culture systems and assessed its potential benefit to PEDV vaccine production platforms. We showed that PEDV N expression can significantly enhance PEDV recovery from infectious DNA clones. Moreover, we demonstrated higher growth characteristics of some PEDV strains, including a slow-growing variant and a vaccine candidate, in Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N. Interestingly, replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) but not influenza virus is slightly enhanced by PEDV N. Results from this study confirm the notion that N is vital for PEDV replication and suggest a potential in adopting Vero E6-N cells as an alternative system for enhancing propagation of PEDV vaccine strains and possibly other related viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Biological materials</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and Vero E6 cells and their derivatives are maintained in OptiMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and antibiotics at 37 &#186;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The reverse genetics system for PEDV established in our laboratory did not include an extraneous N-expressing plasmid [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, capped PEDV N transcripts were included during recovery of PEDV PC22A from <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed full-length PEDV RNA [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The effect of augmented PEDV N expression during <italic>in vitro</italic> recovery in the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based system has not been documented. To test this, we co-transfected HEK 293T cells with a pCAGGS plasmid expressing either PEDV N (WT), PEDV N-L381P or no protein (vec) together with pPEDV-mCh, the infectious clone for PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry, and subsequently detected the recovered progenies in Vero E6 cells. This infectious clone contains the mCherry coding sequence in place of ORF3 [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], therefore allowing us to easily follow PEDV replication by fluorescence detection. The reason we chose to investigate both of these PEDV N variants was based on our previous work on 3Cpro-induced PEDV N processing. We noticed that recovery from infectious clone and growth kinetics of the laboratory-adapted PEDV carrying 3Cpro-sensitive N (WT) in cell culture were consistently more efficient than the mutant carrying 3Cpro-resistant N (L381P) [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we suspected that molecular difference in PEDV N protein might have contributed to efficiencies in viral recovery and growth.</p><p>During co-transfection in HEK 293T cells, similar expression of wild-type and L381P nucleocapsid proteins was observed from pCAGGS, while the PEDV infectious clones produced N at the level too low for detection by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Due to the low numbers of reverse genetics-derived particles, we amplified the viral progenies by passaging once in Vero E6 cells. We qualitatively monitored viral replication by the extent of mCherry expression and syncytium formation and quantified the released PEDV particles at 48 h by RT-qPCR. PEDV N expression during the rescue phase significantly enhanced virus replication as reflected by exhaustive mCherry-positive syncytia and increased the number of PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry viral progenies by three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Interestingly, expression of N-L381P from the plasmid also increased the numbers of the viral progenies compared to the negative control, but the effect was not as large as that observed with the wild-type PEDV N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We next tested rescues of PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry carrying the L381P mutation in its N gene in the presence of absence of PEDV N expression. Consistent with previous observations, reverse genetics rescue of PEDV-AVCT12<sub>N.L381P</sub>-mCherry was less efficient than its wild-type counterpart. Expression of both forms of PEDV N during the reverse genetics rescue step could significantly enhance subsequent syncytium formation and raise the numbers of PEDV-AVCT12<sub>N.L381P</sub>-mCherry viral progenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Note that the numbers of the mutant viruses were still lower than their wild-type counterparts from the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, bar graphs).

The results are not surprising, considering that N proteins are highly conserved among PEDV strains. These data imply a general effect of PEDV N proteins in improving rescue efficiency of a PEDV vaccine strain. Taken together, data in this section suggest that exogenous PEDV N expression enhances viral production during the reverse genetics step from an infectious DNA clone for both wild-type and the slow-growing variant.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Vero E6 cells transiently expressing PEDV N increases PEDV replication</title><p>We projected that PEDV N overexpression not only increases viral progenies during the reverse genetics process but also promotes viral replication in susceptible cells.

We transfected Vero E6 cells with either pCAGGS vector or pCAGGS expressing Myc-tagged PEDV N 24 h prior to infection by PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry and observed extents of infection visually and quantitatively. We utilized the Myc-tagged PEDV N construct to enable distinction between virally-encoded N and plasmid-derived N.

Moreover, even though not all cells were transiently transfected, initially untransfected cells could share PEDV N-Myc from nearby cells upon cytoplasmic fusion during syncytium formation and supposedly showed the enhancement effect on PEDV replication similar to transfected cells.

Equal numbers of cells were plated in 6-well plates and infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry or PEDV-AVCT12<sub>N.L381P</sub>-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001).

After 36 hpi, the titer dropped sharply possibly due to the pervasive cell death caused by early rapid PEDV replication such that the rate of viral production fell behind the rate of degradation of the infectious virions in the media. At 48 hpi, no significant difference in titers was observed between supernatants from the two cells. However, the virus replicating in Vero E6 cells showed a peak titer of ~10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml at this time, ~10-fold lower than that observed in Vero E6-N cells at 36 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

Since the most prominent functions of CoV N proteins involve viral genome management, we focused on the processes of viral RNA synthesis: transcription and replication. To measure genome replication activity, we used primers specific to ORF1 to quantify the levels of genomic RNA being produced over time. To measure transcription activity, we used the forward primer specific to the 5&#8217;UTR and the reverse primer specific to the coding region of the S gene to quantify the levels of sgmRNA. Total RNA was extracted from Vero E6 or Vero E6-N cells infected with PEDV-AVCT12-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) at indicated time points and was used as templates for one-step RT-qPCR with indicated primers. The levels of each RNA species were normalized to the levels of GAPDH mRNA from the same conditions and were expressed as relative quantities to the RNA level at 12 hpi from infected Vero E6 cells. Vero E6-N cells showed slight increase in the levels of genomic RNA at 24 hpi, but the difference disappeared by 36 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

The laboratory-adapted influenza A virus (IAV, strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34) was chosen to represent a negative-sense RNA virus, while the vaccine strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV, Ingelvac MLV strain) was chosen to represent a closely-related positive-sense RNA virus. Vero E6 and Vero E6-N cells were infected with IAV (MOI 0.001) or PRRSV (MOI 0.01). At 36 hpi, infected cells were harvested for protein analysis, and supernatants were collected for released viral RNA quantification by RT-qPCR. No significant difference in IAV titers produced from the two cells could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). On the other hand, a slight increase (&lt; 1-log) in PRRSV RNA titers was noticed in Vero E6-N cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Western blot analysis on infected cell lyases did not reveal drastic difference in viral protein production for either virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This could be due to the lower sensitivity of Western blotting compared to vRNA quantification by RT-qPCR. These results suggest that PEDV N may help slightly enhance replication of a closely-related virus such as PRRSV but have no effect on replication of an unrelated virus such as IAV. Nevertheless, it is clear that PEDV N-mediated enhancement in viral replication is much more pronounced on PEDV replication than it is on other viruses.</p><fig id="pone.0212632.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212632.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Effect of PEDV N on replication of other viruses.</title><p>Vero E6 or Vero E6-N cells were infected with IAV (A) or PRRSV (B).

The implication of such possibility can assist in PEDV vaccine development process. Using reverse-genetics rescue experiments, we showed that inclusion of a separate PEDV N-expressing plasmid can significantly enhance PEDV viral yields. Using Vero E6 cells engineered to express PEDV N, we demonstrated substantial replication advantages in several PEDV variants.</p><p>There have been many precedents in which nucleocapsid proteins have been shown to enhance viral recovery and propagation. For minus-strand RNA viruses, nucleocapsid proteins are required for viral RNA transcription and replication [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, reverse genetics systems for these viruses typically include separate expression systems for their nucleocapsid proteins [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although theoretically not necessary, for some plus-strand RNA viruses, expression of nucleocapsid proteins is required for or can enhance viral recovery during rescue. For TGEV, recovery of virus from transfection of TGEV transcripts requires transfection of TGEV N transcripts, even though TGEV recovery from the BAC system does not exhibit this requirement [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similar observations were reported in efforts to rescue other CoVs from RNA transcripts, such as infectious bronchitis virus, MHV, and SARS-CoV [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the case of PEDV, rescue from infectious RNA was aided by inclusion of the N gene transcript [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, for the BAC-based PEDV reverse genetics system, the virus could be recovered without an extraneous N-expressing plasmid [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this report, we showed that exogenous N protein, although not necessary, can significantly enhance PEDV rescue titers from the BAC system. These data from multiple CoV rescue experiments demonstrate the importance of N in efficient transcription and replication of CoVs and support previous suggestions that CoV N might play essential roles during early RNA synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Expression of N <italic>in trans</italic> can also improve production of infectious PEDV particles during propagation. Based on its role during the replication cycle, possible mechanisms through which PEDV N exerts its effect include viral RNA synthesis, viral particle assembly and IFN antagonism [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As our experiments were conducted in IFN-&#946;-deficient Vero E6 cells, we are inclined to think that IFN antagonism is not primarily responsible for the observed enhancement in PEDV replication kinetics. Nevertheless, we could not entirely dismiss this possibility as PEDV N interferes with IRF-3 signaling [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which could lead to suppression of other ISG responses independent of IFN-&#946;. Indeed, it would be interesting to use other experimental systems with an intact IFN pathway to tease apart possible contribution on viral growth enhancement from PEDV N&#8217;s IFN antagonism function. On the other hand, CoV N has been shown to be critical for CoV assembly. CoV N interacts with other CoV structural proteins, especially the membrane protein, as observed in MHV, TGEV and SARS-CoV [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Even though N is not necessary for CoV envelope formation, expression of N greatly increases yields of virus-like particles in MHV and SARS-CoV, suggesting its important role in formation of complete virions [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>As the primary role of nucleocapsid protein involves viral genome management, we directly asked if ectopic PEDV N expression affects viral RNA synthesis during infection. While genome replication activity is enhanced at an early time point, marked increase in subgenomic RNA production could be observed in Vero E6-N cells over a sustained period, leading to large excess of viral protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212632.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In this experimental system, enhancement of subgenomic transcription might be the primary mechanism of the PEDV N-mediated viral growth enhancement. Several reports have also documented important roles of nucleocapsid proteins during viral RNA synthesis. In general, CoV N can act as an RNA chaperone, facilitating the adoption of proper RNA conformation for transcription or replication [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For TGEV, efficient replicon activity could be observed only from replicons harboring the N gene, while activity of a replicon lacking TGEV N could be rescued in cells expressing TGEV N, demonstrating that N expression either in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic> is required for efficient viral RNA synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Replication of Human CoV-229E genomic RNA is substantially increased by expression of HCoV N and, to a lesser extent, PEDV N [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. MHV N interacts with a replicase component and is implicated in formation of the initiation complex required for negative-strand synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212632.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar interactions between N and a replicase component have been recently described in PRRSV, a member of the same Nidovirales order [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indeed, structural analysis has previously indicated structural similarity between C-terminal portions of SARS-CoV N and PRRSV N and suggested a common origin between the two viral families [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, while influenza virus, a minus-strand RNA virus that replicates inside the host nucleus, was unaffected by PEDV N expression, PRRSV shows slightly enhanced replication in Vero E6-N cells. This specificity also indicates that the enhancement mechanism might be more specific to the replication cycle or machinery commonly shared by Nidoviruses rather than broadly antagonizing host antiviral state. As discussed in Yount <italic>et al</italic>., other possible mechanisms include enhancement of viral mRNA translation or viral genome protection performed by CoV N proteins [<xref rid="pone.0212632.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we showed here that expression of PEDV N can enhance rescue and replication kinetics of PEDV. Importantly, we observed both higher peak titers and/or shorter culture time to reach peak titers. Of course, N overexpression cannot alone solve the yield problem for every PEDV variant; viral growth in cell culture depends on multiple factors, especially spike variants and infectivity. Indeed, we could not observe any advantage in propagation of PEDV field isolates in Vero E6-N cells (B.L. unpublished results). However, in combination with other technological advancement, we might be able to harness the potential of PEDV N in improving yields for the whole chain of modern vaccine production, from rescues of vaccine candidates from the reverse genetics process to cultivation and amplification of PEDV vaccine viruses in cell culture. Although the increase might seem small, ~1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude improvement and a decrease in cultivation time to harvest at peak titers could translate to significant cost reduction during manufacturing processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212632.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Alignment of PEDV N sequences used in this study.</title><p>AVCT12 represents the vaccine strain, while the other two strains were field isolates from Banpong (BP) and Nakorn Pathom (NP) areas in central Thailand.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212632.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Q.
