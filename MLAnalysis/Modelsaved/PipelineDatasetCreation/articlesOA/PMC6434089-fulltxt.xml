Previous studies have compared the performance of different whole genome amplification (WGA) strategies on Illumina sequencing platforms, but there is no related research aimed at Ion Proton platform, which is also a popular next-generation sequencing platform. Here by amplifying cells from six cell lines with different karyotypes, we estimated the data features of four common commercial WGA kits (PicoPLEX WGA Kit, GenomePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit, MALBAC Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit, and REPLI-g Single Cell Kit), including median absolute pairwise difference, uniformity, reproducibility, and fidelity, and examined their performance of copy number variation detection.

Ion Proton is a semiconductor-based NGS platform [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The reads yielded by Ion Proton platform are length-variable single-end reads [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which is quite different from those of Illumina sequencing platforms, e.g. Hiseq series [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ion Proton is one of the currently main NGS platforms and is widely applied to diverse fields, including exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, single-cell sequencing etc. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and especially it often occurs in clinical examination, such as noninvasive prenatal diagnosis [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and preimplantation genetic screening [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Single-cell sequencing offers cellular-level genetic information, so it is an important approach to study early embryo development, neuron genomic heterogeneity, carcinogenesis, and uncultivable bacteria etc. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Along the process of single-cell sequencing, whole genome amplification (WGA) is a key step [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], because of the low quantity of available materials. There are plenty of commercial WGA kits and different kits are based on different strategies: multiple displacement amplification (MDA), degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR), and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC, MALBAC-like) are three major WGA strategies. Different strategy may cause different WGA performance and some studies have paid efforts in the comparison of WGA methods [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, current related researches are conducted on Illumina sequencing platforms, the results have not validated on Ion Proton platform.</p><p>To address this issue, we tested four common commercial WGA kits&#8212;PicoPLEX WGA Kit (which we called PicoPLEX, Rubicon Genomics, U.S.A.), GenomePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit (GenomePlex, Sigma&#8211;Aldrich, U.S.A.), MALBAC Single Cell WGA Kit (MALBAC, Yikon Genomics, China), and REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (MDA, Qiagen, Germany). The first two kits were based on DOP-PCR method, and the two following were based on MALBAC and MDA respectively. The amplified products were sequenced on Ion Proton platform, and then we evaluated the data features, compared the difference among different sample types, and examined their performance in copy number variation (CNV) detection. In this way, we found that MALBAC and PicoPLEX could yield high-quality data and exhibited high reproducibility, and in terms of uniformity, PicoPLEX was slightly better than MALBAC. Our results provided system comparison among the four common WGA kits and guidance for future studies related to single-cell sequencing on Ion Proton platform.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Samples</title><p>Six cell lines in the study were bought from the Coriell Institute (Coriell Biorepositories, U.S.A.), and their karyotypes covered common CNV types, including four aneuploids (+13, +18, +21, and XO), one microdeletion (del(16)(pter-&gt;p12::p11.2-&gt;qter)), and one unbalanced translocation (der(4)t(4;12)(p16.1;p12)pat). Single-cell, multi-cell, and genomic DNA (gDNA) samples were separately prepared for the six cell lines.</p><p>Single cell and multi cells (3&#8211;5 cells) were isolated by micromanipulating under a dissection microscope (Olympus SZ61, Japan) using a finely pulled glass Pasteur pipette.

The concentration of purified gDNA was determined using Quant-iT Assay Kit with Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) and purity analysis was conducted by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Germany). Then, 6 ng of gDNA was extracted and serially diluted 1000-fold by Nuclease-Free Water (Qiagen, Germany) to adjust the concentration to 6 pg/&#956;l. We aliquoted 2.5 &#956;l of the diluted solution so that each aliquot contained 15 pg of gDNA, which was equivalent to the amount of the DNA in a single cell (&#8764;6.6 pg of DNA), taking into account the random loss of DNA due to limiting dilution.</p><p>These samples were stored in &#8722;80&#176;C before WGA.

After WGA, the products were purified by Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, U.S.A.). The purified DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT Assay Kit with Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, U.S.A.), and the purity was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.). Then the amplified products were separated by 2% agarose gels electrophoresis in TBE buffer (90 mmol/l Tris-borate, pH 8.0, 2 mmol/l EDTA), stained by SYBR Green (Invitrogen, U.S.A.), and visualized by Image Master software (Bio-Rad, U.S.A.).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Library construction and whole-genome DNA sequencing</title><p>The WGA products were fragmented to an average size of 170 bp and end ligated with sequencing adaptors carrying identifiable barcode for Ion Proton platform.

The number of uniquely mapped reads and GC content in each window was determined. Then, we filtered windows containing no reads and windows with &#8216;N&#8217;s in the reference sequences. The number of uniquely mapped reads in the remaining windows was corrected and normalized based on their GC content by LOESS regression. Finally, taking corresponding samples from normal humans&#8217; oral epithelium as control, we applied the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to segment the genome into regions with equal copy number, and screened out CNVs whose mean of the log of normalized read count were less than &#8722;0.51 or more than 0.37 and size were more than 4 Mbp.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>The yield and size of WGA products</title><p>Single-cell, multi-cell, and gDNA samples were amplified by MALBAC, PicoPLEX, GenomePlex, and MDA respectively.

MDA showed the worst uniformity, reproducibility, and CNV detection performance among the four WGA kits, indicating that it was not suitable for CNV analysis.</p><p>In practical manufacture and application of WGA kits, there ought to be a reference standard in the kit. In theory, the reference standard could be a lysed single cell isolated from positive cell lines or corresponding DNA. Since DNA had an advantage in preservation and was more convenient in operation, we evaluated the property of the WGA products from gDNA sample, attempting to replace lysed cells with gDNA as reference standards. The MAPDs of the amplified gDNA samples were more than those of single-cell or multi-cell samples amplified by the same WGA kits, suggesting that there was more genomic noise in the amplified gDNA samples. The correlation coefficients between amplified gDNA samples and the bulk data was the lowest among the three sample types, which reflected the low fidelity in amplified gDNA samples. The bad performance of gDNA samples amplified by WGA kits might result from the nonrandom distributed DNA fragments in gDNA diluents.</p><p>Considering the relatively low throughput on Ion Proton, low-coverage whole genome sequencing was common on this platform but it was also a challenge for variant calling. To detect different variants, there were different choices of WGA kits. For small CNV detection, PicoPLEX and MALBAC were both good choices; for large CNV detection, PicoPLEX, MALBAC, and GenomePlex were competent; and for SNP calling, MDA and MALBAC were appropriate. Different projects focused on different variants. For example, preimplantation genetic screen currently focused on CNV detection [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], inheritable diseases studies were mainly interested in SNP calling [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and cancer-related studies might concern CNVs, SNPs, and other variants [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There was no best method for all projects, but there was always a more appropriate one for a certain project.</p><p>In conclusion, we quantitatively examined the performance of four common commercial WGA kits on Ion Proton platform. Based on samples extracted from six positive cell lines and normal humans&#8217; oral epithelium, we estimated the data yield, data quality, uniformity, reproducibility, fidelity, and CNV detection performance of PicoPLEX, GenomePlex, MALBAC, and MDA. At a similar yield and laboratorial situation, PicoPLEX showed the best performance in the quality of sequencing data, uniformity of read depth, amplification reproducibility and fidelity, so it was recommended for CNV calling on Ion Proton platform. Results in the present study would guide the selection of WGA kits on Ion Proton platform and assist the application of single-cell sequencing on this platform.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec5" sec-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by National High-Tech R&amp;D Program (863)[grant number 2015AA020407]; Clinical Research Center for Obstetrical Diseases and Collaborative Network Construction of Liaoning Province [grant number 2016007010]; and Science and Technology Support Project of Jiangsu Province [grant number BE2013654].
