The incidence of CHD is estimated to be approximately 1% in newborns, and despite rapid advances in surgical treatments and interventional therapies over the past few decades, CHD is still the primary non-infectious cause of infant mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, its associated complications such as heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death may occur even after effective correction of cardiac abnormalities [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Until now, the exact cause of CHD is still largely unclear despite extensive investigations. Nevertheless, mounting evidence supports that genetic factors play a crucial part in its development. First, family clustering of CHD with variable phenotypes is not uncommon, and descendants of CHD patients suffer a higher risk of developing cardiac malformations compared with the general population [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Second, multiple genetic variants have been found to be associated with an increased risk of CHD [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#8211;9</xref>]. Overall, these findings jointly indicate that genetic predisposition to CHD is vital for its occurrence and development.</p><p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) play central roles in the regulation of folate metabolism and homocysteine synthesis [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that taking folate supplements during pregnancy could significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular congenital malformations in newborns [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, functional <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic> polymorphisms, which were known to affect plasma folate levels, were considered to be ideal candidate genetic biomarkers of CHD.</p><p>So far, numerous studies have been conducted to assess the roles of <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic> gene polymorphisms in CHD, but the results of these studies were controversial [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#8211;16</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted the present meta-analysis to better evaluate potential associations of <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic> gene polymorphisms with the risk of CHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Literature search and inclusion criteria</title><p>The current meta-analysis was adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A systematic literature search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed to retrieve all relevant articles. The key words used in this literature search included: &#8216;5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase&#8217;, &#8216;methionine synthase reductase&#8217;, &#8216;MTRR&#8217;, &#8216;MSR&#8217;, &#8216;methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase&#8217;, &#8216;MTHFR&#8217;, &#8216;polymorphism&#8217;, &#8216;variant&#8217;, &#8216;mutation&#8217;, &#8216;genotype&#8217;, &#8216;allele&#8217;, &#8216;congenital heart disease&#8216;, &#8216;congenital heart defect&#8217; and &#8216;congenital cardiovascular malformation&#8217; (see Supplementary File S1).

The NOS has a score range of 0 to 9, and studies with a score of more than 7 were considered to be of high quality.</p><p>Two reviewers (Aiping Xu and Weiping Wang) conducted data extraction and quality assessment independently.

Historically, few CHD patients reached adulthood, but thanks to enormous advances in interventional therapies and surgical treatments over the past few years, the average life expectancy of CHD patients has been significantly improved [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, despite substantially improved prognosis, CHD remains to be the leading cause of infant deaths all over the world.</p><p>MTHFR and MTRR are fundamental regulatory enzymes of folate and homocysteine metabolism. Considering the consistently observed association between folic acid consumption and a reduced risk of cardiac deformity, functional polymorphisms of <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic>, which were known to be associated with altered enzymatic activities, were thought to be correlated with the risk of CHD [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, several studies have tried to explore the potential associations of functional <italic>MTHFR</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic> gene polymorphisms with the risk of CHD, but the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted the present meta-analysis to obtain a more conclusive result. Our overall analyses suggested that <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1801394, <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1532268, <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801131 and <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 polymorphisms were all significantly associated with the risk of CHD in certain genetic models. Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of study participants demonstrated that the <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1801394 polymorphism was significantly correlated with the risk of CHD only in Asians, whereas <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1532268, <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801131 polymorphisms were significantly correlated with the risk of CHD in both Asians and Caucasians. When we stratified data based on type of disease, we found that both <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1801394 and <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1532268 polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of VSD, whereas the <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of TOF. The stabilities of synthetic results were subsequently evaluated in sensitivity analyses, and no changes of results were observed in any comparisons, which indicated that our findings were quite stable and reliable. It is noteworthy that obvious between-study heterogeneities were detected in several comparisons. However, a great reduction in heterogeneities was found in further stratified analyses, which suggested that differences in ethnic background and type of disease could partially explain the observed heterogeneities.</p><p>Our meta-analysis is certainly not without limitations. First, our results were based on unadjusted estimations, and lack of analyses adjusted for potential confounding factors such as age, sex and co-morbidity conditions may impact the reliability of our findings. Second, heterogeneity remained significant in certain subgroups, which suggested that the conflicting results of eligible studies could not be fully explained by differences in ethnicity of study population or type of CHD, and other unmeasured characteristics of study participants may also attribute to the observed between-study heterogeneities. Third, associations between investigated polymorphisms and the risk of CHD may also be influenced by gene&#8211;gene and gene&#8211;environmental interactions. However, we failed to analyze the effect of these interactions in our study because only very little relevant data were provided by enrolled literatures. Taken these limitations into consideration, the results obtained by the present study should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In conclusion, the current meta-analysis indicated that <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1801394, <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1532268, <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801131 and <italic>MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 polymorphisms may affect the risk of CHD in Asians and Caucasians, while the <italic>MTRR</italic> rs1801394 polymorphism may only affect in risk of CHD in Asians. However, it is notable that relevant studies were still at the early stage and further well-designed studies are still warranted to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supporting information</title><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Funnel plots of investigated polymorphisms</title></caption><media mimetype="pdf" xlink:href="bsr20181160_Supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e3582" position="anchor"/></fig><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Funnel plots of investigated polymorphisms</title></caption><media mimetype="pdf" xlink:href="bsr20181160_Supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e3587" position="anchor"/></table-wrap></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p></ack><sec id="sec6" sec-type="author-contrib"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>Aiping Xu and Weiping Wang conceived the study and participated in its design.
