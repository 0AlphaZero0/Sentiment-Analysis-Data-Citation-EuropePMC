Since 2011, occurrence among adolescents and adults has risen putting vulnerable neonates at risk. National immunization guidelines now include Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) vaccination during pregnancy and as a cocooning strategy (i.e., vaccinating adults and adolescents in contact with neonates). This study assessed post-marketing Tdap (Boostrix&#174;, GSK, Belgium) vaccine safety in subjects &#8805; 10 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This open, non-comparative multi-center study was conducted over six years at 10 hospitals in Korea. Subjects received Tdap in normal clinical practice according to local prescribing information. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded, classified as expected or unexpected, and severity and relationship to Tdap were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis included 672 Korean subjects (mean age, 44 years; range, 11&#8211;81), 451 were women and 211 were pregnant. Ninety subjects experienced 124 AEs (incidence 13.39%) of which six were serious AEs (SAEs) assessed as not related to vaccination, and 51 were non-SAEs related to vaccination (mostly administration site reactions). Overall 65/124 AEs were unexpected; the most common were 14 constipation, 5 dyspepsia, 4 common cold and 4 premature labor cases. One case of common cold was assessed as possibly related to vaccination.

As in other countries, however, recent outbreaks occurred in 2012 and 2015, and the incidence is continuing to rise in 2018. The most recent reports from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) show 230 confirmed cases in 2012, 205 in 2015 and 318 in 2017.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Routine passive surveillance during 2001&#8211;2012, and ad hoc active sentinel surveillance during the 2012 outbreak, showed infants under one year of age had the highest age-specific incidence of pertussis.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A noticeable increase in the proportion of adolescents and adults (&gt; 20 years) with pertussis was observed after 2011.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As a result, the KCDC recently updated their immunization guidelines to include Tdap vaccination of pregnant women and of adults and adolescents in close contact with infants, in order to reduce the risk to neonates and young infants.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In Korea, Tdap vaccine is indicated for adolescents and adults older than 10 years of age, for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.

Consecutive subjects who received a single dose of Tdap (Boostrix&#174;; GSK) in routine clinical practice, administered according to the local prescribing information (PI), were included in the total vaccinated cohort.</p><p>In addition to the safety assessment, the following data were collected: subject demographics, medical and vaccination history, study vaccine administration status, concomitant medication and vaccinations, hepatic and renal disorders. This study was designed to investigate all AEs occurring during the surveillance period (30-day period following vaccination), including AEs with unestablished causal relationships to Tdap, extremely low frequency or unexpected AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccination</title><p>Each prefilled syringe dose of 0.5 mL Tdap (Boostrix&#174;; GSK) vaccine contains a sterile suspension of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and three purified antigens of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> (pertussis toxoid, pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin and pertactin) adsorbed onto aluminum salts. A single dose was administered to subjects by intramuscular injection according to standard clinical practice and regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Any AE occurring in the 30-day period following vaccination was recorded in diary cards and evaluated internally as expected (AEs included in the PI) or unexpected according to the PI. Each AE was rated as: mild (easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and no interference with daily activities), moderate (sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities; fever between 38&#176;C and 39&#176;C), or severe (preventing normal daily activities, fever over 39&#176;C). Investigators categorized the relationship of each AE to the study vaccine as: certain, probable, possible, unlikely, conditional or unassessable/unclassifiable. The definitions of causality assessment were based on the guidance by Korean authorities.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> An AE categorized as &#8216;unlikely&#8217; was not considered to be an adverse drug reaction (ADR).

The incidence of AEs for which the causal relationship to vaccination could not be ruled out was 5.21%, of which the majority were mild administration site reactions.</p><p>As this was an observational study of routine clinical practice, many subjects had a current medical condition (64%) or used concomitant medication (66%). Subjects with these factors had a higher incidence of AEs, as did women versus men, pregnant women versus non-pregnant women or older adults versus other adult groups. The incidence of AEs among children and adolescents should be interpreted with caution given the low number of subjects in these age groups (i.e., four adolescents and one child). The difference in AE incidence by gender was consistent with previous diphtheria or tetanus vaccine studies which also reported a higher rate of adverse reactions in women than in men.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Given the nature of post-marketing surveillance, and due to possible confounding variables, it was not possible to determine the clinical significance of these factors alone on AE incidence.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Safety data were available for special populations such as pregnant women. AEs occurred in 21.33% of pregnant women (constipation was most frequently reported) and were assessed as not related to vaccination. Having a current medical condition during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of AEs. Six pregnant women reported a SAE including two cases of vaginal hemorrhage and a premature birth, none of which were assessed as related to vaccination. A recent study has found that more women in Korea are having children at an older age, and with increased risks of preterm delivery observed in women aged over 30 years, or low birth weight babies for mothers over 35 years old.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The safety of Tdap vaccination in pregnant women has not been previously assessed in Korea, however, data from large US<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and UK<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> studies have not found an increased risk of AEs following Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety of maternal Tdap vaccination in infants, there were no AEs or negative impact on infant growth and development versus controls (infants of mothers not vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy).<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In large retrospective observational studies in the UK and the US covering over 46,000 women, maternal Tdap vaccination was not associated with any increased risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) birth or any other AEs related to pregnancy or to any differences in neonatal outcomes such as birth weight, compared with unvaccinated subjects.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In fact, one study in the US of over 7,000 pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap found no adverse pregnancy, delivery, or neonatal outcomes associated with vaccination, but a significantly higher average gestational age at delivery, fewer births before 35 weeks of gestation, a shorter duration of neonatal hospitalization, and a lower incidence of SGA neonates.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Routine Tdap vaccination has been recommended by the CDC in the US since 2011 during each pregnancy, and it is currently also recommended in other countries (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, the UK, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina).<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Post-marketing safety data from a retrospective database review in 10&#8211;18 year old adolescents (n = 13,427) given Tdap in routine practice in the US found no increased risk of medically-attended neurologic or hematologic events, allergic reactions, chronic illnesses or deaths following Tdap, compared with matched historical controls given Td (tetanus, diphtheria) vaccination.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>This study was unique in that it assessed the safety of Tdap (Boostrix&#174;; GSK) among Koreans vaccinated in a real-world setting that included pregnant women. This observational study collected safety data from routine clinical practice. Given the design and nature of the post-marketing surveillance, results should be interpreted cautiously, as there was no control group and it was not possible to control for confounding factors.</p><p>In this six-year post-marketing surveillance, administration of Tdap (Boostrix&#174;; GSK) to adults and children 10 years or older, including pregnant women, for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis is shown to have a well-tolerated safety profile. In the future, AEs and their causal relationship to Tdap will continue to be monitored through routine spontaneous reporting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Authors would like to thank Business &amp; Decision Life Sciences platform for editorial assistance and manuscript coordination, on behalf of GSK.
