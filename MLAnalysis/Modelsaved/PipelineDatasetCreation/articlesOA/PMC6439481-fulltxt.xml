It has reported that VPS33B has close association with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome. Unfortunately, no further studies were conducted to reveal the role of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in the homeostasis of bile acids. In the current study, hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted male mice were used to investigate the metabolomics and lipidomics profiles of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> deficiency based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS) system. Hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted male mice displayed cholestasis and slight liver damage with increased serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP and T-Bili compared to wild-type mice. Targeted metabolomics analysis of bile acids revealed that increased taurine-conjugated bile acids accumulated in the serum of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted mice, while unconjugated bile acids were prone to decrease, accompanied by the regulation of bile acid homeostasis-related genes. In addition, lipid profiles were significantly altered with the lack of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in the liver. A variety of lipids, such as triglycerides and sphingomyelins, were significantly decreased in the liver and increased in the serum of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted mice compared to those in wild-type mice. Our study demonstrated that <italic>Vps33b</italic> influences the progress of liver metabolism both in bile acid circulation and lipid metabolism, which is involved in the progression of liver cholestasis in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>VPS33B</kwd><kwd>cholestasis</kwd><kwd>bile acids</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">81522047</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81573489</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81730103</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">81320108027</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003453</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">2017A030311018</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome (OMIM 208085), an autosomal recessive multiorgan disorder that was originally described in 1973 by Lutz-Richner typically presents with neurogenic arthrogryposis, multiplex congenita, renal tubular dysfunction and neonatal cholestasis with bile duct hypoplasia. This disorder mostly affects the offspring of consanguineous unions, where patients usually die within a few months of birth (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Horslen et al., 1994</xref>). Until now, approximately 75% of ARC patients were diagnosed with a <italic>VPS33B</italic> (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 33B) mutation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cullinane et al., 2009</xref>), while others were characterized with a mutation in <italic>VIPAR</italic>, a VPS33B interacting protein, or, <italic>Vps16B</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Rogerson and Gissen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>VPS33B, a 617 AA protein of the Sec-1/Muc18 (SM) family (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Huizing et al., 2001</xref>), is involved in the vesicular intracellular trafficking process and protein interactions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen C.H. et al., 2017</xref>). SM proteins together with SNAREs are generally required for membrane fusion through regulating the formation of quaternary SNARE complexes, including GTPases and other tethering proteins containing long coiled domains. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>). The general role of these proteins in membrane trafficking demonstrated the vital role of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in intracellular trafficking functions.</p><p>The function of VPS33B and its association with ARC disorder has been reported according to the many clinical features of this disease. For example, VPS33B is one of the first proteins found to be essential for a-granule biogenesis according to ARC syndrome. The absence of <italic>Vps33b</italic> causes a lack of a-granules, soluble cargo and p-selectin, a granule-specific membrane protein, in platelets leading to a bleeding diathesis, secondary to platelet dysfunction in ARC syndrome (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). Second, <italic>Vps33b</italic> was reported to take participate in the maturation of phagosomes and endosomes following microbial antigen ingestion (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Akbar et al., 2016</xref>). The lack of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in Drosophila contributes to accelerated inflammatory responses and microbial stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors. Furthermore, severe liver histological change is one of the most important features of ARC syndrome, including cholestasis, bile duct hypoplasia and lipofuscin granule deposition (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Eastham et al., 2001</xref>). Currently, although VPS33B function has been partly studied, there is no curative therapy for ARC syndrome, which is involved in multiple clinical features.</p><p>Clinical therapy for ARC simply relieves patient discomfort, such as ursodeoxycholate therapy, a promising drug for cholestasis that has been used to decrease pruritus mainly caused by the increased level of serum bilirubin. In that case, it suggests that bile acid metabolism disturbances might have a role in the etiopathogenesis of cholestasis in these ARC cases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdullah et al., 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, no further studies were conducted to reveal the role of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in the homeostasis of bile acids. Otherwise, it is reported that liver transplantation can significantly improve ARC patients&#8217; clinical symptoms and prolong patient growth status (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dehghani et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, dysregulated liver function is a severe sign among ARC patients who bear the <italic>VPS33B</italic> mutation. Thus, it is clear that VPS33B may play an important role in the liver, and mechanistic studies of VPS33B might be helpful to develop an ARC therapy or address other liver diseases.</p><p>Recently, the rise of omics studies, especially metabolomics and lipidomics, have become the preferred method to provide new insights into the etiology of liver diseases, new treatment modalities and a new understanding that may reveal potential therapeutic targets. For example, a metabolomics strategy has been used to map the bile acid profile <italic>in vivo</italic> and reveal how bile acid homeostasis is disrupted during the disease progression (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen P. et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted male mice were used to investigate the metabolomics and lipidomics profiles of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> deficiency in order to map the bile acids deposition and lipid profile of <italic>Vps33b</italic> hepatic knockout mice. Furthermore, the role of <italic>Vps33b</italic> in bile acids homeostasis and lipid metabolism and the involved mechanisms were further studied to find out possible therapeutics targets of diagnostic markers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and Reagents</title><p>Serum biochemistry measurement kits (ALT, AST, ALP, and TBILI) were purchased from Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd.

We found that hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> depletion caused cholestasis and slight liver injury in mice, which was also commonly observed in ARC patients as previously reported. A targeted bile acid study confirmed disrupted bile acid homeostasis associated with <italic>Vps33b</italic> deficiency in the liver, and genes involved in bile acid circulation were also transcriptionally regulated. The mis-location of the BSEP apical membrane transporter was evidence of the loss of hepatocyte polarity. Cell junction proteins regulate the injured cell barrier, which might contribute to deteriorating cholestasis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 1996</xref>).

There is a metabolism loop that stabilizes the bile acid pool.

Overall, alterations of bile acids among different tissues characterized the pathogenic conditions of cholestasis in hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted mice.

In addition to <italic>Bsep</italic>, the expression of other bile acid export transporters, <italic>Mrp2/3/4</italic>, did not change.</p><p>A clinical study demonstrated that the <italic>VPS33B</italic> mutation in ARC patients induced an unusual distribution of canalicular plasma membrane proteins. Liver biopsies of ARC patients revealed a clear disturbance in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) localization, which was present only at the canaliculus (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gissen et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, some BSEPs seemed to be expressed only at the basolateral hepatocyte membrane in the patient&#8217;s liver, which is supposed to be sorted to the apical membrane via RAB11A-positive apical recycling endosomes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cullinane et al., 2010</xref>) to export bile acids from hepatocytes to the bile duct. In addition, the localization of another apical membrane transporter of hepatocytes, MRP2, did not change. In our study, the BSEP expression pattern in hepatocytes of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic>-depleted mice was quite different from those of <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice. As an apically localized protein, BSEP might be predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm in the intrahepatic ABC-transporter pool, which is in an inactive state but is trafficked to the apical membrane to function as a bile acid exporting pump (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baier et al., 2006</xref>). It is clear that liver BSEP in <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice completed this intracellular trafficking process, which was stained around the apical membrane of hepatocytes and a small bile duct through its 3D structures (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">de Aguiar Vallim et al., 2013</xref>). However, <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, alb-cre mice showed more cytoplasmic staining without representative localization in membranes compared to <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice, even though its expression level was elevated in the liver. Overall, we concluded that mislocalization of BSEP contributed to cholestasis caused by hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> deficiency.</p><p>Cell junction proteins play an important role in sustaining hepatocyte polarity, which may serve as a belt junction between hepatocytes to prevent bile acid invasion from the bile duct. A study of mIMCD-3 cell polarity clarified that <italic>Vps33b</italic> deficiency caused structural and functional abnormalities, such as downregulated CLAUDIN-1 and E-CADHERIN1 expression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cullinane et al., 2010</xref>). The absence of CLAUDIN-1, a key regulator of paracellular permeability, leads to a severe autosomal recessive disorder whose phenotype is similar to ARC syndrome (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Colegio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hadj-Rabia et al., 2004</xref>). Together with a previous report, CLAUDIN-1 displayed irregular and tortuous distribution in the liver of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> knockout mice (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hanley et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that downregulated expression of CLAUDIN-1 in <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, alb-cre mice resulted in abnormalities in hepatocyte polarity. Furthermore, we found a converse change in E-CADHERIN1 expression in <italic>Vps33b<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, alb-cre mice, which was supposed to be reduced as characterized by impaired cell polarity. However, the involvement of <italic>E-cadherin</italic> in regulating liver pathophysiology remains unclear (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). As we mentioned previously, <italic>Vps33b</italic> functions on the apical protein sorting procedure via RAB11A-positive apical recycling endosomes. One possible pathway by which E-CADHERIN1 reaches the cell surface involves the Rab11-positive recycling complex rather than direct movement from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lock and Stow, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the correct localization of E-CADHERIN1, rather than its expression, might also be critical for liver function.</p><p>Cholestatic liver disease disturbs lipid absorption and metabolism.

Further study of the relationship between <italic>Vps33b</italic> and lipid metabolism at the molecular level should be performed.</p><p>In summary, we investigated the phenotype of hepatic <italic>Vps33b</italic> knockout mice, providing additional evidence of the effect of <italic>Vps33b</italic> on ARC like cholestastic liver injury. In addition, our study demonstrated that <italic>Vps33b</italic> influences the bile acid homeostasis and lipid metabolism in mice, which is involved in the progression of liver cholestasis, indicating potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers of ARC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript and/or the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Files</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>KF contributed to the study execution and manuscript preparation.
