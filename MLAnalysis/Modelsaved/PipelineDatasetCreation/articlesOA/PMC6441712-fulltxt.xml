Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, thus making it essential to find novel curative targets for CCA. Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells includes metabolic abnormalities in glucose (known as the Warburg effect) and other substances such as amino acids and fats. Metabolic reprogramming produces anti-oxidant substances, reduces tumor oxidative stress, and finally promotes the proliferation of tumors. There is increasing evidence to imply that SIRT2, a histone deacetylase, and its downstream target cMYC, play metabolic regulatory roles in tumor cells. However, the role of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA is unclear. To assess the metabolic reprogramming function of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA and to determine the downstream targets as well as evaluate the therapeutic effect, the CCA RNA-Seq data were downloaded from the TCGA database. Differentially expressed genes were confirmed and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Overall, 48 paired CCA samples were collected and subjected to immunohistochemical detection, and the clinical characteristics of participants were summarized. The CCA cells were suppressed or overexpressed with different downstream targets of SIRT2 and then subjected to apoptosis, immunoblotting, seahorse, and metabolites tracing analysis. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were also performed. We found that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway contributed to the proliferation of CCA cells and confirmed that the downstream target is PHDA1 and the serine synthesis pathway. The up-regulated SIRT2 and cMYC levels resulted in low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased conversion of glucose to serine and led to poor patient survival. The highly active SIRT2/cMYC pathway up-regulated the serine synthesis pathway pyruvate and increased antioxidant production, thus consequently protecting the CCA cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Our data revealed that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a critical role in transforming glucose oxidative metabolism to serine anabolic metabolism, thus providing antioxidants for stress resistance. SIRT2/cMYC-induced metabolic reprogramming may represent a new therapeutic target for treating CCA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant cancer with an unknown etiology and an unfavorable prognosis. The morbidity and mortality of CCA have increased year by year worldwide <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Because of limited diagnostic methodologies, the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and are not eligible for surgery, and many of these patients are further chemo-resistant to conventional chemotherapy <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Therefore, for the past three decades, the 5-year survival rates of CCA has remained only 10% <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Consequently, it is essential to find novel curative targets and therapeutic strategies for CCA.</p><p id="p0010">To meet the high demand for rapid proliferation under different stressed conditions, cancer cells reprogram their metabolisms <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Known as the Warburg effect, this metabolic reprograming is marked by a conversion from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This metabolic reprogramming produces anti-oxidant substances, reduces tumor oxidative stress, thereby finally promoting the proliferation of tumors. These metabolic changes facilitate the accumulation of lactate and glycolytic intermediates to promote the growth and invasion of tumor. Hence, reversing the Warburg effect can be a potential mechanism for cancer therapy <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Changes in the expression of key enzymes that catalyze these biosynthesis pathways have been found in multiple tumor metabolic reprogramming <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a multi-enzyme complex that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism, of which PDHA1 is the major component <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PDH can catalyze the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which plays a crucial role in many biological reactions <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Abnormal expression of PDH has been found in a variety of tumors. Several studies have found that PDH activates the metabolism of cancer cells from glycolysis to glucose oxidation, which reduces the lactate production and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus inducing the apoptosis and proliferation of tumor cells <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">In the process of metabolic reprogramming, another important factor for cancer cell proliferation is the activation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Serine is a non-essential amino acid in mammals, but plays an essential role in cancer progression <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Glycolytic metabolisms of glucose can be catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) to produce serine. Therefore, PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH are considered important components of SSP. As a scavenger of ROS, serine contributes to the redox balance to promote the proliferation of cancer cells <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the specific role of SSP in cancer remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="p0020">Post-translational modifications in metabolism regulation have attracted attention because of their ability to respond to changes in cellular metabolic status and regulate through upstream signal transduction pathways. Acetylation is a crucial post-translational modification found in the metabolic enzymes of cell regulation <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Deacetylases are classified into four groups (I-IV), wherein sirtuin (SIRTs) are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent class III histone deacetylases (HDACs). Among the seven SIRT homologues in mammals <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, SIRT2 catalyzes a variety of biological processes such as metabolism and gene expressions <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. There is growing evidence that SIRT2 promotes proliferation in malignant tumors <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that SIRT2 inhibitors have anti-tumor, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that SIRT2 can inhibit the ubiquitin degradation of cMYC, thus contributing to the stability of cMYC and the proliferation of cancer. However, a SIRT2 inhibitor, thiomyristoyl (Tm), can inhibit the growth of cancer cells by degrading cMYC <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. cMYC is an important transcription factor, which is up-regulated in numerous human tumors <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A recent research has further found that cMYC can stimulate SSP activation by transcriptionally up-regulating the expressions of SSP-related enzymes <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Together, these findings suggest that targeting the inhibition of SIRT2/cMYC may play a crucial role in cancer prevention and treatment. However, it remains unclear regarding whether the SIRT2/cMYC pathway has a synergistic effect on the metabolic reprogramming of CCA.</p><p id="p0025">In the present study, we found that SIRT2/cMYC promoted metabolic reprogramming in CCA through two signaling pathways: 1) promoting PDHA1 phosphorylation (p-PDHA1) to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation; and 2) promoting serine synthesis by activating the SSP pathway to reduce apoptosis. The SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a crucial role in transforming glucose oxidative metabolism to serine anabolic metabolism and thus provides antioxidants for stress resistance. SIRT2/cMYC-induced metabolic reprogramming may thus represent a new therapeutic target for treating CCA.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate</title><p id="p0030">All experiments utilizing human samples and involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee and Animal Welfare Committee of Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="p0035">The cells were maintained at 37&#176;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Therefore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CCA were analyzed using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the most relevant DEGs associated with metabolism and apoptosis were confirmed (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">sFigure 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). As a transcription factor and downstream protein of SIRT2, cMYC has attracted extensive interest for its potential role in tumorigenesis in many different human cancers &#8211; especially for its role in regulating the expression of metabolic genes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and muscle-specific pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, PDH is a gatekeeper of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and is always highly phosphorylated, thereby leading to an inactive state and contributing to the Warburg effect <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In order to identify the relevant protein targets of metabolic reprogramming, we first screened the cMYC-related targets in a normal bile duct epithelial cell line (Hibepicc) and two human CCA cell lines (HuCCT1 and RBE). We confirmed high levels of p-PDHA1, SIRT2, and its upstream target cMYC in CCA cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Because the Warburg effect is the key feature of tumor metabolism, the metabolic reprogramming changes were then evaluated by over-expressing SIRT2 in CCA cells. We found that while SIRT2 decreased the levels of TCA-related metabolites, it increased the level of lactate, thereby promoting the Warburg effect (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">sFigure 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).

In addition, these elevated expressions were associated with lower survival rates (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic>E</italic>).

As a well-known metabolic regulator, cMYC can be stabilized by the deacetylation activity of SIRT2 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We confirmed that SIRT2 stabilized cMYC protein through post-translational modification in CCA (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">sFigure 1</xref><italic>B</italic> and 1C). To further investigate how SIRT2 regulates metabolic reprogramming, Tm (a SIRT2 inhibitor) was added to CCA cells. After the inhibition of SIRT2, cMYC and p-PDHA1 decreased while apoptosis-related proteins (c-Caspase 3 and c-PARP) increased (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Furthermore, after knocking-down cMYC in CCA cells, we found that p-PDHA1 and apoptosis-related proteins decreased (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Also, rescue experiments showed over-expressing cMYC help CCA cells resist apoptosis in the presence of TM (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). This suggests that PDHA1 is the downstream of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway. Conversely, neither CPI613 (a PDHA1 inhibitor) nor PDHA1 knockdown could significantly change the levels of apoptotic proteins in CCA cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). Additionally, the inhibition of PDHA1 led to a reduction of the OCR, which suggests a decrease in TCA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><italic>F</italic>). The aforementioned results together suggest that PDHA1 is the downstream target of SIRT2/cMYC by regulating glucose metabolism in CCA.

As previously demonstrated, the SIRT2/cMYC pathway promotes metabolic reprogramming in CCA through two signaling pathways: 1) promoting p-PDHA1 to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and 2) promoting serine synthesis by activating the SSP pathway to increase antioxidant production. To evaluate whether the SSP pathway plays a key role in CCA cell apoptosis, NAC (an antioxidant) was used in combination with Tm. Our results revealed that NAC treatment alone did not affect apoptosis in CCA cells, though Tm treatment alone was able to promote apoptosis. The combination of Tm and NAC, however, led to a significant decrease in apoptosis as compared with Tm used alone (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

Among these, the metabolic reprogramming of glucose is called the Warburg effect. Nonetheless, the question of how metabolites in metabolic reprogramming help induce tumorigenesis and which proteins are key targets for this metabolism remains unanswered. In this study, we identified the promoting role of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA, identified its downstream targets, and evaluated its therapeutic effect (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="f0035"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic model of the effects of SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA cells.</bold></p><p>SIRT2 and cMYC reprogrammed the metabolism of CCA cells by up-regulating downstream p-PHDA1 and PHGDH/PSAT1/PSPH.

The removal of the acetyl group from lysine residues is coupled with the hydrolysis of NAD to generate nicotinamide, lysine, and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. SIRT2 is responsible for catalyzing many biological processes, including genetic control, development and metabolism. Many previous studies have shown that SIRT2 increases the migration and invasion of cancer cells, demonstrating that it may play a role in promoting cancer proliferation and metastasis <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, some studies have shown that SIRT2 may be a tumor-suppressor gene in various other cancers <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Therefore, SIRT2 might promote tumor progression in certain cases, such as human gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer, while under other conditions it may inhibit tumor progression. It is worth noting that LDH-A <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, tubulin <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> are substrates of this deacetylase, suggesting that SIRT2 affects different metabolism in different tumors to promote the biological behaviors of various tumors. In fact, after inhibiting SIRT2 in CCA cells, two significant changes in different metabolic pathways are observed: one is glycolysis reversal by promoting PDHA1 phosphorylation (p-PDHA1) to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and the other is promotion of the SSP pathway via aiding serine synthesis activity. Interestingly, we found that the reversal of PDHA1 phosphorylation alone was insufficient to induce significant apoptosis. This indicates that although glucose metabolism changes induced by SIRT2 are observed in CCA apoptosis, a high degree of serine anabolic metabolism provides an antioxidant effect against stress, which plays a more important role.</p><p id="p0160">There are many kinds of SIRT2 inhibitors, mainly including nicotinamide, which inhibits NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent reactions <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and competitive inhibitors such as sirtinol, spitomicin, and cambinol <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Researchers have found that SIRT2 inhibitors have anti-tumor <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, anti-inflammatory <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and anti-diabetic properties. SIRT2 shares a common structure with other members of the SIRT family, such as SIRT1, which is one of the most widely studied SIRTs and regulates cell migration, apoptosis, and proliferation <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Therefore, the off-target effects of inhibitors should not be ignored. Consequently, a specific inhibitor (Tm) was used. It inhibited SIRT2 with an IC50 value of 0.028 mM and SIRT1 with an IC50 value of 98 mM, but did not inhibit SIRT3, even at 200 mM <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Hence, the inhibition of SIRT2, rather than other SIRTs, may play a leading and more efficient role in reversing metabolic reprogramming. In addition, in the CCA tumorigenesis mouse model in which SIRT2 was inhibited by Tm, tumor growth was delayed without significant side effects.</p><p id="p0165">As an oncogene, <italic>cMYC</italic> has received much attention as a result of its potential role in promoting tumorigenesis. There are many mechanisms by which cMYC induces tumorigenesis, and the enhancement of the Warburg effect is one method. This study found that cMYC is a crucial downstream target of SIRT2. Many studies have also elucidated that cMYC can elevate metabolic proteins such as LDHA and PKM2 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and is therefore considered a promising anti-cancer target. The present study demonstrates that cMYC has an elevated expression in CCA and predicts an unfavorable prognosis. In addition, cMYC is positively associated with p-PDHA1 and SSP-related enzymes and contributes to a high serine level. Our work has determined that the inhibition of cMYC can be used to reduce serine, thereby effectively promoting apoptosis in CCA cells.</p><p id="p0170">Glucose is the main source for serine biosynthesis <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, little is known about how glycolysis intertwines with SSP activation to coordinate cell survival and proliferation. Previous studies have reported that increased SSP activation was observed in breast cancer during serine starvation to maintain cell survival <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Herein we confirmed the importance of SSP activation in CCA proliferation. We also observed that by inhibiting the SIRT2/cMYC pathway, the reduced glycolytic metabolism changed to an elevated serine synthesis metabolism. These results suggest that high serine anabolic metabolism, which provides antioxidants for stress resistance, is essential for preventing apoptosis in CCA cells. We further observed that SIRT2/cMYC and its downstream targets may represent the intersecting points of metabolic reprogramming between glycolysis and SSP, highlighting the importance of SIRT2 for cell survival under redox imbalance conditions.</p><p id="p0175">Our data show that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a crucial role in the conversion of glucose oxidative metabolism to serine anabolic metabolism, thus providing antioxidants for stress resistance.
