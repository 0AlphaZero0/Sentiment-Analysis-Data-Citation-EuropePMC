ENB using the superDimension&#8482; navigation system. This prospectively
collected subgroup analysis presents the patient demographics, procedural

included. General anesthesia was used in 68.2%. Lesion location was
confirmed by radial endobronchial ultrasound in 34.5% of procedures. The
median ENB procedure time was 31.0&#8201;min. Concurrent lung lesion biopsy was
conducted in 82.6% (213/258) of patients. A mean of 2.2 &#177; 1.7 FMs (median
1.0&#8201;FMs) were placed per patient and 99.2% were accurately positioned based
on subjective operator assessment. Follow-up imaging showed that 94.1%

for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the last 10&#8211;15&#8201;years, stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) has been developed and refined to deliver high doses of
radiation in fewer fractions compared with conventionally fractionated radiation
through improved target localization, motion management, and reduced set-up error.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> SBRT is commonly used to treat early-stage NSCLC and oligometastatic disease,
with high local control rates of 83&#8211;100%.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> SBRT is typically delivered over one to five fractions within 1&#8211;2&#8201;weeks.
Greater accuracy and precision of treatment allow very high biologically effective
radiation doses to the tumor while minimizing toxicity and radiation to surrounding tissues.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This dose escalation is optimally delivered using computed tomography (CT)
simulators and linear accelerators with respiratory motion management. The two basic
approaches to motion management during SBRT are gated and nongated treatments. Gated
SBRT treatments often depend on fiducial marker (FM) implantation in or near the
tumor to localize the corresponding structure and deliver the radiation only when
the tumor is in the correct position in the breathing cycle, or during a
breath-hold. Nongated SBRT treatments typically minimize motion through mechanical
compression of the abdomen to restrict diaphragmatic excursion. Other linear
accelerator systems that depend on fiducials for respiratory-gated treatments
typically monitor fiducials before, during, and after the radiation beam is turned
on to ensure the target center is correctly positioned, maximize accuracy of
high-dose radiation treatments to small targets, and afford tight dose conformity to
targets that are particularly close to organs at risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr6-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>FMs are also useful for localizing small peripheral lung tumors to aid the surgeon

surgical localization and the only prospective, multicenter study of FM placement
yet conducted. Most studies report placing markers by bronchoscopic or percutaneous
image-guided approaches with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 112 (18&#8211;245 FMs
placed).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Our cohort demonstrated that ENB-guided FM placement is associated with low
complication rates overall (7.0%), with pneumothorax in 5.4% (3.1% grade &#10878; 2),
occurring less often compared with reports of percutaneous FM placement (5&#8211;67%).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Pneumothorax rates in this FM-placement substudy were similar to those
published for the entire United States cohort (including ENB-guided lung biopsy, FM
placement, and dye marking) at 4.3% overall and 2.9% for grade &#10878; 2.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In the 39 patients who had FM placement without biopsy, there were no
pneumothoraces or significant bleeding events. Thus, with or without concurrent
biopsy, ENB-guided FM placement has low complication rates.</p><p>The scope of this multicenter investigation highlighted several interesting practice
patterns not previously available in single-center studies. First, ENB is a
versatile tool for evaluating thoracic malignancies, allowing for FM placement,
tissue sampling, and pleural dye marking in the same anesthetic event. Of the 258
patients undergoing ENB-guided FM placement, 82.6% (213/258) also had lung lesion
biopsy and 4.7% (12/258) also had dye marking (including six patients with all three
procedures). Complication rates were similar for patients that had FM placement
alone <italic>versus</italic> FM placement with other concurrent procedures. The
flexibility to conduct multiple tasks under one anesthetic agent has the potential
to be more convenient for the patient and reduce time from biopsy to therapy
compared with conducting multiple procedures at different times. Further study of
the impact of ENB in the evaluation of thoracic malignancies is needed.</p><p>Second, 99% of FMs were accurately placed under ENB guidance based on the operator&#8217;s
subjective assessment. Accuracy of marker placement for SBRT has been described in
some studies as the ability of various tracking systems to track at least three FMs
a certain distance and angle apart in six dimensions [<italic>X</italic> (pitch),
<italic>Y</italic> (row), <italic>Z</italic> (yaw) directions and rotation
around the <italic>X/Y/Z</italic> axes].<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Target tracking errors may
result in inaccurate dosing and damage to uninvolved surrounding tissue.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Unfortunately,
details on interfiducial marker distance, degree of angles between FMs, tracking
accuracy, and SBRT system type were not captured in NAVIGATE. These questions
require further study.</p><p>FM position and stability are critical for optimal SBRT with linear accelerator
systems using a gated technique. In the current study, the type of FM used and
number placed per patient varied between operators, ranging from 1&#8211;12 with a mean of
2.2 (the patient with 12 FMs placed had 2 lung lesions). This practice pattern
variation is very interesting given that most markers placed were for SBRT therapy.
If respiratory gating is utilized, the general recommendation is to place at least
three FMs per lesion, although this is not universally accepted.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, some NAVIGATE centers
routinely placed only two markers. ENB-guided FM placement may also be employed if
FMs previously placed by percutaneous methods were inadequate in number or location.
The range observed in NAVIGATE likely reflects practice pattern variation between
centers, as well as differences between private practice and academic centers (which
may be more likely to treat two or more tumors with SBRT and therefore place more FM
per patient overall). Interestingly, this practice pattern variation has also been
documented in survey studies of radiation oncologists across the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The SuperLock nitinol coil FM was the most common (80.6%) FM used, possibly due to
the exclusive use of that FM at the highest enrolling center of the cohort. Concern
about marker migration or better tactile ability for surgical localization may
influence choice of FM type. There is sparse information comparing the performance
of various types of FMs. In one study of 15 patients using SuperLock nitinol coil
FMs who received SBRT, 100% of patients had retention of FMs from implantation. The
authors also observed minimal interfractional fiducial migration during the course
of radiation treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In another study, the VortX coil FM had a retention rate of 96.7% (from
pretreatment radiation planning CT scan to the first day of therapy) compared to
two-band (72%) and the gold-seed (69%) markers.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The VortX FM was the second most common marker utilized in the NAVIGATE
study. Regardless of the type of FM used, 94% were present on follow-up imaging. For
those patients that ultimately received radiation therapy, data on whether the FMs
were maintained through radiation treatment and whether there was significant
interfractional FM migration is unavailable. Factors affecting physician choice of
FM type needs further exploration.</p><p>While most operators utilized general anesthesia (69%) for FM placement, a
significant number also employed moderate sedation in concordance with published
literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="bibr29-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="bibr30-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The effect of
sedation method on ENB-guided FM placement has not been specifically addressed. One
report demonstrated no significant difference in procedural complications between
general anesthesia and moderate sedation with ENB-guided biopsies, including 23
patients who underwent ENB solely for FM placement.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The median duration of the procedure was 57&#8201;min overall and 31&#8201;min for the ENB
procedure, similar to the overall NAVIGATE study (52&#8201;min and 25&#8201;min, respectively)<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and ENB literature reports ranging from 20 to 70&#8201;min.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Procedure
times were even shorter in those patients with only FM placement and no lung lesion
biopsy. Additionally, ENB guidance was aided by cone&#8211;beam CT in 4% and rEBUS in 37%.
rEBUS is commonly used to confirm appropriate positioning for biopsy or FM
placement.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These complimentary technologies help to confirm appropriate

scan and data obtained during bronchoscopy.</p><p>A total of 62 patients had FM placed prior to lung surgery (50 for localization only
and 12 for both SBRT and localization). Data were not collected on whether the
markers were useful during the surgery, or the type of surgical approach (i.e. wedge
resection followed by lobectomy). Additionally, the type of FM preferred by the
surgeons or reasoning behind the FM choice was not recorded. Interestingly, there
are only two prior, retrospective, single-center reports of ENB-guided FM placement
in four patients to aid in wedge resection of peripheral pulmonary
nodules.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
Successful CT-guided percutaneous localization with FM, hook wire, and pleural dye

hemorrhage, pleural reaction, and dislodgement, which can lead to localization
failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Further studies will clarify the optimal method and indication
for preoperative marker placement to localize deeper nodules for surgical resection.
The growing interest in robotic surgery for segmental and subsegmental resection of
ground glass opacities and subsolid nodules will likely require improved methods of
localization, such as dye or FM placement.</p><sec id="section13-1753466619841234"><title>Limitations</title><p>NAVIGATE is an observational cohort study collecting data on ENB procedures in a
large and diverse study population. This pragmatic design provides a broad
picture of ENB usage patterns and outcomes in a generalizable, unrestricted
setting. However, it also poses some limitations with regard to important data
not mandated by the intentionally flexible study protocol. First, defining
placement accuracy based on the operator&#8217;s subjective assessment may not be the
most clinically appropriate indicator for SBRT success. Distance from the marker
to the lesion, position of markers, and migration were not recorded. The ability
to successfully track FM in three or more dimensions for those patients
receiving gated radiation treatments may have been a more relevant definition.
Second, the type of SBRT system used per operator was not specified. Given the
heterogeneity of radiation systems employed to treat patients with lung SBRT, it
is unclear whether the FMs were used to deliver gated treatments or whether they
were simply used to improve target localization for nongated treatments. Third,
only the number of FMs placed per patient, not per lesion, was recorded. The
number of fiducials used was left to the discretion of the bronchoscopist,
presumably based on feedback from the radiation oncologist or local physicist.
This reflects widely variable SBRT clinical practice patterns.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1753466619841234" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Finally, lesion characteristics data (such as location and size) were not
collected for the FM subgroup.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-1753466619841234"><title>Conclusion</title><p>NAVIGATE is the largest prospective study of ENB yet conducted and, to our knowledge,
