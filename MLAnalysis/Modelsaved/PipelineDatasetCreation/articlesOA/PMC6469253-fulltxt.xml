Preprocessing continued in the FSL software toolkit (Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK) with motion correction, nonlinear noise reduction (SUSAN), spatial smoothing with a 5&#8208;mm Gaussian kernel, temporal filtering, and prewhitening. The FLOBS tool in FSL was then used to generate a hemodynamic response function basis set with three components that had sufficient flexibility to account for a large array of temporal delays expected in the data, and a general linear model used to fit the time&#8211;series data with the FSL tool FEAT. Region of Interest (ROI) analyses were performed using the FSL tool Featquery within two functionally defined regions in the occipital lobe. These ROIs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="acn3761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were derived from an independent dataset from CAA participants acquired at 1.5&#160;T,<xref rid="acn3761-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> then mapped into MNI space for use across participants. The primary and secondary ROIs for the analysis were defined by the voxels activated in at least 50% or at least 25%, of the runs across all CAA participants, respectively. The primary ROI for the analysis, ROI1, was used to extract the mean of the modeled time&#8211;courses within the ROI. A larger secondary ROI, ROI2, was used to extract a <italic>z</italic>&#8208;score&#8211;weighted mean of the modeled voxel&#8208;wise time&#8208;courses within the ROI.

</p><p>For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in natural logarithm of the slope of visual stimulus&#8208;driven fMRI responses, ponezumab showed negligible mean treatment effect at Day 2 and marginally negative mean treatment effect at Day 90. At both timepoints, the placebo group remained stable, but the direction of any mean treatment effect was opposite to the hypothesized direction. As such, the treatment did not produce the expected improvement in the radiologic surrogate of vascular dysfunction, and the prespecified criteria for efficacy were not met at either Day 2 or 90. The individual fMRI secondary endpoints were in line with primary endpoint observations.</p><p>The failure to meet the primary endpoint may indicate that vascular amyloid was not cleared, or perhaps not sufficiently cleared, to improve vascular reactivity. The unexpected trend towards a decrease in vascular reactivity estimated via fMRI could be due to mobilization of amyloid plaque,<xref rid="acn3761-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> mobilization of vascular amyloid with resultant vascular damage, the possibility of a random chance finding associated with a small sample size, or a currently unidentified effect of antiamyloid immunotherapy.</p><p>The large gamut of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data obtained longitudinally did not show any concerning changes in the ponezumab group, so there is no indication that the reduced slope observed on fMRI represents a clinically meaningful worsening. As the BOLD fMRI signal is influenced by a combination of neurometabolic, vascular, and hemodynamic responses to the visual stimulus, a definitive biological interpretation of the observed fMRI time&#8211;course is not currently possible. Further, the timing and direction of the vascular reactivity response to amyloid&#8211;removing therapy is unknown, as this is the first study of this kind. It is possible that the removal of amyloid from the vessel wall triggers a transient increase in cerebrovascular dysfunction. Future studies employing this fMRI technique could consider additional time points to more fully characterize the response.</p><p>The consistency of baseline and placebo data in this study, together with the fMRI results from previously published studies,<xref rid="acn3761-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> suggest that it is feasible to use the technique in a consistent manner across multiple study timepoints and sites, so it may become a viable biomarker for future studies.<xref rid="acn3761-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="acn3761-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Our results were unique in suggesting that a pharmacologic intervention might cause a consistent change in these fMRI markers. The exact physiologic determinants of these markers and the clinical implications of altering them remain to be determined.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, relatively short duration of treatment, and limited number of timepoints. Another potential limitation is misdiagnosis of CAA, though we note that the modified Boston criteria appear to have high specificity (87.5% to 100%) among symptomatic patients. The novel finding of a tendency towards apparent reduced vascular reactivity with little evidence of ARIA or other overt inflammatory effects raises the possibility of a previously unidentified effect of antiamyloid immunotherapy that may be worthy of further investigation.</p><p>Future CAA studies should employ advanced brain imaging to disentangle the potential cause&#8211;effect relationships between amyloid load and vascular function and may help us understand how pharmacologic interventions can modify these important parameters to obtain a beneficial clinical effect.</p></sec><sec id="acn3761-sec-0017"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CL, JG, YZ, PH, JP, EG, MB, ES, and SG contributed to conception and design of the study; CL, JG, YZ, PH, JP, EG, ML, LF, AV, SS, MB, ES, and SG contributed to acquisition and analysis of data, and CL, JG, YZ, PH, JP, EG, ML, LF, SS, AV, MB, ES, and SG contributed to drafting of the manuscript and/or figures.</p><p>Ponezumab Trial Study Group:</p><p>Anand Viswanathan (Massachusetts General Hospital),</p><p>Charlotte Cordonnier (Lille University),</p><p>David John Werring (University College London),</p><p>Sandra Elizabeth Black (University of Toronto),</p><p>Lawrence Sterling Honig (Columbia Univeristy),</p><p>Catharina J.M.
