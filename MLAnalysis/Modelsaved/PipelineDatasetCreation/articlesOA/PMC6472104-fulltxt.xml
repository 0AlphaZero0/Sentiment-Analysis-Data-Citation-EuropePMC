Health education (HE) provides beneficial starting point for physical activity (PA) promotion in schools. This study evaluates an intervention integrated into three HE lessons to increase PA and reduce sedentary behavior (SB) among eighth graders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">All public secondary schools in Tampere, Finland participated and were randomized to intervention (INT, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7) and comparison group (COM, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;7). In INT (690 students, 36 classes) the teachers (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;14) implemented behavioral theory-driven content during three HE lessons. In COM (860 students, 41 classes) the teachers (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;14) carried out standard lessons. The evaluation was based on RE-AIM: <bold>E</bold>ffectiveness was assessed from baseline to 4&#8201;weeks (Follow-up 1) and <bold>M</bold>aintenance from 4&#8201;weeks to 7&#8201;months (Follow-up 2) with change in students&#8217; PA and SB and related psychosocial and parental factors. Methods included questionnaire, accelerometer and activity diary. Linear mixed models with baseline adjustments and random effect correction were used to compare the difference in change between INT and COM. Data on <bold>R</bold>each, <bold>A</bold>doption and <bold>I</bold>mplementation were collected during the process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Intervention effects were only seen in the self-reported data favoring INT in the weekly number of days with at least 1&#8201;h of brisk leisure PA (0.3 [95%CI 0.1 to 0.6]), proportion of students meeting PA recommendations (4.1 [95%CI 2.5 to 5.7]), proportion of students reporting that their family sets limitations for screen time (5.4 [95%CI 3.3 to 7.4]) and in the number of days on which the students intended to do leisure PA in the following week (0.3 [95%CI 0.1 to 0.6]). The effects on PA were still beneficial for INT at Follow-up 2. The intervention reached 96% of the students, was adopted in all 7 schools and was implemented by 13/14 teachers in 35/36 classes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The intervention was feasible and had small favorable effects on students&#8217; self-reported PA, intention to do PA and family norm in screen time. The effects on PA persisted until Follow-up 2. It is likely that for greater impacts the HE lessons should have been supported with other actions without compromising feasibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01633918?term=NCT01633918&amp;rank=1">NCT01633918</ext-link> (June 27th, 2012).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12889-019-6737-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>School</kwd><kwd>RE-AIM</kwd><kwd>Health education</kwd><kwd>Lessons</kwd><kwd>Health promotion</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003126</institution-id><institution>Opetus- ja Kulttuuriministeri&#246;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRO 139/627/2010</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Majority of adolescents in Finland and many other European countries are not sufficiently physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is alarming since physical activity (PA) is associated positively with adolescents&#8217; immediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and future health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the patterns of PA in adolescence are also likely to transfer to adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and in adults, physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of ill-health and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Actions are therefore needed to promote PA and reduce sedentary behavior (SB) among adolescents.</p><p id="Par14">During the past decade schools have been harnessed to tackle diverse public health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] such as physical inactivity. School reaches majority of children and adolescents regardless of their family background or life circumstances, covers half of their daily waking hours throughout the year and encloses many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] during which the lifestyles are still modifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Most scientific reviews conclude that school-based interventions may be effective in promoting adolescents&#8217; PA although the effects have generally been small (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Especially multicomponent whole-school approaches have shown promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] but contradictory findings have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The effects of information and communication technology in conjunction with other delivery modes seem also encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In Finnish secondary schools (grades 7&#8211;9, ages 13&#8211;15) health education (HE) provides an exceptionally favorable platform for PA promotion. It is a stand-alone compulsory subject with 3 courses each including 38 lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The content is guided by the National Core Curricula, which can be locally adapted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The main themes are growth and development; health in everyday choices; resources and coping skills; and health, society and culture. To qualify, the teachers need to undergo 60 university credits in health sciences. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to WHO Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) -survey, the perceptions of Finnish 13&#8211;15-year old students about HE lessons are primarily positive: 86% of girls and 79% of boys agree that HE lessons teach them to think about the pros and cons related to various health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">HE is also part of national or state curricula in some other EU countries and for example in the United States and Canada. In these countries, HE is most commonly incorporated into other subjects such as physical education, social studies or specific health programs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Regardless of its univocal potential no publications on utilizing curriculum-based HE in PA promotion can be found in Finland or internationally.</p><p id="Par18">This paper reports the RE-AIM evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] of a randomized controlled Kids Out! -intervention, which aimed to promote PA and reduce SB among eighth graders by integrating behavioral theory-driven content into three routinely scheduled HE lessons in secondary schools. The multimodal content included Internet-based self-assessment with feedback views, YouTube-video, refillable student leaflet, refillable classroom poster, classroom peer-discussions and parental leaflet.

The questionnaire uses Geographic Information System (GIS) to enable the respondents to map their school routes, places of PA, modes of transportation and social activity. It also includes two questions on leisure-time PA and screen time. After completing the SoftGIS questionnaire the students received a refillable FeetEnergy-homework leaflet, which included three sections: 1) self-assessment of PA and SB, 2) health-related information on PA and SB and 3) action plan for increasing PA and reducing SB. The students were to complete the first two sections for the next lesson (Lesson #2) and they were given a parental leaflet with similar contents to deliver home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Lesson #2</title><p id="Par23">The lesson started with discussions about the school-specific feedback views accumulated automatically from the students&#8217; responses to SoftGIS questionnaire. The three views gave the students an overview on their active commuting to school, weekly moderate-intensity leisure PA and on meeting screen time recommendations. In the end of the lesson, the students received a link to a YouTube video (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q22XOs1DEtM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q22XOs1DEtM</ext-link>) providing information and ideas for being more physically active and reducing sitting in everyday life. The students were to watch the video and complete the last section of the FeetEnergy-leaflet (action plan for increasing PA and reducing SB) for Lesson #3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Lesson #3</title><p id="Par24">The class watched the FeetEnergy-video together and discussed their action plans in the FeetEnergy leaflet in pairs or small groups. After that the students had an opportunity to write their action plans on the FeetEnergy-poster attached to the classroom wall. The lesson ended with teacher&#8217;s brief summary about the action plans and a suggestion to finish the poster for the next lesson by writing comments on how the action plans had been accomplished. In the beginning of Lesson #4 the teachers were encouraged to have a brief discussion with the students about the comments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparison group (COM)</title><p id="Par25">The teachers were asked to reschedule their standard HE lessons on PA to the same time period as in INT. Otherwise, only data collection was carried out in COM and the teachers received the intervention material after the study. Before the intervention a short electronic questionnaire was addressed to the HE teachers (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;28) in INT and COM to clarify what the standard HE practices on PA were at 8th grades. It included questions about the number of HE lessons on PA during the school year; the type of material used during the HE lessons on PA (a list of 9 materials: text book, Internet, booklets or leaflets, videos, activity trackers etc.); and the topics always raised during the HE lessons on PA (a list of 13 topics: PA recommendations, health benefits of PA, injury risks of PA, harmfulness of sitting/screen time etc.).</p><p id="Par26">The response to the questionnaire was obtained from 14 (100%) teachers in INT and 10 (71%) teachers in COM. The mean number of HE lessons on PA during the whole school year varied from 2 to 11 depending on the school. Five schools (3 in INT and 2 in COM) had eight or more HE lessons on PA. There was no statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.68) in the mean number of HE lessons on PA between INT (6.7, SD 5.1) and COM (6.0, SD 2.6). Neither were there differences in the mean number of PA material used in HE lessons (3.5 in INT and 3.8 in COM, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.58) nor topics discussed during the lessons (8.6 in INT and 7.3 in COM, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.23) between the groups.

The students received written instructions to wear the accelerometer on their right hip during waking hours for 7&#8201;days from Monday to Sunday and to remove it only for sauna, shower and water activities. The device has been found as valid as the most commonly used accelerometer (Actigraph GTX3, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola FL, USA) in assessing adolescents&#8217; PA and SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. After both measurement periods the accelerometer-users in both groups received an individual graphical feedback about their daily amount of intensity-specific PA and SB and meeting the PA recommendations.</p><p id="Par31">A 7-day activity diary illustrated in Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> was used to estimate PA and SB in specific contexts such as &#8216;walking or cycling to/from school&#8217;, &#8216;PA/SB during school hours&#8217; and &#8216;participation in organized sports&#8217;. Each day at 9&#8201;p.m. a text message was sent to the students and/or to one of the parents on to remind them of completing the diary entries from the same day and of using the accelerometer on the next day. The mobile phone numbers were obtained from the informed consents.</p><p id="Par32">At baseline one school in COM with 130 students was not able to arrange the distribution of accelerometers and activity diaries and thus only questionnaire data was collected at all measurement points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Effectiveness &#8212; secondary indicators</title><p id="Par33">Psychosocial factors (family norm, short-term behavioral intention, confidence to execute the behavioral intention) related to walking or cycling to school, leisure PA and screen time were assessed to examine the possible changes underpinning behavior change. The indicators were chosen based on previous reviews, which show that self-efficacy, intention to change behavior and family support are among the most powerful correlates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and mediators of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] behind adolescents&#8217; PA.

Each student delivered a questionnaire to their parents at Baseline and Follow-up 1 and returned the completed questionnaire back to school in a sealed envelope. The background section included questions on e.g. respondent&#8217;s relationship with the student (mother/father/other), education, working status, weight, height, self-rated fitness, activity level at age 14 to 15, transportation mode to work, and weekly PA and daily sitting. The section with effectiveness indicators included questions on knowledge about PA and screen time recommendations; family discussions on leisure PA, school commuting and screen time; and family efforts to influence child&#8217;s leisure PA, walking and cycling to school and screen time. The items were chosen after exploring previous studies about the parental correlates of PA in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and the questions were developed particularly for this study because no valid measures for evaluating change in the items were found (Additional&#160;file&#160;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Adoption</title><p id="Par35">The adoption rate indicates the extent to which the setting participates in the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

For this purpose, the teachers were e-mailed an electronic questionnaire.</p><p id="Par41">Due to practical and financial reasons the two-year rule could not have been followed in evaluating maintenance at individual level. Instead, the purpose was to see whether the effects on behavior and psychosocial factors possibly discovered at Follow-up 1 (4&#8201;weeks from baseline) were maintained until Follow-up 2 (7&#8201;months from baseline). This was assessed with between-group difference in change from Follow-up 1 to Follow-up 2 only in variables, which showed statistically significant effects at Follow-up 1.

In relation to this the participation rate of 96% in the present study was excellent resulting most likely from the mandatory nature of HE lessons. As previously shown, incorporating activities into the regular school curriculum may lead to lower attrition and better representativeness than delivery with voluntary commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, the characteristics of non-participants and participants are seldom compared in school-based studies. Some studies have found differences in e.g. socioeconomic environment, participation in sports clubs or time spent in sedentary activities but in others no differences have been detected. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the present study the non-participants did not differ from the participants in a statistically significant way. High participation rate in the intervention lessons and similarity of non-participants and participants indicate that integrating PA promotion in HE lessons may be an efficient and non-selective way to reach the target group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Effectiveness</title><p id="Par62">Previous overview by Naylor and McKay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] on preventing inactivity in schools indicates that classroom-based education alone is not able to increase adolescents&#8217; PA levels but if supplemented with self-assessment and tracking may be effective in reducing screen time. The findings of the present study, which included the supplementary elements mentioned above, did not support this view. Most reviews on school-based PA promotion advocate whole-school approaches employing multilevel strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is thus likely that in order to change PA or SB behavior, the HE lessons of the present intervention should have been supported with environmental and policy strategies, community involvement and more powerful linkage to the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, this would have required more staff and time resources, which cannot be easily obtained in real-life contexts such as schools.</p><p id="Par63">Naylor and McKay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] further state that in some studies classroom-based HE has been shown to affect positively psychosocial variables of PA. The findings of the present study supported this view partially as beneficial effects were seen in the student-reported family norm for screen time and students&#8217; intention to do brisk leisure PA following week. However, the knowledge base on the psychosocial factors of PA in adolescence is still quite thin mainly due to heterogeneity of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, the studies on mediators of change in PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] are predominantly cross-sectional preventing from making causal conclusions. It is also possible that the mediators differ between subjectively and objectively measured PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Regarding parental indicators no studies could be found, which examined the effects of school-based intervention similarly to the present study. There are at least three potential explanations for the ineffectiveness of the intervention to influence on parental knowledge, family discussions and family efforts. The first is implementation, which will be discussed further in the implementation section. The second pertains to measures, which may have been too vague to catch potential small changes. The third lies in the intervention itself: the parental leaflet may have been too minimal even for increasing knowledge and involvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Adoption</title><p id="Par65">In the present study the adoption rate was 100% since all the schools, which were invited, participated and completed the study. Comparison with earlier studies is difficult since adoption is seldom reported in PA interventions among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, the adoption rate of the present study indicates that the school staff was highly interested in PA promotion and despite of extra burden, resilient to finish off the actions, which they had been initially signed in.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Implementation</title><p id="Par66">It is suggested that the level of implementation affects the outcomes of health promotion interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. By contrast, Naylor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] found in their systematic review on school-based PA interventions that in most studies the level of implementation was not linked to changes in PA or SB. The authors, however, state that the lack of linkage does not necessarily mean that there is no connection. The finding may have also resulted from the heterogeneity of implementation and outcome measures. The present intervention showed high fidelity (except in parental material) but only minor effects. In this respect the findings are in line with the previous review and indicate that other issues than implementation were responsible for the modest outcomes.</p><p id="Par67">Factors influencing (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]) and strategies enhancing implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have recently been examined more intensively. Studies indicate, for example, that contextual appropriateness influences the implementation of school-based PA interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the present study the appropriateness was operationalized as responsiveness and included acceptability of the HE lessons and applicability of the material. Both showed only moderate rating but still, the fidelity of the intervention was high in terms of teachers, lessons and classes. Thus, it seems that once the teachers had committed to the intervention, they delivered it regardless of perceived weaknesses in responsiveness.</p><p id="Par68">The moderate-only responsiveness may partly be explained by comments in the Teacher&#8217;s Manual, which revealed that some teachers had technical problems with the computers in Lesson#1 and Lesson #2, some had difficulties in facilitating conversation during the lessons and some experienced frustration in capturing the students&#8217; interest in the subject. However, the comments on a specific lesson or material may have been completely opposite between the teachers and also within a single teacher depending on the class she/he had been teaching. This becomes understandable through a separate study, which videotaped some of the intervention lessons and demonstrated, how the flow of a single lesson was affected by the interaction between individual teacher and the students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The finding also justifies the teacher-based random effect correction in the statistical analysis of effectiveness.</p><p id="Par69">Involving teachers and students in the planning process may have led to better responsiveness. In a previous study participation of the target group has been considered important for the applicability, effectiveness, engagement and sustainability of the school-based health promotion programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Taking teachers&#8217; views into account has been shown to make the approaches more meaningful and relevant to the teachers enhancing the implementation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Moreover, students&#8217; participation in school health promotion has been found to have beneficial effects on students themselves, school as an organization, student interaction and student-adult relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">The poor parental recollection of receiving intervention material from school was likely to be one important reason for the lack of effectiveness in parental knowledge, family discussions and family efforts: no effects can be expected if only a marginal proportion of parents was exposed to the intervention. Involving parents has proved challenging also in other school-based interventions promoting PA in youth (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]) although there are few exceptions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]). With this in mind and given that peers seem to have more power over adolescents&#8217; PA than parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] it seems worth weighing how much parental involvement is invested in interventions targeting PA promotion in adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Maintenance</title><p id="Par71">Maintenance is generally the least reported dimension in PA interventions among youth mostly because the studies do not usually aim at institutionalizing the interventions beyond the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This was also the case in the present study, which included no active strategies to facilitate the use of intervention material after the study. This may be the main reason for not obtaining proper information from the teachers 2 years after the intervention about the use of intervention material to evaluate the organizational maintenance. Other possible explanations for the poor response rate to the electronic questionnaire may have been busy time schedule, lack of interest or being annoyed with one more inquiry related to the study. The teachers may also have been reluctant to give socially undesirable answers about using the material.</p><p id="Par72">At individual level the effects discovered at Follow-up 1 somewhat diluted by Follow-up 2 but were still partly favorable for INT since no statistically significant between-group difference was discovered in the change of weekly number of days with at least 1&#8201;h of brisk leisure PA. This is encouraging especially considering the briefness of the intervention. On the other hand, the behavioral effects at Follow-up 1 were small and seen only in the self-reported data. As they further diminished by Follow-up 2 their clinical meaning can legitimately be challenged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par73">The main strength of the study was the comprehensive evaluation procedure, which is highly recommended for identifying the elements needed to maximize the intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and to translate the study results into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Yet, implementation evaluations are still rare in school-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. And even if shown implementable in one context, it is presumable that interventions need adaptations in order to be applicable in different circumstances.</p><p id="Par74">Another important strength of the study was the integration of behavior change theory into the intervention lesson. It helped in designing the intervention procedure and content and made the approach more systematic even though it was concurrently recognized that as shown in adults, behavioral theories do not necessarily improve the likelihood of intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Previous studies on predictors, mediators and explanatory factors of change indicate that the use of theories in adolescents&#8217; PA promotion is uncommon and the variety of theories applied is narrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. No studies utilizing Health Action Process Approach -model were found for comparison. It seems that more information is needed on application of behavioral theories in changing adolescents&#8217; PA.</p><p id="Par75">The study used large selection of indicators in the effectiveness evaluation including psychosocial and parental factors. This extended the evaluation perspective to factors, which may precede behavior change especially in brief interventions. It seems, for instance, that behavioral intention has an important role in contributing change in adolescents&#8217; PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In this sense the findings of the present study, which showed intervention effect on intention to do PA following week, were encouraging.</p><p id="Par76">The original sample covered all the secondary schools, eighth grades and the whole age-cohort in the city of Tampere. This improves the generalizability of the findings to this particular population especially regarding the questionnaire-based data, which at Follow-up 2 still included more than 70% of the original age-cohort. The generalizability is further strengthened by the high adoption and fidelity rate, both enhancing the transferability of the intervention into practice. It therefore seems that the somewhat disappointing findings on effectiveness did not originate from poor external validity of the intervention but from other factors pointed out in more detail in the limitations section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par77">The major methodological limitation of the study was the high dropout rate from the accelerometer and activity diary measurements at baseline as well as from both follow-ups. Despite the large overall sample size, the small sample sizes in these measures reduced the potential to detect between-group differences and deteriorated the generalizability of findings. On the other hand, relying solely on questionnaire data in interpreting the findings may not have been adequate due to well-known weaknesses of subjective PA measures and due to selectivity issues, which appeared also in this study, although minimally. There is no solid explanation for students&#8217; low interest in using the objective measures in the present study. One reason may be that wearing a hip-mounted accelerometer is considered uncomfortable or laborious. Another reason may be that a diversity of user-friendly monitoring alternatives, which are based on smart phones, are already available for those adolescents interested in their PA and SB.</p><p id="Par78">Use of non-validated questions in psychosocial and parental indicators made it difficult to evaluate the reliability of findings. It may be that the questions did not actually measure the factors they were designed for and / or were not sensitive enough to assess the changes between two time points. Reliable questions are needed in future studies to overcome these deficiencies.</p><p id="Par79">The intervention was brief in terms of generating behavior change. For better effectiveness, it is likely that additional supportive actions and longer intervention period would have been needed. However, this would have inevitably meant more workload for the teachers, which may have threatened the feasibility of the intervention. Presumably, integrating new elements into existing school-curricula is challenging in all countries. In the present study, knowing the challenges restricted the number of intervention lessons to three, which was considered the maximum for feasible implementation. Including supportive actions may have reduced feasibility and prevented from seeing the effects of the lessons alone. Thus, conducting school-based interventions in natural environments is constant balancing between effectiveness and feasibility.</p><p id="Par80">Assessing the quality of implementation on how the teachers implemented the lessons and what the students learned and experienced during the lessons would have provided more insight and explanations to the minor impacts of the intervention. Qualitative data e.g. via interviews or videotaping would also have shown how the elements of Health Action Process Approach, which was the theoretical background of the intervention, actualized in each lesson. Now the gap between high fidelity and modest effectiveness can only be speculated to relate mostly to the briefness of the intervention and partly to the subjective evaluation methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par81">A brief, multimodal intervention, which aimed at promoting PA and reducing SB during three HE lessons, was feasible and had small favorable effects at Follow-up 1 (4&#8201;weeks from baseline) on students&#8217; self-reported PA, intention to do PA following week and family norm in screen time. The effects on PA diluted but still partly existed at Follow-up 2 (7&#8201;months from baseline). It is likely that in order for the intervention to be more effective, HE lessons on PA should have been supported with other actions without nevertheless compromising feasibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec39"><p>

A written informed consent was obtained from all students to participate in the study. Consent for each part of the measurements (questionnaire; accelerometer and activity diary) was asked separately after fully informed in the cover letter about the ethical principles of voluntary participation, avoiding harm and privacy and data protection. In addition, one parent or guardian was to sign the student&#8217;s consent to indicate that they were aware of the study and child&#8217;s decision to participate in the measurements. Parents were also informed about the study via electronic communication system between school and home. In the parental part of the study, completing the questionnaire &#8211; after being fully informed about the procedure in the cover letter &#8211; indicated consent to participate in the study. Written informed consent was not obtained from the parents because the questionnaire did not include sensitive information or intervene physical integrity in a way that it would have been necessary.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Consent for publication</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Publisher&#8217;s Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Van Hecke L, Loyen A, Verloigne M, van der Ploeg HP, Lakerveld J, Johannes Brug J, De Bourdeaudhuij I, Ekelund U, Donnelly A, Hendriksen I, Deforche B, and on behalf of the DEDIPAC consortium.
