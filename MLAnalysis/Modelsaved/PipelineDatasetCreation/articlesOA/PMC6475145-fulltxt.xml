Similar rates of local control, survival and toxicity were observed in preoperative long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) (45&#8211;50.4 Gy in 25&#8211;28 fractions) and in short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) with 25 Gy over five fractions. Both regimens lower the local recurrence rates compared with that of surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. With the simplicity and lower cost of SCRT, a growing number of patients have been receiving SCRT as preoperative radiotherapy. However, the currently established SCRT (25 Gy over five fractions) followed immediately by surgery resulted in poor downstaging and sphincter preservation rate. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate is also markedly lower with SCRT than with LCRT (0.7%vs16%). Several studies recommended SCRT with delayed surgery for more than 4 weeks with expectation of improved pathological outcomes and fewer postoperative complications. While a number of clinical trials demonstrated a persistently better overall local control with SCRT than with LCRT, overall survival advantage has not been observed. Since survival is mainly depended on distant metastases, efforts should be made towards more effective pathological response and systemic treatment. Given the apparent advantages of SCRT, we aimed to establish a dose escalation of SCRT and sequential modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) as preoperative therapy for LARC with objectives of achieving an optimal balance of safety, cost effectiveness and clinical outcome, and to support further investigation of this regimen in a phase II/III setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this phase I study, three dose levels (6Gy&#215;5F, 7Gy&#215;5F, 8Gy&#215;5F to gross tumour volume, while keeping the rest of irradiated volume at 5Gy&#215;5) of SCRT followed by four cycles of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy will be tested by using the traditional 3+3&#8201;design.

According to statistics, the incidence of colorectal cancer had increased to 13% in 2015 compared with only 7% in 2002 in China. In the distribution of urban and rural areas, both morbidity and mortality were much higher in urban areas than in rural areas (69.93% vs 30.07% and 66.25% vs 33.75%, respectively).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#8211;3</xref> Surgical resection is the primary treatment method for resectable rectal cancer. Postoperative chemoradiotherapy improves local control but also lowers the tolerance rate and increases the incidence of postoperative complications. It is generally not recommended as a regular treatment strategy excepting patients who have high risk of recurrence after surgery. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision and adjuvant chemotherapy has been recommended as the preferred regimen for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) with more effectiveness in local control compared with postoperative radiotherapy.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The traditional long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) is 45&#8211;50.4 Gy in 25&#8211;28 daily fractions given with concurrent chemotherapy and delayed surgery (4&#8211;8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy). Also considered an alternative treatment option is preoperative short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) of 25 Gy in five daily fractions and followed by immediate surgery (1&#8201;week after SCRT). Similar rates of local control, survival and toxicity were observed in these two regimens.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Although SCRT reduce treatment interval and cut-down costs, its pathological complete response (pCR) rates are relatively low. Bujko <italic>et al</italic> reported that the pCR rates for SCRT and LCRT are 0.7% and 16%, respectively.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This difference may be partially related to the interval between preoperative radiotherapy and surgery. The pCR rates are higher in patients who have the longer interval.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the latest multicentre, randomised, non-blinded, phase III, non-inferiority clinical trial (Stockholm III), participants were randomly assigned to receive either 5&#215;5&#8201;Gy radiation dose followed by immediate surgery within 1&#8201;week (SCRT) or after 4&#8211;8 weeks (SCRT with delay) or 25&#215;2&#8201;Gy radiation dose followed by surgery after 4&#8211;8 weeks (LCRT with delay). All these regimens show similar oncological results. However, LCRT with delayed surgery prolongs the treatment interval substantially. Although radiation-induced toxicity was observed in SCRT with delayed surgery, postoperative complications were significantly reduced compared with SCRT followed by immediate surgery. Thus, SCRT with delayed surgery was recommended as a useful alternative to conventional SCRT with immediate surgery.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>The optimal pattern of dose fractionation of preoperative radiotherapy is still indicated for further exploration. J Widder <italic>et al</italic> reported that SCRT of 25 Gy administered in 2.5 Gy two times per day within 1&#8201;week for resectable rectal cancer generated a well-tolerated and simpler way to increase local control.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A prospective phase II study of SCRT of 2.9 Gy twice daily fractions to a total dose of 29 Gy also resulted in tolerable toxicity and favourable local control.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although both modifications of SCRT have resulted in acceptable toxicity and good local control, the overall survival remains statistically unchanged. Besides, accelerated irradiation (two times per day) increases daily workload. A prospective phase II study made a boost to the&#160;gross tumour volume (GTV) up to a total of 30 Gy in five fractions to investigate the feasibility and the impact on pCR rates. This trial achieved a pCR rate of 16% with acceptable toxicity.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This suggests the potential benefit of achieving better local control, even the overall survival by increasing the fractional dose to the GTV. Hence, we proposed the dose escalation trial of boosting GTV from 5&#215;6&#8201;Gy, 5&#215;7&#8201;Gy to 5&#215;8&#8201;Gy in SCRT for treating LARC. The theoretical basis lies in:</p><sec id="s1a"><title>To improve the tumour killing</title><p>Biological equivalent doses (BED) were used for comparison of various fractionations of radiotherapy. Taking into account the cell proliferation, BED can be calculated by: BED (Gy)=nd &#215; [1 + (d /&#945; / &#946;)] &#8722; &#947; /&#945;(T &#8722; Tk) n: number of fractions d: single fractional dose (Gy)</p><p>&#945; / &#946;: 10 Gy for rectal tumour, 3 Gy for normal tissues</p><p>&#947; / &#945;: a daily repair rate, set as 0.6 Gy for rectal tumour</p><p>T: overall treatment time</p><p>Tk: a proliferation delay, set as 7&#8201;day for rectal tumour cells.</p><p>If T&lt;Tk, the proliferation term is disregarded. For normal tissue, the proliferation term is also disregarded.</p><p>Taking tumour proliferation into account, the above BED formula arrives at a same BED of 37.5 Gy for both 1.8Gy&#160;&#215;25&#8201;and 5 Gy&#160;&#215;5, suggesting the same cell killing effect. However the lower pCR rate of SCRT implies a lesser effective tumour killing. This might be attributed to factors such as tumour reoxygenation and/or the presence/absence of chemotherapy. Without increasing the toxicity such as importantly sphincter dysfunction, the logical step toward higher therapeutic effect is then naturally to escalate the GTV dose and/or adding concurrent or sequential chemotherapy, leaving the rest of the irradiated volume at the established 5 Gy&#160;&#215;5. In this proposed trial, we will re-evaluate the published result of GTV boost of 6 Gy&#160;&#215;5&#8201;and further explore the toxicity and clinical efficacy of GTV dose escalation with sequential chemotherapy for SCRT.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>To induce tumour immune response</title><p>Several studies reported that radiotherapy can induce or regulate immune response, which can suppress tumour growth and generate inflammatory response. Radiotherapy can stimulate tumour therapeutic effects in both local-regional (within radiation field) and distant area of body.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Surace <italic>et al</italic> found that tumour cell death and transient activation of complement can be induced by radiotherapy to produce proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a. These proinflammatory anaphylatoxin are essential in tumour response to radiotherapy and tumour-specific immune stimulation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Lee <italic>et al</italic> found that immune responses could be inhibited by exhausting lymphocytes when received conventional radiotherapy (2 Gy daily fraction).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> On the contrary, high dose of radiation can enhance the immune response. Compared with 2 Gy daily fraction, ablative radiotherapy of a single dose of up to 20 Gy could result in more apoptosis, necrosis and senescent cells.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The underlining mechanism may involve cell surface molecular components, the release of soluble medium and signal transduction.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Results from Parker JJ&#8217;s study demonstrated that tumour cells undergo immunogenic deaths following high dose irradiation through the transformation in phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B family.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>It has been well established that preoperative chemotherapy plays a crucial role in eliminating potential micrometastases. A multicentre, phase III study (Polish II) enrolled 515 patients with fixed cT3 or cT4 rectal cancer to receive either SCRT followed by three cycles FOLFOX4 or LCRT. They found that patients received SCRT and FOLFOX4 had lower acute toxicity (p=0.006), higher R0 resection rates (77% vs 71%, p=0.07) and higher value of pCR rates (16% vs 12%, p=0.17).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Another phase II study enrolled 76 patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer to receive SCRT and four cycles mFOLFOX6 sequential chemotherapy. The pCR rate reached 25% and T-downstaging rate achieved up to 71%.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is worth noting that when adding preoperative chemotherapy, the prolonged interval between SCRT and surgery did not incur the complication by the radiation-fibrosis as commonly anticipated. Therefore, we hypothesise that SCRT with dose escalation to GTV followed by mFOLFOX chemotherapy as preoperative treatment method is safe and may further improve the treatment outcome for patients with LARC. The advantages of this therapy regimen include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Not only does escalation of fractional dose of SCRT increase the BED, it may lead to radiation-induced immune response and result in enhanced therapeutic control of both local recurrence and distal metastasis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The prolonged interval between preoperative radiotherapy and surgery, adding chemotherapy in between will allow the antitumour effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to fully take place and to achieve higher pCR rates and R0 resection rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implementation of standard mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy can be synergetic with radiotherapy to potentially eliminate micrometastases and control the primary tumours.</p></list-item></list>

Three extra patients will be added to receive the same dose (5&#215;6&#8201;Gy) if one patient exhibits the DLT. Of the total six patients treated at this dose level, the trial continues to the next dose level if only one out of six patients has experienced the DLT and stops at that dose level if at least two patients experience the DLT. When the escalation is stopped, additional three patients will be required to receive this dose level.

To further improve clinical outcomes, especially overall survival, we developed a novel preoperative SCRT regimen using GTV dose-escalation method (5&#215;6&#8201;Gy, 5&#215;7&#8201;Gy, 5&#215;8&#8201;Gy) followed by mFOLFOX6 neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with LARC. Belluco <italic>et al</italic> studied the long-term outcome of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for T3 rectal cancer, and concluded that for patients who had complete pathological responses (pCR), 5&#8201;year overall survival were significantly better.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Khwaja SS <italic>et al</italic> reported that SCRT followed by mFOLFOX6 as preoperative regimen for rectal cancer resulted in stable patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes 1&#8201;year after treatment.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These have motivated us to hypothesise that combining dosimetric and potentially biologic advantages of GTV dose escalation of SCRT and standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy could lead to improvement of pCR and long-term survival. Our study is aimed to lay the foundation for conducting future phase II/III clinical trials that may transform the preoperative treatment paradigm of SCRT from conventional 5&#215;5&#8201;Gy to 5&#215;6&#8201;Gy, 5&#215;7&#8201;Gy or 5&#215;8&#8201;Gy followed by mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in patients with LARC.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Ethics/dissemination/confidentiality</title><p>We will fully inform the eligible patients of the purpose and procedures of this study.
