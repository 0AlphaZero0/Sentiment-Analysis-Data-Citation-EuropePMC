As the most prevalent post-transcriptional modification on mammalian mRNA, the systemic and dynamic regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A is coordinated by multiple writer/eraser components. It is catalyzed mainly by a large RNA methyltransferase complex containing the methyltransferase-like (METTL) enzymes METTL3 and METTL14, Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, among which METTL3 is in charge of catalyzing m<sup>6</sup>A formation, METTL14 is involved in binding target mRNA, and WTAP is responsible for the localization into nuclear speckles of the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>; and removed by two demethylases: fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, several new members are identified belonging to METTL3&#8211;METTL14&#8211;WTAP complex; RBM15/RBM15B is reported to recruit this complex to certain mRNA and lncRNA XIST to promote m<sup>6</sup>A formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; KIAAI1429 and ZC3H3 are identified to regulate m<sup>6</sup>A methylation and play distinct functions in different cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, a group of m<sup>6</sup>A readers, such as YTH-domain family (YTHDF)1 and YTHDF2, could recognize m<sup>6</sup>A, and promote the translation and degradation of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNAs, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence indicates that m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulates multiple biological pathways, such as stem cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, and viral replication by mediating RNA decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

The induction of immune activation or tolerance by DC strictly depends on distinct subsets of DCs at different maturation stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Generally, immature DC (imDC) induces immune tolerance, mature DC (maDC) stimulates and activates immune response, while regulatory DC (DCreg) downregulates immune responses via suppression of T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The dysregulation of DC activation at distinct stages is well known to be closely linked to multiple inflammatory, autoimmune, and other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Although transcriptional networks governing DC development and function have been intensively investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, the epigenetic mechanisms, especially the role of mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in this process, remain to be fully understood. Therefore, identifying the role of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in controlling DC activation is critical for better understanding of immune response and will also have important clinical implications.</p><p id="Par5">It is well accepted that membrane co-stimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, and CD86, which could be upregulated by LPS stimulation, directly modulate the function and the stage of DC in their antigen presentation and T-cell activation. However, as multiple cells could respond to LPS stimulation, it is still unclear why only professional APCs, such as maDC, highly and continually express these co-stimulatory molecules after activation in response to innate stimuli. Molecular profiling of the imDC, maDC, and DCreg, the three kinds of DC at sequential but distinct maturation and differentiation stages, is a well-established cellular model for dynamically investigating the mechanisms of immune activation and regulation by DC at different subsets and stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, we utilized DC maturation and a differentiation model, including bone marrow-derived imDC, LPS-stimulated BMDC (maDC), and DCreg, to investigate the expression patterns and biological roles of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the maturation and function of DC. We demonstrate that mettl3 catalyzes m<sup>6</sup>A of CD40, CD80, and Tirap during DC maturation, and increases their translation efficiency to promote DC activation and function in promoting T-cell activation. Our study shed new light on the epigenetic regulation of innate immunity via m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated methylation of the related immune transcripts. In addition, our study provided a new mechanism why APC, once matured and activated, preferentially expresses a higher level of co-stimulatory molecules for efficiently initiating immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>m<sup>6</sup>A modification level is increased during DC maturation</title><p id="Par6">We first investigated the abundance of m<sup>6</sup>A and m<sup>6</sup>A writers/erasers in the three sequential but distinct DC subsets: bone marrow-derived imDC, LPS-stimulated BMDC (maDC), and DCreg. HPLC&#8211;MS/MS and dot-blot experiments revealed that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification level was significantly increased in maDC compared with that in imDC and DCreg (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In line with this dynamic change of m<sup>6</sup>A modification level, m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases Mettl3, Mettl14, and Wtap were also increased in maDC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We then profiled the transcriptome-wide mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in two replicates of imDC, maDC, and DCreg using m<sup>6</sup>A immunoprecipitation together with high-throughput sequencing (meRIP-seq). The correlations between two biological replicates were mostly over 0.85, which shows a strong correlation. High-confidence m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were enriched in transcripts of 6004, 7990, and 6624 genes in imDC, maDC, and DCreg, respectively. Further motif enrichment analysis revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A peaks identified above shared a common sequence element GGACU (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and the CDS segment harbored the largest fraction of peaks (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). A metagene profile revealed m<sup>6</sup>A peaks around the transcription start site and stop codon site in DC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In line with the increase of the m<sup>6</sup>A level in maDC, m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were enriched in more transcripts in maDC, which were clustered in the immune system and inflammation response as analyzed by GO enrichment (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Specifically, multiple newly appeared m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in maDC were enriched in transcripts of NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>) when compared with imDC, while enriched in transcripts of the TNF signaling pathway and NF-&#954;B signaling pathway when compared with DCreg (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). NF-&#954;B is the major downstream regulator of NLR, TNF signaling pathway and plays a pivotal role in the induction of co-stimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines during DC maturation; these data hint a potential role of m<sup>6</sup>A in immune response of maDC, especially in the NF-&#954;B activation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>m<sup>6</sup>A modification level increases in DC maturation. <bold>a</bold> m<sup>6</sup>A level of imDC, maDC, and DCreg mRNA detected by HPLC&#8211;MS/MS (up) and dot-blot assays (down). <bold>b</bold> Indicated proteins level in imDC, maDC, and DCreg. <bold>c</bold> Sequence motifs identified within m<sup>6</sup>A peaks of imDC, maDC, and DCreg of two biological replicates with the lowest <italic>p</italic>-value. <bold>d</bold> Distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks across the length of mRNA.
