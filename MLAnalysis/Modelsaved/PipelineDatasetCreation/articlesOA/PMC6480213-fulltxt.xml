The drug induces a dozen DNA methylation adducts, including <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG), which is the most toxic primary DNA lesion as it causes the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that trigger apoptosis. In p53 wild-type cells, TMZ activates p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46, which have opposing dual functions regulating survival and death, respectively. Since the use of TMZ in a therapeutic setting is limited because of its side effects, the question arises as to the existence of threshold doses that activate the death pathway and start apoptosis. To determine whether there is a threshold for the TMZ-induced DNA damage response and exploring the factors regulating the switch between p53 dependent survival and death, the glioblastoma lines LN-229 (deficient in MGMT) and LN-229MGMT (stably transfected with MGMT) were exposed to different doses of TMZ. p53 protein expression and phosphorylation levels of p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 were determined by Western blotting. Also, apoptosis, senescence and autophagy levels were checked after different doses of TMZ. The results show that pro-survival p-p53ser15 and pro-death p-p53ser46 were induced by <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG in a specific dose- and time-dependent manner. p-p53ser15 was an early response while p-p53ser46 was activated at later times following treatment. Unexpectedly, the dose-response curves for total p53, p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 were linear, without an obvious threshold. <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG induces apoptosis late after treatment as a linear function of TMZ dose. This was observed for both p53 proficient LN-229 and p53 lacking LN-308 cells. A linear dose-response after TMZ was also observed for senescence and autophagy as well as &#947;H2AX, an indicator of DSBs that are considered to be the downstream trigger of apoptosis, senescence and autophagy. LN-229MGMT cells were highly resistant to all measured endpoints because of repair of the critical primary lesion. Although LN-308 were less responsive than LN-229 to TMZ, they displayed the same TMZ-induced DSB level. The observed linear dose-responses are not compatible with the view that low DNA damage level evokes survival while high damage level activates death functions. The data bear important therapeutic implications as they indicate that even low doses of TMZ may elicit a cytotoxic response. However, since <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG triggers apoptosis, senescence and autophagy in the same dose range, it is likely that the accumulation of senescent cells in the population counteracts the killing effect of the anticancer drug.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>O6-alkylguanine</kwd><kwd>temozolomide</kwd><kwd>dose-response curves</kwd><kwd>time-response</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>glioma</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-20-01562"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In cancer therapy, chemotherapeutics with genotoxic activity are being used routinely. It is well known that these anticancer drugs induce DNA damage that triggers complex cellular DNA damage responses (DDR), which determine the fate of the cell, making the decision between survival and death [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Key players involved in this scenario are the DDR kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK, the checkpoint kinases CHK1, CHK2, the stress kinase HIPK2, and further downstream, the transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein p53. During activation, p53 becomes phosphorylated, liberates from its inhibitor MDM1, becomes stabilized and binds as a transcription factor in a dimeric form to a p53 consensus sequence in the promoter of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, p53 has other functions that are independent of transcriptional activation of genes [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is generally believed that low DNA damage levels activate pro-survival and high damage levels activate pro-death genes and cellular functions [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, p53 stimulates the transcription of p21, which results in cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair genes such as DDB2, which enhances the repair capacity, leading to removal of toxic DNA lesions from DNA [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At high dose levels p53 turns into a &#8220;killer&#8221; through activation of pro-death functions such as the proapoptotic genes Bax, Bak and Fas [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although this concept derived mostly from work with ionizing radiation is reasonable, there is not much experimental proof of it for chemical genotoxins, notably anticancer drugs. The concept implicates that there are threshold doses for cell death, i.e., low doses do not elicit activation of apoptosis pathways while high doses do.</p><p>A proof of this concept requires maximum understanding of the cell death pathways activated by a given genotoxicant. A well-studied drug in this respect is temozolomide (TMZ), which is used in first-line therapy for high-grade gliomas, including astrocytoma (WHO <sup>0</sup>3) and glioblastoma multiforme (glioma WHO <sup>0</sup>4) [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main target of TMZ is the nuclear DNA in which, similar to other S<sub>N</sub>1 alkylating agents, at least 12 nucleophilic sites can become methylated [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The major methylation products are <italic>N</italic>-methylpurines such as <italic>N7</italic>-methylguanine, <italic>N3</italic>-methylguanine and <italic>N3</italic>-methyladenine, while <italic>O</italic>-methylpurines are less frequent. Thus, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG) accounts for maximally 7% of the total methylations [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although produced in minor amounts, the damage is highly genotoxic and cytotoxic if not repaired by the suicide enzyme <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. If cells are repair competent, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG is quickly removed from DNA. Under this condition, cells become highly resistant to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-alkylating agents and higher doses of a methylating agent are required to achieve a killing effect, which results from saturation of base excision repair and repair by ALKB homologous proteins (ALKBH) [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, in the high dose setting, other lesions than <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG, which are less toxic, give rise to cell death. The doses of TMZ in a therapeutic setting are very likely too low to achieve cell death resulting from non-repaired N-alkylations. Therefore, with an achievable serum concentration of up to 50 &#181;M TMZ, the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG response plays a key role in determining tumor cell death.</p><p>The mechanisms of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG triggered genotoxic responses have been described previously [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In brief, <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG is a mutagenic mispairing lesion that results in mismatches with thymine that are subject to mismatch repair (MMR). Reinsertion of thymine during MMR causes a futile MMR cycle with gapped DNA that finally gives rise to DNA replication blockage and the formation of replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which occurs in the post-treatment cell cycle [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These events provoke the activation of ATR und ATM, and downstream CHK1 and CHK2, respectively, as well as p53 phosphorylation [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Upon genotoxic stress, p53 can be phosphorylated at different sites. p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 (p53ser15) and serine 20 (p53ser20) results from ATM/ATR-CHK2/CHK1 activation, while phosphorylation at serine 46 (p53ser46) results from activation of the kinase HIPK2 (for review, see [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). We have recently shown that this also occurs in glioblastoma cells upon treatment with TMZ. We also showed that p53ser46 exerts a pro-apoptotic function as downregulation of HIPK2, the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation, attenuated significantly the level of apoptosis in TMZ-treated LN-229 glioblastoma cells [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In light of the hypothesis outlined above, according to which low doses elicit pro-survival and high doses pro-death functions, we wondered whether the dose-response of key players of DDR shows the hypothesized threshold. Here, we present data showing the non-existence of threshold doses for &#947;H2AX, p53ser15, p53ser46, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence in the p53 expressing LN-229 glioblastoma cell system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.

Dose Response and Time Dependence of p53, p-p53Ser15 and p-53Ser46 in Temozolomide Treated Glioblastoma Cells</title><p>To determine the dose-response of total p53, the pro-survival form p-p53Ser15 and the pro-death form p-53Ser46, Western blot experiments were performed using the line LN-229. This glioblastoma line bears p53 that harbours a point mutation, which however retains the trans-activating activity of p53 [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the line can be considered functionally p53 wild-type. LN-229 is MGMT deficient [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We further used the isogenic line LN-229MGMT, which was stably transfected with human MGMT cDNA and thus expresses MGMT [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], in order to find out whether the responses observed are triggered by the specific TMZ-induced DNA damage <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG. The p53 expression levels were determined 24 and 72 h after the addition of TMZ to the medium of exponentially growing cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, the total p53 and p-p53ser15 protein levels went up with increasing TMZ doses 24 h after treatment while the p-p53ser46 protein level remained nearly unaffected. With the highest dose of TMZ in this experimental series (125 &#956;M) the total p53 level was 3.7 times above the control group while the expression level of p-p53ser15 reached 10.9 times above the control level where p-p53Ser15 was only marginally detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>A for a representative blot and for quantification <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The finding that, in contrast to p-53Ser15, p-p53ser46 was not induced 24 h after treatment indicates that there is a sequential activation of pro-survival and pro-death factors in glioblastoma cells exposed to TMZ. In LN-229MGMT, we did not observe any significant increase in p53, p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, right panel), demonstrating that the effects observed were triggered by the <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG lesion, which is specifically repaired by MGMT.</p><p>After 72 h TMZ treatment, LN-229 cells displayed increasing signals of p53 and p-p53ser46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), p-p53ser15 also increased above the control, although this was moderate compared to p53 and p-p53ser46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>B and for quantification <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). With the highest dose tested, total p53 accumulated 13.1 times over the control, p-p53ser46 reached 8.9 times, and p-p53ser15 was 5.2 times the control level. In LN-229MGMT cells, p-53Ser46 was not enhanced and p-p53ser15 was only slightly activated, very likely due to residual amounts of non-repaired <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel). Overall, the data revealed that p-p53Ser15 is an early response and p-53Ser46 a late response triggered by the TMZ-induced lesion <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.2. Dose Response and Time-Course of Apoptosis Induction</title><p>To compare the sequence of anti- and pro-apoptotic p53 with cell death induction, we measured apoptosis and necrosis in LN-229 and LN-229MGMT after TMZ treatment in a dose-range up to 125 &#181;M by AV/PI staining and flow cytometry. Although 72 h after exposure to TMZ, the p-p53ser46 level was significantly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), the apoptosis level stayed low and was not significantly above the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Apoptosis in LN-229 started to increase 96 h after TMZ exposure, and reached its maximum at 120 and 144 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,E,F). This confirms previous observation that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG triggered apoptosis is a late response. Of note, the cells were kept in an exponentially growing state throughout the whole examination period. Apoptosis in LN-229 reached a saturation level at &gt;50 &#181;M, presumably because of other endpoints that were concomitantly induced such as senescence and autophagy [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Necrosis (defined as AV+PI+) was only marginally induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), supporting our previous finding that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG is a powerful apoptotic lesion. In LN-229MGMT cells, neither apoptosis nor necrosis was induced with all doses and time points assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,D), demonstrating that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG was responsible for the cytotoxic effects observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.3. Is There a Threshold in p53, p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 Induction?</title><p>Next, we addressed the question of whether there is a threshold in the dose-response in LN-229 cells. For this experimental series, we applied TMZ in a low dose range of up to 20 &#181;M. Cells were harvested from exponentially grown cultures 24 h and 72 h after the onset of treatment and total cell extracts were subjected by Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, in the low dose range and measured 24 h after TMZ exposure, p-p53ser15 was the most sensitive indicator for DNA damage, which increased with increasing dose. After 72 h exposure, the p-p53ser46 level was also increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). As expected on the basis of previous results, in LN-229MGMT all effects were vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B left panels). The results indicate that after low dose TMZ treatment, the pro-survival factor p-p53ser15 is phosphorylated first (and quite early) compared to the pro-death factor p-p53ser46, which gets activated at a later stage.</p><p>Originally, we suspected that the dose-response for the pro-apoptotic p-p53ser46 would show a threshold. This, however, was not the case. As revealed by the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D, there is a linear increase in the amount of p53, p-p53Ser15 and p-p53Ser46. The total p53 level already reached saturation with a dose of 5 &#181;M. The increase of p-p53ser15 (24 h) and p-p53ser46 (72 h) was linear over the whole dose range tested.</p><p>It is also interesting that after 72 h, the p-p53Ser15 dropped to the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), indicating this is an early and transient response compared to p-53Ser46, which is a late (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f003">Figure 3</xref>D, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and presumably also long-lasting response.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.4. Is There a Threshold in Apoptosis Induction?</title><p>Having shown that p-p53Ser46 increases linearly with dose, we measured the dose-response of apoptosis (and necrosis) in LN-229 cells in the same low dose range (0&#8211;20 &#181;M TMZ). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, there is a linear increase (best fit) in the level of apoptosis without any obvious threshold dose. The dose that displayed a significant increase above the control level was 2.5 &#181;M. Again, necrosis was not significantly induced (not shown) and MGMT expressing cells were effect-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>To explore the possibility that p53 is responsible for the lack of a no-effect threshold, another glioma cell line, LN-308, was introduced in this step of analysis. LN-308 is completely lacking p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f004">Figure 4</xref>C) due to gene deletion [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is also MGMT deficient (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01562">Supplementary Materials, Figure S3</xref>). Nevertheless, in order to avoid any effects caused by residual MGMT not detectable by the assays, we routinely pre-treated the cells with <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>BG. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f004">Figure 4</xref>D revealed that LN-308 cells are more resistant than LN-229 to TMZ-induced apoptosis. The best fit of the dose-response curve was linear and did not reveal a threshold.</p><p>To verify the data, colony formation assays were employed, which are considered to be highly sensitive for measuring reproductive cell death. After exposing LN-229, LN-229MGMT and LN-308 cells plated on dishes to TMZ and allowing them to grow for about two weeks, the formed colonies were counted. The survival fraction declined dose-dependently in LN-229 and LN-308. For LN-229 cells, the survival curves did not show a shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f005">Figure 5</xref>), supporting the view that there is no threshold for the induction of cell death in this line. In the dose range used, LN-229MGMT cells were strongly protected against TMZ-induced cell death, showing only a slight decline in their colony-forming ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For LN-308 cells, the survival curve displayed only a marginal shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01562">Supplementary Material, Figure S4</xref>). Overall, the data confirmed the results obtained in the apoptosis assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.5. Dose-Response of TMZ-Induced Senescence and Autophagy</title><p>In a previous work, we showed that TMZ induces not only apoptosis, but also senescence and autophagy in LN-229 cells [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, we wondered whether senescence and autophagy are induced in the same dose range as apoptosis and whether there is a threshold in the dose-response curves. For comparison, senescence and autophagy were also determined in p53 deficient LN-308 cells. Senescence induced by TMZ increased as a linear function of dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). Similar to apoptosis, MGMT protected against TMZ-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f006">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating the primary trigger is <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG. In LN-308 cells, the slope of the senescence curve was lower than in LN-229 cells, and therefore, comparatively high doses of TMZ have to be used to significantly induce senescence. Extrapolation of the dose-response curves indicated the non-existence of a threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f006">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><p>The autophagy response was similar to senescence. TMZ induced more autophagy in LN-229 than in LN-308 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,C), while LN-229MGMT showed no response at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). Taken together, the results show that p53 proficient LN-229 cells are more sensitive than p53 deficient LN-308 cells as to TMZ-induced apoptosis, senescence and autophagy. No threshold was observed for these endpoints in LN-229 and LN-308 cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-ijms-20-01562"><title>2.6. Dose-Response of TMZ-Induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks</title><p>The endpoints we have assessed are triggered by the primary lesion <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG, whose processing gives rise to DSBs that are considered to be the ultimate trigger of p53 stabilization and cell death [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, different cell death responses could be the result of differences in DSB formation. Thus, the more sensitive p53 proficient LN-229 cells might exhibit better <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG processing resulting in DSBs than LN-308 cells upon treatment with TMZ. To explore this hypothesis, the &#947;H2AX foci assay was used, which is an accepted indicator of DSBs [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The cells (LN-229, LN-229MGMT and LN-308) were treated with 0-20 &#956;M TMZ and, 72 h later, the &#947;H2AX foci were determined and quantified. The &#947;H2AX foci in LN-229 showed a liner increase with dose of TMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) and no threshold was obvious. In LN-229MGMT cells, DSBs were not induced at significant level in the whole dose range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). In LN-308, the DSB frequency was very similar to LN-229. The increase was linear and, again, no threshold could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f008">Figure 8</xref>C). The similar frequencies of DSBs in LN-229 and LN-308 indicate that sensitivity differences between the cell lines are the result of downstream events triggered by DSBs, presumably through p53.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-ijms-20-01562"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The DNA methylating agent temozolomide is a first-line drug in the treatment of high-grade malignant glioma. It is effective in inducing cell death if the tumor lacks MGMT or expresses it at low level, i.e., &lt; 30 fmol/mg protein [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These tumors are defined as &#8220;methylated&#8221; because of MGMT promoter CpG methylation, which correlates with silencing of the gene [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and deficient or low MGMT protein expression and enzyme activity [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Since <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG induced by TMZ (and other methylating anticancer drugs) is a toxic DNA damage, it is understandable that MGMT deficiency (determined, e.g., by promoter methylation) leads to responsiveness of the tumor [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite these well-known relationships, the prognosis of glioblastoma, which account for up to 70% of high-grade malignant glioma, is bleak as the median length of survival is only 14.6 months (12.6 and 23.4 months in the MGMT-unmethylated and MGMT-methylated subgroups, respectively) [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although recent phase III clinical trials showed that the median overall survival for adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma can reach up to 20 months in the control cohorts, indicating a trending increase in median overall survival, the prognosis is still bad with 5-year overall survival rates of less than 10% (for references see [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Treatment with TMZ occurs daily along different schedules [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The serum concentration of TMZ has been determined to be in the range of up to 30 &#181;M, with a half-life of about 2 h [<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a therapeutic setting with a single oral dose of 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, the peak plasma concentration was, on average, 28.4 &#181;M (5.5 &#181;g/mL) and the brain interstitium concentration 1.5 &#181;M (0.3 &#181;g/mL) [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In another study TMZ was determined following oral 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> TMZ, with a plasma peak level of 72 &#181;M and a cerebrospinal fluid level of 9.9 &#181;M [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the TMZ concentration at the target organ seems to be rather low and it is reasonable to suppose, notably in view of the high recurrence rate, that the TMZ level is not high enough in order to exert a killing effect on residual (post-operative) glioblastoma cells. This notion is fueled by the supposition that at low dose levels cell death is not induced, which goes back to the general paradigm that low DNA damage levels induce survival functions, whereas high DNA damage levels activate cellular death pathways [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This view implies that DNA damage thresholds do exist that regulate the balance between life and death. This work was aimed at proving or disproving this widely accepted hypothesis.</p><p>First, we have shown that in LN-229 and LN-308 glioblastoma cells, which are functionally wild-type and mutant for p53, respectively [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the amount of DSB (&#947;H2AX foci) increases as a linear function of dose. TMZ does not need metabolic activation. It spontaneously decomposes, yielding carbenium ions that methylate DNA dose-dependently. From this it is reasonable to conclude that <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG is induced as a linear function of dose. The linear dose-response for DSBs indicates that the rate of conversion of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG into DSB is independent on dose, and there is no defense at low dose levels that prevents the formation of DSBs in LN-229 and LN-308 cells. In this model system, we determined about 60 DSBs with a dose of 20 &#181;M TMZ. The amount of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG induced under these conditions is not known.</p><p>We further show in Western blot experiments that p53, p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 increase up to a saturation level as a linear function of dose. This was a surprising finding since it collides with the view that low DNA damage triggers survival and high DNA damage triggers death functions. Upon TMZ treatment, p-p53ser15 results from ATR (ATM) and downstream CHK1 (CHK) activation [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which is likely the result of blocked replication forks and DSBs formed on collapsed forks. The linear dose-response suggests that even low <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG and DSB levels induced by TMZ are able to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases that phosphorylate 53 at serine 15. Unexpectedly, p-p53ser46 was also generated at low dose levels without a detectable threshold. p-p53ser46 results from activation of the stress kinase HIPK2 [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The pathway of HIPK2 activation in general [<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and following TMZ in glioblastoma cells, including LN-229, has been described [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The available data suggest that primarily ATR and following secondary activation, also ATM, phosphorylate SIAH1, the inhibitor of HIPK2 [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This leads to degradation of SIAH1 and liberation and stabilization of HIPK2, which in turn phosphorylates p53 at serine 46 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f009">Figure 9</xref>). The linearity of p-p53ser46 accumulation indicates that ATR (ATM) is able to phosphorylate SIAH1 and thus liberate HIPK2 even at very low TMZ doses.</p><p>We have shown that p-p53ser15 and p-p53ser46 become activated following TMZ treatment in a sequential order, with early activation of p-p53ser15 and late activation of p-p53ser46. p-p53ser15 becomes detectable 24 h after treatment and declines a day later, indicating that this is a transient response. p-p53ser46 was detected 3 days after treatment and was still detectable when cells started to undergo apoptosis. This is in line with the pro-apoptotic role of this phosphorylated form of p53.</p><p>In accordance with this is the finding that apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and reproductive death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f005">Figure 5</xref>) of LN-229 cells do not display a clear no-effect threshold. Cell death appears to be a linear function of the dose of TMZ. It is known that p-p53ser46 binds to the promoter of pro-apoptotic genes, including the death receptor FAS (alias CD95/APO1), and thus stimulates its transcription [<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This was recently shown to occur upon TMZ in LN-229 cells [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Obviously, there is no threshold for p-p53ser46 transactivation activity in this cell system.</p><p>Similar to apoptosis, DNA damage-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f006">Figure 6</xref>) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01562-f007">Figure 7</xref>) were induced as a linear function of the dose of TMZ. In MGMT expressing cells, TMZ was ineffective in inducing these effects (doses up to 50 &#181;M) suggesting that they were triggered by <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG. Previously, we have shown that senescence and autophagy are regulated by the same upstream damage response pathway that regulates apoptosis [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The linearity for these endpoints indicates that pro- and anti-death functions are induced simultaneously at each dose level. From the therapeutic point of view, the finding points to the need of inhibiting the pro-survival functions senescence and autophagy in a way that cells preferentially enter the death pathway.</p><p>Finally, we observed that the p53 deficient glioblastoma cell line, LN-308 is more resistant to the induction of apoptosis by TMZ. This finding is compatible with our previous observations according to which MGMT deficient p53wt glioma cells are more sensitive to the cytotoxic (apoptotic) effect of TMZ than MGMT deficient p53 mutated cells that lack the transactivation activity of p53 [<xref rid="B47-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The p-53 independent apoptotic pathway of glioblastoma cells is bound on the endogenous mitochondrial pathway, which seems to be more refractory than the p53 regulated death receptor pathway [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of note, p53 also stimulates the mitochondrial cell death route by supporting the translocation of BAX to the outer mitochondrial membrane and sequestering Bcl-2, leading to cytochrome C release and apoptosome formation [<xref rid="B48-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that p53-driven apoptosis rests on both p-p53ser46 promoter activation and exacerbation of mitochondrial damage through cytoplasmatic p53.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-ijms-20-01562"><title>4. Conclusions and Implications</title><p>Although we are aware that this study needs extension to other cell lines and tumor models, LN-229 provides an example where the paradigm that low doses activate survival and high doses death functions does not apply. Regarding DNA repair, it is known that p-p53ser15 triggers the activation of DNA repair genes, which causes protection against genotoxins [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to our experience with different cell types and genotoxins, the most robust p53-stimulated repair genes encode DDB2 and XPC as well as the translesion polymerase Pol eta (Pol H) [<xref rid="B50-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, these genotoxic stress-inducible repair proteins are not involved in the repair of TMZ-induced DNA methylation damage. A reasonable candidate for causing a threshold is MGMT. Thus, from work that included bacteria to humans, it became clear that MGMT mediated DNA repair gives rise to a mutagenic and toxic threshold [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, a search for an adaptive response in brain cancer cells revealed that MGMT is not inducible by TMZ, which is clearly different from rodent cells in which MGMT was shown to be upregulated following genotoxic stress [<xref rid="B53-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] in a p53 dependent manner [<xref rid="B54-ijms-20-01562" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, lack of induction of repair of <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG in glioma cells is surely a contributing factor for the non-existence of a threshold. If ATR/ATM becomes activated even with low damage levels and also triggers senescence, autophagy and apoptosis, the important question arises as to the mechanism that makes the switch between the pathways. This is clearly an attractive area of future research.</p><p>In view of the limited amount of cell lines used in this study, it is too early for clinical implications. Nevertheless, the data may be taken to indicate that even a low dose of TMZ is able to elicit a cytotoxic response in p53 wild-type and MGMT lacking tumors. Of note, a prerequisite for <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG induced cytotoxicity is cell proliferation. If a fraction of tumor cells is released in a senescent state, it will no longer be subjected to <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>MeG triggered apoptosis. This might especially be the case if cells are treated repetitively. Therefore, on the basis of the results presented here, the metronomic dose protocol (drug application at low and frequent doses) bears beneficial effects by exacerbating cytotoxicity, but also adverse effects since the fraction of non-proliferating (senescent) cells might be increasing with each consecutive treatment dose. It should also be considered that TMZ is usually given concomitantly with ionizing radiation (usually 2 Gy per treatment), which may additionally ameliorate the fraction of non-proliferating tumor cells. If the arrest state is transient, it is conceivable that the fraction of senescent cells at the end of therapy contributes to recurrence, which is usually the unfortunate case for glioblastomas. Again, we are aware of the limitations of the study, which rests on comparison of only three cell lines (LN-229, LN-220MGMT and LN-308). It provides, however, an example of lack of threshold doses in cell death responses (&#947;H2AX, p53ser15 and p53ser46, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence) if MGMT is lacking. The data warrant further studies with a larger set of well-defined cell lines, stem cells and tumors in situ prior to and after therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijms-20-01562"><title>5.
