<italic>Tityus serrulatus</italic> venom (<italic>Ts</italic> venom) is a
complex mixture of several compounds with biotechnological and therapeutical
potentials, which highlights the importance of the identification and
characterization of these components. Although a considerable number of
studies have been dedicated to the characterization of this complex
cocktail, there is still a limitation of knowledge concerning its venom
composition. Most of <italic>Ts</italic> venom studies aim to isolate and
characterize their neurotoxins, which are small, basic proteins and are
eluted with high buffer concentrations on cation exchange chromatography.
The first and largest fraction from carboxymethyl cellulose-52 (CMC-52)
chromatography of <italic>Ts</italic> venom, named fraction I (Fr I), is a
mixture of proteins of high and low molecular masses, which do not interact
with the cation exchange resin, being therefore a probable source of
components still unknown of this venom. Thus, the present study aimed to
perform the proteome study of Fraction I from <italic>Ts</italic> venom, by
high resolution mass spectrometry, and its biochemical characterization, by
the determination of several enzymatic activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Fraction I was obtained by a cation exchange chromatography using 50 mg of
crude venom. This fraction was subjected to a biochemical characterization,
including determination of L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipase,
hyaluronidase, proteases activities and inhibition of angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) activity. Fraction I was submitted to reduction, alkylation and
digestion processes, and the tryptic digested peptides obtained were
analyzed in a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data analysis was
performed by PEAKS 8.5 software against NCBI database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fraction I exhibits proteolytic activity and it was able to inhibit ACE
activity. Its proteome analysis identified 8 different classes of venom
components, among them: neurotoxins (48%), metalloproteinases (21%),
hypotensive peptides (11%), cysteine-rich venom protein (9%), antimicrobial
peptides (AMP), phospholipases and other enzymes (chymotrypsin and
lysozymes) (3%) and phosphodiesterases (2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The combination of a proteomic and biochemical characterization strategies
leads us to identify new components in the <italic>T. serrulatus</italic>
scorpion venom. The proteome of venom&#180;s fraction can provide valuable
direction in the obtainment of components in their native forms in order to
perform a preliminary characterization and, consequently, to promote
advances in biological discoveries in toxinology.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Tityus serrulatus</kwd><kwd>scorpion venom</kwd><kwd>enzymes</kwd><kwd>proteases</kwd><kwd>ACE inhibitors</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Scorpion venoms are a rich source of components with diverse biological activities
and high specificity for their targets [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
Their venoms are usually composed of insoluble mucus, oligopeptides,
mucopolysaccharides, nucleotides, low molecular weight molecules (serotonin or
histamine), protease inhibitors, histamine releasers, amino acids and other organic
compounds, enzymes and many neurotoxins [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among this impressive
cocktail, neurotoxins are the main components studied, mostly because of their
interaction with Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channels and their importance in
the scorpion envenoming [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition,
several enzymes have been characterized in scorpion venoms, including phospholipase
A, hyaluronidase, sphingomyelinase D, lysozyme, metalloproteases and serine
proteases. Other enzymes have been related with the post-translational processing of
toxin precursors and with the facilitation of venom permeation into tissues [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The study of venom components is highly useful for elucidating the biochemical
process of envenoming, but also for identifying molecules that can be used as
molecular tools and/or drugs with therapeutic action. So far, the number of distinct
toxins present in scorpion venoms has been estimated at about 100.000, and only less
than 1% has been characterized [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The initial fractionation of <italic>Tityus serrulatus (Ts)</italic> venom on a
carboxymethyl cellulose-52 (CMC-52) column, described by Arantes et al. [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and modified by Cerni et al. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], uses ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8,
and allows separate <italic>Ts</italic> venom components in 18 fractions, according
to their charge. The positively charged proteins at this pH (such as neurotoxins)
interact with the cation exchange resin and the other proteins are eluted in the
first fractions of the chromatography. Fraction I (Fr I) is the first and largest
peak eluted on CMC-52 chromatography and was never in depth studied before. It is
composed by a mixture of proteins of high and low molecular masses, being a probable
source of components still unknown of <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> venom and,
therefore, was chosen to be analyzed in this study [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Proteomic techniques have been employed to explore the diversity of toxins present in
scorpion venom. Protein separation techniques, such as high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) hyphened with soft ionization mass spectrometers, allowed a
more detailed proteomic analysis of animal venoms [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Those techniques provide a broad range of structural
information such as the amino acid sequence for peptides, accurate determination of
molecular mass, determination of disulfide bonds, and characterization of
post-translational modifications [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
Furthermore coupled techniques such as chromatography and electrospray ionization
(ESI) permit mass spectrometry to become the method of choice for the analysis of
complex mixtures such as animal venoms [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>With the advent of omics techniques, studies of animal venoms have become
increasingly faster and more comprehensive, often able to provide a holistic view of
all components in the venom specially when combined to Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) transcriptomics [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, due
the high complexity of scorpion venoms, a proteome fraction-directed or fraction
subproteomes combined to shotgun proteomics can be useful in the identification of
new molecules and to guide the obtainment of components in their native forms in
order to perform a preliminary characterization. Considering this panorama, the
present study carried out a high resolution proteome of Fraction I, the first
fraction of the cation exchange chromatography from <italic>Tityus
serrulatus</italic> venom, and its biochemical characterization, aiming the
exploration and bioprospection of undiscovered components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Venom Fractionation</title><p>
<italic>Ts</italic> venom was obtained from the vivarium of the Faculdade de
Medicina de Ribeir&#227;o Preto da Universidade de S&#227;o Paulo (School of Medicine of
Ribeir&#227;o Preto, University of S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil), using electrical stimulation
of 12 mV. The freeze-dried venom was diluted in ultra pure water
(MilliQ<sup>&#174;</sup>) and desiccated for 6 h. After this procedure, the
sample (50 mg) was resuspended in 500 &#956;L of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 &#176;C (Centrifuge 5415 R).
Ammonium bicarbonate buffer (500 &#956;L) was added to the precipitate, the mixture
was homogenized and centrifuged. This process was repeated twice. The
supernatants from the 4 extractions (final volume of 2.0 mL) were pooled, held
at 4 &#176;C for 12 hours, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. At the end
of this process, the soluble venom (without mucus) was submitted to a fast
protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), using a CMC-52 microgranular column 1.6 x
100 cm (Whatman, UK), equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH
7.8), as described by Cerni et al. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
The sample (2 mL) was initially eluted with buffer A, followed by a linear
concentration gradient (0 to 100%) of buffer B (0.6 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH
7.8), under a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and temperature of 25 &#176;C. Absorbance was
automatically recorded at 280 nm. All the fractions obtained were lyophilized
and stored at &#8722;20&#9702;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Eletrophoresis</title><p>The fractions obtained from the venom chromatography were analyzed by tricine
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE)
following the method used for ultra-low mass proteins [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was used a 16.5% separating gel, overlaid by a 5%
stacking gel. The gels were stained with PlusOne Coomassie Blue
PhastGel<sup>&#174;</sup> R-350 (GE Healthcare, UK) and destained with 10% acetic
acid (v/v). The ultra-low range molecular weight marker (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA)
was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical characterization</title></sec><sec><title>Phospholipase activity</title><p>Phospholipase activity was assessed in Petri dishes [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with the following modifications: agarose was replaced
by agar and erythrocytes were not used. Briefly, a gel containing 0.01 M
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, egg yolk diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH
7.2 in the ratio 1:3 (v/v), 1% bacteriological agar, and 0.005% sodium azide was
prepared in Petri dishes. Then, 40 &#181;L of the fraction was applied into 5-mm
diameter holes made in the gel, followed by incubation at 37 &#176;C overnight. The
formation of translucent halos around the holes in the gel indicated
phospholipase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteolytic activity on azocasein</title><p>The azocaseinolytic activity was determined by colorimetric assay [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], in which 85 &#956;L of an azocasein
solution (5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) were incubated with 10 &#956;L of venom
fraction (Fraction I: 47 &#956;g/&#956;L) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 5 &#956;L of solution of
100 mM protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, PMSF and
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA), for 90 minutes at 37 &#176;C. Next, 200 &#956;L
of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (v/v) was added to the samples followed by
centrifugation at 1000 x<italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes. Then, 150 &#956;L of 0.5 M
NaOH were added to the supernatants and read at 450 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>L-amino acid (LAAO) activity</title><p>LAAO activity was detected spectrophotometrically according to Kishimoto and
Takahashi [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Each venom fraction was
incubated with 2 mM <italic>o</italic>-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich Co.,
USA), 1 U/mL horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), 5 mM L-leucine
(Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), and 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. Incubation was
performed at 37 &#176; C for 1 hour and then the reaction was quenched with 2 M
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The absorbance was determined on a microplate
reader at wavelength of 492 nm, with reference to absorbance at 630 nm. To
determine the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> released, a calibration curve
was made with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0 - 10 mM). According to Kishimoto and
Takahashi [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], 1 unit of LAAO activity
is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 &#956;mol of
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> per minute under the specified conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity</title><p>ACE inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated following the
procedures described by <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2005</xref>)
and modified by <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pinheiro-J&#250;nior (2018</xref>) to
miniaturize the methodology to 2 mL micro tubes [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The mixture of 30 &#181;L
of 5 mM Hippuryl-His-Leu (HHL, Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) in 100 mM borate buffer,
pH 8.3 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), containing 300 mM NaCl, was incubated for 5
min, at 37 &#186;C, with 20 &#181;L of each venom fraction solution. As negative control
of inhibition (100% ACE activity), 20 &#181;L of the same buffer was used. ACE (20 &#181;L
of 100 mU/mL solution; Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) was later added to the mixture,
which was then incubated for 2 h, at 37 &#186;C. The reaction was stopped with
addition of 20 &#181;L of HCl 2 N. The hippuric acid (HA), formed during ACE
catalysis, was quantified by the incubation with 120 &#181;L of quinoline
(Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) and 40 &#181;L of benzenesulfonyl chloride (BSC,
SigmaAldrich Co., USA) for 30 min, at 30 &#186;C. The chromogen formed by
HA-quinoline-BSC was diluted with 250 &#181;L of ethanol, followed by another
incubation, under the same conditions. Then, 290 &#181;L of the mixture was
transferred to a 96-well plate and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a
microplate absorbance reader (Sunrise Basic TECAN, Austria). The percentage of
ACE inhibitory activity was calculated by the multiplication by 100 of the
difference from the absorbance in the reaction without and with inhibitor
divided by the difference of absorbance in the reaction without inhibitor and
negative control. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyaluronidase activity</title><p>Hyaluronidase activity was quantitatively determined by the turbidimetric assay
as described by Pukrittayakamee et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], adapted to a 96-well microplate and under conditions described
by Amorim et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For this assay it
was used acetate buffer (200 mM sodium acetate and 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0), 10 &#956;g
hyaluronan (0.5 mg/mL in water) and the fraction I to the final volume of 200
&#956;L. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 &#176;C, and the reaction was stopped
with the addition of 100 &#956;L of 5% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 4%
NaOH (w/v). Then, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 400 nm in a
microplate reader (Sunrise Basic, Tecan, Switzerland). Hyaluronidase activity
was expressed as the percentage of hydrolyzed hyaluronan, considering the
absorbance of the tube in which no hyaluronan was added as 100% of
hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition/potentiation of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity</title><p>A possible inhibitor or enhancer of trypsin/chymotrypsin activity present in
venom fraction was tested. The reaction mixture was prepared as described by the
supplier (PBS, enzyme, venom and chromogenic substrate specific for each
enzyme). The assay was performed with bovine trypsin and &#945;-chymotrypsin (1 mg/50
mL, 0.001 M HCl; Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), trypsin and &#945;-chymotrypsin substrates
(10 mg/mL N-<italic>p</italic>-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-4-nitroanilide acetate salt and
0.2 mg/mL N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide,
respectively; Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4,
and Fraction I at two concentrations (1.90 mg/mL and 5.65 mg/mL). The substrate
solution was prepared at the 1 mg/20 mL assay concentration in PBS. Volumes of 5
&#956;L of bovine trypsin and &#945;-chymotrypsin were tested with 5 &#956;L of substrate in
the 96-well samples at room temperature with 100 &#956;L PBS. The reaction mixtures
were read at 410 nm to quantify the formation of p-nitroaniline (yellowish
color) every 2 minutes during 200 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Experimental data are presented as mean &#177; SD, and they were analyzed with the
GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
USA, 2012), using Student&#8217;s t-test or ANOVA followed by Sidak
<italic>post-hoc</italic>. Values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered
statistically signi&#64257;cant.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteomics analysis</title></sec><sec><title>In solution digestion of Fraction I</title><p>The lyophilized Fraction I was dispersed with 200 &#956;L ultrapure water. The sample
remained in the water bath at 37 &#176;C for 20 minutes and then centrifuged for 5
minutes. The sample was quantified by RC-DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, USA) and the
concentration found was 8 &#956;g/mL. For reduction of the Fraction I, an aliquot of
the lyophilized sample was re-suspended in 8 mL of 25 mM
NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and 2 &#956;L of 100mM dithiothreitol and incubated
for 1 hour at 56 &#176;C and 300 rpm. For further alkylation, 1.5 &#956;L of 500 mM
iodoacetamide was added to the sample and incubated in the dark for 1 hour at
room temperature. Then, the fraction sample was digested by trypsin in 50 mM
NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.8, in a ratio of 1:50 and incubated
overnight, at 37 &#176;C, under shaking at 300 rpm. Reaction was stopped by adding
10% TFA (v/v) to the reaction mixture, and the sample was dried on speed vacuum.
Sample was suspended in 20 &#181;L of 0.1% TFA (v/v) for desalting on ZipTip&#8482; pipette
tips with C18 resin (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), using an
acetonitrile/water/TFA (49.8/50/0.2 v/v) solution as eluent.</p></sec><sec><title>Shotgun proteomics</title><p>For shotgun proteomics analysis, the digested material was analyzed in the
Acquity UPLC<sup>&#174;</sup> M-Class (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to the
Q-Exactive Orbitrap&#8482; Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scienti&#64257;c, Bremen, Germany). The
chromatographic system is equipped with a 100 &#956;m x 25 cm monolithic PepSwift
capillary column (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The elution of the
peptides was performed with a gradient of 3-50% solution B in 80 minutes (A: H2O

(serine proteases, metalloproteinases), L-amino acid oxidases, hyaluronidases
and bradykinin potentiating peptides. Fraction I did not demonstrated
phospholipase, hyaluronidase or LAAO activities (data not shown). However, it
exhibits proteolytic activity, as evidenced by increased proteolysis in trypsin

the hydrolysis of azocasein substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.

</p></sec><sec><title>Proteomics</title><p>Mass spectrometry analyses resulted in 4,321 MS and 28,504 MS/MS scans for
Fraction I. After applying the parameters described in the Methods section,
Fraction I presented 8,017 Peptide Spectrum Matches and 882 peptide sequences
that matched the database information. These peptides belong to 66 proteins,
among which 56 were identified with more than 2 unique peptides and 10 proteins
with 2 unique peptides.</p><p>The peptides obtained by high resolution nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS were <italic>de
novo</italic> sequenced using the SPIDER algorithm dedicated to the searches
into the &#8220;Scorpion&#8221; database created from NCBI in June 2018. We have considered
as an accurate identification just the proteins that matched with at least 2
unique peptides. Therefore, with the <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing, it was
obtained 3,269 mass spectra&#8217;s, with represented in 95 proteins that matched with
the database in the SPIDER section analysis. The full list of proteins and
peptides found in this study is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="suppl1">Additional file 1</xref>.</p><p>The results obtained by the biochemical characterization corroborates the
proteomics analysis. Among them, 48% were neurotoxins, 21% metalloproteinases,
11% hypotensive peptides and 9% cysteine-rich venom protein (CRISPs). In this
analysis, Fraction I also showed to have antimicrobial peptides (AMPs),
phospholipases and other enzymes, such as chymotrypsin and lysozymes, which
represents 3% each of all venom components identified. In addition, it was
identified phosphodiesterases (2%) in this fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Fraction I presents several components of high molecular mass, such as enzymes
and CRISPs, since it is possible to observe in the electrophoresis gel. The
proteomic study identified 8 different venom components classes. De Oliveira et
al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] described an integration of
proteome and transcriptome studies of <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> and found
14 different classes of venom components, herein we found that 8 of them exist
in Fraction I. In addition, it was observed the presence of peptides, such
neurotoxins, hypotensive peptides and AMPs, which probably eluted in this
fraction aggregated to other venom components. Fraction I is the first to be
eluted during the process of fractionation of the venom in a CMC-52 cationic
resin, this fact indicates that it is composed of toxins with less basic
characters than the others.</p><p>

</p><p>Related to ACE inhibition observed in the biochemical analysis, the proteome
revealed 11% hypotensive peptides, including bradykinin-potentiating peptides,
hypotensins, PAPE peptides and one endothelin-converting enzyme 1. The higher
coverage of this class was obtained for the Hypotensin-2 (P84190.1), already
described by Verano-Braga et al. [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>],
with 48 peptides sequenced that matched with the 25 amino acids residues from
this template. However, the <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing showed 210
<italic>de novo</italic> tags for this template, resulted from at least 22
amino acid residues mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="suppl2">Additional file 2</xref>). Also, this sequence has 33 possible
post-translational modifications, such as the formation of pyro-glutamic ring
which hamper the sequencing of these peptides by Edman&#8217;s Degradation.</p><p>In this study, we identified two peptides (YANLGEFPWMVFIR and
SELDKNCSGFLLSPSFVLDHK) that matched with a putative venom chymotrypsin-like
protease (AG85164.1) from <italic>Tityus bahiensis</italic>. These findings can
explain the enhancing of proteolytic activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin
observed in the biochemical analysis of this fraction.</p><p>Interesting, the proteome analysis revealed the presence of several CRISPs which
were never isolated before and were reported only in the proteomic study of De
Oliveira et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Herein, we found
that this venom component class is eluted in Fraction I, which will be useful in
directing the isolation procedure to obtain these toxins. In this study we have
covered 57% of the protein sequence identified by De Oliveira et al [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (deposit JAW07031.1). This sequence
presented 14 post-translational modifications, including amidations,

</p><p>The proteome of Fraction I identified venom components classes that were
described just in the transcriptome study of De Oliveira et al. [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], such as phospholipases A2,
antimicrobial and bradykinin-potentiating peptides. This fact reinforces the
importance of a previous fractionation of the venom in order to obtain a more
accurate sequencing of the venom components in the proteomics studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the omics approaches provide a holistic (although not exhaustive) view of
the venom composition from the animals, there is a gap in the obtainment of these
components directly from the venom, mainly due the low yield of purified toxins from
milked venom. Therefore, a proteome fraction-directed or fraction subproteomes
associated to shotgun proteomics can overcome this challenge.</p><p>In this study a preliminary fractionation of the <italic>Ts</italic> venom was
performed using the cation exchange column CMC-52, as described by Arantes et al.
[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Cerni et al. [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This fractionation is based on the
electrostatic interaction between the sample components and the stationary phase at
pH 7.8. The positively charged venom components interact with the negatively charged
carboxymethyl groups of the resin and are eluted with the increase of the buffer
concentration [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This <italic>Ts</italic>
venom fractionation approach has some advantages, as the isolation of Ts1 (fraction
XIII), corresponding to 16% of the soluble venom. In addition, enzymes, such as
hyaluronidase and proteases, especially metalloproteinases, keep their activities
under these chromatographic conditions [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The chromatographic fractionation of the <italic>Ts</italic> venom resulted in 18
fractions. Fraction I is the first to be eluted, indicating that it is composed by
proteins with character less basic than the other ones that are eluted with higher
buffer concentrations. This fraction is rich in venom components, showing many
protein bands with different molecular masses, in the Tricine-SDS-PAGE.
Additionally, Fraction I corresponds to approximately 30% of the <italic>Ts</italic>
venom, being its major fraction.</p><p>The proteolytic activity assays of fraction I in the presence of inhibitors reveal
the presence of both metalloproteases (inhibited by EDTA) and serine proteases
(inhibited by PMSF). The existence of these proteases in <italic>Ts</italic> venom
was reported before in omics studies of De Oliveira et al [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] that found 16 transcripts related to trypsin-like proteases
and 1 sequence of trypsin-like serine protease in the <italic>T. serrulatus</italic>
proteome. However, the chymotrypsin peptides found in our work represents the first
evidence at protein level of the presence of this protease in the
<italic>Ts</italic> venom.</p><p>The function of scorpion venom proteases has not been fully elucidated yet. These
enzymes can cleave proteins at specific sites of the amino acid sequence and are
classified according to the key amino acid at the catalytic site or according to the
need of the metal ion to perform its function [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These enzymes are important for cellular metabolism, since they
participate in the post-translational process of removal of the signal peptides,
among others [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Proteinases can also act as toxins and are well characterized in the venoms of
spiders and snakes. Concerning <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> venom, in 2010, a
metalloproteinase called antarease, showed to be able to penetrate into intact
tissues and cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs), which may alter
vesicular transport and secretion mechanisms [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, antarease may be
one of the compounds responsible for acute pancreatitis observed after envenoming
with <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
Recently, ten novel metalloproteinases sequences were predicted after analysis of
the <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> venom gland transcriptome, called
metaloserrulases [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Fraction I was also able to inhibit the ACE activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and
its proteome identified several components classified as hypotensive peptides. Some
of these peptides are responsible for inhibiting the angiotensin converting enzyme,
which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide. In
addition, ACE also inactivates bradykinin, which is a vasodilator peptide [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These concomitant actions lead to a
decrease in blood pressure, thus demonstrating the importance of these peptides as a
possible molecular tool and/or therapeutic drug. Numerous studies reported already
the presence of hypotensive peptides in animal&#8217;s venom [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Several scorpion venom components act on the cardiovascular system. Among them
natriuretic peptides [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], PAPE peptides
[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], non-disulfide-bridged peptides
[<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], bradykinin-potentiating peptides
(BPPs) and hypotensins [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] which are peptides that exhibits
hypotensive properties. In our study, we found in Fraction I all these peptides,
with exception of natriuretic peptide. In addition, we identified
endothelin-converting enzyme, already found in the study of De Oliveira et al.
[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although endothelin is frequently
considered as having a primarily cardiovascular role in the brain, the roles of this
enzyme in the venom remains unclear [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Another important result obtained from proteome of Fraction I was the identification
of CRISP classes. This venom component has been already reported in other animal
venom, such as snakes [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>-<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], spiders [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and scorpions [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The role of CRISPs in the venom
remain unclear but they seem to interfere in the smooth-muscle contraction by
inhibiting ion channels [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. One CRISP
identified in the transcriptome of <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> by De Oliveira
[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was sequenced in our study. These
results show how subproteome can be effective to drive the researches in the
isolation of components with biotechnological and therapeutic potential directly
from the venom.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that some basic neurotoxins, such as Ts1, which are also found
in fractions eluted at higher buffer concentrations, have been identified in
Fraction I. This result shows that these neurotoxins may aggregate with other venom
proteins, preventing their interactions with the resin during the chromatographic
process, justifying their presence also in Fraction I. These phenomena contribute to
increase the diversity of components present in this fraction, confirming our
initial hypothesis that this fraction deserved to be better studied due to its
diversity in bioactive components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study of the venom components has a remarkable importance in the toxinology
field, which allows identifying molecules with biotechnological and therapeutic
potentials. A fraction subproteome associated to biochemical characterization has an
important role in the venom elucidation. Shotgun proteomics described at least 8
different venom component classes in Fraction I, among them proteases and
hypotensive peptides, which were confirmed by enzymatic assays, revealing how
complex is this fraction. Venom subproteomes may serve as a roadmap to obtain
specific venom components in their native forms and therefore perform its
preliminary characterization, promoting advances and biological discoveries to
toxinology field.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p><bold>Availability of data and material:</bold> The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from
