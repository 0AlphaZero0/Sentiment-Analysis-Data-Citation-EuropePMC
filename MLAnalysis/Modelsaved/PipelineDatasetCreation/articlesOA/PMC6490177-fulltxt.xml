The natriuretic polypep-tide b (Nppb)-expressing class of sensory neurons, when activated, elicits scratching responses in mice, but it is unclear which itch-inducing agents stimulate these cells and the receptors involved. Here, we identify receptors expressed by Nppb neurons and demonstrate the functional importance of these receptors as sensors of endogenous pruritogens released by mast cells. Our search for receptors in Nppb neurons reveals that they express leukotriene, serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Targeted cell ablation, calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons, and conditional receptor knockout studies demonstrate that these receptors induce itch by the direct stimulation of Nppb neurons and neurotransmission through the canonical gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-dependent spinal cord itch pathway.

To accomplish this protective response, sensory neurons detect cutaneous pruritogens, and these cells relay sensory information via a common and dedicated spinal pathway (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2009</xref>) to higher centers in the brain, producing an itch percept.</p><p id="P7">Both exogeneous compounds (e.g., the protease mucunain present in spicules from the cowhage plant; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>) and endogenous agents released from cells in the skin can trigger pruriception (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Azimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Oetjen et al., 2017</xref>). Skin-resident mast cells are thought to be key players in the latter indirect itch pathway, since they are ideally localized to detect and respond to intruder agents and organisms such as parasites (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Metcalfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Tay et al., 2013</xref>). In the past, work has focused on histamine released by mast cells, for instance in the context of type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Modena et al., 2016</xref>). However, mast cells are also activated under nonallergic conditions (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Krystel-Whittemore et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, in most clinically relevant settings, including certain chronic diseases, antihistamines are ineffective at relieving itch (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">Yosipovitch et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that molecules other than histamine serve as endogenous pruritogens. However, potential roles of non-histamine mast cell-derived mediators in pruriception are not well characterized, and the neurons and receptors involved in detection of these compounds are also not well understood.</p><p id="P8">In mice, pruritogens are detected by two nonoverlapping classes of sensory neurons that themselves are part of a larger population of neurons that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (Trpv1) (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>). One of these classes of neurons is marked by the transmitter natriuretic polypeptide b (Nppb), and the second is defined by the expression of the Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor a3 (Mrgpra3) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>). It was demonstrated that activation of Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons is sufficient for the generation of itch behavior (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Further corroborating a role of Mrgpra3 neurons in pruriception, several itch receptor proteins, including Mrgpra3 itself, the receptor for the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, and Mrgprc11, the receptor for bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8&#8211;22 and several cysteine proteases, were shown to be expressed by Mrgpra3 neurons (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), and elimination of these cells attenuated sensitivity to pruritogens (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The transmitter Nppb is required for itch responses (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), but it is unclear which itch-inducing agents stimulate Nppb cells and the receptors involved. Interleukin-31 (IL-31), a cytokine associated with chronic itch (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Sonkoly et al., 2006</xref>), might be sensed by Nppb neurons, as they express the IL-31 receptor IL-31Ra (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>). However, IL-31 alone does not provoke acute itch in healthy humans, questioning its role as an endogenous pruritogen (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Hawro et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the serotonin receptor Htr1f was reported to be expressed in Nppb cells, but ablation of these cells partially reduced itch responses to serotonin and other pruritogens, calling into question the contribution of both this receptor and Nppb cells to itch (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Stantcheva et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, transcriptomic studies suggest that Nppb neurons express select G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that may be involved in itch, but these receptors have not been validated (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, to date, it remains unclear how Nppb neurons participate in the detection of pruritogens. To better understand this process, we sought to identify the itch receptors Nppb neurons express and thereby determine the origin of the pruritogens that stimulate these cells. We used an unbiased transcriptomic approach in conjunction with expression studies, calcium imaging, and mouse behavior to define the mechanism by which Nppb neurons couple activation of mast cells to itch.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mast Cell Activation Induces Itch</title><p id="P10">There are multiple chemicals, with varied sources, that can elicit the sensation of itch. Compounds from mast cells (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Sjoerdsma et al., 1957</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Steinhoff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Sumpter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">Wernersson and Pejler, 2014</xref>) are regarded as a class of endogenous pruritogens; for instance, histamine is widely used in rodent itch behavioral tests (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Han and Dong, 2014</xref>). However, although mast cells are thought to cause itch, the release of chemicals from them has not been studied in detail because of challenges in solely activating these cells. This is because the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor Fc&#949;RI, whose ligation causes degranulation, is expressed on several cell types in addition to mast cells (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Gould and Sutton, 2008</xref>). Additionally, mediators that can cause IgE-independent mast cell degranulation have been shown to directly activate sensory neurons, raising doubts about the specificity of this group of agonists <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Kido-Nakahara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Matsushima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">McNeil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Schemann et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, to characterize the contribution of mast cells to itch in more detail, we examined, using a targeted genetic approach, the behavior caused by stimulation of these cells. The strategy we employed utilized the mast cell-specific Cre-recombinase driver mouse line mast cell protease 5 (Mcpt5)-Cre (MCCre), together with the Cre-dependent R26-LSL-hM3Dq line (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Scholten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). This permitted the expression of the GPCR, hM3Dq, only in mast cells. hM3Dq is an artificial receptor that has been widely employed to stimulate cells using the synthetic ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a compound that does not activate endogenous GPCRs (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). To confirm the specificity of this strategy, we crossed MC-Cre animals with the Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line Ai9 (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, we found very high co-localization between tdTomato reporter expression and mast cells in the skin (290 of 304 cells double labeled; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Further, we found almost complete co-expression between hM3Dq and mast cells that was strictly dependent on the expression of Cre (557 of 644 cells double labeled; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). If activation of mast cells causes itch, then we would anticipate that intradermal administration of CNO should induce scratching. Exactly as expected, mice injected with CNO into the nape of the neck exhibited scratching responses toward the injected area, demonstrating that activation of mast cells is sufficient to provoke itch behavior. In contrast, Cre-negative control littermates failed to exhibit scratch responses when challenged with CNO (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the activation of mast cells likely leads to the release of agents, and this is sufficient to evoke itch behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Nppb Neurons Express Potential Pruriceptive GPCRs</title><p id="P11">Although some of the receptors for compounds released by mast cells are known (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 2010</xref>), it is unclear if there are additional itch receptors for less well-characterized chemicals. Therefore, we designed a screen to search for potential receptors. Because Nppb and Mrgpra3 cells have been shown previously to be responsible for itch in mice and when stimulated can elicit scratching responses (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that there might be unidentified itch receptors expressed in these populations of neurons. We further hypothesized that additional receptors might be differentially expressed between these two classes of cells because the Mrgpra3 and Mrgprc11 itch receptors are expressed preferentially by Mrgpra3 neurons (<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Since both Nppb and Mrgpra3 cells co-express the Trpv1 ion channel (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), we examined the genes expressed in Nppb cells, taking advantage of Sst-Cre mice, which permit the genetic labeling of Nppb neurons, (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), and compared them with genes expressed in Trpv1 neurons, thereby allowing us to search for receptors expressed in these two populations of cells.</p><p id="P12">In order to sample all (or close to all) genes expressed in these cells, we generated cDNA libraries from RNA collected from ~200 hand-picked labeled neurons (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref> for details). Four independent Sst<sup>+</sup> and four Trpv1<sup>+</sup> cDNA libraries were generated, sequenced, and subsequently compared. As expected, and confirming that the transcriptomes of Sst and Trpv1 cells differ significantly from each other, hierarchical clustering of transcriptome data showed that the largest determinant for difference between samples was cell type (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of data from Sst and Trpv1 samples revealed ~1,600 genes with significant differences in gene expression between cell types (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; EdgeR, p &lt; 0.05). Almost 1,000 genes were expressed ~2-fold higher in Sst compared to Trpv1 samples, and ~600 genes were enriched in Trpv1 versus Sst libraries (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). From these lists of genes, we choose to focus our attention on GPCRs, since many pruritogens are detected by this class of receptors (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Imamachi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Ru et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Consistent with our postulate and with previous reports (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), the itch-related GPCRs Mrgprc11, Mrgpra3, Mrgpra1, and Mrgpra9 were enriched in Trpv1 libraries relative to Sst libraries (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). While the specific expression of multiple receptor molecules in Mrgpra3 cells has been functionally linked to pruritogen-evoked scratching responses (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the receptor repertoire for Nppb neurons is still incompletely understood. Therefore, we next concentrated our attention on the GPCRs enriched in Nppb cells and identified 18 candidate GPCRs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on the GPCRs enriched in Nppb neurons, we sought to directly determine if mediators for some of these receptors are released by mast cells. We used peritoneal-derived mast cells (PDMCs), which have frequently been used to model skin mast cells (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Metcalfe et al., 1997</xref>), to examine some of the substances they release upon stimulation. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref> shows that after PDMC stimulation, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), serotonin, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Olivera and Rivera, 2005</xref>), are released, suggesting that these agents may be involved in mast cell-dependent itch via activation of their cognate receptors in Nppb neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 Elicit Itch via the Spinal Cord-GRP Pathway</title><p id="P14">Since we found that the release of LTC4, serotonin, and S1p from mast cells is correlated with mast cell-induced itch behavior, we focused our attention on the receptors for these compounds (Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1). For these receptors to be involved in itch, the intradermal injection into the nape of the neck of specific ligands for them, would be expected to induce scratching. Indeed, exactly as anticipated, all of these compounds elicited vigorous scratch responses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). The rodent cheek behavioral assay permits the distinction of itch from nociceptive responses, with pruritogens evoking scratching with the hindlimb while algogens trigger wiping with the forelimb (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>). In contrast to the wiping evoked by capsaicin, N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 produced intense scratching and did not elicit wiping, suggesting that these agents are pruritogens (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Itch responses have been shown to be transmitted through a spinal cord circuit that requires the neuropeptide gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and GRP neurons (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). This circuit has been shown to be specific for itch, and therefore, to obtain evidence that the Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 are pruriceptors, we tested if itch responses evoked by them are dependent on signaling through spinal cord-GRP neurons. To accomplish this, we used a targeted genetic strategy where we interfered with the biosynthesis of neuropeptides, including GRP, in spinal cord-GRP neurons. Specifically, we generated mice lacking the critical neuropeptide-modifying enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) in GRP-Cre neurons (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2007</xref>), GRP-Cre&#8759;PAM<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (PAM-mice) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). PAM is the sole enzyme responsible for C-terminal deglycination and amidation of peptides, a common modification of many neuropeptides including GRP (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Merkler, 1994</xref>). In the absence of modification by PAM, GRP has two orders of magnitude less potency for its receptor than the amidated peptide (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 1990</xref>). We note that the resulting PAM mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios and displayed no overall gross phenotype. Confirming successful elimination of PAM from GRP neurons, we were only able to amplify the mutant PAM allele (with Cre-mediated deletion of exon 6) from cDNA derived from the spinal cord samples from PAM mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Further, as expected for interference with spinal GRP signaling, histamine-, chloroquine-, and compound-48/80-induced itch was profoundly reduced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref>), while responses to other somatosensory stimuli were unaffected by this mutation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3B</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3E</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, itch induced by intrathecal administration of GRP and injection of nor-Binaltorphimine were unaffected, consistent with the PAM genetic lesion only affecting signaling upstream of spinal cord GRPR neurons and not effecting other GRP neurons in the CNS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3J</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, PAM mice are an effective genetic method to test if compounds are involved in itch. To investigate if the GRP-dependent spinal circuit is required to evoke itch responses for ligands to Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, we performed experiments with PAM mice. We hypothesized that if these receptors are required for itch, then spinal cord-GRP signaling would be required. Just as expected, itch behavioral responses mediated through Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 were strongly attenuated in PAM mice compared to littermate controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3K</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Trpv1-Lineage Neurons Are Necessary for Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-Evoked Itch</title><p id="P16">Our findings that Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-induced itch-responses require spinal-GRP signaling suggest that they are itch receptors. A corollary of this result is that the elimination of the sensory neurons, which express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, should attenuate itch responses induced by the agonists for these receptors. To address this predicted consequence, we used animals that have lost the Trpv1 lineage of sensory neurons (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>) by crossing Trpv1-IRES-Cre animals (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>) with a R26-floxed stop-diphtheria toxin A (DTA) line (<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Voehringer et al., 2008</xref>) to produce Trpv1-Cre&#8759;LSLDTA mice (Trpv1-DTA). In agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>), we found that these mice have deficits in behavioral responses to the Trpv1 agonist capsaicin as well as in the detection of noxious heat and cold (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C</xref>). We verified histologically that Trpv1-DTA mice lack sensory neurons expressing Trpv1 and Nppb (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4D</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4G</xref>) (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>). Strikingly, Trpv1-DTA mice also exhibit severely reduced scratching responses to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), indicating that these neurons are required to produce Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 itch responses. However, even though Trpv1-lineage neurons are required for N-met LTC4-, LY344864-, and CYM5442-induced itch, this reaction may result via a deficit in an indirect itch pathway, e.g., via mast cells (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Boyce, 2007</xref>). To test this possibility, we examined itch responses in mice lacking mast cells. Specifically, to ablate mast cells, we crossed MC-Cre&#8759;LSL-tdTomato mice with the R26-floxed stop-DTA line (MC-DTA). Histochemical staining of skin from MC-DTA animals showed that they had no detectable mast cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>; 0 mast cells in 7 sections from 3 mice). MC-DTA mice displayed itch responses indistinguishable from littermate control animals, showing that scratching induced by N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 does not require mast cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).</p><p id="P17">A second prediction of Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 being itch receptors is that application of their corresponding ligands should stimulate the neurons in which they are expressed. Since Trpv1-lineage neurons are required for itch responses mediated by these receptors, the cells that express these receptors must be within this population of neurons. Therefore, we performed calcium imaging on DRG neurons collected from mice where the Trpv1 lineage of cells expresses the calcium sensor GCaMP6s, Trpv1-Cre&#8759;Ai96 mice (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Since this cell lineage contains multiple different classes of cells, not all of which are involved in itch (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>), sensory neurons were sequentially exposed to N-met LTC4, LY344864, CYM5442, histamine, and capsaicin to determine cellular specificity. With this testing regimen, we could classify neurons that express histamine and capsaicin (Trpv1) receptors and determine the neurons that were responsive to ligands for Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1. As expected, calcium imaging revealed a class of non-itch neurons that were stimulated by capsaicin but were unresponsive to all the pruritogens tested (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, middle). Imaging also revealed two different classes of neurons that reacted to pruritogens. The first of these reacted to histamine and capsaicin but was unresponsive to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, left). The second class of neurons displayed largely overlapping responsiveness to N-met LTC4, LY344864, and CYM5442 as well as to histamine and capsaicin (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Nppb Neurons Co-express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1</title><p id="P18">Our transcriptomic data show that Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 are enriched in Nppb-cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), ablation experiments demonstrate that Trpv1-neurons are required for itch mediated by these receptors, and cellular imaging assays establish that a subpopulation of Trpv1-neurons responds to the ligands for these receptors (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that Nppb-neurons co-express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1. Recently, it was reported that Cysltr2 and Htr1f are found in Nppb-neurons (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Stantcheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the extent of overlap in expression of these receptors with Nppb was not examined nor was the co-expression of receptors with each other and with other cell types determined. Therefore, to understand more about the neurons that express Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, we performed triple-label <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) using probes to individual receptors, Nppb, and Trpv1. Virtually all Cysltr2-positive neurons express Nppb-Trpv1 (87.2% &#177; 2.8%; 266 neurons from 17 sections/3 animals), and similarly, almost all Htr1f-positive and S1pr1-positive cells express Nppb-Trpv1 (86.3% &#177; 6.3%; 199 neurons from 12 sections/3 animals and 98.9% &#177; 1.3%; 89 neurons from 8 sections/3 animals), demonstrating a remarkably tight co-expression of these receptors in Nppb cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The co-expression of Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 in Nppb neurons predicts that these neurons should be activated by agonists for these receptors.

However, comparison of the transcriptomes of Nppb and Trpv1 neurons did not reveal differential expression of histamine receptors between these classes of cells. We wondered if this might be because histamine receptor is expressed in both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons. To better characterize these two classes of neurons, we determined that they are both predominantly small diameter and that Nppb neurons are 7.5% &#177; 0.7% and Mrgpra3-cells are 8.4% &#177; 2.8% of DRG cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>; 5,059 Tubb3<sup>+</sup> neurons) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, to determine if Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons express histamine receptor, we performed ISH for the histamine receptor Hrh1 and compared its co-expression with Nppb and Mrgpra3. Interestingly, results from triple-label ISH revealed that Hrh1 is expressed by both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons (93.3% &#177; 0.8% of Nppb<sup>+</sup> cells and 73.4% &#177; 2.3% of Mrgpra3<sup>+</sup> cells; 1,644 and 1,185 neurons, respectively), as well as by an additional smaller population of cells (9.1% &#177; 1.4% of Hrh1<sup>+</sup> cells negative for Nppb and Mrgpra3; 286 neurons) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).

To obtain further <italic>in vivo</italic> validation that these receptors are itch sensors, we focused our attention on whether S1pr1 is essential for S1p-induced itch. In order to do this, we generated a mouse null for S1pr1 in only sensory neurons, Trpv1-Cre&#8759; S1pr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (S1pr1 cKO) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Allende et al., 2003</xref>). As S1pr1 is expressed only in Nppb neurons (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), this intersectional approach enabled the specific deletion of S1pr1 in Nppb-expressing neurons. We reasoned that if S1pr1 functions <italic>in vivo</italic> as an itch receptor, then a sensory-neuron-specific knockout (KO) of this GPCR should produce mice lacking itch responses to S1p (CYM5442). <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> illustrates the genetic strategy employed to eliminate expression of S1pr1 in sensory neurons.

We next investigated if S1pr1 cKO mice have sensory deficits, testing several acute somatosensory behaviors. No differences between mutants and controls were observed for behavioral responses to noxious heat, noxious cold, and innocuous mechanical stimuli or for motor coordination, itch responses to histamine and chloroquine, and ongoing nociceptive responses after intraplantar injection of capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate, showing that the S1pr1 is not required for these behaviors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). Responses to N-met LTC4 and LY344864 were also normal in mutant mice (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). By contrast, scratching responses to intradermal injection of the S1pr1 agonist CYM5442 were virtually absent in S1pr1 cKO mice (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).

First, chemogenetic activation of mast cells produces itch behavior. Second, we show that mast cells, upon stimulation, can release serotonin, LTC4, and S1p. Third, we demonstrate that receptors for these three ligands are expressed selectively by Nppb neurons. Fourth, genetic disruption of spinal cord GRP-neuron neuropeptide-mediated itch establishes that Cysltr2-, Htr1f-, and S1pr1-induced scratch responses require the canonical GRP-spinal cord itch circuit. Fifth, calcium imaging results corroborate that Nppb neurons directly respond to agents released by mast cells. Lastly, we engineered and tested mice specifically lacking S1pr1 in sensory neurons, showing that these mice selectively lose itch responses to S1p. Together, our studies establish a cellular and molecular mechanism by which mast cell activation induces itch.</p><p id="P23">There has been much interest in identifying and characterizing receptors responsible for itch sensation in the last decade (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Han and Dong, 2014</xref>).

Here, we identify and functionally characterize three additional itch receptors, Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1, that are specifically co-expressed in Nppb neurons. In addition to these three GPCRs, our transcriptomic analysis of Nppb neurons (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>) revealed the existence of other receptors that might modulate Nppb-neuron activity. For instance, we found the serotonin receptors Htr7, Htr1a, and Htr1d to be enriched in Nppb neurons relative to Trpv1 neurons, some of which were previously reported to contribute to itch (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our sequencing results suggest that the platelet-activating factor receptor (Ptafr) is also likely expressed in Nppb neurons. Interestingly, the platelet-activating factor lipid moiety was described to be produced by mast cells (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima et al., 1997</xref>), hinting that it may be involved in mast cell-mediated itch as well. The large number of identified receptors suggests that there is redundancy in pathways for induction of itch, and almost all pruriceptors described so far have been reported to be coupled to Trpv1 and/or Trpa1 ion channels. It has also been described that the direct activation of Trpa1 can evoke itch in different animals (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Esancy et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, it is likely that itch and pruriceptors developed to respond to specific dermatological challenges. Additionally, even though agonists to the proposed itch receptors reported here evoke itch responses in experimental settings, they may not all have primary roles in itch detection.</p><p id="P24">The Cysltr2, Htr1f, and S1pr1 group of receptors we identified is co-expressed in a population of neurons that express the neuropeptide transmitter Nppb (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), while Mrgpra3 itch neurons express a different class of itch receptors but do not express Nppb, insinuating that there is specialization between these cell types. A caveat to this partition of itch receptors is the common expression of the histamine receptor Hrh1 (and other itch receptors; data not shown) by both Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, we previously showed that deletion of Sst from sensory neurons can impact behavioral responses to the Mrgpra3 agonist chloroquine (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), indicating functional cross-talk between both groups of itch neurons. Future studies should resolve if there is itch-cell specialization between Nppb and Mrgpra3 neurons and an analysis of genes expressed by these cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) may provide a means to better address this question.</p><p id="P25">We employed a mutation in a critical enzyme in the maturation pathway for neuropeptides to disrupt the GRP-itch circuit in the spinal cord (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Merkler, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 1990</xref>). The elimination of the PAM enzyme in GRP-Cre-expressing cells produced a specific defect in itch for all of the itch-inducing agents we tested, including histamine and chloroquine, while leaving responses to all other somatosensory modalities tested normal (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). This highly selective effect on itch is similar to that seen when GRPR signaling was manipulated previously (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Compared to many other neural circuits, the striking feature of the itch pathway is its reliance on neuropeptides (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). This contrasts with the contribution of neuropeptides in other somatosensory synaptic signaling pathways where neuropeptides are thought to have modulatory effects and their loss produces only modest deficits in animal behavior (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">De Felipe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>). The difference in timing and duration of itch sensation compared to other somatosensory modalities might be a result of this difference in neurotransmission.</p><p id="P26">The results we present in this study focus on acute itch responses evoked by injection of pruritogens or the chemogenetic activation of mast cells. The mechanisms underlying itch responses for both are likely similar to those which occur for normal itch responses, for instance after an insect bite. However, the agents we identified in this study are unlikely to be the only compounds that are released by mast cells and induce acute itch. For instance, mast cell-derived proteases are known to activate PARs, thereby inducing scratching responses (<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Ui et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to a role in mast cell-mediated acute itch, the endogenous ligands we characterized here may also be involved in persistent itch conditions. High levels of circulating S1p have been reported to be associated with psoriasis (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Checa et al., 2015</xref>), and similarly, elevated LTC4 is associated with skin inflammation, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Sadik et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, platelet-activating factor antagonist was reported to produce some relief in patients with itch caused by atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abeck et al., 1997</xref>). These lipid mediators, in addition to being released by mast cells, may be released by keratinocytes or other types of immune cells. Collectively, these studies suggest that S1pr1 and Cysltr2 in Nppb neurons, in addition to having roles in acute itch produced by mast cell activation, may also contribute to some forms of chronic itch.</p><p id="P27">Mast cells are thought to be immune sentinels that survey the skin for intruders. Classically, their function is believed to involve the detection of invading parasites and the recruitment of other immune cell types via paracrine signaling (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Metcalfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Tay et al., 2013</xref>). It was also known that the release of some agents from mast cells leads to the sensation of itch. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism by which mast cell activation produces sensory nerve stimulation by identifying ligands and several receptors responsible for this coupling. These results highlight a mechanism by which neural and immune systems cooperate to provide a unified defense of the skin and offer insights into the potential ways by which this cascade may become dysfunctional during chronic itch.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>STAR&#9733;METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING</title><p id="P28">Further information and requests should be directed to the Lead Contact, Mark Hoon (<email>mark.hoon@nih.gov</email>).

Sections were blocked (10% normal goat serum in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100) for 2 hours at room temperature. Mast cells were visualized by incubation with avidin-FITC (1:500 in blocking solution, Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) for 60 minutes and three subsequent washing steps in PBS. In some cases, mast cell visualization was combined with immunohistochemical staining for hM3Dq-mCitrine. Here, sections were incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with a polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (A6455, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100.

Ear-tag numbers were read after the experiment and results were unblinded at the end of testing sessions. All behavioral experiments were conducted during the light cycle at ambient temperature (~23&#176;C). Behavioral assessment of scratching behavior was conducted as described previously (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, mice were injected subcutaneously into the nape of the neck with histamine, chloroquine, compound 48/80, LY344864 (all Millipore-Sigma), nor-Binaltorphimine, CYM5442 (both Tocris, Minneapolis, MN), CNO (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or N-met LTC4 (Cayman Chemical). Compounds were diluted in PBS except CYM5442 which was diluted in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Higher doses of CNO led to anaphylaxis-like reactions, most likely because of the systemic dispersion of highly lipophilic CNO. Therefore, we limited the CNO dose we employed in our studies to prevent anaphylaxis and consequently the conditions we used may not have produced fully activated mast cells. In a separate experiment, GRP was injected intrathecally. Scratching behavior was recorded for 30 minutes and is presented in bouts per 30 minutes. One bout was defined as scratching behavior toward the injection site between lifting the hind leg from the ground and either putting it back on the ground or guarding the paw with the mouth. Injections of LY344864, CYM5442, N-met LTC4 and capsaicin in the mouse cheek itch/pain model were performed as described previously (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</xref>). Injection volume was always 10 &#956;l.</p><p id="P39">Ablation of Trpv1 lineage neurons was functionally verified by testing the sensitivity of mice toward application of capsaicin onto the cornea as described previously (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, 50 &#956;l of a 50 &#956;M capsaicin solution were applied onto the cornea and wiping behavior was counted for 30 s. Responses to heat were tested as described previously with minor modifications (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>). Hind paws of mice habituated in small plastic enclosures on a plantar test instrument (Ugo Basile, Gemonio, Italy) were stimulated with a radiant heat beam and time to withdrawal was measured. Withdrawal was tested 5 times for each hind paw, consecutive tests of the same paw were separated by at least 3 minutes. Cold responses were tested as described previously (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, a dry ice pellet was applied below the hind paw of a mouse sitting on a glass surface and time to withdrawal was measured. Withdrawal was tested 5 times for each hind paw, consecutive tests of the same paw were separated by at least 3 minutes. Mechanical sensitivity thresholds were assessed using calibrated von Frey filaments employing the simplified up-down method (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bonin et al., 2014</xref>). Motor coordination was tested by measuring the performance on an accelerating rota-rod, as previously described (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Roberts, 1968</xref>). Each mouse performed the task 3 times and the rod speed at failure was averaged. Ongoing spontaneous pain responses were quantified by counting paw flinches for 15 or 30 minutes after intraplantar injection of capsaicin or allyl isothiocyanate, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23"><title>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title><p id="P40">Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analyses.
