However, the mechanism underlying thyroid cancer progression remains largely unclear. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a kind of non-coding RNA transcript longer than 200 bps. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs plays crucial roles in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and progression. For example, Huang et al. found that the lncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) was upregulated and promoted cell proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer by increasing IQGAP1 (IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1) expression [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several other lncRNAs, such as HIT000218960 [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], NR_036575.1 [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and LOC100507661 [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], were also associated with thyroid cancer growth and metastasis. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in thyroid cancer are still unknown.</p><p>ZFAS1 (ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1) is a novel lncRNA identified to be dysregulated in human cancers, including breast cancer [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], gastric cancer [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and colorectal cancer [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ZFAS1 was first described as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Of note, most publications have shown that ZFAS1 serves as an oncogene. In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZFAS1 promoted cancer metastasis by binding miR-150 to induce ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1), MMP14 (matrix metalloproteinase 14), and MMP16 expression [<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In gastric cancer, ZFAS1 was found to be associated with proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, it was shown that ZFAS1 could also promote cell growth and metastasis in breast cancer [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the expression pattern and function roles of ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer progression are still unclear.</p><p>Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis proposes that RNA modules, including lncRNAs, lncRNAs pseudogenes, and mRNAs could crosstalk with each other by competitively binding to microRNAs (miRNAs). Studies have suggested that the ceRNA mechanism plays crucial roles in cancer progression. For example, the BRAF pseudogene served as a ceRNA to induce lymphoma by regulating the BRAF and MAPK pathway. Wan et al. reported PTCH1-3&#8242;UTR promoted non-small cell lung cancer metastasis by activating miR-101-3p/SLC39A6. In thyroid cancer, H19 competitively binds to miR-17-5p to promote cancer progression by inducing YES1 expression.</p><p>In the present study, explored the expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer tissues by analyzing TCGA dataset. TCGA is a public platform, which includes more than 30 types of human cancers with their clinicopathological information. TCGA platform was widely used to identify key regulators, mutations, and RNA splicing in human cancers. Furthermore, we performed bioinformatics analysis, such as co-expression, GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, to reveal the potential roles of ZFAS1 in the development of thyroid cancer. Our study aimed to provide evidence to show ZFAS1 could act as an effective therapeutic strategy for thyroid cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>TCGA dataset analysis</title><p>We used data from TCGA data portal and GSE50901 [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], GSE33630 [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and GSE29265 to analysis the expression of ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer.

TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using alphanumeric codes: T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, M describes distant metastasis (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another).</p></sec><sec><title>ZFAS1 mediated ceRNA networks</title><p>Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis proposes that RNA modules, including lncRNAs, lncRNAs pseudogenes, and mRNAs could crosstalk with each other by competitively binding to miRNAs.

It can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2984">Figure 1A and 1B</xref> that the level of ZFAS1 was significantly overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues with respect to that in the non-cancerous tissues. Of note, this finding was further confirmed by 3 independent GEO datasets, including GSE50901 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2984">Figure 1C</xref>), GSE29265 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2984">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>), and GSE33630 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-25-2984">Figure 1F</xref>).

The absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient &#8805;0.30 was selected as a cutoff to identified reliable ZFAS1-mRNA pairs. A total of 698 mRNAs were included in this network.</p><p>We next performed GO and KEGG pathway analysis based on the co-expressed genes of ZFAS1 by using the DAVID system (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp</ext-link></italic>).

A series of lncRNAs, such as H19 [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], CNALPTC1 [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], AFAP1-AS1 [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], GAS8-AS1 [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and TUG1 [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], have been associated with cell proliferation, migration, and invasion regulation. A recent study showed lncRNAs, such as PTCSC3 [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], could also affect drug resistance in thyroid cancer. Of note, a few studies indicated that lncRNAs was associated with cancer progression and could serve as biomarkers for thyroid cancer. For example, lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 was observed to be overexpressed and correlated with poor prognosis in thyroid cancer [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that ZFAS1 was overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues and associated with associated with age, lymph node metastasis, and histological type in thyroid cancer. In order to explore whether ZFAS1 could play a role in early diagnosis, we compared the expression level of ZFAS1 in all grades of thyroid cancer samples to that in normal samples. Interestingly, we observed ZFAS1 was upregulated in the earlier stage thyroid cancer samples. Importantly, higher ZFAS1 expression levels was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free survival time in thyroid cancer. These results suggested ZFAS1 could serve as a biomarker for thyroid cancer.</p><p>ZFAS1 has been found to play crucial roles in the progression of many different human cancers. ZFAS1 was identified as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], non-small cell lung cancer [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and glioma [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although Askarian et al. [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] first reported that ZFAS1 serves as a tumor suppressor, most reports have identified ZFAS1 as an oncogenic gene in human cancers. Xie et al. found lncRNA ZFAS1 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the roles of ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer remained unknown. Here, we performed cellular experiments to explore its roles and found ZFAS1 knockdown suppressed the proliferative ability by inducing cell cycle arrest. Inducing the cell cycle arrest is a well-known anti-cancer mechanism. Dysregulation of cell cycle progression subverts the dynamic balance of cell proliferation and cell death, thereby leading to cancer development. Emerging studies suggest that lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. For instance, GAS5 regulated cell cycle arrest in human neuroblastoma. And Linc00152 was found to be involved in cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer. Here, we found knockdown of ZFAS1 significantly increased the percentage of G1 phase cells but decreased the percentage of S phase cells. Our results were consistent with previous findings that ZFAS1 played oncogenic roles in human cancers.</p><p>The mechanisms involved in ZFAS1 regulating cancer progression have been identified by several groups. ZFAS1 was found to act as a ceRNA, which could sponge miR-329 [<xref rid="b28-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], miR-150 [<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and miR-484 [<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to promote their targets. In addition, Xu et al. found that ZFAS1 could block Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling in gastric cancer proliferation and metastasis [<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nie et al. found that ZFAS1 could epigenetically repress KLF2 and NKD2 expression in gastric cancer. In the present study, we performed a co-expression analysis for ZFAS1 to explore potential roles of lncRNAs; such methods are widely applied in various human diseases [<xref rid="b32-medscimonit-25-2984" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We observed ZFAS1 were significantly associated with translation, rRNA processing, intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi, protein deubiquitination, ribosome, spliceosome, RNA transport, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, RNA polymerase, and FoxO signaling pathway. Moreover, we constructed a ZFAS1-mediated ceRNA network in thyroid cancer that included 2 miRNAs (hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-590-3p) and 137 mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed this ceRNA network was involved in regulating DNA replication, transcription, mitotic sister chromatid separation, and translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrated that ZFAS1 was highly expressed and correlated with poor prognosis in thyroid cancer. Knockdown of ZFAS1 was observed to suppress cell proliferation and cell cycle. Bioinformatics analysis showed ZFAS1 was associated with translation, rRNA processing, intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, ribosome, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Our study suggested ZFAS1 could serve as a biomarker for thyroid cancer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn9-medscimonit-25-2984"><p><bold>Source of support:</bold> Departmental
