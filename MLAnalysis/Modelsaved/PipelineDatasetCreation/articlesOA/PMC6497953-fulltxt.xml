Although Tfp have been extensively studied in several Gram-negative pathogens where they function as key virulence factors, many aspects of their biology remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a global biochemical and structural analysis of Tfp in a recently emerged Gram-positive model, <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>. In particular, we focused on the five pilins and pilin-like proteins involved in Tfp biology in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. We found that the two major pilins, PilE1 and PilE2, (i) follow widely conserved principles for processing by the prepilin peptidase PilD and for assembly into filaments; (ii) display only one of the post-translational modifications frequently found in pilins, <italic>i.e.</italic> a methylated N terminus; (iii) are found in the same heteropolymeric filaments; and (iv) are not functionally equivalent. The 3D structure of PilE1, solved by NMR, revealed a classical pilin-fold with a highly unusual flexible C terminus. Intriguingly, PilE1 more closely resembles pseudopilins forming shorter Tff than <italic>bona fide</italic> Tfp-forming major pilins, underlining the evolutionary relatedness among different Tff. Finally, we show that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp contain a low abundance of three additional proteins processed by PilD, the minor pilins PilA, PilB, and PilC. These findings provide the first global biochemical and structural picture of a Gram-positive Tfp and have fundamental implications for our understanding of a widespread class of filamentous nanomachines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gram-positive bacteria</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>type IV pili</kwd><kwd>virulence factor</kwd><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>pilin</kwd><kwd>Streptococcus sanguinis</kwd><kwd>twitching motility</kwd><kwd>type IV filaments</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)

Tfp are polymers of primarily one major protein subunit, a type IV pilin with distinctive N-terminal sequence motif (class III signal peptide) and 3D structure (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), assembled by a conserved set of dedicated proteins (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These defining features are shared by a large class of filamentous nanomachines called type IV filaments (Tff) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Tff are ubiquitous in prokaryotes because genes encoding type IV pilins and filament assembly proteins are found in virtually every bacterial and archaeal genome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Much of our current understanding of Tff biology comes from studies of bacterial Tfp in a few Gram-negative human pathogens in which they function as key virulence factors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The following general picture has emerged. Prepilins are translocated by the general secretory pathway across the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), where they remain embedded via a universally conserved structural feature, <italic>i.e.</italic> a protruding hydrophobic N-terminal &#945;-helix (&#945;1N) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This leaves the hydrophylic leader peptide of the class III signal peptide in the cytoplasm, which is then cleaved by a membrane-bound aspartyl protease (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), the prepilin peptidase, generating a pool of mature pilins in the membrane ready for polymerization into filaments. Efficient prepilin processing by the prepilin peptidase, which does not require any other protein (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), depends on the last residue of the prepilin leader peptide (a conserved Gly) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and two conserved catalytic Asp residues in the prepilin peptidase (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). How filaments are polymerized remains poorly understood, but it is clear that this process is mediated by a multiprotein machinery in the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which transmits energy generated by a cytoplasmic hexameric assembly ATPase (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) to membrane-localized pilins. As a result, pilins are extruded from the membrane and polymerized into helical filaments via hydrophobic packing of their &#945;1N helix within the filament core (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Finally, once Tfp reach the outer membrane, they are extruded onto the surface through a multimeric pore, the secretin (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The above picture, although complex, is oversimplified because there are additional proteins that play key roles in Tfp biology, including several proteins with class III signal peptides, named minor pilins or pilin-like proteins, whose localization and exact role are often unclear. Moreover, Tfp are highly dynamic filaments, constantly extending and retracting. Retraction has been best characterized in a subclass known as Tfpa, where it results from filament depolymerization powered by the cytoplasmic hexameric ATPase PilT (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which generates massive tensile forces (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, Tfp have not been extensively studied in Gram-positive species although it has been recognized that this represents a promising new research avenue as these bacteria possess a simpler surface architecture (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although Gram-positive Tfp were first described in Clostridiales (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> has emerged as a model because it is genetically tractable (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A comprehensive genetic analysis of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfpa (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) has revealed that they: (i) are assembled by a similar machinery as in Gram-negative species but with fewer components, (ii) are retracted by a PilT-dependent mechanism, generating tensile forces very similar to those measured in Gram-negative species, and (iii) power intense twitching motility. The main peculiarity of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> filaments is that they contain two major pilins, rather than one as normally seen (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In the present study, we have focused on the pilins and pilin-like proteins involved in Tfp biology in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and have performed a global biochemical and structural analysis of its filaments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The pil locus in S. sanguinis 2908 encodes five pilin/pilin-like proteins</title><p>All known integral components of Tfp and/or Tff share an N-terminal sequence motif named class III signal peptide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It consists of a leader peptide, composed predominantly of hydrophilic amino acids (aa) ending with a conserved Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, followed by a stretch of 21 predominantly hydrophobic aa (except for a negatively charged Glu<sup>5</sup>) forming the protruding &#945;1N helix that is the main assembly interface for subunits within filaments (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Processing by the prepilin peptidase PilD occurs after Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. In most Tfp and/or Tff, there are multiple pilin and/or pilin-like proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins encoded by the <italic>pil</italic> locus in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, which contains all the genes involved in Tfp biology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), predicts five pilins and/or pilin-like proteins (PilA, PilB, PilC, PilE1, and PilE2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). Four proteins (PilB, PilC, PilE1, and PilE2) display a canonical N-terminal IPR012902 motif (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), which is part of the class III signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Visual inspection of the sequences of the remaining proteins suggests that PilA has a degenerate class III signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), which is not identified by the bioinformatic tools available, including PilFind, which is dedicated to the identification of type IV pilins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Bioinformatic analysis of the two major pilins (PilE1 and PilE2) and three pilin-like proteins (PilA, PilB, and PilC) encoded by the <italic>pil</italic> locus in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> 2908.</bold>

PilB and PilC contain additional C-terminal domains (<italic>blue</italic> and <italic>orange rounded rectangles</italic>).

Processing by PilD (indicated by the <italic>vertical arrow</italic>) is expected to occur after Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The mature proteins start with a tract of 21 predominantly hydrophobic residues (shaded in <italic>blue</italic>), which forms an extended &#945;-helix that is the main assembly interface within filaments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0181904710001"/></fig><p>PilA, PilB, and PilC, all of which are essential for piliation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), exhibit sequence features distinct from PilE1 and PilE2, the major pilin subunits of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). All three proteins have much shorter leader peptides than PilE1/PilE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). In addition, although mature PilA has a size (17 kDa) similar to previously studied pilins and pilin-like proteins (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), its putative class III signal peptide is unique for several reasons. The first residue of the predicted mature protein is Ser<sup>1</sup>, there is an unusual Pro<sup>4</sup>, and the highly conserved Glu<sup>5</sup> is missing. On the other hand, whereas PilB and PilC have canonical class III signal peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), both are much larger than classical pilin-like proteins, with mature sizes of 50 and 52.7 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). This is explained by the presence of bulky domains at the C terminus of PilB and PilC. PilB contains a von Willebrand factor type A motif (IPR002035) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), whereas PilC contains a concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase structural domain (SSF49899) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that PilA, PilB, and PilC are pilin-like proteins, which might be cleaved by PilD and polymerized into <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp, alongside the major pilins PilE1 and PilE2.</p></sec><sec><title>S. sanguinis Tfp are heteropolymers of N-terminally methylated PilE1 and PilE2</title><p>As shown previously, purified <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp consist predominantly of comparable amounts of two proteins, the major pilins PilE1 and PilE2 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which share extensive sequence identity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Tfp, sheared by vortexing, were purified by removing cells/cellular debris by centrifugation before pelleting filaments by ultracentrifugation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As assessed by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>), these pilus preparations contain contaminants that originate from cells/cellular debris. To determine the precise composition of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp, we improved the purity of our pilus preparations. To remove more debris, we performed one additional centrifugation step and passed the sheared filaments through a 0.22-&#956;m syringe filter before ultracentrifugation. As assessed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>), filaments prepared using this enhanced purification procedure were significantly purer, with no visible contaminants. Intriguingly, the morphology of the purified filaments also changed. Although they were previously overwhelmingly thick (12 nm) and wavy (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), most filaments purified using this enhanced procedure display a classical Tfp morphology (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) as assessed by transmission EM (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Indeed, they are thin (&#8764;6 nm wide), long (several &#956;m), and flexible, but they do not form large bundles.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp exhibit a characteristic Tfp morphology and are composed primarily of N terminally methylated PilE1 and PilE2 subunits.</bold>

Their N-terminal residue upon processing is usually methylated and other PTM sometimes include the addition of a variety of glycans and phosphoforms. Methylation is catalyzed by PilD, which is a bifunctional enzyme in many species (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A bioinformatic analysis shows that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> PilD contains the IPR010627 motif catalyzing <italic>N</italic>-methylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>), suggesting that the N-terminal Phe<sup>1</sup> residue in PilE1 and PilE2 is likely to be methylated. Because other PTM cannot be inferred bioinformatically, we used top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) to map the PTM of the two major pilins of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> 2908. Top-down MS analysis of purified filaments showed the presence of two major proteoforms with a ratio of &#8764;4:3 (PilE1:PilE2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), with deconvoluted singly charged monoisotopic masses at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 14,745.63 and 14,087.46 Da. These masses are consistent with the predicted theoretical masses of mature PilE1 (14,731.60 Da [M + H]<sup>+</sup>) and PilE2 (14,073.40 Da [M + H]<sup>+</sup>) with the addition of a single N-terminal methyl group (14.01 Da). Bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis of the two bands excised separately and digested in-gel identified PilE1 and PilE2 with nearly complete sequence coverage (85 and 86%, respectively). The only peptide that was not detected, despite employing several proteolytic enzymes, was the N terminus (<sup>1</sup>FTLVELIVVIIIIAIIAAVAI<sup>21</sup>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). These MS results strongly suggest that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> pili consist mainly of a 4:3 ratio of N terminally methylated PilE1 and PilE2 subunits.</p><p>Next, we sought to answer the question whether <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp are heteropolymers of PilE1 and PilE2 or whether two homopolymers co-exist. Recently, using a markerless gene editing strategy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), we showed that <italic>pilE1</italic> could be engineered <italic>in situ</italic> to encode a protein with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag, without affecting piliation or Tfp functionality. We therefore used this property to design an affinity co-purification procedure to answer the above question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). In brief, the intention was to (i) engineer <italic>pilE1</italic> and <italic>pilE2</italic> mutants encoding C terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins, (ii) shear the filaments, (iii) affinity-purify (pulldown) sheared filaments containing His<sub>6</sub>-tagged subunits, and (iv) assess whether the untagged pilin co-purifies, suggesting that the filaments are heteropolymers, or does not co-purify, suggesting that two distinct homopolymers co-exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). We therefore engineered four different variants by either fusing a His<sub>6</sub> tag to the C terminus of full-length PilE1 and PilE2 (PilE1<sub>6His-long</sub> and PilE2<sub>6His-long</sub>) or by replacing the last seven aa in these pilins by the tag (PilE1<sub>6His-short</sub> and PilE2<sub>6His-short</sub>). We first confirmed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analysis of purified pilus preparations that the four variants were piliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), although at various levels. Purified pili contained both tagged and untagged pilins as assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for PilE1 and PilE2 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), or an anti-His<sub>6</sub> tag commercial antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). When affinity-purified sheared filaments were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-PilE1, anti-PilE2, or anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies, we found that in each of the four mutants the untagged pilin co-purifies with the tagged pilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Importantly, wildtype (WT) untagged filaments cannot be affinity-purified using this procedure, indicating that the pulldown is a His<sub>6</sub> tag-specific process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Considering that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp show little if any bundling, these findings strongly suggest that they are heteropolymers of PilE1 and PilE2. Taken together, these findings show that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp are heteropolymers composed of a 4:3 ratio of PilE1 and PilE2, both harboring a single PTM, <italic>i.e.</italic> a methylated N terminus.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp are heteropolymers composed of PilE1 and PilE2.</bold>
<italic>A,</italic> schematics of the affinity-purification strategy. In brief, one of the genes encoding major pilin PilE1 (<italic>red</italic>) or PilE2 (<italic>black</italic>) is engineered to produce a protein fused to an affinity His<sub>6</sub> tag, <italic>e.g.</italic> PilE1&#8211;6His (<italic>small red sphere</italic>). Sheared pili are mixed with cobalt-coated beads (<italic>large black sphere</italic>) and purified by pulldown, which is expected to yield filaments containing both pilins (tagged and untagged) if <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp are heteropolymers. Conversely, if the filaments are distinct homopolymers, only the tagged filaments will be purified. <italic>B,</italic> analysis of filaments purified by shearing/ultracentrifugation from four unmarked mutants harboring a His<sub>6</sub> tag fused either to the C terminus of full-length PilE1 and PilE2 (PilE1<sub>6His-long</sub> and PilE2<sub>6His-long</sub>) or replacing the last seven aa in these pilins (PilE1<sub>6His-short</sub> and PilE2<sub>6His-short</sub>). The WT strain was included as a control. Samples were prepared from cultures at similar OD<sub>600</sub>, separated by SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue (<italic>upper panel</italic>) or analyzed by immunoblot using anti-PiE1, anti-PilE2, or anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies (<italic>bottom three panels</italic>). <italic>MW</italic> indicates the molecular mass marker lane, in kDa. <italic>C,</italic> immunoblot analysis using anti-PiE1, anti-PilE2, or anti-His<sub>6</sub> antibodies of sheared filaments that were affinity purified by pulldown.

A common rule has emerged concerning two highly conserved residues Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and Glu<sup>5</sup> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is crucial for processing by PilD, whereas Glu<sup>5</sup> is dispensable for processing but critical for filament assembly (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Because the importance of these residues has not been assessed for Gram-positive Tfp, we tested it in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>. Because PilE1 and PilE2 have identical N termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), we focused our efforts on PilE1 and used our gene editing strategy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to construct markerless mutant strains expressing PilE1 variants in which the Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and Glu<sup>5</sup> residues would be mutated. Next, we tested whether these mutants proteins were processed by PilD and assembled into filaments. Pilin processing was assessed by immunoblotting in whole-cell protein extracts using the anti-PilE1 antibody (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> processed PilE1 is 14.7 kDa, whereas the unprocessed protein is 16.9 kDa. Assembly into Tfp was assessed by immunoblotting on purified filaments. Originally, we replaced Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup> by an Ala (PilE1<sub>G&#8722;1A</sub>), which had no effect on processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) or assembly into filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). A similar finding was reported in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and was attributed to the small size of Ala because substitutions with bulkier residues abolished pilin processing (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Accordingly, when Gly<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was replaced by a Ser (PilE1<sub>G&#8722;1S</sub>), PilE1 could not be processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) or polymerized into filaments, which consisted only of PilE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). The marked decrease in PilE2 in pilus preparation suggests a dominant-negative effect of unprocessed PilE1<sub>G&#8722;1S</sub> on PilE2 filament formation. As for the Glu<sup>5</sup> residue, when it was replaced by an Ala (PilE1<sub>E5A</sub>), PilE1 processing was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) but the protein could not be polymerized into filaments, which again consisted only of PilE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>). As above, there was a marked decrease in PilE2 in pilus preparation suggesting a dominant-negative effect of PilE1<sub>E5A</sub> on PilE2 filament formation. These findings confirm that the widely conserved principles defining how major pilins are processed and assembled into filaments (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) apply to Gram-positive Tfp as well. This further highlights the suitability of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> as a Gram-positive model to study Tfp biology.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Processing of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> major pilin PilE1 by PilD and its assembly in filaments follow widely conserved general principles.</bold>

To facilitate purification, we expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the soluble portions of PilE1 (112 aa) and PilE2 (105 aa) fused to an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). This truncated the first 27 residues of the mature proteins, which form the protruding hydrophobic N-terminal &#945;-helix in type IV pilins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This procedure allowed us to purify well-folded and soluble proteins using a combination of affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. Because PilE2 shares 78% sequence identity with PilE1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), we decided to focus on the longest PilE1 and determine its structure by NMR. We isotopically labeled His<sub>6</sub>-PilE1 with <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N for backbone and side chain NMR resonance assignment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>) and obtained a high-resolution structure in solution. This structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>) revealed that PilE1 adopts the classical type IV pilin-fold (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It exhibits a long N-terminal &#945;-helix packed against a &#946;-meander consisting of three anti-parallel &#946;-strands, flanked by distinctive &#8220;edges&#8221; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>), which usually differ between pilins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although the loop connecting &#945;1 and &#946;1 is unexceptional except perhaps for its length (50 aa), the C terminus of the protein (after &#946;3) is striking. Unlike in other pilins in which this region is stabilized by being &#8220;stapled&#8221; to the last &#946;-strand either by a disulfide bond, a network of hydrogen bonds, or a calcium-binding site (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), the 10-aa long C terminus in PilE1 is unstructured and highly flexible. Although the structures within the NMR ensemble superpose well up to the last &#946; strand (&#946;3), their C termini exhibit different conformations and orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Intriguingly, when compared with structures in the Protein Data Bank, PilE1 was found to be most similar to pseudopilins, which form short Tff, rather than to <italic>bona fide</italic> Tfp subunits.

As expected, PilE2 was found to be virtually identical to PilE1 except for its shorter &#945;1&#946;1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>), which is explained by the fact that eight residues at the C terminus of this loop in PilE1 are absent in PilE2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Finally, after producing full-length models of PilE1 and PilE2 using the full-length gonococcal pilin (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) as a template, we were able to model packing of these pilins within recently determined structures of Tfpa (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>).

To start with experimental characterization of PilA, PilB, and PilC in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, we purified each protein and generated antisera. Immunoblotting using whole-cell protein extracts confirmed that the three proteins are expressed because they could be detected in WT, but not in the corresponding deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). We then tested whether PilA, PilB, and PilC were processed by PilD, which for PilA was uncertain considering its degenerate class III signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Processing by PilD, which removes the leader peptide, is expected to generate mature proteins of 17, 50.5, and 52.8 kDa for PilA, PilB, and PilC, respectively, shorter than their 18-, 51.5-, and 53.9-kDa precursors. Immunoblots confirmed that all three proteins are cleaved by PilD as indicated by the detection of proteins with masses consistent with unprocessed precursors in a &#916;<italic>pilD</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Next, we took advantage of our ability to prepare highly pure Tfp, to determine whether PilA, PilB, and PilC could be detected in pilus preparations by immunoblotting. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>, although only PilE1 and PilE2 could be detected by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analysis, PilA, PilB, and PilC are readily detected by immunoblotting in these preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). Co-purification of PilA, PilB, and PilC with the filaments depended upon their processing by PilD because these proteins were not detected in sheared fractions prepared from a nonpiliated &#916;<italic>pilD</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). In conclusion, findings that PilA, PilB, and PilC are cleaved by PilD and co-purify with Tfp suggest that these three proteins are minor (low abundance) pilin components of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp, likely assembled into filaments in a similar fashion to the major subunits PilE1 and PilE2.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Pilin-like proteins PilA, PilB, and PilC are processed by PilD and co-purify with Tfp.</bold>

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing Tff biology might have practical implications for human health and nanotechnology. Perhaps one of the reasons for our limited understanding of Tff biology is that, historically, these filamentous nanomachines have been studied in just a few Gram-negative bacterial species, all belonging to the same phylum (Proteobacteria) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The study of Tff in phylogenetically distant species has the potential to move the field forward, which has recently sparked studies in Archaea (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and in distant phyla of Bacteria (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). One of the most promising new Tfp models that has emerged is the Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A recent systematic genetic analysis of Tfp biology in this species, the first to be realized in a non-Proteobacterium, showed that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> uses a simpler machinery (with fewer components) to assemble canonical Tfpa that generates high tensile forces and power twitching motility (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In this report, we performed in depth biochemical and structural analysis of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> filaments, which led to the notable findings discussed below.</p><p>The first important achievement in this study is the establishment of one of the most complete biochemical pictures of a Tfp. Critically, this confirms the observed trend (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfpa are simpler filaments, with fewer components. Indeed, in Gram-negative Tfpa models, in addition to the major pilin there are 7&#8211;8 proteins possessing class III signal peptides (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, there are four conserved pilin-like proteins required for piliation (PilH, PilI, PilJ, and PilK) whose role (priming filament assembly) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and localization (at the tip of the pili or distributed throughout the filaments) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) remain uncertain, and three species-specific minor pilins (ComP, PilV, and PilX) that are dispensable for piliation but modulate Tfp-associated functions (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, besides PilE1 and PilE2 there are only three Pil proteins possessing class III signal peptides (PilA, PilB, and PilC). As shown here, these proteins are efficiently recognized and post-translationally modified by PilD, which processes their N-terminal leader peptides and (most likely) methylates the first residue of the resulting mature proteins, as demonstrated for PilE1 and PilE2. Processing follows widely conserved principles (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). No other PTM, which frequently decorate major pilins in Gram-negative Tfp are found on <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> PilE1 and PilE2. Importantly, the use of highly pure pilus preparations clearly showed that these five proteins are Tfp subunits. PilE1 and PilE2 are the two major pilins, whereas PilA, PilB, and PilC are three minor pilins. Although the arrangement of the major pilins in the filaments (geometric or stochastic) remains to be determined, this study strongly suggests that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp are heteropolymeric structures containing comparable amounts of PilE1 and PilE2, a property not previously reported for Tff. However, the reason for this peculiarity remains unclear because the homopolymeric Tfp assembled by &#916;<italic>pilE1</italic> and &#916;<italic>pilE2</italic> mutants power efficient twitching motility. A possible explanation might be that PilE1 and PilE2 are important for optimal stability of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp as &#916;<italic>pilE1</italic> and &#916;<italic>pilE2</italic> mutants produce less filaments than WT. On the other hand, what could be the role of the minor subunits of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp (PilA, PilB, and PilC)? Although they are required for piliation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), they are unlikely to prime filament assembly because they are unrelated to the four conserved pilin-like proteins carrying out this process in Gram-negative Tfp (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Rather, PilA, PilB, and PilC are likely to contribute to filament stability and to modulate Tfp-associated functions. This notion is supported by the unusual presence of large C-terminal domains in PilB and PilC. Interestingly, both the von Willebrand factor type A motif (found in PilB) and the concanavalin A-like lectin/glucanase structural domain (found in PilC) are often involved in binding protein or carbohydrate ligands, suggesting that PilB and PilC are involved in host adhesion in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, a property frequently associated with Tfp in other species (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The structural information generated on <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> Tfp is the second notable achievement in this study. Our new pilus purification strategy shows that the morphological features of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> filaments are canonical of Tfpa (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is possible that the thick and irregular filaments purified previously (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) were damaged during ultracentrifugation by the presence of cells/cellular debris. Our high-resolution NMR structure of the globular domain of PilE1 confirms that Gram-positive Tfp major subunits adopt the classical type IV pilin-fold (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The 3D structure of PilE2 is likely to be virtually identical, because of its &#8764;80% sequence identity to PilE1. Full-length PilE1/PilE2 are therefore expected to adopt the canonical &#8220;lollipop&#8221; structure (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), because the missing hydrophobic &#945;1N portion can reliably be modeled as a protruding &#945;-helix. Their &#945;1-helix is likely to adopt a gentle S-shaped curve like in the gonococcal major pilin (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), because the helix-breaking Pro<sup>22</sup> is conserved. Importantly, PilE1/PilE2 fit well in recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of several Gram-negative Tfpa (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which despite different helical parameters display similar packing of the &#945;1N helix within the core of the filaments. Because of the conservation of the helix-breaking Pro<sup>22</sup>, it is likely that the &#945;1N helix will be partially melted between Ala<sup>14</sup> and Pro<sup>22</sup> as the pilins in the above reconstructions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which is thought to provide flexibility and elasticity to the filaments (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In addition, this would allow the formation of a salt bridge between Glu<sup>5</sup> and the methylated Phe<sup>1</sup> (both conserved in PilE1 and PilE2) of the neighboring pilin. Minor subunits PilB and PilC, which have canonical class III signal peptides similar to PilE1/PilE2 are likely to assemble within filaments in a similar fashion. It is unclear, however, whether the &#945;1N helix would be partially melted, because the helix-breaking Pro<sup>22</sup> is absent in these proteins. Moreover, it remains to be seen how the bulky C-terminal domains in PilB and PilC, which appear to have been &#8220;grafted&#8221; by evolution onto a pilin moiety, would be exposed on the surface of the filaments. As for PilA, its unique class III signal peptide, makes it difficult to predict how its &#945;1N helix will be packed in the filament core, especially because of the unusual Pro<sup>4</sup>. Critically, our high-resolution structure of PilE1 also challenges two common assumptions in the field (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). First, in contrast to all previously available pilin structures, the C terminus in PilE1 is unstructured and highly flexible. This explains why it is a permissive insertion site and why it even can be deleted and replaced by a His<sub>6</sub> tag (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), without interfering with the ability of PilE1/PilE2 to be polymerized into filaments. Therefore, the common rule that the C terminus of major pilins must be stabilized to preserve pilin integrity and its ability to be polymerized (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), is not always true. It cannot be excluded at this point that the major pilins of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> are an exception as the major pilin of another Tfp-expressing Gram-positive, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, apparently needs to stabilize its C terminus (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Second, a Tfp-forming major pilin, PilE1, is most similar to pseudopilins that form short filaments in alternative Tff, such as PulG from <italic>K. oxytoca</italic> T2SS (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This indicates that a major pilin 3D structure cannot be used to predict whether the subunit will form pseudopili or <italic>bona fide</italic> Tfp, which perhaps blurs the lines between different Tff and suggests an even closer evolutionary relationship between these filamentous nanomachines.</p><p>In conclusion, by providing an unprecedented global view of a Gram-positive Tfp, this study further cements <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> as a model species that is fast closing the gap with historic Gram-negative Tfp models. Together with our recent reports (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> exquisite genetic tractability, these findings pave the way for future investigations, which will undoubtedly contribute to improve our understanding of a fascinating filamentous nanomachine almost universal in prokaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids that were used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.006917/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>.

In brief, in the first step, the target gene was cleanly replaced in the WT, by allelic exchange, with a promoterless <italic>pheS</italic>*<italic>aphA-3</italic> double cassette, which confers sensitivity to <italic>p</italic>-Cl-Phe and resistance to kanamycin. To do this, a splicing PCR (sPCR) product fusing the upstream (amplified with primers F1 and R1) and downstream (amplified with F2 and R2) regions flanking the target gene to <italic>pheS</italic>*<italic>aphA-3</italic> (amplified with <italic>pheS</italic>-F and <italic>aph</italic>-R) was directly transformed into the WT, and allelic exchange mutants were selected on Km-containing plates. Allelic exchange was confirmed for a couple of transformants by PCR. In the second step, the <italic>pheS</italic>*<italic>aphA-3</italic> double cassette was cleanly replaced in this primary mutant, by allelic exchange, with an unmarked mutant allele of the target gene (see below). To do this, an sPCR product fusing the mutant allele to its upstream and downstream flanking regions was directly transformed into the primary mutant and allelic exchange mutants were selected on <italic>p</italic>-Cl-Phe-containing plates. Markerless allelic exchange mutants, which are Km<sup>S</sup>, were identified by re-streaking <italic>p</italic>-Cl-Phe<sup>R</sup> colonies on TH plates with and without Km. The <italic>pilE1</italic> and <italic>pilE2</italic> mutant alleles encoding proteins with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag were engineered by sPCR. We made two constructs for each gene: a long construct in which we fused the His<sub>6</sub> tag to the C terminus of the full-length protein (sPCR with F1/R3 and F3/R2), and a short construct in which we replaced the last seven aa by the tag (sPCR with F1/R4 and F4/R2).

In brief, as previously described (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), gel pieces were destained and digested overnight with 1 &#956;g of trypsin or Lys-C in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Na<sub>2</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.8, at 37 &#176;C, 1 &#956;g of chymotrypsin in 100 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, 10 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;2H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.8, at 25 &#176;C, or 0.3 &#956;g of Asp-N in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> ZnSO<sub>4</sub>&#183;7H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 8.0, at 25 &#176;C. Generated peptides, which were extracted as previously described (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), were vacuum-concentrated, dissolved in loading buffer (2% acetonitrile, 1% TFA), and desalted using ZIP-TIP tips as instructed by the manufacturer (Millipore). The peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 1% TFA and vacuum-concentrated. Dried peptide samples were dissolved in 10 &#956;l of 2% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid before analysis by reverse phase LC-MS/MS. Redissolved samples (2&#8211;5 &#956;l) were injected into a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-UHPLC system (Sunnyvale) coupled online to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. LC separation was achieved with an Acclaim PepMap 100 column (C18, 3 &#956;m beads, 100 &#8491;, 75-&#956;m inner diameter, 50 cm) and a LC-packing trap column (C18, 0.3-mm inner diameter, 300 &#8491;). The flow rate (15 &#956;l/min) was provided by the capillary pump. A flow rate of 300 nl/min was employed by the nano pump, establishing a solvent gradient of solvent B from 3 to 5% in 5 min and from 5 to 55% in 60 min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, whereas solvent B was 0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200 to 2,000) were acquired with the resolution <italic>r</italic> = 70,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200, with an automated gain control (AGC) target of 10<sup>6</sup>, and ion accumulation time set at 100 ms. The seven most intense ions, depending on signal intensity (intensity threshold 5.6 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup>) were considered for fragmentation using higher-energy collisional induced dissociation (HCD) at <italic>r</italic> = 17,500 and normalized collision energy (NCE) = 30. Maximum ion accumulation time for MS/MS spectra was set at 180 ms. Dynamic exclusion of selected ions for MS/MS were set at 30 s.

For the first method, sample preparation and top-down ESI-MS on a LTQ Orbitrap were performed as previously described (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and intact protein mass spectra were acquired with a resolution of 100,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 400. For the second method, after initial preliminary testing of a gradient of solvent B from 3 to 55% in 10 min, and from 55 to 85% in 12&#8211;35 min, the data were acquired on an LTQ Orbitrap operated in positive ionization mode in the data-dependent mode, to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200 to 2,000) were acquired with a resolution <italic>r</italic> = 100,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 400, with AGC target of 10<sup>6</sup> and ion accumulation time set at 100 ms. The two most intense ions, depending on signal intensity (intensity threshold 5.6 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup>) were considered for fragmentation using HCD at <italic>r</italic> = 17,500 and NCE = 30. The lock mass option was enabled in MS mode for internal recalibration during the analysis. For the third method, a direct injection nano-ESI top-down procedure was employed. Briefly, the Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-UHPLC system coupled to the LTQ Orbitrap was reconfigured so that after sample loading onto the loop, valve switching allowed the nanopump to inject directly the sample from the loop into the LTQ Orbitrap MS using an isocratic gradient of 10% methanol, 10% formic acid. Data acquisition was done manually from the LTQ Tune Plus (version 2.5.5 sp2) using <italic>r</italic> = 100,000 and NCE = 400.</p><p>Data processing and analysis was done as follows. Bottom-up MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.2) and the Andromeda search engine against an in-house generated <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> whole proteome database, and a database containing common contaminants. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, Lys-C, Asp-N, and no enzyme (no restriction) were selected as enzymes, allowing two missed cleavage sites. We applied a tolerance of 10 ppm for the precursor ion in the first search, 5 ppm in the second, and 0.05 Da for the MS/MS fragments. In addition to methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal methylation was allowed, in a separate search, as a variable modification. The minimum peptide length was set at 4 aa, and the maximum peptide mass at 5.5 kDa. False discovery rate was set at &lt;0.01. Deconvolution of the PilE1 and PilE2 mass envelopes from top-down analysis was done as previously described (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).

A full set of triple resonance NMR spectra was recorded on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with triple resonance cryoprobes at 295 K, and processed with NMRPipe (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Backbone assignments were completed using a combination of HBHA, HNCACB, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments using NMRView (One Moon Scientific) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Side chain resonance assignments were obtained from a combination of CC(CO)NH, HC(C)H-TOCSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments using in-house software developed within NMRView (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Distance restraints were obtained from 3D <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-NOESY and <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-NOESY spectra and used for structure calculations in ARIA 2.3 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), along with dihedral angle restraints obtained from chemical shift values calculated using the TALOS+ server (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). For each round of six calculations, 100 structures were calculated over eight iterations. In the final iteration, the 10 lowest energy structures were submitted to a water refinement stage to form the final structural ensemble.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>All the sequences were from the genome of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> 2908 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Protein alignments were done using the Clustal Omega server at EMBL-EBI, with default parameters. Pretty-printing and shading of alignment files was done using the BOXSHADE server at ExPASy. Prediction of functional domains was done by scanning the protein sequence either against InterPro protein signatures (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), or against the SUPERFAMILY database of structural protein domains (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Both analyses were done using default parameters. MODELLER was used for modeling protein 3D structures (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In brief, a homology model for full-length PilE1 was produced using MODELLER in multiple template mode, with the N-terminal 25 residues of PilE from the gonococcal Tfp (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and a representative of the PilE1 NMR ensemble determined in this study. This PilE1 model was then used as a template to produce a PilE2 model using MODELLER in single template mode. These two molecules were then superimposed onto a single chain each of the gonococcal filament cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), using COOT (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), and using the SSM superpose function. Sections of the polypeptide were then refined into the electron densities using the real space refine function in COOT to adjust fitting of PilE1/PilE2 monomers into the helical filament. Multiple copies of these models were then used to produce the final representation. Structural homologs of PilE1 were identified by scanning the Protein Data Bank using the Dali server (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>J.-L.
