It is classically divided into nociceptive pain, which appears as the normal response to tissue damage and pathological pain. The latter, in turn, can be divided into inflammatory, which is produced by the action of mediators of inflammation substances that act as promoters of nociception; or neuropathic, which is the result of direct damage to the central or peripheral nervous system.</p><p>Pain perception is not a simple matter and, since it is influenced by a variety of environmental and genetic factors<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, individual differences in sensitivity and pain tolerance are large. The severity of pain is controlled by genetic variants affecting the expression or function of nociceptive sensory system components.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, the pain inheritance patterns are complex and phenotypes are the result of the expression of multiple differently distributed genes.</p><p>Since pain origin is polygenic, the combination of the alleles of different genes can lead to different genotypes with different degrees of vulnerability that determine individual differences in the efficiency and kinetics of analgesics.</p><p>The effect of pain relief drugs is modulated by different factors such as the clinical course, severity and individual perception of pain, factors that alter the pharmacokinetic mechanisms controlling the local availability of analgesic molecules at their site of action, factors involved in the interaction of analgesic molecules with their target structures influencing the intensity of pain, factors that modulate opioid dosage requirements by conferring a risk of drug addiction and side effects,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and variations in genes coding for proteins involved in all stages of drug interaction with the body.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Dental surgery induces transient nociceptive pain, and different genes have been involved either in its perception or in its response to analgesic drugs. For example, opioid peptides, which function as neuromodulators of pain, and their receptors, among which is the &#956;-Opioid receptor (OPRM1), whose polymorphism cause variability in receptor density and function, may explain the variation of responses among patients<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and has been related to nociception.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, is involved in neuropathic pain<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> as well as nociception.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Nitric oxide synthases (NOS), which are enzymes that synthesize nitric oxide (NO) one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the regulatory processes of nociceptive stimulus, are also involved in nociception, neuropathic and inflammatory pain.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that modulate the presence of extracellular and intracellular mediators that are activated during transduction, conduction and transmission of painful stimuli and it has been involved in nociception.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As far as we know these polymorphisms are not involved in articaine metabolism, and there is compelling evidence indicating that they play a major role in pain response. Therefore, these alleles are good candidates that require further study. To this end, we analyzed, for the first time, the possible association of anesthesia effectiveness with the OPRM1 N40D polymorphism, whose amino acid change in the extracellular domain modifies its affinity for endogenous and exogenous ligands such as &#946;-endorphin.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, the OPRM1 rs11799971 (c.118A&gt;G; p. N40D) allele G is associated with lower gene expression and a decreased number of cell surface receptors.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The polymorphisms of the TRPV1 gene I315M and I585V, whose amino acids changes apparently do not alter the structure or function of the receptor<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (allele M) have been associated with a higher response to capsaicin, while TRPV1 rs8065080 (c.1191A&gt;G; p.I585V) allele G has been associated with a higher tolerance to pain and a lower capsaicin response.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The IL6 &#8722;174C&gt;G polymorphism changes protein expression levels<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the NOS3 &#8722;786T&gt;C polymorphism, which regulates the transcription rate of the NOS3 gene and has the ability to change enzyme levels, has been associated with less promoter activity and protein expresion.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>We believe that for clinical practice it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanism behind pain production in the patients and thus in the future be able to predict and avoid or reduce the possible pain produced by the oral interventions. With this aim in mind, we recruited both male and female healthy patients for carrying out an observational study. Thus, we think that the aforementioned four genes are strong candidates to play a role in nociception and pain, so that the aim of our study was to analyze OPRM1 N40D, TRPV1 I316M, TRPV1 I585V, IL6 &#8722;174C&gt;G and NOS3 &#8722;786T&gt;C polymorphisms and their possible relationship with the articaine-epinephrine oral anesthesia&#8217;s delayed time of onset and with pain perception.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Patients</title><p>This observational study was carried out once informed signed consent had been obtained from the participants. In total, 114 oral cell samples (54 from men 60 from women) were collected from dental centers in Madrid (Spain) from May to December 2009. The ages of the patients included in the study ranged between 18 and 92, with an average age of 47.99&#177;15 and a median of 48. The patients were apparently healthy, of both sexes and had good oral hygiene. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with an active systemic infection or any other severe uncontrolled systemic disease, diabetics and those with thyroid endocrinopathy or fibromyalgia, patients who had received head and neck radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, lactating women, and individuals with cognitive impairment. The patients who had undergone orthognathic, oral or implant surgery less than 1 year prior to the onset of the study or with trauma in the orofacial territory and/or associated structures were excluded from the study. This also included patients who had received more than 3&#160;years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or less than 3&#160;years of concomitant treatment with immunosuppressant. Exclusion criteria also included patients who smoked, and in particular those who consumed more than 10 cigarettes a day.</p><p>This study was approved by the ethics board of University of Salamanca and the University Hospital of Salamanca and was in accordance with the Helsinki declaration.</p><p>Samples were collected by unilateral exfoliative cytology using simple, dry (without medium) and sterile swabs. Then, the amide oral infiltrative anesthetic articaine with epinephrine, was applied in the corresponding oral region under intervention (<xref rid="ST0001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, subjects were operated on using different oral surgery techniques for dental implants and extraction. A protocol to collect clinical and demographic data was developed, and surgery was performed in the mandibular and maxillary area, numbered according to the sextants defined by the International Dental Federation (IDF).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Anesthesia</title><p>A carpule of Ultracain&#174; with epinephrine 40/0.01 mg/ml containing 4% articaine vasoconstrictor epinephrine 1:100.000 (<italic>Normon S.A</italic>.) was applied to different anatomical regions of the oral cavity. Articaine is less toxic than other drugs belonging to the same family due to the presence of an additional ester group that is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, and this type of anesthesia was chosen because of the latency, potency and duration of its effect on soft tissues compared to others with similar chemical structures.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The presence of a vasoconstrictor in the solution, usually 1:200.000 adrenaline or 1:100.000 epinephrine, decreases the rate of absorption, resulting in lower latency and increased duration of action, so that lower doses are required and local hemostasis is promoted.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>Pain scales</title><p>We performed an objective and a subjective analysis of pain post-anesthetic administration. In all of the patients who underwent surgery, pain measurements were made by a single examiner. Onset time of the anesthesia was determined objectively with a stesiometer (<xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Objective pain (Algometry) was assessed using a pressure algometer (Von Frey&#8217;s Esthesiometer).<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Esthesiometer measure the exteroceptive sensory. Designed by Sidney Weinstein<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> in the decade of the fifties of the last century, it is formed by a set of 20 nylon monofilaments of equal length and different amplitude that provide a logarithmic scale of the applied real force and a linear scale of perceived intensity. To normalize the distribution of the dependent variable, the designer of the esthesiometer designated the logarithm for the numerical value of the pressure force as Log10&#160;F (mg). The numerical values obtained in the range of 1.65 to 6.65 mm in diameter, equal to 0.008 and 300 force of pressure expressed in grams respectively. Subjective pain was carried out using a visual analog scale (VAS) with a range of 0 to 10, where 0 was nothing, 1&#8211;3 few, 4&#8211;7 much, and 8&#8211;10 unbearable. Huskisson EC originally referenced VAS in 1974.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This method, evaluates in one person the intensity of pain and its evolution over time. As the pain analyzed is subjective, it is not useful to compare the intensity of pain among different people, since each individual has a different perception of pain. It consists of a line of 10 cm that represents the continuous spectrum of the painful experience; the left end means &#8220;no pain&#8220; and the right &#8221;the worst pain imaginable.&#8221; In this scale the patient must indicate the intensity of his painful sensation, which will be measured, with a ruler, by the examiner from his left end to the point indicated.<table-wrap id="T0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Allelic frequencies of each polymorphism in patients under study</p></caption></table-wrap>
</p><p>Thus, we also searched for a relationship between polymorphisms and subjective pain at different times: 15&#160;seconds and 45&#160;seconds from the application of the anesthetic. Subjects were grouped by pain ranges based on VAS values below or over 2. In the last case, those subjects in whom the anesthetic had taken effect were removed from the study. Thus, the frequency of genotypes of different polymorphisms in each of the other groups was studied to see whether there were any polymorphisms involved in the individual&#8217;s susceptibility to pain.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2004"><title>DNA extraction</title><p>High molecular weight DNA was obtained from oral mucosa cells.

It is known that age, gender, or psychological and ethnic factors may modify pain perception,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and there are several studies on the interaction between an individual&#8217;s genetic basis and their response to painful stimuli.1,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Articaine is a short-acting local anesthetic belonging to the amide group. Epinephrine acts as a vasoconstrictor to promote local hemostasis and reduce systemic absorption of local anesthetic. Therefore, their combination induces anesthesia within 1 to 6&#160;mins and its effect stands for several hours.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In our study, patients showed different times of onset of action of anesthesia and different pain sensation levels. This variability is due to individual differences, and its origin is yet unclear, since there are very few genetic studies that provide data on the onset and duration of anesthesia. Thus, we analyzed OPRM1 N40D, TRPV1 I316M, TRPV1 I585V, IL6 &#8722;174C&gt;G and NOS3 &#8722;786T&gt;C polymorphisms in subjects treated with local anesthetic articaine with epinephrine before dental surgery.</p><p>According to our findings, there is no association between these polymorphisms and the time elapsed between the application of the anesthetic and the onset of its effect. There are no differences between patients before and after 45, 50, and 65&#160;seconds. Likewise, subjective pain intensity, measured by VAS, bears no relationship with them, because no differences were found in the frequency of appearance of the genotypes. However, it is true that in women an association was found between TPRVC315&#160;G/G and a delayed time of anesthesia. At present, the reason for why this occurs is unknown, but we believe that new studies with larger numbers of patients may corroborate this finding.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first attempt to find a relationship between local oral anesthesia and genetic variability. Regarding polymorphism related to OPRM1 and sensitivity to analgesic, we have only found a previous study by Fukuda et al (2010)<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> in which the authors reported that SNP A118G, which was related to response to morphine doses in cancer patients, was responsible for differences in sensitive to fentanyl. In the case of TRPV1 (rs8065080) our results agree with a previous study were authors failed in finding any association between this polymorphism and chronic postoperative pain in patients of thoracic cosmetic surgery.<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>On the other hand, we are aware that the limitation of this study is the number of patients and perhaps in the future a study designed with more patients might find any association between the studied polymorphisms and the anesthesia onset. We also are aware that comparing the pain feeling is difficult between patients given the differences places of anesthesia application and probably the different diffusion of the drug in each patient. For these reasons, we tried to sort the patients out with an arbitrary VAS of 2 in 15 and 45&#160;seconds. However, we also failed to find any correlation with this aggrupation.</p><p>Thus, we concluded that there was not association among the polymorphism under study and anesthesia onset. However, we also believe that it cannot be ruled out that variations in other genes may be involved in individual susceptibility to local anesthesia with articaine-epinephrine.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to data analysis, drafting or revising the article, gave final approval of the version to be published, and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec id="S0006" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work. </p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Mogil</surname>
