Consequently, a comparative analysis of the <italic>B</italic> values of neighbouring atoms must account for resolution. A combination of the SIGD, peak-height distribution and outlier detection was used to identify a number of entries from the PDB that require attention. It is also shown that the presence of a multimodal <italic>B</italic>-value distribution often indicates that some loops or parts of the molecule have either been mismodelled or have dramatically different mobility, depending on their environment within the crystal. These distributions can also indicate the level of sharpening/blurring used before atomic structure refinement. It is recommended that procedures such as sharpening/blurring should be avoided during refinement, although they can play important roles in map visualization and model building.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>macromolecular structures</kwd><kwd><italic>B</italic> values</kwd><kwd>inverse-gamma distribution</kwd><kwd>maximum-likelihood estimation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source><award-id>MC_US_A025_0104</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by <funding-source>Medical Research Council</funding-source> grant <award-id>MC_US_A025_0104</award-id>. <funding-source>Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences</funding-source> grant . </funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="sec1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction &#160; </title><p>Refinement and validation of atomic models elucidated using crystallographic, and more and more increasingly single-particle cryo-EM, methods (Frank, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> &#9656;</xref>) are essential steps in the derivation of reliable three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. Atomic refinement procedures based on Bayesian statistics are now routine (Bricogne, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb6"> &#9656;</xref>; Murshudov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> &#9656;</xref>; Pannu &amp; Read, 1996<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb41"> &#9656;</xref>). Prior structural and chemical information pertaining to building blocks of macromolecules are used during refinement (Vagin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb34"> &#9656;</xref>; Long <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb18"> &#9656;</xref>; Moriarty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb20"> &#9656;</xref>; Nicholls <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb23"> &#9656;</xref>; Smart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb31"> &#9656;</xref>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb30"> &#9656;</xref>) as well as for validation (Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> &#9656;</xref>; Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> &#9656;</xref>). This aids the derivation of chemically and structurally sensible atomic models that are consistent with prior knowledge, whilst transferring as much information from the experimental data to the model as possible via the likelihood function. There are a number of research papers and software tools that are dedicated to the validation of positional parameters of atomic models (see Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#9656;</xref>; Hooft <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"> &#9656;</xref>; Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> &#9656;</xref>, and references therein). These papers and the corresponding software tools have been instrumental in improving the quality of the models deposited in the PDB (Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> &#9656;</xref>; Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> &#9656;</xref>). As highlighted by Pozharski <italic>et al.</italic> (2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> &#9656;</xref>) and Weichenberger <italic>et al.</italic> (2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb35"> &#9656;</xref>), there is still a long way to go before we can claim that the quality of the models in the PDB agrees well with prior knowledge and optimally reflects experimental data.</p><p>Parameters of atomic models include positions, occupancies and isotropic/anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADPs; also known as <italic>B</italic> values, <italic>U</italic> values and temperature factors). While many research papers have been dedicated to the validation of ADPs (see Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> &#9656;</xref>, and references therein), works dedicated to the analysis of ADPs are few and far between (Dauter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#9656;</xref>; Merritt, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb42"> &#9656;</xref>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb43"> &#9656;</xref>; Negroni, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"> &#9656;</xref>;). Moreover, ADPs are often used as a pr&#173;oxy for model quality, for example for the selection of reliable portions of macromolecules, and for validation (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#9656;</xref>). There are at least two problems with such procedures.<list list-type="simple" id="l1"><list-item><p>(i) ADPs contain information about crystal disorder, the relative mobility of atoms within a molecule, as well as absorbing many shortcomings of the modelling and parameterization (<italic>e.g.</italic> errors in atomic positions).</p></list-item><list-item><p>(ii) The absolute values of ADPs are not meaningful. For example, by sharpening or blurring the data before refinement one can decrease or increase the average ADPs arbitrarily. Rather, it is more appropriate to analyse the relative values of the ADPs within the molecule and/or crystal/cryo-EM structure.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The resolution at which the structure has been resolved should also play a role in the analysis of <italic>B</italic> values. For example, a <italic>B</italic>-value difference of 10&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup> would have a completely different effect on the shape and height of the density were the data to extend to a resolution of 3&#8197;&#197; compared with 2&#8197;&#197;. At 3&#8197;&#197; resolution this 10&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup> difference would have little effect on the shape and height of the density, whereas at higher resolutions a difference of 10&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup> would have a more dramatic effect. The relative difference between <italic>B</italic> values is also of importance; the effect of atomic <italic>B</italic>-value differences of 10 versus 20&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup> will be more dramatic than 100 versus 110&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the distribution of <italic>B</italic> values should be considered in the analysis of <italic>B</italic> values and the selection of reliable portions of the structure. One should always remember that over-sharpening can make some ADPs negative, making them physically unreasonable. On the other hand, too much blurring may result in loss of structural details in the density maps.</p><p>In this contribution, we will describe some statistical tools for the analysis of isotropic <italic>B</italic> values. Firstly, we explore using the shifted inverse-gamma distribution (SIGD) to describe the distribution of ADPs within one crystal structure, as well as for each chain within the molecule. We then analyse the distribution of atomic peak heights for point atoms at different <italic>B</italic> values and resolutions, and then describe the application of these techniques to selected entries from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> &#9656;</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that the inverse-gamma distribution has previously been suggested (Dauter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#9656;</xref>) and used (Negroni, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb22"> &#9656;</xref>) for the analysis of macromolecular structures. Here, we extend these analyses and add new statistics: an atomic peak-height distribution for point atoms that is dependent on resolution and <italic>B</italic> value, which reflects the effect of <italic>B</italic> values on the density better than mere <italic>B</italic> values. We also present a new plot based on SIGD parameters that helps in the visual identification of suspect crystal structures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2.</label><title>Shifted inverse gamma as a model for the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution &#160; </title><p>Individual atomic ADPs are proportional to the variances of positional parameters; ADPs represent the mobility of atoms as well as the accuracy of the positional parameters. In Bayesian statistics, the inverse-gamma distribution (IGD) is often used as a prior probability distribution to model the variance of a normal distribution (see, for example, O&#8217;Hagan, 1994<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb24"> &#9656;</xref>). Since ADPs are proportional to the variances, we can postulate that it is likely that the distribution of ADPs will resemble the IGD. However, since average <italic>B</italic> values depend on the sharpening level of the data, we add an additional shift parameter to the IGD. Sharpening/blurring should change the average <italic>B</italic> value without affecting the shape of the distribution, except in cases where over-sharpening produces negative or many small <italic>B</italic> values. Therefore, we assume that the distribution of isotropic ADPs can be modelled using the SIGD, <disp-formula id="fd1"><graphic xlink:href="d-75-00505-efd1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>This distribution has three parameters: shape (&#945;), scale (&#946;) and shift (<italic>B</italic>
<sub>0</sub>). If there is no over/under-sharpening of Fourier coefficients then <italic>B</italic>
<sub>0</sub> = 0, although this is rarely the case. Changing ADPs from <italic>B</italic> to <italic>u</italic> = <italic>B</italic>/8&#960;<sup>2</sup> only affects the scale and shift parameters. Since the shape parameter is also known as the degrees of freedom, it is tempting to assume that since the positional parameters of atoms reside in a three-dimensional space, the shape parameter of the SIGD would be around 3. However, we refine this parameter using soft harmonic restraints to ensure that the estimation of SIGD parameters is stable while allowing some variability.</p><p>Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref> shows the SIGD for different shape and scale parameters (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#9656;</xref>

This figure demonstrates that, at least for this particular case, the empirical <italic>B</italic>-value distribution resembles the SIGD reasonably well.

The derivation of the maximum-likelihood equations for this case is given in Appendix <italic>A</italic>
<xref ref-type="app" rid="appa"/>. Starting values for the parameters are derived using the relationship between the parameters of the SIGD and its mean and variance. Parameter estimation using the first few moments of the distribution is known as the method of moments (Stuart <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb33"> &#9656;</xref>), <disp-formula id="fd2"><graphic xlink:href="d-75-00505-efd2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>Note that the mean of the SIGD exists only if &#945; &gt; 1, and the variance exists only when &#945; &gt; 2.

It is clear that the peak heights are dependent on atom types, occupancies, resolution and <italic>B</italic> values. In order to allow comparison of atomic peak heights, we ignore the effect of different atom types and occupancies; we essentially treat all atoms as point atoms<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>. As a result of resolution cutoff and <italic>B</italic> values (atomic mobility), the density becomes smeared out; this affects the values of the density map at the centre of atoms.

The real observed density will also depend on the noise level, the weights used in map calculations, the occupancies of the atoms, the quality of the amplitudes and phases, the number, types and proximity of neighbouring atoms, the overall anisotropy of the data and many other factors. However, a very simple analysis of peak heights should shed some light onto what can be expected at a given resolution. Even if the distribution of the <italic>B</italic> values is known, it is tricky to derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of peak heights at the atomic centre; therefore, in the following analysis we will use only empirical and simulated distribution histograms for peak-height analysis.</p><p>Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> &#9656;</xref> shows the histogram of <italic>B</italic> values for one example and the corresponding peak-height distribution calculated at different resolutions. It is seen that although the <italic>B</italic>-value distributions are the same, changing the resolution dramatically changes the distribution of peak heights. At higher resolution, as might be expected, small differences in <italic>B</italic> values have a much more dramatic effect on the density level than at lower resolutions. Therefore, it is always a good idea to consider the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution together with resolution, or to consider how the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution and its effect on peak heights depend on resolution.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4.</label><title>Selection of the PDB entries &#160; </title><p>We considered the 89&#8197;862 entries from the PDB, as of December 2016, for which the experimental method was X-ray crystallography. For further analysis, we used only the models for which the high-resolution diffraction limit is between 1.5 and 3&#8197;&#197;. To avoid dealing with noncrystallographic symmetry constraints, the use of which is not always clear from the PDB entry, we removed virus structures. Of the remaining models, we were able to refine 46&#8197;952 automatically using the refinement program <italic>REFMAC</italic>5 (Kovalevskiy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> &#9656;</xref>) available from <italic>CCP</italic>4 (Winn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb36"> &#9656;</xref>). Reasons for refinement failure include (i) the ligand present in the PDB was not in the CCP4 monomer library at the time of refinement (this was the most common case), (ii) no structure-factor amplitudes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> and (iii) space-group inconsistencies between the PDB file and the reflection-data file. The remaining crystal structures contained roughly 160&#8197;000 chains, among which there were 145&#8197;800 protein chains. We also excluded cases with <italic>R</italic> factors higher than 35%.

However, for refinement, over-sharpening can result in suboptimal atomic models as some of the atoms may have negative <italic>B</italic> values. Almost all existing refinement programs use some lower threshold (for example 0.5&#8211;2&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup>) in order to avoid dealing with negative <italic>B</italic> values. As a result, the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution becomes distorted, making interpretation of the <italic>B</italic> values (and sometimes the whole molecule) difficult. When TLS refinement is also performed then the behaviour of <italic>B</italic> values can become even more unpredictable, resulting in large negative or positive peaks reflecting wrong atomic <italic>B</italic> values.</p><p>For our example case, we added a small <italic>B</italic> value (20&#8197;&#197;<sup>2</sup>) and re-refined the model, resulting in the <italic>B</italic>-value distributions shown in Figs. 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> &#9656;</xref>(<italic>d</italic>), 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> &#9656;</xref>(<italic>e</italic>) and 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> &#9656;</xref>(<italic>f</italic>), with &#945; and &#946; parameters falling in the region identified in the &#945;/&#946; plot.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><label>5.3.</label><title>Blurred cases &#160; </title><p>Blurring, in general, should not result in suboptimal refinement.

These are difficult to classify, and there may be various reasons for these outliers. One such case is PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2bp7">2bp7</ext-link>: from viewing the parameters of the estimated SIGD on the &#945;/&#946; plot (Fig.&#160;6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>a</italic>), it is evident that this is a clear outlier with a larger &#945; of 7.83 and a relatively large &#946; of 308.21. The SIGD (Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>b</italic>) and peak-height distributions (Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>c</italic>) show that there are some atoms with small <italic>B</italic> values and therefore relatively large peak heights. Closer analysis revealed that most of the side chains of methionine residues are missing, and that there are some heavier atoms that are interpreted as water molecules. The crystallization conditions indicate that there could be magnesium, sodium, potassium, chlorine and phosphate present as well as molecules of thiamine diphosphate. Inspection of the map showed that these molecules/ions are present in the crystal. After a few rounds of model building and rebuilding, <italic>R</italic> and <italic>R</italic>

The SIGD parameters estimated using <italic>B</italic> values from the rebuilt structure are close to the &#8216;acceptable&#8217; region of the &#945;/&#946; plot (Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>

<italic>e</italic>) and peak-height distribution (Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>

Figs. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>(<italic>g</italic>) and 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> &#9656;</xref>(<italic>h</italic>) show the region of the density before and after rebuilding in the region of the thiamine diphosphate. This example demonstrates how the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution, together with the fitted SIGD parameters, can help to identify some of the shortcomings of atomic models. In particular, very low <italic>B</italic> values can indicate that at least some of the atomic identities are wrong.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.5"><label>5.5.</label><title>Multimodal <italic>B</italic>-value distributions &#160; </title><p>There are a number of PDB entries for which the distribution of <italic>B</italic> values exhibits multimodality. There can be various reasons for such behaviour. Two such reasons are the following.<list list-type="simple" id="l2"><list-item><p>(i) It is an intrinsic property of the molecules within their environment (crystal or multi-domain/multi-subunit structures in cryo-EM), where different components have different numbers of neighbours to interact with. In such cases, different subunits/domains may have different levels of mobility, and this will be reflected in the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution. It can be expected that each individual structural unit will exhibit SIGD behaviour with different parameters. However, the refinement of atomic positions and consequently <italic>B</italic> values in such cases becomes unstable, resulting in inaccurate models. This means that the distribution of <italic>B</italic> values for chains that have higher <italic>B</italic> values may violate the SIGD hypothesis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(ii) Another common case that exhibits the symptom of multimodal <italic>B</italic>-value distributions is when some parts of the model (loops, ligands or even domains) may have been placed incorrectly. Essentially, such behaviour indicates that there is very weak or no evidence to support the presence of these parts of the structures, and as such they should be considered with extreme care.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Here, we analyse two cases: PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2grm">2grm</ext-link>, where there are two sets of subunits with very different <italic>B</italic> values (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>), and PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4l39">4l39</ext-link>, where the density for part of the molecule is very weak (Fig. 8<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> &#9656;</xref>).</p><p>For PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2grm">2grm</ext-link> (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>), the <italic>B</italic>-value and peak-height distributions clearly exhibit multimodal distributions (Figs. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>b</italic> and 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>c</italic>). The parameters of the SIGD for this case are slightly outside the &#945;/&#946; plot (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). Analysis of the <italic>B</italic> values shows that chains <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> have low <italic>B</italic> values and chain <italic>C</italic> has higher <italic>B</italic> values. The density corresponding to chains <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> is also better than that for chain <italic>C</italic> (Figs. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>d</italic> and 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>e</italic>). In this case, it seems that the occurrence of different <italic>B</italic> values for different chains is owing to the fact that they have a different number of contacts to stabilize them within the crystal (Table 3<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3"> &#9656;</xref>). Chain <italic>C</italic> interacts only with itself within the asymmetric unit, and makes only 15 interactions with chain <italic>B</italic>. In contrast, chains <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> interact with each other within and between asymmetric units. Presumably, this is the reason why the mobility of chain <italic>C</italic> is higher than those of the others, resulting in higher overall <italic>B</italic> values. The peak-height distribution (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>c</italic>) also shows that there is at least one atom that is substantially heavier than the other atoms. Analysis of the density revealed that this atom is on a twofold axis. The PDB header shows that lithium chloride was used for crystallization. If this atom is heavier than the other atoms then it is likely to be a Cl atom, although the identification of Cl atoms is usually very difficult, especially at this resolution (2.8&#8197;&#197;).</p><p>In the case of PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4l39">4l39</ext-link> (Fig. 8<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> &#9656;</xref>), the higher <italic>B</italic> values, and therefore the more smeared density, are the result of a disordered domain. Inspection of the density (Fig. 8<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> &#9656;</xref>
<italic>d</italic>) clearly indicates that there might be a different interpretation of this domain and that it might perhaps be better if such loops were left out of the atomic model altogether.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec6"><label>6.</label><title>Conclusions and future perspectives &#160; </title><p>We have demonstrated that there is a need to model as well as to validate atomic ADPs. It is demonstrated that for many macromolecular structures the SIGD can be used to model the distribution of ADPs. Even if the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution over the whole structure does not obey the SIGD, the individual chains/domains will obey this distribution. When the distributions of <italic>B</italic> values for different chains/domains are different there can be at least two reasons: (i) different domains/subunits have different contacts depending on the environment and (ii) there are disordered and/or mismodelled regions that have naturally higher <italic>B</italic> values, reflecting errors in the positional parameters. Such multimodality affects the density and therefore the interpretability of the maps. Future work will include the refinement of multimodality parameters (the number of classes and parameters of the SIGD for each class) using such techniques as the expectation-maximization algorithm.</p><p>We also show that by modelling the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution using the SIGD and comparing the parameters with those derived from all PDB entries, one can identify the degree of sharpening/blurring before refinement. Whilst both sharpening and blurring are valid procedures that can help in the interpretation of density maps, applying these procedures prior to or during refinement can result in suboptimal atomic models. Too much sharpening results in series-termination and noise-amplification effects that reduce the interpretability of maps, and there might be additional density owing to series-termination effects that can be erroneously modelled as water molecules. In general, it is recommended that during map interpretation, even if sharpening is used, the local contacts must be analysed in order to ensure that the modelled atoms/molecules make chemical sense. During refinement, a reasonable level of sharpening must be used, otherwise refinement can become very slow and convergence may not be reached, or refinement can result in negative <italic>B</italic> values that consequently may affect the density map as well as the refinement procedure.</p><p>Since the signal-to-noise ratio in the maps is related to the overall mobility, and therefore the atomic <italic>B</italic> values of the molecules, it is not surprising that when the distribution of the <italic>B</italic> values for a given subunit/domain is shifted to the right (increased) then the corresponding density becomes weaker and the resolvability of peaks is reduced. Estimation of the SIGD parameters can also provide an estimate of the minimal safe <italic>B</italic> value for sharpening. When the data are over-sharpened this affects the distribution of <italic>B</italic> values, moving them to the left (reducing them). In this case, the refinement procedure often becomes stuck, as <italic>B</italic> values cannot become negative. Correcting for over-sharpening, <italic>i.e.</italic> artificially adding a <italic>B</italic> value to the data before refinement, seems to improve the behaviour of refinement, leading to a more reliable atomic model with associated ADPs.</p><p>In this work, we also analyse the resolution-dependent peak-height distribution and show that the effect of the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution is dramatically different at different resolutions. In principle, the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution, together with its effect on the peak-height distribution, can be used as a proxy for the resolution/information content of the data: at higher resolution it can be expected that the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution will be narrow and at low resolution it should be wider.</p><p>In future, we plan to apply a theoretical <italic>B</italic>-value distribution for the refinement of atomic models at lower resolutions where the data are not sufficient to accurately estimate individual atomic <italic>B</italic> values.</p><p>Future work will also consider the potential of using the IGD for map sharpening. The usual map-sharpening technique assumes that there is a single <italic>B</italic> value for all atoms. If we use the distribution of <italic>B</italic> values then we should be able to design better sharpening normalization procedures and therefore better map-sharpening procedures. A similar approach was used by Blessing <italic>et al.</italic> (1996<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> &#9656;</xref>), under the assumption that the <italic>B</italic>-value distribution follows a normal distribution. We also intend to include local <italic>B</italic>-value analysis together with the effect on peak heights to identify wrongly modelled atoms or regions of the structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><p>Refined and rebuilt atomic model for 2bp7..
