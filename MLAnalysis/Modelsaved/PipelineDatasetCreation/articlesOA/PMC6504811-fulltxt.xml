Due to the fact sEVs can be isolated directly from the culture medium of mineralizing osteoblasts, there is growing interest their application regenerative medicine. However, at present therapeutic advancements are hindered by a lack of understanding of their precise temporal contribution to matrix mineralization. This study advances current knowledge by temporally aligning sEV profile and protein content with mineralization status. sEVs were isolated from mineralizing primary osteoblasts over a period of 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Bimodal particle distributions were observed (weeks 1 and 3: 44 and 164 nm; week 2: 59 and 220 nm), indicating a heterogeneous population with dimensions characteristic of exosome- (44 and 59 nm) and microvesicle-like (164 and 220 nm) particles. Proteomic characterization by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed a declining correlation in EV-localized proteins as mineralization advanced, with Pearson correlation-coefficients of 0.79 (week 1 vs. 2), 0.6 (2 vs. 3) and 0.46 (1 vs. 3), respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) further highlighted a time-dependent divergence in protein content as mineralization advanced. The most significant variations were observed at week 3, with a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decline in particle concentration, visual evidence of EV rupture and enhanced mineralization. A total of 116 vesicle-localized proteins were significantly upregulated at week 3 (56% non-specifically, 19% relative to week 1, 25% relative to week 2). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these proteins highlighted overrepresentation of genes associated with matrix organization. Of note, increased presence of phospholipid-binding and calcium channeling annexin proteins (A2, A5, and A6) indicative of progressive variations in the nucleational capacity of vesicles, as well as interaction with the surrounding ECM. We demonstrate sEV-mediated mineralization is dynamic process with variations in vesicle morphology and protein content having a potential influence on developmental changes matrix organization. These findings have implications for the selection and application of EVs for regenerative applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vesicle</kwd><kwd>mineralization</kwd><kwd>annexin</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>nano</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000266</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="10231"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone formation is a carefully orchestrated and well-regulated process whereby inorganic mineral is deposited on a collagenous matrix. Early mineral deposition is principally coordinated by osteoblasts, which modulate local phosphate ion concentrations and drive osteogenesis. Despite significant advancement in musculoskeletal biology, current understanding of the processes by which mineral is first deposited and propagated within the extracellular matrix (ECM) remain incompletely understood (Boskey, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Early studies postulated that matrix mineralization was largely a passive and cell-independent process whereby non-collagenous proteins confined to gap zones function as sites for the localization of ions that drive mineral nucleation (Bonucci, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, two highly significant ultrastructural studies published in 1967 identified the active contribution of nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs, 50&#8211;400 nm), which functioned as loci for early mineral nucleation and propagation in growth plate cartilage (Anderson, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>; Bonucci, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>). It was subsequently demonstrated that mineral crystallized in and around EVs, forming the spheroidal nodules characteristic of mineralization both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It has since been shown that these particles are released into the developing ECM where they determine the specific and localized pattern of nodular mineralization observed in developing bones (Anderson, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Mature nodules then fuse to generate seams of woven bone (Marvaso and Bernard, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that this process is dynamic, progressing from an initial amorphous phase through a series of precursors and that this transition is, in part, facilitated by EVs (Mahamid et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Since these initial studies, EVs have been identified in a wide range of tissues and biofluids. This has resulted in the establishment of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) and the subsequent publication of position statements outlining criteria for defining these complex bioactive nanoparticles (Th&#233;ry et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, advancement in vesicle biology and nomenclature has largely occurred in parallel to developments in bone matrix biology. Vesicles identified within the extracellular matrix of bone are routinely defined matrix vesicles (MV) with a size distribution ranging from 50&#8211;400 nm. Aligning this definition with current vesicle nomenclature, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that these vesicles comprise a heterogeneous mixture of exosomes (30&#8211;150 nm) and microvesicles (100&#8211;500 nm) that may have divergent roles in directing mineralization and intercellular communication in developing bone (Shapiro et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, it is now understood that in addition to matrix-associated vesicles, osteoblasts cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> also generate a population of secreted vesicles that can be isolated the surrounding culture medium (Nair et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that these secreted EVs (sEVs) are enriched in annexin calcium-binding proteins and that the exogenous delivery of these bioactive particles can significantly enhance osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) cultures (Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, if these pro-osteogenic sEVs are to be applied therapeutically additional work is required to define how their properties vary over the course of mineralization and better understand how their properties align with the more comprehensively characterized MVs (Shapiro et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Vesicles derived from different tissue sources are uniquely adapted to fulfill the requirements of that tissue. As such, vesicles will contain specific protein, lipid and nucleic acid signatures indicative of their tissue of origin. Within developing bone, osteoblast-derived vesicles have been shown to function in early mineralization events preceding endochondral ossification. To fulfill their function, these particles are enriched in membrane lipids (e.g., cholesterol, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine), calcium binding proteins (e.g., annexins-A1, -A2,&#8722;5, and &#8211;A6) and phosphate converting enzymes (e.g., tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, TNAP, and nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase, Enpp) (Kirsch et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Together this specialized collection of lipids and proteins comprises the nucleational-core-complex (NCC), which facilitates the uptake, binding and organization of calcium and phosphate ions to initiate mineral formation, expansion and crystallization (Wu et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). It is proposed that EVs bud from the osteoblast plasma membrane and accumulate calcium and phosphate ions extracellularly, providing an optimized niche for the transition to crystalline apatite that eventually ruptures the vesicle and is deposited on the collagenous ECM (Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Hasegawa et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Additionally, internal sources of polyphosphate, such as ATP, are also considered to play a significant role in coordinating osteogenesis both as a source of inorganic phosphate and through their action on purinergic signaling pathways (Orriss et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, much of the data surrounding existing theory has been collected in studies of matrix-bound vesicles, where MVs have been digested from the collagenous matrix (Bottini et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Consequently, limited information exists regarding the precise temporal contribution of sEVs to matrix mineralization. Since the production and isolation of sEVs is less laborious and time-consuming than MVs they present an appealing source of particles for regenerative applications and investment is required to comprehensively characterize their temporal roles in matrix mineralization.</p><p>To date, we and others have documented the capacity of vesicles isolated from the media of differentiating osteoblasts to function as sites of nucleation within mineralizing tissues and have begun to define a mechanism of action based on their biological content (Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, if we are to fully understand their contribution to hard tissue matrix development and potentially exploit these bioactive particles to enhance bone regeneration it is essential that we begin to understand how their function changes over the course of mineralization. In this study we morphologically and proteomically characterize vesicles secreted by primary human osteoblasts under defined culture conditions during mineralization in order to define their temporal effects during osteogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Primary Osteoblast Isolation and Culture</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Birmingham UK Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 16/SS/0172).

In alignment with protein concentration, the number of particles isolated was found to decrease in mature cultures, with a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decline in particle number observed between weeks 2 (2.05 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup>) and 3 (1.12 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup>). These findings may suggest that most of the protein was associated with vesicles with limited indication of the presence of non-vesicular proteins. The presence of sEVs at each time point was visually confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Image 1</xref>). Differences in vesicle morphology were noted, with vesicles isolated during week 3 displaying a less organized structure and visual evidence of rupture which is perhaps indicative of a decline in membrane integrity and the release of luminal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Particles from all three isolations featured an electron dense core, which appeared to become more organized at week 2. Particle size measurement was achieved using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and indicated a bimodal size distribution over the course of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref>). Particle polydispersity decreased over time and bimodality become increasingly evident with peaks becoming increasingly distinct as mineralization advanced. At week 3 (330 nm) maximum particle size decreased relative to weeks 1 and 2 (&gt;500 nm). Weighted averages calculated for particles showed no statistical change over the course of 3 weeks, with mean sizes of 124, 144, and 112 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of sEVs released by mineralising primary osteoblasts derived from three separate donors into culture medium over a period of 21 days.

PCA highlighted a clear spatial distinction between MS protein spectra collected at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To further understand the proteins that demonstrated the greatest discriminatory power between time points, multiple orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant (OPLS-DA) analyses were performed (i.e., weeks 1v2, 1v3, 2v3). Separation of time points was seen in all 2-dimensional score plots corresponding to OPLS-DA analyses (data not shown) and S-plots were consulted for the up- and down-regulated proteins that had the greatest influence on the multivariate model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Only proteins with a Log<sub>2</sub> fold change of &gt;1 and a <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Analysis revealed that relatively few significant differences could be observed between the relative protein profiles of vesicles isolated at week 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>i). 17 proteins were found to be significantly upregulated between these two isolations, with 4 upregulated at week 2 (blue: S100A6, PLEC, ANPEP, CHI3L1) and 13 upregulated at week 1 (green: CD81, FBN2, NID2, RELN, NUTF2, THBS1, LGALSL, MFGE8, COL4A1, COL5A2, COL16A1, PCOLCE2, ADK, MYH9, FBN1, HSPG2). As primary osteoblasts differentiated and generated a mineralized matrix the number of differentially expressed proteins increased significantly, with 75 and 73 proteins significantly upregulated between vesicles isolated at weeks 2 and 3 (12 at week 2, 63 at week 3), and weeks 1 and 3 (26 at week 1, 47 at week 3), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>ii,iii).

Few changes in protein intensity were observed between weeks 1 and 2 (79% Pearson correlation). As such, we carried out gene ontology (GO) analysis using the PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system to identify differences in predicted biological function, molecular mechanism and cellular compartment of proteins upregulated at 3. Based on our stringent exclusion criteria, a total of 116 proteins were found to be upregulated or exclusive to vesicles isolated during the third week of osteogenic differentiation. Of these 116 proteins 56% were non-specifically upregulated relative to vesicles isolated at both week 1 and 2. GO analysis of biological process revealed overlapping functions in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion, with both processes particularly upregulated at week 3 when compared with week 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, proteins identified in sEVs at week 3 aligned with cartilage and skeletal system development. Again, these differences were particularly evident when compared with vesicles derived at week 2. Molecular mechanisms associated with these proteins correlated with the binding of lipids, calcium and glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). These proteins were predicted to localize within the extracellular matrix and a higher proportion of these proteins derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of proteins identified as being differentially upregulated in sEVs isolated during the third week of osteoblast differentiation relative to those isolated at weeks 1 (dashed line) and 2 (block color).

The outcomes of this study contribute further insight on how howthe morphology and biological content of these complex nanoparticles changes as mineralization advances (Xiao et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Morhayim et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This could have considerable implications relating to the prospective application of sEVs in regenerative medicine as well as the reproducibility of research findings between studies. In the present study we isolated sEVs from the culture media of mineralizing primary osteoblasts over a period of 21 days under chemically-defined conditions. We identified the presence of sEVs during early (week 1), mid (week 2), and late (week 3) matrix mineralization and noted a significant reduction in particle concentration at week 3. At each time point we observed a consistent bimodal size distribution indicative of a heterogeneous population of microvesicle-like (100&#8211;1000 nm), as well as exosome-like (30&#8211;150 nm) particles (Raposo and Stoorvogel, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As osteoblast differentiation advanced EVs became less polydisperse, with the presence of two distinct populations becoming more apparent. When visualized using TEM, morphological differences were evident between vesicles generated during early (week 1) and terminal (week 3) stages of osteoblast differentiation, with visual indications of compromised structural integrity evident during week 3. This is likely related to the progressive formation of mineral crystals previously shown to radially bud and perforate the vesicle membrane (Eanes, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Skrtic and Eanes, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). These growing crystals associate with the surrounding osteoid to form mineralized nodules that propagate along an external collagen template (Hasegawa et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Such findings align with observations reported in a model of rat tibial regeneration, where evidence of vesicle rupture was reported following 21 days, in line with proximity to the calcified front (Sela et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Deformation of these vesicles may also account for the significant reduction in particle number detected at week 3 and the distinct absence of particles over 330 nm in size, which may have ruptured (Amir et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). The absence of a visually distinctive plasma membrane is likely to be related to the commercial method of precipitation applied to isolate the vesicles (Martins et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to morphological variations in vesicle profiles, we were able to identify a correlation between total sEV protein number and osteoblast differentiation status, as indicated by a declining Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79 (week 1 vs. 2), 0.60 (week 2 vs. 3), and 0.46 (week 1 vs. 3). Gene ontology analysis highlighted the significant differences in protein expression at week 3 correlated with an enrichment in extracellular, vesicular and membrane-bound proteins with biological functions in extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis, and skeletal development. These results contribute evidence to demonstrate osteoblast sEVs are dynamic units that have temporally defined roles in matrix development. To date, relatively few studies have analyzed the sEV proteome. The first study to do so compared vesicles isolated from culture medium using ultracentrifugation with matrix vesicles embedded in the extracellular matrix. In this study the 544 proteins were identified in sEVs isolated from immortalized mineralizing MC3T3-E1 cells, whereas the present study documented only 249 common proteins among sEVs isolated over a period of 3 weeks. However, a number of common extracellular matrix proteins (Emilin-1, MMP-2, Periostin, Thrombospondins, and Decorin), enzymes (Aminopeptidase-N, superoxide dismutase and Cathepsin proteins) and membrane proteins (Integrins &#945;V and &#946;3) are common to sEVs isolated in both studies. Further correlation exists in the presence of cytoskeletal (&#945;-actinin-1 and&#8722;4, Vinculin and Gelsolin), signaling (GTP-binding proteins, 14-3-3 proteins and Rab family proteins) and calcium regulating (Annexin and S100 proteins) proteins (Xiao et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The second study applied ultracentrifugation to isolate sEVs from the culture medium of mineralizing human SV-HFO fetal pre-osteoblast cells and, to our knowledge, is the only other study to have profiled sEVs over the course of mineralization (Morhayim et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Morhayim et al. identified a total of 1116 proteins, a number of which represented osteoblast-related proteins linked to skeletal development, differentiation and calcium ion binding. These included a number (30%) of osteoblast-EV specific proteins, which were not observed in our own study. Variations observed in total protein content observed between studies are likely manifold, with differences in cell type and sEV isolation procedure and time of isolation being perhaps most significant. However, the robustness of our approach is demonstrated by the identification of common annexin (ANXA2, ANXA6), tetraspanin (CD81) and metabolic (GAPDH, LDHA) vesicle markers (Morhayim et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Further, EVs isolated in the present study contained 60% of the most 100 most prevalent EV proteins as published by Vesiclepedia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microvesicles.org/extracellular_vesicle_markers">http://microvesicles.org/extracellular_vesicle_markers</ext-link>). Perhaps most interestingly, in line with the findings of Morhayim et al. we provide evidence through gene ontology analysis to indicate that bone-related processes are one of several primary functions of sEVs.</p><p>In addition to the protein signature of sEVs,time dependent changes in the lipid profile have been previously demonstrated. These findings were described in a rodent model of endosteal repair, where variations in phospholipids, including phosphotidylcholine (PC), phosphotidylserine (PS) and sphingosine were found to correlate with the stage of regeneration (Schwartz et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Since the organization of phospholipids within the EV membrane is critical for driving mineral formation via the NCC, variations in content will inevitably influence protein interactions that could impact the nucleational capacity of vesicles and their association with the extracellular matrix. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet profiled changes in the protein content of osteoblast-derived vesicles during the course of mineralization. Central to the NCC is the annexin family of calcium regulated phospholipid-binding proteins, which localize to the vesicle lumen, outer surface and inner leaflet. Members of the annexin family are proposed to associate with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and PS to configure an optimal environment for the nucleation of mineral crystals. It is hypothesized that this interaction drives the transition of amorphous calcium phosphate through a series of intermediate phases to generate thermodynamically stable hydroxyapatite crystals (Anderson, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). However, annexin proteins are also likely to have additional roles in the binding and channeling of calcium ions. We have previously shown that annexin proteins I, II and VI are significantly upregulated in mineralizing sEVs derived from the culture medium of mineralizing osteoblasts (Davies et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The pro-osteogenic effects of these proteins has been further demonstrated in synthetic models of the NCC, where the incorporation of Annexin-A5 promoted a significant increase the rate and total amount of mineral formed when incubated with synthetic cartilage lymph (Genge et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In the present study we provide evidence to indicate a temporal relationship between the profile of annexins and the osteoblast maturity, with annexin-A2, -A5 and -A6 significantly upregulated in sEVs during the third week of osteoblast differentiation, where significant mineralization was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Such variation in proteins either directly or indirectly associated with the NCC will have implications when considering the potential application of osteoblast-derived vesicles for regenerative applications, where it will be therapeutically advantageous to select for the most osteo-inductively potent particles (Bj&#248;rge et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>Temporal differences in annexin proteins also reflect biochemical changes in the composition of the developing ECM indicative of maturation that are, at least in part, related to collagen composition. It has been proposed the collagen-interacting properties of vesicles may function to align them within the matrix and provide a template for mineralization (Bottini et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For instance, Annexin A2 mediates the secretion of collagen type-VI (Dassah et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which functions by bridging cells with the surrounding connective tissue and organizing the three-dimensional architecture of bone (Cescon et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the present study we show that type-VI collagen was significantly upregulated in sEVs during the third week of mineralization <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus supporting findings by Lamand&#233; et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) demonstrating the formation of stable collagen-VI helices by a SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line occurs later in the differentiation pathway (Lamand&#233; et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Additional collagen subtypes, including type-I collagen were found to be associated with vesicles but did not vary over the course of mineralization. Annexin A2 and A6, which were also found to be upregulated at week 3, are known to interact with chondroitin sulfate, a structural component of cartilage and an important mediator in bone regeneration, in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (Ishitsuka et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Takagi et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). While the interaction between annexin A6 and protein kinase C &#945; has been shown to mediate terminal differentiation and mineralization events of hypertrophic chondrocytes by channeling the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (Minashima et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As such, temporal variations observed in annexins and their defined interactions with collagens, which are fundamental to the development of the mineralizing ECM, implicate sEVs as mediators of changes in the ECM required for the transition between hypertrophic cartilage and endochondral bone.</p><p>In addition to specific interactions with collagenous and non-collagenous components of the ECM, vesicles function in the transportation of collagens and matrix proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum into the extracellular environment. This is achieved through coupling with coat protein carriers, which include COPII carriers such as Sec23a (Malhotra and Erlmann, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the present study, the inner coat protein Sec23a was found to be upregulated in vesicles during the third week of mineralization, correlating with an enhanced presence of collagen type-VI. Furthermore, COPII vesicles utilized for the translocation of collagens into the ECM are typically under 100 nm, which correlates with the smaller subpopulation of particles identified in the present study (Weeks 1 and 2, 44 nm; Week 3, 54 nm &#8211; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although we are aware that further investigation will be required to delineate the mechanisms by which sEVs deliver collagen subunits to drive development of the ECM, we believe that our initial findings are of important biological relevance and propose that osteoblasts secrete distinct vesicle subsets with discrete roles during osteogenesis. In addition to collagens, profiling vesicles over the course of a three-week differentiation period revealed the presence of additional proteins known to be localized within the endoplasmic reticulum, including reticulocalbin, calumenin, reticulocalbin-3, endoplasmin, and translational endoplasmic reticulum ATPase. These findings provide further support to the theory that at least a subset of osteoblast-derived vesicles derive from the trans-Golgi network and are trafficked to the plasma membrane via interaction with members of the Rab family of small GTPases where they fuse and are released into the extracellular environment (Stenbeck and Coxon, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, the contribution of ER-associated vesicles appears to be dependent on the differentiation status of the osteoblast, with proteins such as reticulocalbin, endoplasmin and calumenin largely down-regulated during the third week of mineralization.</p><p>Further to the capacity of Annexin A2 to mediate the secretion of collagen type-VI, this calcium-binding protein also interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor sclerostin, which has led to the suggestion that this protein may function in the regulation of osteogenesis (Devarajan-Ketha et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins is critical for regulating bone homeostasis through &#946;-catenin-dependent canonical and &#946;-catenin independent non-canonical pathways. In the present study we identified the presence of Wnt5a and the Wnt-1-inducible signaling pathway protein (WISP-2) in sEVs and documented significant upregulation during the third week of mineralization (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), when a calcified ECM was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). WISP-2 has previously been shown to promote cell adhesion and differentiation depending on whether it is secreted or localized within the cytoplasm (Gr&#252;nberg et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the precise function of this protein in bone tissue is far less well-understood than its sister protein, WISP-1, which has well-documented roles in osteogenic differentiation and bone repair (Maiese, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Wnt5a functions in the regulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling with a well-established role in coordinating osteoclastogenesis through receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2)/ c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling (Hasegawa et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The Wnt5a ligand has also been implicated in the onset of pathological vascular calcification via its interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (Woldt et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Homozygous deletion of Wnt5a has been shown to reduce the expression of critical pro-osteogenic genes such as ALP, osterix and osteocalcin, as well as the formation of mineralized nodules (Okamoto et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previous research has identified vesicles as vehicles for the systemic delivery of hydrophobic Wnt proteins in a diverse range of cell types including human umbilical cord MSCs (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), cortical neurons (Tassew et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and macrophages (Menck et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have acknowledged the presence of these critical homeostatic proteins in sEVs. As such, we present initial findings to suggest that sEVs may function in the activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling required for osteoclastogenesis and the maintenance of bone homeostasis. However, additional studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Findings from the present study demonstrate that the secretion of osteoblast vesicles is a dynamic and temporal process, which is dependent on the mineralization status of the ECM. sEVs contained many proteins implicated in the nucleation and propagation of mineral in developing hard tissues and shared common morphological and biological features reported for matrix-bound vesicles. The localization of osteogenic signaling proteins and postulated components of the NCC increased as mineralization advanced. Of significance was the upregulation of annexin family members and Wnt signaling proteins in sEVs generated during week 3, since these proteins have defined roles in osteogenesis. Our findings shed light on fundamental mechanisms governing vesicle-mediated mineralization, identifying it as a dynamic process whereby progressive variations in sEV morphology and protein content mirror developmental changes matrix organization. Findings also have implications when considering the selection and application of osteoblast-derived sEVs in regenerative medicine and further studies will be required to determine the pro-osteogenic properties of temporally isolated sEV fractions when administered <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the University of Birmingham UK Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 16/SS/0172).
