The role of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) in HCC remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of OTC in HCC was analyzed based on datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and further confirmed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays on clinical samples and cell lines. Furthermore, the associations between OTC expression and clinicopathological parameters as well as clinical outcome, including the overall and disease-free survival rates were analyzed. Finally, the effect of OTC on HCC cells was measured using proliferation, bromodeoxyuridine and colony-formation assays. Lower OTC expression was observed in HCC cells and tissues compared with primary human hepatocytes. Further investigation demonstrated that low expression of OTC in HCC was associated with larger tumor size and advanced grade. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with lower levels of OTC exhibited shorter overall and disease-free survival times. Notably, OTC silencing with RNA interference facilitated cell proliferation in HCC SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 cells. However, overexpression of OTC led to inhibition of cell proliferation. In conclusion, the present study identified a novel role of OTC in HCC development, providing a potential novel therapeutic target for this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>ornithine transcarbamylase</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70&#8211;90% of primary liver cancer, as estimated in 2012 (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), with &gt;500,000 patients worldwide being diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, as estimated in 2011 (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Liver cancer has been predicted to be the sixth most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide in 2018, with ~841,000 new cases and 782,000 cases of cancer-associated mortality annually (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Apart from surgery, multiple treatment options are available for HCC treatment, including resection, ablation, transplantation, chemoembolization and systemic targeted agents, such as sorafenib (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, cancer recurrence and early metastasis remain major obstacles in clinical treatment (<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms in HCC is required.</p><p>Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is a liver and intestinal mucosa-located, intramitochondrial, rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle. It catalyzes the reaction that converts ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate into citrulline, which is the second step of the urea cycle, to detoxify the ammonia produced from amino acid catabolism (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Defects in the urea cycle can lead to high blood ammonia concentration, which can cause several physiological disorders, including anorexia, cerebral edema, coma, seizure, delayed growth and development, intellectual disabilities and even loss of life (<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several studies have suggested that accumulated ammonia resulting from OTC deficiency causes chronic liver damage, which is a potential risk factor of HCC (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, increased liver fibrosis in OTC-knockout Het mice compared with their wild-type littermates has been confirmed (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, studies on the effect of OTC in HCC are limited.</p><p>The present study aimed to identify whether OTC serves a role in HCC progression, and to investigate its biological function. The present study revealed that OTC downregulation is a characteristic molecular alteration and a reliable prognostic factor for the survival of patients with HCC. Notably, the present study demonstrated anti-growth effects of OTC in HCC cells for the first time. The present study suggested that OTC may be investigated as a novel HCC therapeutic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting OTC (siOTC-1 and siOTC-2) and negative control (siCont) were purchased from Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd.

Of these patients, 36 (85.7%) were male and six (14.4%) were female. Patient ages ranged between 22 and 77 years (56.88&#177;13.404 years). A total of 10 parameters that may be prognostic in HCC were assessed by statistical analyses and summarized in <xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>.

Following surgical resection, tumor diameter was measured and the samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. Relevant clinical data were collected retrospectively. Additionally, paraffin-embedded sections of 15 paired samples from patients with HCC, which were not included in the aforementioned group of patients, were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis from the Pathology Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University. Of the 15 patients, 10 (66.7%) were male and 5 (33.3%) were female. Patient ages ranged between 39 and 73 years (mean &#177; standard deviation, 62.67&#177;9.401 years).

Thermocycling conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 95&#176;C for 2 min, and 20 sec denaturing at 94&#176;C, 20 sec annealing at 60&#176;C and 20 sec extension at 72&#176;C for 35 cycles, followed by 0.5&#176;C every 5 sec from 65 to 95&#176;C for melting curve analysis. FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used.

Protein quantification was conducted using the BCA assay (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Total proteins (30 &#181;g/lane) were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with OTC primary antibody (1:1,000 dilution) or GAPDH (1:5,000 dilution) primary antibody at 4&#176;C overnight. They were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:3,000 dilution; cat. no.

Sections (5-&#181;m) of 15 paired samples from patients with HCC were obtained from the Pathology Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University. The tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated through an ethanol gradient into water and microwave-heated in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the sections were then incubated with 10% normal goat nonimmune serum (Fuzhou Maixin Biotech Co., Ltd., Fuzhou, China) for 30 min at room temperature to block the nonspecific antibody binding. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with OTC antibody at a 1:50 dilution at 4&#176;C overnight. The following day, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (undiluted; cat. no. KIT-9710; Fuzhou Maixin Biotech Co., Ltd.) and combined with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. DAB staining was used for detecting immunoreactivity (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin for 2 min at room temperature. Negative control sections were prepared without primary antibody to determine the specificity of the staining. The scoring of OTC was carried out by two independent pathologists using a light microscope, according to the proportion of tumor cells with positive staining (negative, none; weak, &lt;10%; moderate, 10&#8211;50%; strong, &gt;50%), as previously described (<xref rid="b17-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). No and weak staining were defined as OTC negative, and moderate and strong staining were defined as OTC positive.

The results revealed a significantly decreased OTC expression in the HCC tumor specimens compared with that in the non-tumor samples (P&lt;0.0001; <xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To verify the downregulation of OTC in HCC, its expression in PHHs, immortalized MIHA hepatocytes and liver cancer cells (Huh-7, HepG2, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5 and SK-Hep-1) was determined using RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The RT-qPCR analysis revealed that OTC mRNA expression was significantly lower in the liver cancer cells compared with that in PHHs (<xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, the OTC protein levels were lower in the liver cancer cell lines compared with those in PHHs, as detected by western blotting (<xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similar to HCC cells, MIHA cells exhibited lower OTC expression compared with PHH cells. As numerous genes identified to be dysregulated were associated with cell immortalization and transformation (<xref rid="b18-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), it is possible that immortalization contributed to the downregulation of OTC in MIHA cells.</p><p>Subsequently, OTC protein expression was investigated in 15 HCC tissue samples obtained from the Pathology Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University and their respective adjacent non-tumor liver samples via IHC (<xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The findings revealed that, in the 15 cases examined, all the adjacent non-tumor liver tissues exhibited positive (strong or moderate) OTC expression. However, positive expression was detected in only 4 of the 15 HCC tissues (26.7%) (<xref rid="SD1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table SI</xref>). The levels of OTC were further examined in 42 pairs of clinical HCC specimens by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results indicated that OTC mRNA was downregulated on average in the HCC tissues compared with their adjacent non-tumor samples (P=0.0006; <xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Western blot analysis indicated that 30/42 HCC tissues (71.4%) exhibited lower OTC expression compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Of these 30 HCC tissues, 14 exhibited undetectable OTC protein expression. The average OTC protein level in the 42 HCC tissues was significantly lower compared with the average OTC protein level in the 42 adjacent non-tumor samples, as semi-quantified by ImageJ software. (P=0.0404; <xref rid="f1-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F and G</xref>). Taken together, the present results suggest that OTC expression is suppressed in HCC tissues and cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The association between OTC expression and clinicopathological parameters</title><p>The association between OTC expression and the clinicopathological features of the patients with HCC was examined in the 42 cases included in this study. The patients were classified into two groups based on the OTC protein level (cases where the protein level in the tumor tissue relative to the adjacent non-tumor tissue sample was &lt;1.0 were classified as low-expression; the rest were classified as high-expression). The findings revealed low expression in 30 of the 42 cases (71.4%) and high expression in 12 cases (28.6%) (<xref rid="tI-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). Pearson's &#967;<sup>2</sup> test revealed that lower tumor OTC levels were associated with a larger tumor size (P=0.01) and higher grade (P=0.02). No significant association was observed between OTC levels and patient age or sex, or other clinical parameters, including cirrhosis, vascular invasion, multiple tumors and the serological predictor of liver damage, alanine aminotransferase. In addition, the tumor OTC levels were evaluated according to the tumor stage in data obtained from the TCGA database (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http//gdc.cancer.gov/">http//gdc.cancer.gov/</uri>). As demonstrated in <xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, the OTC mRNA levels in patients with early stage tumors (stage I) was higher than those with stage II (P=0.0029) or III (P=0.0002) tumors. To further confirm that low OTC levels indicate poor HCC prognosis, the 5-year overall survival times of 373 HCC cases and disease-free survival times of 313 cases from TCGA database were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with low OTC expression exhibited significantly shorter disease-free survival (P=0.0044; <xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) and 5-year overall survival rates (P=0.0197; <xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) compared with those with high expression. Together, these results demonstrate that low OTC levels are associated with tumor progression and poor survival rates, making this factor a potential novel biomarker for patients with HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>OTC overexpression inhibits HCC cell proliferation</title><p>To explore the functional role of OTC in HCC, OTC was overexpressed in Huh-7 and SK-Hep-1 cells by transient transfection and verified by western blotting (<xref rid="f3-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The effects of OTC overexpression on the cells were assessed by cell proliferation and colony-formation assays. The upregulation of OTC significantly decreased the proliferation rates of Huh-7 and SK-Hep-1 cells (<xref rid="f3-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, decreased numbers and sizes of SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 cell colonies were observed in the OTC overexpression groups compared with the control groups, which were transfected with vector plasmid (<xref rid="f3-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Finally, OTC overexpression led to an inhibition of DNA synthesis, as revealed by EdU staining (<xref rid="f3-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E and F</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that OTC overexpression serves an inhibitory role in cell proliferation and colony-formation in HCC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>OTC silencing facilitates HCC cell proliferation</title><p>To further evaluate the biological effects of OTC on HCC cells, an RNA interference experiment was performed on Huh-7 and SK-Hep-1 cells. Targeting siRNAs (siOTC-1 and siOTC-2) suppressed OTC expression, as determined by western blotting (<xref rid="f4-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). OTC downregulation significantly enhanced cell proliferation in the two cell lines (<xref rid="f4-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and C</xref>), and resulted in enhanced colony-formation ability (<xref rid="f4-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). In addition, elevated DNA synthesis was observed in OTC-knockdown cells (<xref rid="f4-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E and F</xref>). Together, these data support that OTC downregulation promotes HCC cell proliferation and colony formation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>OTC, a key enzyme in the urea cycle, has been well documented in ammonia metabolism (<xref rid="b20-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, few studies have focused on the role of OTC in HCC. A previous study demonstrated that OTC deficiency could increase the risk of developing HCC, suggesting that OTC may be associated with HCC progression. Another study revealed that OTC depletion could increase the probability of liver fibrosis in a mouse model, and since ~90% of HCC develops from liver fibrosis, this suggests that OTC is indirectly linked to HCC progression (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, direct evidence on the role of OTC in HCC progression is lacking. In the present study, the functional role of OTC in HCC was investigated. Based on the database analyses, OTC expression levels were revealed to be downregulated in HCC. This was further verified in liver cancer cell lines and 42 paired clinical HCC tissue samples. In agreement with the present findings, Liu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b21-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) noticed that OTC mRNA levels are downregulated in HCC Huh-7 and LH86 cell lines. To further elucidate the role of OTC in HCC, associations between OTC expression and the clinicopathological features of the patients were investigated. The results demonstrated that low OTC expression was associated with larger tumor size and advanced grade. Furthermore, low tumor OTC expression indicated poor prognosis for patients with HCC.</p><p>The enzyme activity of OTC is inhibited by acetylation at lysine 88, highlighting the important role of a deacetylase in the regulation of its function (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, the mitochondrial NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) has been identified as a regulator of OTC deacetylation (<xref rid="b22-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Notably, a previous study determined that SIRT3 is downregulated in HCC cells, possibly protecting them from apoptosis (<xref rid="b23-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Combined with the present observations that OTC functions as a tumor suppressor, it was hypothesized that the acetylation of OTC in HCC cells is increased by the downregulation of SIRT3, leading to the suppression of its activity. This may explain the finding that OTC RNA interference promoted cell proliferation, whereas overexpression had the opposite effect in the present study.</p><p>It is worth noting that decreased OTC levels may impair the normal urea cycle, resulting in the accumulation of ammonia and a hyperammonemic state. High concentrations of ammonia in cells are toxic and induce cell apoptosis (<xref rid="b24-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b27-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This is contradictory to the observation that low OTC promoted HCC cell proliferation. In the present study, no clinical symptoms of hyperammonemia nor marked elevations of blood ammonia levels were observed in the patients with HCC. As glutamine metabolism is the main source of ammonia, it is hypothesized that HCC cells may utilize glutamine mainly through the transamination pathway without resulting in ammonia production. This non-canonical pathway of glutamine utilization is also observed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, and it is required for tumor growth (<xref rid="b28-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The implicated interactions between the transamination and amino acid metabolism pathways in HCC cells may be involved in the development of HCC mediated by downregulated OTC. Additionally, studies have reported that OTC may influence liver regeneration though participating in certain unidentified signaling pathways, independent of its known enzyme activity (<xref rid="b29-ol-0-0-10174" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Further investigations are required to explain whether the effect of OTC on HCC cells relies on the protein itself or its catalytic properties and possible targets.</p><p>In summary, the present study revealed a new function of OTC in HCC tumorigenesis and progression. The decreased OTC levels may contribute to the HCC development of this disease, making it a potential target for therapy. Further studies are required to uncover the underlying mechanism involving OTC in the inhibition of HCC development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ol-0-0-10174"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_Data.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e499" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81672012 to JC), the Chongqing Natural Science Foundation (grant no. cstc2016jcyjA0183 to JC) and the Scientific Research Project of Graduate Students of Chongqing Medical University (grant no.
