Afterwards, GM petunia plants have also been detected in other EU countries. Regarding the environment as well as the food and feed chain, GM petunia plants have been assessed by experts as representing a negligible risk. However, the presence of GM petunia plants on the European (EU) market is considered as illegal because no authorization has been delivered by the EU competent authorities regarding their cultivation and commercialization. Consequently, all GM petunia plants identified on the EU market have to be discarded and destroyed. However, given that no registration of commercial names for petunia varieties is currently mandatory, the potential identification of GM petunia events based on commercial names is complicated by the fact that a single petunia variety may have several different commercial names and <italic>vice versa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To screen the potential presence of GM organisms (GMO) in the food and feed chain, the enforcement laboratories are usually using real-time PCR methods targeting transgenic elements commonly found in GMO. Subsequently, GM events are identified using the corresponding real-time PCR event-specific method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the context of GM petunia, the same screening strategy can be employed in targeting transgenic elements previously used in the generation of GM petunia, such as p35S (Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter), t35S (CaMV 35S terminator), pNOS (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> nopaline synthase promoter), tNOS (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> nopaline synthase terminator), nptII (neomycin phosphotransferase II gene) and tOCS (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> octopine synthase terminator). In addition, GM petunia plants harboring the maize <italic>A1</italic> gene (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), allowing to modify the flower pigmentation, have previously been reported. Therefore, a screening marker targeting this maize <italic>A1</italic> gene can also be interesting to be used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Although it is necessary for the identification as well as to trace the origin, no real-time PCR construct-specific method and event-specific method is available for GM petunia. Moreover, the development of real-time PCR construct-specific and event-specific methods requires first of all an access to their genome or at least to crucial sequences such as their transgene flanking regions and unnatural associations of elements from their transgenic cassette(s). Moreover, given that the GM petunia plants may have different origins of transformation, more than one method could be necessary to develop.</p><p id="Par4">With the aim to get the sequences of interests corresponding to transgene flanking regions and unnatural associations of transgenic elements, we have applied on petunia samples an integrated strategy previously developed to detect and demonstrate the presence of unauthorized GMO in the food and feed chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This strategy consists of two main successive steps. First, the presence of GMO is detected through a real-time PCR screening targeting key transgenic elements potentially commonly found in GMO, especially in GM petunia. Second, a PCR-based DNA walking method anchored on earlier detected key transgenic elements is applied bi-directionally to obtain information about the sequences flanking the known transgenic elements via the sequencing of the resulting PCR products using a long-length Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, which was in this study the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. In order to detect and trace GM petunia plants, the proposed integrated strategy has thus been in this study applied on several petunia plants commercialized on the EU market.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par5">Several petunia plants commercialized on the EU market were collected in Hungary and the Czech Republic (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). First, the petunia samples were screened for the potential presence of GM petunia by real-time PCR screening using markers targeting elements that are either commonly found in GMO (p35S, pNOS, tNOS, Cry1Ab/Ac and t35S) or only present in EU unauthorized GMO (t35S pCAMBIA). The screening marker targeting the maize <italic>A1</italic> gene, was also integrated in the analysis given its reported presence in GM petunia plants. An additional category of screening markers specific to the <italic>Cauliflower Mosaic Virus</italic> (CaMV) (CAP and CRT2) was used to discard false positive signals coming from transgenic sequences derived from CaMV, such as p35S (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As expected, the wild-type (WT) petunia plants (samples n&#176;19&#8211;20) were negative for all tested screening markers. All other samples (n&#176;1&#8211;18 and n&#176;21&#8211;23) presented a similar pattern of real-time PCR amplification.

All the generated PCR products presented a size range going approximately from 100 to 1500&#8201;bp. The obtained PCR products of each petunia sample were pooled and barcoded to be then sequenced using the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Among the generated DNA fragments from each tested petunia sample, the ones related to the DNA walking p35S-R method were all characterized by a sequence successively corresponding to the p35S element [GenBank: MF521566.1; AY615305.1] followed by an uncharacterized vector sequence [GenBank: MF521566.1] and the maize <italic>A1</italic> gene [GenBank: MF521566.1; NM_001158995.2]. This association of sequences was previously mentioned as being used to produce GM petunia presenting a novel flower pigmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Regarding the sequences of the DNA fragments produced with the DNA walking p35S-F method, the p35S element [GenBank: KY964325.1] was followed by an uncharacterized vector sequence [GenBank: KY964325.1] and the beta-lactamase (<italic>bla</italic>) gene [GenBank: KY964325.1; KT405500.1], conferring a resistance to ampicillin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Files&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The identification of these unnatural associations of elements allows confirming that these petunia plants were actually GM. These results suggest also that there is the possibility that the same transgenic cassette may have been used in all the GM petunia tested in this study. Moreover, these sequences could be useful to develop a construct-specific method.

The confirmation of this transgene flanking region was obtained by PCR amplifications followed by Sanger sequencing using two primers, one designed on the petunia sequence and one designed on the <italic>bla</italic> gene (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Due to the sequence similarity between the p35S and <italic>bla</italic> elements for all tested GM petunia samples (Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), this analysis was also applied on GM petunia samples presenting shorter sequences characterizing only the transgenic cassette (n&#176;4, n&#176;6, n&#176;10 and n&#176;15) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). All these GM petunia samples presented a PCR amplicon with the expected size (402&#8201;bp) and with the same transgene flanking region (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The identical insertion site of these samples suggests a similar origin of GM event transformation.</p><p id="Par9">In order to collect additional information related to the petunia sequence interrupted by the inserted transgenic cassette, further analysis were performed. This petunia sequence presented a similarity (77%) with a transposon (GenBank: RVW93168.1) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The insertion of the transgenic cassette expressing the maize <italic>A1</italic> gene on a transposable element, well-known to be able to influence gene expression, could explain the flower color variations observed among the tested GM petunia plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, further analysis are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par10">Regarding the transgenic cassette of all tested GM petunia samples, the GM petunia described in Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 1987 represents a possible origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This hypothesis is based on the similarity of the unnatural association of elements (<italic>bla</italic>, p35S and <italic>A1</italic> gene) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Files&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) as well as to the presence and absence of transgenic elements determined using the real-time PCR screening (positive for p35S, pNOS and t35S and negative for tNOS) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, the analysis of the GM petunia material published by Meyer <italic>et al</italic>., 1987 and its comparison to the GM petunia plants tested in this study are needed to confirm this hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">At the technical level, the used MinION platform from the Oxford Nanopore technologies presents the advantage to be able to deal with heterogenic DNA libraries, to provide data in real-time of long read-lengths and to be easily available in-house due to the small size and portability of the device and the attractive price. Moreover, this high-throughput technology allows to sequence several samples simultaneously. In contrast to the Sanger sequencing platform, the use of a NGS platform, such as the MinION device, for the sequencing of DNA libraries generated through the proposed PCR-based DNA walking methods allows also to reduce the laborious aspect of the experimental procedure. More precisely, as each DNA walking PCR product presents in general several amplicons, an individual purification of each of these amplicons from an electrophoresis gel is required for their subsequent sequencing using the Sanger technology while the entire PCR product can directly be sequenced using the MinION device. However, according to previous studies, this NGS technology presents a relatively high error rate of generated raw data (~10&#8211;20%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the present study, despite the high similarity between the sequences of the transgene flanking region generated by the MinION and Sanger platforms, the error rate was varying approximately between 1 to 22% (Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Nevertheless, in contrast to a single mutation point, the detection of transgenic cassettes and transgene flanking regions from GMO as well as the determination of the transformation origin were still possible with such a kind of error rate. These generated sequences could also be used to develop real-time PCR construct-specific and event-specific methods in order to be used in GMO routine analysis by the enforcement laboratories for the survey of GM petunia plants on the market. For such purpose, the use of sequences confirmed by the Sanger sequencing technology, presenting a lower error rate than the MinION platform, is strongly advised for the oligonucleotide design of these real-time PCR construct-specific and event-specific methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par12">The proposed integrated strategy, combining a PCR-based DNA walking, anchored on earlier detected key transgenic elements, with the MinION sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, was successfully applied on several suspected GM petunia samples circulating on the EU market. Their presence was demonstrated by the characterization of their transgene flanking regions as well as unnatural associations of elements from their transgenic cassette. Moreover, the high similarity between the transgene flanking region from all tested GM petunia samples strongly suggests their common origin of transformation although these GM petunia samples had different commercial names. Given that the tested GM petunia plants were also presenting some flower color variations among themselves (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), any petunia plants could be relevant for such investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, with the aim to increase the characterization of sequences of interest, additional DNA walking methods anchored on other transgenic elements observed in GM petunia, such as <italic>bar</italic>, pNOS and t35S, could be useful to develop.</p><p id="Par13">Regarding the choice of the NGS platform, the MinION device allowed in-house generation of a long-read sequencing data for several samples simultaneously in a short-time frame (maximum 48&#8201;hours), which is highly interesting because such time-frame is compatible with the workflow of enforcement laboratories. However, the bioinformatics analysis still required a certain level of expertise necessary to be developed in enforcement laboratories. Moreover, given its relative high-error rate, the re-sequencing of fragments of interest using for instance the Sanger technology is advised for further applications, such as the development of real-time PCR construct-specific and event-specific methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Plant materials, DNA extraction, DNA concentration and DNA purity</title><p id="Par14">Twenty-three petunia samples were collected from the Hungarian (samples n&#176;1&#8211;20) and Czech Republic (samples n&#176;21&#8211;23) markets (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Briefly, a target-specific primer (a) and one kind of the degenerated random tagging primer (DRT) mixes (A-D) were first used to amplify the sequences of interest. In a second and third semi-nested PCR, target-specific primers (b and c) were sequentially combined with universal tagging primers, UAP-N1 and UAP-N2 respectively, in order to increase the yield of the sequences of interest and to decrease the background. For each petunia sample (n&#176;1&#8211;18 and n&#176;21&#8211;23) presenting earlier a positive signal in real-time PCR for the p35S marker, 100&#8201;ng of DNA were tested using the bidirectional DNA walking method anchored on p35S.

The concentration of each purified pool was measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits by the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. For each purified pool, a sequencing library was prepared from 1&#8201;&#181;g of DNA using the 1D amplicon by ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and the 1D Native barcoding kit (EXP-NBD103; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. More precisely, each purified pool was initially end-repaired and dA-tailed to be subsequently ligated individually to a unique barcode. All these barcoded samples were then pooled to be ligated to adapters in order to constitute the sequencing library. As only 12 different barcodes were available, two sequencing libraries were prepared, one for the samples n&#176;1&#8211;11 and one for the samples n&#176;12&#8211;18 and n&#176;21&#8211;23 (Supplementary File&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Finally, each sequencing library was loaded into an individual MinION flow cell of the MinION sequencing device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) to be sequenced for 48&#8201;hours. The basecalling of the generated raw data (fast5 format) was performed using Albacore (version 2.0.1). The demultiplexing of the different petunia samples, individually barcoded with a unique barcode during the library preparation, was automatically carried out during this step. The individual fastq files were extracted from the base-called fastq5 files with poretools (version 0.6.0).
