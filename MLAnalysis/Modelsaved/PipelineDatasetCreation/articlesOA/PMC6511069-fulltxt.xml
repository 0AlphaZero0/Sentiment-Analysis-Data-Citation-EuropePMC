<italic>Pavo cristatus</italic>, commonly known as the Indian blue peafowl, is native to South Asia. Apart from the wild, they are usually found as park and zoo exhibits or are raised for breeding and conservation purposes [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). Peafowl have been widely featured in ancient Indian literature [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and are closely associated with the life and culture of Southeast Asia, symbolizing beauty, love, grace, and pride [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For these reasons, the peafowl&#8212;specifically the peacock&#8212;was chosen to be the national bird of India in 1963.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Photograph of the Indian blue peacock (<italic>P. cristatus</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="giz038fig1"/></fig><p>Genome sequencing of the avian model organism <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (the red junglefowl, or chicken) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and other avian species [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has provided novel perspectives on vertebrate genome evolution, such as a better understanding of genome structure and annotating the mammalian genome. Genome studies of <italic>G. gallus</italic> have revealed high conservation within orthologous regions of the human genome [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thus showing promise as a good candidate for studies on developmental biology, immunology, and vertebrate genome architecture [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite a wealth of information from existing avian genome-sequencing projects, it remains important to sequence the genomes of other species to add value to avian and vertebrate genomics. Here, we use Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT) to sequence a bird genome for the first time. The long reads generated from this sequencing technology were helpful during the de novo assembly of this genome, especially in the guanine-cytosine&#8211;rich repeat regions, which invariably pose serious challenges. By comparing this genome with those of other birds, we will understand more about the uniqueness of the peacock genome; the development of this species, its complex plumage pigmentation, and sexual dimorphism; and its evolutionary relationships with other birds. Characterization of genes and their specific functions will facilitate better understanding of the peafowl species. By comparing proteins between the peacock, chicken, and <italic>Meleagris gallopavo</italic> (domestic turkey), conserved domains and functional annotations may be revealed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample collection and extraction of DNA</title><p>A blood sample was collected from an Indian male peacock (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) at Kanpur Zoo, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India, after the necessary ethical and institutional approvals were obtained.</p><p>DNA from blood was prepared for sequencing as follows: first, 200 &#181;l of blood was added to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing &#8764;20 &#181;l of proteinase K solution, and briefly mixed. Cell lysis buffer (200 &#181;l) was added to the tube, which was mixed by vortexing for 10 seconds, then incubated at 56&#176;C for 10 minutes. Then, 250 &#181;l of binding buffer (BBA) was added to the tube, which was mixed by vortexing again for 10 seconds. The contents of the tube were added to a ReliaPrep (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) binding column, which had been placed into an empty collection tube, then capped and placed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The binding column and tube were then centrifuged for 1 minute at 12,000 rpm and flow-through was discarded.

The final PCR product (sequencing library) was purified with HighPrep beads, followed by a library quality control check. The Illumina-compatible sequencing library was initially quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and fragment size distribution was analyzed on an Agilent TapeStation. Finally, the sequencing library was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA).

Approximately 4 &#181;g of genomic DNA was simultaneously fragmented and tagged with mate-pair adapters in a transposon-based tagmentation step. Tagmented DNA was then purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA), followed by strand displacement to fill gaps in the tagmented DNA. Strand-displaced DNA was further purified with AMPure XP beads before size-selecting fragments of 3&#8211;5, 5&#8211;7, and 7&#8211;10 kilobase pairs (kb) on low-melting agarose gel. The fragments were circularized in an overnight blunt-end intra-molecular ligation step, which resulted in circularization of DNA with the insert mate-pair adapter junction. Circularized DNA was sheared using a Covaris S220 sonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) to generate approximate fragment sizes of 300&#8211;1000 bp. The sheared DNA was purified to collect the mate-pair junction-positive fragments using Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified fragments were end-repaired, adenylated, and ligated to Illumina multiplex barcode adaptors, in accordance with the NextEra Mate Pair Sample Preparation Kit protocol.</p><p>The adapter-ligated DNA was then amplified for 15 cycles of PCR using Illumina-compatible primers.

This surge has largely been driven by a more affordable cost per base sequencing, and the development of smarter algorithms that have been refined and equipped to handle large datasets [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42&#8211;44</xref>]. The challenge for newer genome analysis pipelines is to generate assemblies with lower contig numbers and longer contigs per genome. To achieve this, technologies that generate longer reads or greater read depths are very helpful [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but the use of combinations of different sequencing technologies also plays a significant role in improving genome assemblies [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (Table S10). Libraries generated using &gt;1 type of chemistry have been found to generate superior assemblies [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and have been shown to reduce the number of scaffolds&#8212;even with very low coverage. Thus, we need to consider combinations of sequencing technologies, along with the use of different bioinformatics software programs, to obtain assemblies with fewer scaffolds, or which are closer to chromosome-level sequencing [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Compared with other avian genomes [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the sequencing depth of 290&#215; that we achieved for the peacock is one of the highest. The final draft peacock genome assembly resulted in an N50 of 0.23 Mb. Including 2.3&#215; of reads generated by ONT helped to improve the assembly by reducing the number of scaffolds by 26.2% and increasing the scaffold and contig N50s by &#8764;50.7% and 115%, respectively.</p><p>The draft assembly contained &lt;0.4% unknown nucleotides, which is very low for a draft assembly. Our hybrid peacock assembly outperforms the currently available draft peacock assembly (Table S11) by sequencing 6 different libraries, including long reads from ONT, and 2.1-fold increased sequencing data generation. Greater sequencing depth and the use of multiple libraries enabled us to obtain a better assembly with 6.6-fold fewer scaffolds and an improvement in N50 length by 9.1-fold. The longest scaffold in our assembly is 8.7-fold longer than in the previously published draft assembly and has a 5-fold lower percentage of non-ATGC. Thus, for the first time in avian genomics, we have demonstrated how low-cost, third-generation sequencing data generated by ONT can help to improve draft genome assembly. Assemblies with longer scaffolds will further help us to understand more about organisms with structurally complex genomic regions, repeat elements, and isoforms [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Our confidence in the peacock proteins predicted from our assembly was strengthened when we discovered that &#8764;95% of them showed significant homology to various genomic features from different databases (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Based on proteins conserved across the avian species, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the peacock is most closely related to the chicken, followed by turkey and duck. This concurs with previous data based on mitochondrial phylogeny [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, our genome sequence provides further insight into the peacock's genetic lineage and evolution with respect to other avian species. The estimated median divergence time of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> from <italic>G. gallus</italic> is &#8764;35 million years ago, whereas the divergence time estimated between <italic>G. gallus</italic> and <italic>M. gallopavo</italic> is &#8764;37 million years ago [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The large gap between peacock and other avians may be attributed to the non-availability of other avian genome sequences. The gap may be closed by sequencing other avian species.</p><p>Among the vertebrates, it has been observed that variations in transposable elements (TEs) between avians are very low [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] (Table S8). The genome complexities of a species are influenced by the TEs, which are believed to play a crucial role [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this peacock genome assembly, inclusion of ONT long-read sequences has substantially improved the assembly, thus helping to resolve repetitive regions across the genome. The roles of TEs in the development and evolution of the peacock should be further explored.</p><p>Information about the peacock genome will be valued, and may be explored, by avian enthusiasts to further understand the avian world. Although not yet critically endangered in India, the wild peafowl population is declining because of massive deforestation, habitat loss [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and increased poaching for their meat and feathers.
