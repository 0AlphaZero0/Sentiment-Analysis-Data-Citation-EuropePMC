Poor linear growth, marked by stunting [length-for-age <italic>z</italic> score (LAZ)&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2],</p><p>is reflective of the cumulative impacts of chronic deprivation and repeated infectious insults. Poor weight gain, marked by underweight [weight-for-age <italic>z</italic> score (WAZ)&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2] and wasting [weight-for-length <italic>z</italic> score (WLZ)&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2], may indicate acute deprivation or illness (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Nutritional interventions alone often do not effectively reverse poor childhood growth, particularly stunting (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). There is a need for markers to identify children who are likely to grow while receiving supplemental nutrition as well as those in need of additional interventions targeting other causes of malnutrition such as chronic or recurrent infections and/or poor gut health and function.</p><p>Hormonal responses to nutrient intake may correlate with a child's growth pattern and may be useful as markers of growth responsiveness to intervention. Growth hormone (GH) is the principal endocrine regulator of growth and is secreted nightly by the anterior pituitary (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). GH regulates growth in part by binding to receptors in the liver that control expression of insulin-like-growth factor I (IGF-I), one of the hormones responsible for stimulating growth in local tissues and systemically. GH resistance, defined by elevated GH concentrations and low concentrations of IGF-I, is exhibited in states of undernutrition, including chronic caloric insufficiency, protein deficiency, and isolated micronutrient deficiencies (zinc, vitamin A, magnesium), and has been associated with systemic inflammation (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). GH resistance may mediate the relation between these nutritional deficiencies and poor linear and ponderal growth in children. Because GH resistance is not nutrient specific, IGF-I and GH cannot be used to identify children who are likely to grow in response to supplemental nutrition. An endocrine hormone called Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) may be more informative, because it appears to play a role in the pathway by which chronic caloric/protein deprivation in particular triggers GH resistance and inhibits skeletal growth (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;13</xref>).</p><p>Fibroblast growth factors are a family of protein growth factors that regulate diverse biological processes including growth and development. FGF21 is an endocrine hormone produced primarily by the liver and adipocytes that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, and is a signal of protein restriction that regulates metabolism and growth during periods of reduced protein intake (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In humans, FGF21 concentrations rise after sustained fasting and in response to protein deprivation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14&#8211;16</xref>). Chronic exposure to FGF21 results in reduced expression of hepatic GH receptors, inhibition of GH signaling, and disruption of GH action at the bone growth plate (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8&#8211;13</xref>). Limited pediatric data suggest that serum and plasma concentrations of FGF21 are negatively associated with linear growth in healthy and preterm children younger than 1 y (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that FGF21 may be a useful marker in identifying undernourished children whose growth is impeded by insufficient macronutrient (protein) intake. Therefore, high concentrations of FGF21 may identify those children who are more likely to grow in response to nutritional supplementation than others whose poor growth is attributable to other factors, such as environmental enteropathy, a subclinical intestinal disorder prevalent among children in resource-limited settings which has been associated with linear growth faltering, reduced oral vaccine immunogenicity, and cognitive impairment (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18&#8211;20</xref>).</p><p>The present study examines the association between circulating concentrations of FGF21 and subsequent growth in a cohort of underweight children receiving nutritional supplements in urban Bangladesh.</p><p>Study protocols for The Interactions of Malnutrition &amp; Enteric Infections: Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) multisite &#8220;Case Control&#8221; study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all collaborating institutions, and governmental and regional health authorities, including the Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Bangladesh (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Informed consent was taken from the legal guardians of the children before enrollment. Caregivers were not compensated for participating in the research; however, transportation costs and wage loss were covered if required for participation. The present study, including the quantification of FGF21 in previously collected samples, was not part of the initially planned MAL-ED analysis, and a separate proposal was approved by the ERC.

In the parent study, 500 moderately to severely underweight (WAZ&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2) children aged 6&#8211;23 mo living in the Bauniabadh area of section 11 of Mirpur, an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were recruited by field workers at a child feeding center from February, 2009 through April, 2011 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Children were identified either through an initial community-wide WAZ screening of children aged 6&#8211;24 mo or by active surveillance at the feeding center, which continued through the study period.</p><p>The sample of 120 children was chosen for the present analysis based on an a priori sample size calculation for a simple linear regression of 6-mo change in FGF21 on concurrent change in LAZ. This sample size provided 80% power to detect true slopes of &#8722;0.004 or 0.004 for the line obtained by regressing 6-mo change in LAZ against concurrent change in FGF21 with an &#945; level of 0.05, based on SDs of 0.56 LAZ and 37.3 pg/mL and a correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.19 (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Methods</xref></bold> for detail) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The sample was restricted to children who were moderately underweight at enrollment (WAZ&#160;&gt;&#160;&#8722;3, but &lt;&#8722;2) and had &#8805;200 &#956;L of stored plasma available from enrollment and month 5 of follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).

Storage temperatures of &#8211;70&#176;C apply for any aliquots that were not tested immediately.

Stool samples were excluded from children who had diarrhea symptoms within 7 d before collection and from those who had dual sugar permeability testing within 1 d before collection. These factors alter stool water content to a variable extent, making the interpretation of AAT concentrations unreliable without measuring dry weights.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>All procedures were conducted in the icddr,b laboratories in Dhaka. Plasma retinol was quantified using HPLC (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). An aliquot of plasma was deproteinized with methanol containing 50 &#956;g% and retinol was extracted into hexane. The hexane layer was transferred to a clean vial, evaporated under nitrogen, re-dissolved in mobile phase (95% methanol), and injected into an HPLC column. Three plasma pool samples with assigned values set against standard serum from the National Institute of Science and Technology were run with each set of samples, and the concentration of retinol was calculated based on the known concentration of retinol in the pool samples. Whole blood was collected in microcuvettes and quantitative determination of hemoglobin was performed using the HemoCue HB201 analyzer. FGF21 was quantified in plasma samples using a commercially available ELISA (R&amp;D Systems) per package insert instructions. Sulfuric acid (9.8%) stop solution was produced locally. Each plasma sample was tested in duplicate, read directly at 450 nm using Gen5 software (BioTek), and results were expressed as the mean value. A wavelength correction was not performed, as neither a 540-nm nor a 570-nm filter was available. The Gen5 software was programmed to extrapolate concentrations for samples whose absorbance exceeded the highest standard (2000 pg/mL) by &lt;20%, or fell below the lowest standard (31.3 pg/mL) by &lt;20%. In cases in which the sample was out of range, the software reported that the concentration was either &gt;2462 pg/mL or &lt;25.426 pg/mL; and therefore, such results were assigned a value of 2462 pg/mL or 25.4 pg/mL, respectively. ELISA results from 2 of the 120 enrollment samples exceeded the absorbance of the highest standard (in both wells), and results from 4 samples fell below the absorbance of the lowest standard. At month 5, ELISA results from 2 of the 120 samples exceeded the absorbance of the highest standard, and results for 6 samples were less than the absorbance of the lowest standard.</p><p>AAT was measured in stool samples using commercially available ELISA kits (BioVendor), and was run per package insert instructions at a dilution of 1:500 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Samples out of range of the standard curve for the AAT assay were run at higher or lower concentrations (as appropriate) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analyses were performed using STATA version 14.2 SE (StataCorp). The WHO's Anthro software was used to calculate <italic>z</italic> scores (LAZ and WAZ) from raw anthropometric data using standards established in the 2006 WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group. Height observations were dropped from the data set if deemed implausible (&#8805;1 cm lost from the previous month or bounded by values lower by &#8805;1 cm). Implausible height data were omitted from 1 child at 2 time points (enrollment and month 1), and from 7 children at single time points in the intervention period (1.3% of measurements within that period).</p><p>The distributions of anthropometric measurements, plasma biomarker concentrations, and fecal AAT concentrations were evaluated for normality using Shapiro&#8211;Wilk tests. Pearson correlations were calculated for baseline plasma FGF21 concentrations with fecal AAT, plasma micronutrient concentrations (ferritin, vitamin D, zinc, retinol), blood hemoglobin, and plasma concentrations of the systemic inflammation markers &#945;-1-glycoprotein (AGP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). A series of regression models was used to test whether FGF21 was associated with growth during nutritional supplementation, with plasma FGF21 as a continuous (concentration in nanograms per milliliter for ease of interpretation) or a binary (high compared with low) variable.</p><p>Student's <italic>t</italic> tests with unequal variances were used to compare the mean baseline FGF21 concentrations between children whose LAZ increased and those whose LAZ decreased over the 5-mo supplementation period. The comparison was also done for WAZ. Linear regression was used to test whether baseline FGF21 concentration was associated with improvements in nutritional status (change in LAZ or WAZ) over the 5-mo supplementation period. FGF21 was modeled in units of nanograms per milliliter rather than picograms per milliliter to ease the interpretability of the model coefficients. Models included terms to adjust for the pertinent baseline anthropometric measurement and plasma retinol and ferritin concentrations (considering the co-administration of micronutrient supplements).</p><p>Examination of the baseline FGF21 concentrations revealed a distribution that was heavily skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). As there was interest in analyzing differences between the groups of children with extreme FGF21 values and those without, children were grouped by FGF21 above (high) or below (low) the 90th percentile of the baseline concentration data (1056.5 pg/mL). This cutoff was based on the pre&#8211;nutritional supplementation FGF21 concentration data rather than the pooled data, because the baseline FGF21 distribution in the sample was likely more representative of the population of underweight children living in this setting. To assess potential confounders, Student's <italic>t</italic> tests with unequal variances were used to compare the mean baseline plasma micronutrient concentrations, plasma AGP concentrations, fecal AAT concentrations, and anthropometry in children with and without high FGF21 at enrollment.</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Scatterplot of plasma FGF21 concentrations at enrollment and after supplementation.

In contrast, children with low baseline FGF21 experienced continued declines in age-standardized length and did not experience changes in weight during nutritional supplementation. These findings were independent of anthropometry, inflammation, and micronutrient status at enrollment, and are consistent with the hypothesis that high FGF21 concentrations may be useful as a biomarker to identify a priori which children are likely to grow in response to nutritional supplementation.</p><p>High FGF21 identified a small group of children who gained weight while receiving nutritional supplementation. The cohort was enrolled based on poor weight status, and those identified as having high baseline FGF21 improved their weight during supplementation to a greater degree than those with low FGF21 concentrations. The absence of improved linear growth among children with high baseline FGF21 is not surprising, because feeding interventions often fail to normalize linear growth (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). That these children did not become more stunted on average during supplementation is notable given that growth faltering in South Asian children generally worsens between 6 and 24 mo of age (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Children with low baseline FGF21 became more stunted, growing on average &#8764;1.5 cm less and gaining nearly half a kilogram less over the 5 mo of supplementation. Therefore, our data suggest that FGF21 may be useful as a biomarker to identify which children are likely to grow in response to nutritional supplementation while also identifying those children in whom alternative interventions are likely to be required to improve growth. Environmental enteropathy, as measured by fecal concentrations of AAT, did not differ significantly by FGF21 status, and alterations in gut function and the gut microbiome may also have influenced growth in the cohort. Unfortunately, no interventions have been proven to effectively prevent or treat environmental enteropathy beyond transient improvements in gut function markers (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33&#8211;36</xref>).</p><p>FGF21 concentrations are hypothesized to be part of the late adaptive response to starvation, as serum FGF21 increases in healthy human adults after 7&#8211;10 d of fasting (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Protein deprivation in particular appears to drive increases in circulating FGF21, as plasma concentrations in healthy adults increased markedly after 28 d of a low-protein diet but did not change in controls who were not protein restricted (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Similarly, a small study in adults observed 6-fold higher plasma FGF21 concentrations in a group randomly assigned to receive a 5-d diet with 10% protein content than in the group who received a 25%-protein diet (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The children with high FGF21 concentrations in our study had concentrations greatly exceeding those reported from healthy adults after a 10-d fast (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), suggesting that their high FGF21 concentrations may have been driven by sustained caloric and protein deprivation. There are limited published data on FGF21 concentrations in healthy children, and concentrations observed in this Bangladeshi cohort were much higher than those observed in a previous study of Chilean infants born preterm and full term and measured at birth and 6 mo of age (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The importance of dietary protein for child growth is well documented and the typical infant diet after weaning from exclusive breastfeeding in Bangladesh often provides insufficient protein. The finding that FGF21 concentrations were positively associated with growth is somewhat counterintuitive given that both experimental and clinical studies have observed FGF21 to be positively associated with GH resistance and, thus, poor growth. However, it is plausible that nutritional supplementation of the type used in this study may have contributed to decline in FGF21 concentrations among children with high baseline concentrations by treating deficiencies in protein and macronutrient intake. High circulating FGF21 concentrations may be useful in identifying a subset of children whose poor growth status is in large part attributable to sustained caloric/protein deprivation, and who may therefore be more likely to grow in response to nutritional supplementation.</p><p>In all, 6 children had high FGF21 concentrations after 5 mo of supplementation. These children had significantly lower retinol and lower CRP concentrations after supplementation than children whose FGF21 concentrations were low. Interestingly, FGF21 concentration was negatively correlated with plasma retinol and positively correlated with AGP after supplementation. Both AGP and CRP are acute-phase proteins, but whereas CRP concentrations decline rapidly after infection, AGP falls off more slowly. That there were consistent correlations between FGF21 concentrations and both retinol and AGP at 2 different time points suggests that both chronic systemic inflammation and vitamin A insufficiency may influence FGF21 in addition to dietary protein. However, it is unclear why CRP concentrations were lower in the children with high FGF21 at month 5. Other factors, such as infection and intestinal injury, may also influence FGF21 and the present study may not provide sufficient discrimination to detect these associations.</p><p>This study is the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate the association between FGF21 and growth responsiveness during nutritional supplementation in underweight children. Previous pediatric studies have reported that plasma FGF21 is negatively associated with linear growth in preterm infants. For example, a study of very preterm infants reported a negative association between average FGF21 concentrations over the first 5 postnatal weeks and concurrent change in LAZ (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), suggesting that early elevated FGF21 concentrations are associated with postnatal growth failure. Another study reported a negative correlation between LAZ change from 6 to 12 mo of age and concurrent FGF21 change in a small sample of preterm infants (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Consistent with these observations, in the present study, the 5-mo changes in both WAZ and LAZ were negatively associated with concurrent change in FGF21 concentration.</p><p>This study leveraged a well-designed and implemented cohort and had several notable strengths. Children were enrolled from a single setting using a well-defined recruitment protocol and rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria established by the MAL-ED consortium. The high population density, poor sanitation, and low socioeconomic status of the Bauniabadh area are representative of a typical urban slum in Dhaka and are similar to others in South Asia (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A unique strength in this study is that children were visited several times each week to collect highly detailed surveillance information on the incidence of diarrhea, respiratory disease, and other morbidity events. The detailed morbidity data enabled the exclusion of stool samples with close proximity to diarrhea symptoms or intestinal permeability testing that would have potentially diluted AAT concentrations (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In addition, the use of linear mixed-effects models allowed for utilization of monthly anthropometry data, facilitated comparison of FGF21 and growth relations in the supplemented and nonsupplemented periods, and adequately accounted for correlated anthropometric data coming from the same individuals.</p><p>There were a few important limitations to this study. Children in the study were from a narrow age range and were restricted to those with WAZ between &#8722;3 and &#8722;2, limiting the generalizability of our conclusions. Useful data on gestational age, birth weight, and birth length were not possible to obtain because children were recruited and enrolled at a minimum age of 6 mo. Although a child's gestational age and size at birth may influence circulating FGF21 concentrations, these data were not available. Data on parity, plurality, and size of the parents were not available; however, there is no evidence to support a priori a relation between parity, plurality, or the size of parents and FGF21 concentrations in children. Owing to our choice of cutoff, there were relatively few children (10%) with high baseline concentrations of FGF21 and even fewer (5%) after supplementation. Therefore, results must be interpreted cautiously and tested in other populations. Owing to limited sample volumes, it was not possible to repeat FGF21 ELISAs using dilution where results greatly exceeded the absorbance of the highest standard. The intra-assay CV was 7.7% for the 226 samples within the detectable range of the assay (i.e., not those with assigned values). Some of this variability was likely because wavelength correction, used to correct for optical imperfections in the ELISA plate, was not performed. The timing of blood draws was not standardized and it is unclear whether diurnal cycle or proximity to meals influences FGF21 concentrations in children. However, FGF21 concentrations were relatively unaffected by time of day or standardized food intake over 24 h in 5 adults tested after a 25-h fast (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Because there are limited child data available on endogenous FGF21 variability, it could have been useful to measure plasma FGF21 concentrations twice within an interval of 1&#8211;2 wk before supplementation in order to confirm the baseline FGF21 concentrations observed in the cohort.</p><p>Our evaluation of whether environmental enteropathy is associated with concentrations of FGF21 was limited by the small number of children with high FGF21 in the sample, and the sole reliance on AAT as a measure of environmental enteropathy. AAT describes elevated intestinal permeability, which is just one aspect of the range of functional changes thought to underlie the relation between environmental enteropathy and poor linear growth (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). AAT may be less sensitive to small gaps in mucosal integrity owing to its large size than smaller molecules such as urinary lactulose. Without simultaneous plasma measurements, fecal AAT concentrations may provide a less reliable estimate of intestinal permeability, given the variability of plasma concentrations (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in a cohort of moderately underweight children, the subset with high initial FGF21 concentrations was most likely to respond to nutritional supplementation of the type used in this study, demonstrating improvement in WAZ. Although average LAZ remained relatively unchanged in children with high baseline FGF21, LAZ declined considerably in similarly underweight peers with low baseline FGF21. Changes in FGF21 concentrations were negatively associated with concurrent changes in children's LAZ and WAZ. FGF21 may identify undernourished children who are more and less likely to be growth responsive to nutritional supplementation. FGF21 and environmental enteropathy markers may be especially useful for improving the targeted treatment and prevention of poor growth in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplemental File</label><media xlink:href="nzz024_supplemental_file.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of the MAL-ED network, the field and laboratory staff at icddr,b, and participants of the MAL-ED Mirpur study for their important contributions.
