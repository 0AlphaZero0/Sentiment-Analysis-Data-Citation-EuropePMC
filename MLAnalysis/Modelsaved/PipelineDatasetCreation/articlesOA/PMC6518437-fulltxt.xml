<bold>Introduction:</bold> Substandard and falsified medicines undermine health systems. We sought to unravel the political and economic factors which drive the production of these products, and to explain how they reach patients.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted in-depth case studies in China, Indonesia, Turkey and Romania. We reviewed academic papers and press reports (n = 840), developing semi-structured questionnaires. We interviewed regulators, policy-makers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacists, patients and academics (n=88). We coded data using NVivo software, and developed an analytic framework to assess national risks for substandard and falsified medicines. We tested the framework against cases reported to the World Health Organization, from countries at all income levels.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> We found that increasing political commitment to provision of universal health coverage has led to public procurement policies aimed at lowering prices of medical products. In response, legitimate, profit-driven pharmaceutical companies protect their margins by cutting costs, or withdrawing from less profitable markets, while distributors engage in arbitrage. Meanwhile, health providers sometimes protect profits by 'upselling' patients to medicines not covered by insurers. Cost-cutting can undermine quality assurance, leading to substandard or degraded medicines. Other responses contribute to shortages, irrational demand and high prices. All of these provide market opportunities for producers of falsified products; they also push consumers outside of the regular supply chain, providing falsifiers with easy access to customers. The analytic framework capturing these interactions explained cases in most high and middle-income settings; additional factors operate in the poorest countries.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Most efforts to secure medicine quality currently focus on product regulation. However, our research suggests market mechanisms are key drivers for poor quality medicines, including where political commitments to universal health coverage are under-resourced. We have developed a framework to guide country-specific, system-wide analysis. This can flag risks and pinpoint specific actions to protect medicine quality, and thus health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>falsified medicine</kwd><kwd>substandard medicine</kwd><kwd>counterifeit medicine</kwd><kwd>medicine quality</kwd><kwd>procurement</kwd><kwd>LMIC</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001828"><funding-source>Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam</funding-source><award-id>22070000.014.002</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>209930</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported through grant funding from the Wellcome Trust (Grant holder: Elizabeth Pisani; grant number 209930) and Erasmus University (through the REI grant; WBS number 22070000.014.002). </funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Substandard and falsified medical products undermine the prospect of achieving effective universal health coverage (UHC)
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. They waste money, fail to cure sick people, and sometimes even kill them. Reviews of
<italic>in vitro</italic>, animal, observational and modelling studies conclude that anti-infective medicines that deliver sub-therapeutic doses because of poor formulation or degradation also encourage drug-resistant infections
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. A 2017 analysis of 1,500 cases of suspect medicines reported to the World Health Organisation Global Surveillance and Monitoring System for substandard and falsified medical products (the WHO GSMS database) showed that they exist in all regions of the world and affect all classes of medicines. Recently published meta-analyses of prevalence studies suggest that between 10 and 20 percent of anti-infective medicines in low- and middle-income countries might be substandard or falsified
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>The problem is not new. The WHO outlined factors facilitating the manufacture and trade in poor quality medicines and recommended measures to tackle the problem as early as 1999
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Some 18 years later, in 2017, it published a report whose findings and recommendations were remarkably similar. Both reports grouped factors that facilitate the production and circulation of falsified and substandard medicines into three broad areas:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Access-related: shortages of affordable, accessible, acceptable, quality-assured medicine;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Governance-related: weak legislation and sanctions, corruption;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limited technical capacity: limitations among regulators, investigators, prosecutors, laboratories etc., as well as among producers and throughout the supply chain.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Other reviews have cited similar factors, and have proposed similar response strategies for prevention, detection and response, underlining, like WHO, the need to strengthen national medicines regulatory agencies
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>This begs the question: if both the drivers of poor-quality medicines and the solutions have been known for two decades, why does the problem persist? We hypothesised that previous approaches correctly diagnose the immediate drivers, but did not sufficiently consider the specific political and economic factors which shape the markets for substandard and for falsified medicines, and which may stand in the way of proposed policy responses.</p><p>We thus conducted detailed, qualitative case studies in four middle-income countries which are significant producers and consumers of pharmaceuticals. We aimed to identify specific mechanisms through which political, economic and other systemic factors influence the availability of substandard and falsified medicines and vaccines, and the ways in which they enable or obstruct policies aimed at reducing the production, trade and consumption of those products. On the basis of our findings, we further aimed to develop an analytic framework that can be used at the national level to identify policies and practices that create risks for substandard production or degradation of medical products, or that provide opportunities for market entry of falsified products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Our team consisted of specialists in epidemiology, criminology, medicine marketing and regulation, economics and public policy. We used WHO's 2017 definitions, adopting "substandard" to refer to medical products that do not meet quality standards, and "falsified" to describe those that deliberately misrepresent identity, composition or source, and excluding patent-related considerations

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the WHO Essential Medicines and Health Products Information Portal and Google Scholar using the keywords "counterfeit" (which was, until the 2019 revision, the Medical Subject Heading used for poor quality medicines), "substandard", "falsified" or "poor quality" in combination with "medicin*", "medical products" or "pharmaceutical*". We identified further publications from bibliographies.</p><p>We reviewed resulting publications using critical interpretive synthesis&#8212;an iterative method designed for analysing heterogeneous qualitative data and developing theory
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Early in the process, we developed a coding structure centred on factors that created a market opportunity for poor-quality medicines, as well as factors that motivate, facilitate, or deter their production or trade. We entered this structure into NVivo software v12
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, using it to code further reading and refining it inductively. It reached near-final form before the country case studies were conducted. We provide the final coding structure along with a log of changes to coding during iterative analysis in the study repository (see
<italic>Extended data</italic>; 02_Coding_structure.docx
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Choice of countries</title><p>We chose to conduct studies in middle-income countries because many, including several with large populations, are now actively pursuing policies designed to achieve or sustain UHC, while at the same time trying to increase domestic capacity for the production of pharmaceuticals. In addition, many are facing a "double burden" of disease, and demand is rising for new treatments for non-communicable diseases, as well as those for neglected and common infectious diseases. Such countries thus provide learning across a wide range of issues; this learning may also be useful to lower income countries that are now considering increasing public financing for health.</p><p>In our initial reading, we also identified structural characteristics with potentially significant implications for medicine quality, as described in the Results section below. To the extent possible, we chose to conduct case studies in countries that displayed one of these characteristics. Finally, wishing to search literature and conduct interviews in local languages where possible, we considered the language skills of our research team. </p><p>Once countries had been selected for case studies, we searched national institutional websites as well as the internet for sources relating to substandard and falsified medicines in Chinese, Indonesian, Turkish and Romanian.</p></sec><sec><title>Field research</title><p>We developed question guides based on our literature review, with variations for particular sub-studies (see
<italic>Extended data</italic>; 11_Interview_topic_guide.docx
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). Potential respondents were purposively selected based on their knowledge of the manufacture, regulation, trade, prescription or consumption of medicines; further respondents were suggested by participants. We contacted them electronically and explained the purpose of the study. Consenting respondents (n=88) were provided with further details in writing in their native language, including around procedures to maintain confidentiality, then interviewed face-to-face or by Skype for between 60 and 90 minutes. Consent to record was sought. Where granted (n= 65) consent was repeated on tape. Where denied (n=14) or technically impractical (n=10), consent to take written notes was sought, and written consent for interview was obtained. Most interviews were conducted in the respondent's native language; staff of international organisations were interviewed in English.</p></sec><sec><title>Data processing, analysis and testing</title><p>Recorded interviews were transcribed and translated into English in full or in part by the interviewer. Where no recording was possible, notes were typed in English. Researchers coded their own interviews in a shared NVivo project; the principal investigator (EP) coded a subset of interviews in parallel&#8212;differences in coding were discussed in weekly team meetings to develop shared understanding around key concepts. More details of participant recruitment, interviews and data handling, reported following COREQ guidelines

<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>).</p><p>We used a grounded theory approach in developing a coherent framework based on the similarities between country case studies
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. A draft analytic framework was developed and presented to an informal study advisory group in April 2018 (see
<italic>Acknowledgements</italic>). It was revised following input from the group.</p><p>We then collaborated with colleagues at WHO, asking them to identify cases they considered illustrative of the breadth of reports of substandard and falsified medicines logged in the GSMS database. The selected cases included reports from the Democratic Republic of Congo (&#215;2), Nicaragua, Niger, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela, as well as cross-border and regional cases involving China, France, India, Paraguay, the Middle East and West Africa (&#215;3). We mapped these cases on to the market risk framework, to ascertain the extent to which the factors identified in the framework explained the dynamics of each case.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The Daily Board of the Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus University reviewed the study plan and questionnaires and approved the protocol with number MEC-2018-016. National guidelines in all of the concerned countries specify that local ethical approval must be sought for invasive, but not non-invasive research. We discussed the study with officials in the Ministry of Health and/or medicine regulatory authorities (at the provincial level in China and at the national level in other countries) before the start of data collection to ensure that they were fully aware of the aims of our work.</p><p>Study funders were consulted over final study design; funders had no role in analysis, manuscript development or decision to submit for publication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>These results bring findings derived from our review of literature and documentation together with data collected in semi-structured interviews. Where no specific reference is given, the finding comes from interview data.</p><p>Altogether, we reviewed some 840 papers and documents relating to medicine quality and product falsification in seven languages, and interviewed 88 people. We provide a full downloadable bibliography of all documents reviewed.in the study repository (see

<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Global overview from literature: contributors to poor quality medicines</title><p>Many of the academic research papers we found reported surveys of the prevalence of poor-quality medicines in low income countries
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The academic literature also provided many commentaries that summarised existing evidence. Some stressed the importance of market factors
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and several called for greater political commitment to addressing the threat posed by poor quality medicines
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. However, few of these provide any detailed analysis of the reasons why that commitment is currently lacking.</p><p>Books and institutional reports were more likely to provide information about factors facilitating the circulation of poor-quality medicines, as described in the

<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. These documents generally agree on the circumstances commonly associated with poor quality medicines: shortages of affordable, quality-assured medicine; weak legislation and sanctions; under-resourced regulators with poor technical capacity; complex supply chains; and corruption. We used these areas of agreement to inform our coding structure and interview guides.</p><p>However, we found no global analyses which described how these factors relate to one another, or to the political and economic landscapes in which they are rooted.</p><p>Much of the remainder of the literature fell into two categories: studies of the medicine markets in a particular country or trading area, and investigations of cases in which falsified or substandard medicines reached markets
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. These provided additional insights about factors likely to affect medicine quality, especially in middle-income markets, and contributed to our choice of country case studies. Salient factors increasing risk included market structures that facilitate arbitrage or parallel trade (to which Romania is subject), very rapid scale-up of health service provision (all study countries), decentralised or otherwise complex government and regulatory structures (Indonesia, China). Protective factors included effective single-payer systems and strong information systems, both present in Turkey.</p></sec><sec><title>Country case studies</title><p>

China is the largest producer and exporter of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in the world; it also has a complex decentralised regulatory structure. We chose to focus on the interaction between international, national and state-level factors influencing quality assurance of Chinese API in Zhejiang province, the country's largest producer and exporter of active ingredients and home to four of the world's top ten producers, according to trade sources
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We thus spoke principally to manufacturers and regulators in Zhejiang.</p><p>While health services in Indonesia were decentralised in 2001, the central government committed in 2014 to including all citizens in a single-payer health insurance scheme. Though three-quarters of the population is now covered, the scheme has been in deficit since its inception. We focused our case study on the interaction between the radical changes to health financing and the quality of medicines, speaking to stakeholders across the system.</p><p>Turkey undertook a similar transformation in health financing a decade earlier, and has more recently invested in widely praised medicine tracking technology. The Turkish case study paid particular attention to the genesis of this technology, and the factors that facilitated or threatened its implementation; many of the interviewees were directly involved with or impacted by these efforts.</p><p>Romania is one of the newest and poorest members of the European Union; out-of-pocket spending on health is close to 40% higher than the EU average
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Successive governments have promised to reduce medicine prices, but must do this within the EU's single market, while Romanian pharmaceutical companies must comply with EU standards. The Romanian case study included interviewees from across the supply chain, and highlighted the interaction between national and regional goals, regulations and markets.</p><p>
<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the number of interviewees in each country case study.</p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Table 3. </label><caption><title>Number of people interviewed, by country and respondent type.</title></caption></table-wrap><p>The particularities of each country focus will be reported separately. The remainder of our results present the common dynamics that we found across these different country case studies, and the analytic framework that arises from them.</p></sec><sec><title>Political promises and policies affecting the market for medicines</title><p>We found that political promises, and the policies intended to deliver on them, fundamentally shaped the market for medicines in all study countries, with more uniformity on the demand side of the market than on the supply side. Because the Chinese study focused on the API market, we do not include specific information on the demand side for formulated medicines in China.</p><sec><title>Demand for medicines</title><p>In all of the study countries, governments have promised to provide virtually all citizens with affordable access to health care. Scaling up service provision to deliver on this promise clearly increases the size of the market for medical products.</p><p>The health financing mechanisms that aim to deliver UHC differ in Indonesia, Turkey and Romania, but all include high degrees of public subsidy. This, combined with rising demand, puts pressure on public budgets, and makes cost containment a priority. Procurement policies have thus increasingly focused on bringing down the price of medicines. Other health system measures have reinforced these efforts, as shown in
<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Table 4. </label><caption><title>Policies aimed at containing the cost of medical products.</title></caption><table-wrap-foot><fn id="FN1"><p>INN, International non-proprietary name.</p><p>Sources: Interviews and

For example, infrequent updating of prices in response to changes in reference prices or exchange rates disrupted markets in Romania and Turkey. In Indonesia, inclusion on the national formulary precedes cost-effectiveness analysis (which is only performed for limited classes of drugs, such as oncology). This reduces the state's bargaining power in auctions.</p><p>However, taken together, cost-containment measures have effectively reduced the price paid for many medicines in the study countries

</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>A: Yes, definitely. Starting with the raw materials. That's the first thing, manufacturers are going to look for the very cheapest API, they're going to look for a cheaper supplier. Next is the way they make the medicines available. For example, they might have started with blister packs, but they'll change those to strips, something cheaper. Basically, they're looking for ways to make more profit.</italic>

We provide granularity to help guide national plans to prevent, detect and respond to substandard and falsified medical products.</p><p>The study shares the limitations common to qualitative research regarding subjects involving illegal or unethical behaviour. While we worked hard to include a wide range of participants and to stress that data would be anonymised, some potential respondents declined interview while others, particularly from government institutions, gave normative responses. However, we were able to capture a wide range of opinions and experience, including detailed descriptions of unethical practices, giving us confidence that our results are sufficiently comprehensive.</p><p>The four middle-income countries studied shared characteristics that are not reflective of all nations; when we tested the framework against cases reported in other countries, we identified refinements which may be necessary in adapting the framework for lower income settings.</p><p>Our results did, however, prove robust across a wide range of settings. They suggest that when the incentives driving demand for affordable, cost-effective medical products are aligned with the rewards for producing and distributing those products at assured quality, substandard medicines will be rare, and there will be little opportunity to profit from the sale of falsified products. However, it is currently hard to align production incentives with rewards, because the forces shaping demand are largely determined by national governments aspiring to maximise access to affordable care, while suppliers are motivated by profit, often calculated globally.</p><p>Much of the current discourse about medicine quality focuses on strengthening the capacity of national regulatory agencies to oversee the production or import of medicine products, and their distribution. Certainly, well-resourced national medicine regulators are critical in assuring product quality. However, our analysis shows that many policies far beyond the reach of the medicine regulator contribute to shaping the market for medicines, sometimes incentivising the production or import and sale of substandard or falsified products.</p><p>We find that unless quality is explicitly included in pricing and procurement policies, downward price pressures can actively incentivise the production of substandard medicines and facilitate degradation. No country can hope to achieve sustainable, effective UHC without quality-assured generic products, yet low-profit-margin generic products are especially vulnerable to corner-cutting in response to price pressures.</p><p>A key safeguard is thus to ensure that prices cover quality production and distribution, as well as fair profit. This is an unpalatable message. "Fair profit" is hard to determine, since manufacturers rarely disclose real costs
<sup><xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. Further, profit is often conflated with profiteering in discussions of pharmaceutical pricing, while the fear that innovator producers hope to undermine public confidence in generic products discourages discourse around quality assurance for low-cost products. Meanwhile, large exporters of generic products often respond to calls for more quality assurance by accusing more expensive producers of covert protectionism
<sup><xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#8211;
<xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>.</p><p>A further safeguard against substandard production is close regulation of manufacturing practice. We find evidence, however, that a political commitment to the promotion of domestic manufacturing may put pressure on regulators to lower standards for GMP or product quality inspection. This is worrisome in a climate of increasing economic nationalism in many middle-income countries, including those needing to find new sources for medicines previously supplied by the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria
<sup><xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>.</p><p>The current global system concentrates the burden for quality-assurance on medicine regulators in over 190 consuming countries, rather than in a handful of major exporting nations. Adequate quality assurance of products made for export would increase efficiency in a globalised pharmaceutical market. This is a political rather than a technical challenge, but models exist in other sectors, such as aviation
<sup><xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>. More cost-effective, streamlined regulation could eat into fees that national regulators now earn for often duplicative authorisation procedures, but it would cut costs for quality manufacturers, reducing the risk of product withdrawal and shortages.</p><p>Product shortages, as well as the quest for affordability or profit, can push patients and health care providers out of the regulated supply chain, creating opportunities for falsifiers. As the Turkish case study demonstrates, the existence of a consolidated market in which both patients and producers are relatively well protected against excessive price pressures is an effective protection against this risk. Market-based solutions such as this appear more effective than attempts to tackle falsification primarily through product regulation
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As The Lancet Commission on Essential Medicines observed, UHC cannot be achieved with poor quality pharmaceuticals
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. We thus conclude that organisations and governments aiming to ensure UHC must consider the potential impacts of procurement rules as well as industrial, environmental and trade policies on the quality of medicines, and support and implement systemic approaches that provide fair reward for the production and distribution of quality-assured, cost-effective therapies.</p><p>There is considerable scope to validate the market risk framework in different country settings, and to use it in combination with well-designed quantitative surveys to better understand the scale of the problem and to address the locally-specific drivers of vulnerabilities to poor quality medical products at the systemic as well as the national level
<sup><xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup>. Distinguishing between risk factors for substandard medications and falsified products can also guide choices about post market surveillance equipment
<sup><xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.</p><p>The framework also functions as diagnostic tool to identify market and regulatory failures that have incentivised or facilitated a specific case of falsification/substandard production.

<bold>Summary </bold>
</p><p> This paper attempts to investigate political and economic factors which drive the demand and supply of sub-standard and falsified (SF) medicines. Using a grounded theory approach, the authors try to develop a market risk framework for SF medicines. The main issue addressed by this paper is of significant policy relevance and impact. It is the first paper (to the best of my knowledge) which uses a demand/supply and market risk framework to study this problem.</p><p> Below I point out a few areas in the paper where I would have liked to see greater depth in analysis or clearer exposition of what this analysis tells us with a reasonable degree of confidence, and what parts remains less clear.</p><p>

<bold>Comments </bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The key hypothesis is that SF medicines are largely the result of market responses to demand for lower prices/cost containment, industrial policy and environmental control pressures. There may be other underlying root causes for the prevalence of SF. This is where the authors&#8217; use of grounded theory methodology (and the sampling approach used) falls a little short. The manuscript does not provide much detail (there is some discussion on p13) on how they looked for cases/instances that do not fit the main reasons they have identified, what they found, and did they attempt to look at filling gaps in initial data collected to clarify uncertainties. This would have allowed them to add more depth/density and allow a reader to fully understand which parts of their grounded theory to have stronger confidence in, and which parts to have lesser confidence in. They delve into this a little bit in the discussion section, but it would have been better to see a clearer and more elaborate exposition of the negative cases in the main section which discusses the market risk framework.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All the countries included in the sample have a high degree of health insurance coverage or some form of pooling. To what extent would the findings of this study apply to out of pocket markets without any price controls? Posing this question would help bring out the external validity scope of this paper more clearly. It will also more clearly highlight other factors that lead to SF.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It will be useful for the authors to look at Boswell-Dean (2019)
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-35338-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> which shows that price controls in India may have led to higher quality in the out-of-pocket medicines market.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The drivers for sub-standard and falsified medicines are often very different and the framework developed by the authors and Figures 3, 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate that. It may be useful to categorize them more explicitly in Table 6.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Shortages (due to different reasons) are identified as the primary driver for falsified medicines. While this may be true for the 4 middle income countries studied, in many other markets, falsified medicines are supplied to out-of-pocket paying patients even when the &#8220;genuine&#8221; product is in abundant supply (although is priced higher). This sometimes makes the distinction between the underlying reasons for sub-standard and falsified a little murky. Also, see Bate
<italic>et al.</italic> (2011)
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-35338-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> for some discussion regarding this.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While unclear if it applies widely due to the nature of the study sample, it is worth exploring if a possible market response would be to differentiate drug quality according to the consumption sub-market as in Bate
<italic>et al.</italic> (2016)
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-35338-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While I understand purposive sampling based on market characteristics, using API market in one country (China) and finished products in the other countries is not a very good comparison strategy for building grounded theory. Cost containment from political pressures only directly effects finished product producers. The effect of cost containment on finished product translates into a much lower price effect on APIs (depending on the type of medicine only a small fraction of the cost is API cost). Also, there is limited evidence that finished product producers pass-on their price decrease pressures to API suppliers. Economics of API manufacturing is also much more volume and fixed cost dependent so its better to make larger quantities and supply them at marginal cost to other &#8220;non-consumption&#8221; markets.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="rep-ref-35338-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">

While the problem of substandard and falsified medicines and its potentially adverse health consequences is well&#160;recognised, research has tended to focus on documenting the scale of the problem and enumerating&#160;the&#160;contributory factors. This paper uses empirical case studies and review of secondary literature to develop&#160;a 'market risk' analytic framework&#160;for use in mapping the political and economic system dimensions of the problem in specific country settings.&#160;The framework is built on a&#160;literature review followed by comparative analysis of qualitative interviews with relevant informants and stakeholders in four diverse middle-income countries.&#160;&#160;</p><p> This is a complex issue&#160;influenced by a range of interwoven factors, many of which are highly technical or difficult to grasp for non-specialist readers (ranging from Good Manufacturing Practice and regulatory standards to diverse market structures,&#160;the effects of differing insurance systems and international trade arrangements). Given this, the authors do a good job in general of highlighting&#160;the key dimensions at play without losing the reader in technical detail.&#160; Occasionally a little further explication would be helpful, for example in elucidating&#160;the role of arbitrage&#160;or the practice of auctions through which (it appears) governments select a supplier for a required pharmaceutical product.&#160;</p><p> The study design is generally sound&#160;and the use of semi-structured interviews is particularly appropriate for gathering material on sensitive topics such as this. The authors could perhaps have made fuller&#160;use of the substantial review of academic papers and press reports that they conducted by using an established&#160;scoping review framework&#160;and by providing further details of the critical interpretive synthesis conducted (these results are not included). The development&#160;of a coding framework based solely on the secondary literature and its subsequent deployment for coding and analysis of the interview data is somewhat unusual. Analysis of the&#160;qualitative case study material could have been enriched by combining the use of this&#160;coding scheme&#160;with a more inductive approach, to allow development of unexpected themes emerging from the interview data. A fully grounded theory approach would also have included testing the authors' hypothesis against divergent/deviant examples. However, the more structured approach utilised here does serve&#160;the authors' purpose of framework development effectively, by focusing on the specific political and economic dimensions that may heighten risk for creating markets for substandard or falsified medicines. Importantly, the authors identify different influences operating for these two types of inferior&#160;product. The figures provide clear and useful diagrammatic characterisations of the processes described, such as the effect of cost-cutting on the risk of substandard medicines.&#160;&#160;</p><p> The conclusions are generally sound&#160;though broader&#160;statements could be better evidenced, such as the framing assumption of the paper that downward pressures on prices&#160;are exerted by political promises to deliver Universal Health Care. Only the implementation of such promises through legislation, regulation or other government actions to reduce costs of medicines rather than the 'promises' themselves are really relevant to this assertion; and since many governments are focusing efforts toward UHC primarily on expanding health insurance coverage, some further discussion of the potential implications of different health insurance arrangements on risks relating to medicine quality would have been helpful.&#160;</p><p> Nonetheless, overall this is a sophisticated and impressive analysis that provides an original conceptualisation that helps to clarify&#160;a rather murky field. It provides a potentially useful framework for further country-specific analyses to disaggregate&#160;the various contributory factors that may influence susceptibility for low quality and falsified medicines to appear in the market. Moreover, it rightly shifts focus from product regulation, where efforts have mostly concentrated to date, to causal market mechanisms; and it usefully pinpoints the need to differentiate the economic forces likely to result in the appearance of substandard medicines from those that increase risk of falsified medicines being manufactured and marketed.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>I have read this submission.

The choice of countries is somewhat eclectic - it is not quite clear why they were chosen over others. The focus of the case studies is different in each case as is the occupational distribution of the interviewees.&#160;</p><p> The paper would have benefited&#160;from a more systematic analysis of the health systems and pharmaceutical policies in each of the countries. The details on p.5-6 are quite cursory. This applies also to the case studies themselves in the extended dataset.&#160;</p><p> With regards to the central conclusion that "increasing political commitment to provision of universal health coverage has led to public procurement policies aimed at lowering prices of medical products" I am not sure that it is supported by the data. Public procurement has long sought to minimize prices, often without due regard to medicines quality. UHC, to the extent that it involves greater public funding of health services and a reduction in the number of patients buying their own medicines, could actually improve the prospects for reducing reliance on falsified and substandard medicines. The fault lies in defective procurement policies that do not properly factor in quality criteria and the reluctance of governments to provide adequate financing. Where there is a substantial generic industry, as the report points out, there is also political pressure not to enforce strict regulation.&#160;</p><p> In that context, the report refers to the need to allow "fair profit" to ensure that quality standards are maintained, but how to achieve that raises a lot of issues that are not pursued in any depth.&#160;</p><p> On specific points:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The comment about the WHO prequalification&#160;programme on p.9 rather understates its importance as the reference makes clear. It also covers diagnostics.&#160;</p></list-item><list-item><p>On p.15 the list of additional factors in low income countries really needs referencing.&#160;</p></list-item></list>

<bold>Specific questions</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors have not made the interview data available. However, the explanation for this is fully satisfactory.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Overall</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There is great concern but little understanding about the prevalence, drivers and impacts of sub-standard drugs. This paper is timely. It develops a framework, which while not necessarily definitive, is useful. It gives insight into the issue of fake drugs by seeking to understand the drivers for undesired behaviours leading to poor outcomes.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Introduction</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Although there are pragmatic reasons for lumping &#8220;substandard&#8221; and &#8220;falsified&#8221; drugs and although this is current WHO terminology, combining the two categories can be mis-leading as they have very different drivers and hence different solutions.&#160;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is going too far to say that solutions for poor quality medicines in LMICs are known. There is an argument that the solutions proposed, largely drawn from historical experiences in HICs, are inappropriate and unworkable in the context of LMICs.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Methodology</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The choice of countries requires more explanation. How many countries fitted the criteria chosen by the researcher?</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of participants per country is rather small, but probably adequate for this time of qualitative study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ethical approval for non-invasive research is rather a grey area. They should refer to national guidelines that say local ethical approval is not needed for non-invasive research. Most countries where we work require local ethical approval.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Results and Discussion</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It would be useful to have information on the size of the un-regulated drug sector in these countries.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results capture very much the &#8220;received wisdom&#8221;. It would be interesting to have perspectives of some of the &#8220;un-approved stakeholders&#8221; e.g. the people who buy drugs on line or sellers of illegal products.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The paper very well documents the un-intended consequences of well-intended goals. They should be more cautious in suggesting preventative actions as it is very likely these preventative actions will have their own set of un-intended consequences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The application to low income countries was perfunctory and a more in-depth analysis is warranted.</p></list-item></list>
<bold>Generally, very well written and error free.</bold>
