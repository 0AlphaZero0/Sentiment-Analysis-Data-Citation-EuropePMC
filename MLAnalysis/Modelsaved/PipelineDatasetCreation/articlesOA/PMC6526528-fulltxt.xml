In this study, two novel FIPs from <italic>Lentinus tigrinus</italic> were identified and named Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2. The bioactive characteristics of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 were compared to a well-known FIP (LZ-8 from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>) to investigate the effect of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 expression on concanavalin A- (Con A-) induced liver oxidative injury. Both Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 protected the livers from Con A-induced necrosis, as evidenced by decreased serum aminotransferase levels (AST, ALT) and relieved liver histology. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, and IL-6) and oxidative stress (SOD, MDA) were shown to be reduced by expressing Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2. In addition, the hepatoprotective effect of Fip-lti1, Fip-lti2, and LZ-8 correlated with ameliorating the imbalance of Th1/Th2 (IFN-<italic>&#947;</italic>/IL-4). The observed liver protection of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 was mechanistically explored. Treatments with Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 regulated GATA3/T-bet expression, activated the decreased Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway, and countered the upregulated NLRP3/ASC/NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>Bp65 signaling in Con A-stimulated liver injury. Nrf2 activation was shown to be involved in the mechanisms underlying the protection of Fip-lti by RNA interference. In conclusion, we identified two new fungal proteins (Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2) that can protect the liver from Con A-induced liver oxidative injury through the Nrf2/NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B/NLRP3/IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic> pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>CAST Innovation Foundation</funding-source><award-id>2017QNRC001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission</funding-source><award-id>Hu nong qing zi (2017) no. 1-14</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Many bioactive components have been identified from basidiomycete mushrooms; the identified molecules include polysaccharides [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], triterpenes [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FIPs are a class of small proteins, which have shown anticancer, antiallergy, and antianaphylaxis activity and stimulation of immune cells to produce cytokines [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, FIPs in pharmaceuticals or functioning as vaccine adjuvants can harness benefits of immune regulation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Lentinus tigrinus</italic> (<italic>L. tigrinus</italic>), a white-rot fungus that grows naturally on rotten hardwood during spring and summer in China [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], is an edible and medicinal mushroom containing a valuable combination of nutrients including high amino acid concentration and low sugar level [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phenolics (one of the components isolated from this mushroom) reportedly have antioxidative properties [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, no FIP genes have been isolated and characterized from <italic>L. tigrinus</italic> to date. Based on BLAST analysis, we identified a novel gene encoding fungal immunomodulatory protein in the <italic>L. tigrinus</italic> genome sequence (DOE Joint Genome Institute, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jgi.doe.gov/">https://www.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>) and designated it &#8220;Fip-lti.&#8221;</p><p>The liver, a vital organ for metabolism and detoxification, is continuously exposed to toxicants including chemical, biochemical, and biological insults [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, the liver is at high risk for injury either directly or indirectly through the immune response. Con A is known to induce liver injury; hence, it has been utilized to generate the acute liver failure model. Con A activates T cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells, leading to hepatoinflammation or immune hepatitis. In a murine model, Con A-induced hepatic injury is featured with an abnormal immune response that mimics human T cell-mediated liver disease [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Elevated production of inflammatory cytokines&#8212;including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <italic>&#945;</italic>, interleukin- (IL-) 1<italic>&#946;</italic>, and IL-6&#8212;was associated with the initiation of liver injury and rapid dysfunction [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, oxidative stress is closely related to inflammation as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are actively recruited leading to the cellular damage and progression of inflammatory disease [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>So far, there have been no published systematic studies assessing the expressions and activities of FIPs under liver damage. Herein, we evaluated the protective effects of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 in both in vitro and in vivo models. We further investigated the mechanisms of the hepatoprotective effect by Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 proteins and indicated the therapeutic potential of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 for immunity-mediated liver injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Two Novel FIPs: Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2</title><p>The nucleotide sequence that encodes for Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 consists of 339 and 345 base pairs (bp) or 113 and 115 amino acids (aa), respectively. The calculated molecular weights are 12.61 kDa and 12.80 kDa. The peptide sequence of Fip-lti1 consists of 13 strongly basic (+) amino acids (Arg, Lys) and 11 strongly acidic (&#8722;) amino acids (Asp, Glu), resulting in an 8.66 pI value (alkaline). In contrast, Fip-lti2 consists of 10 strongly basic (+) amino acids (Arg, Lys) and 12 strongly acidic (&#8722;) amino acids (Asp, Glu), leading to a 5.49 pI value (acidic). Both Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 do not carry signal peptide and transmembrane helices.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>, the phylogenetic relationship among the identified FIPs reveals that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 form a unique separate branch, indicating a substantial divergence from all FIPs, but Fip-nha. Amino acid modification feature scan suggested that Fip-lti1 contains five putative N-myristoylation sites, four putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, one casein kinase II phosphorylation site, and one putative N-glycosylation site; G61 and G86 of putative N-myristoylation sites, T39 and T45 of putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and one putative N-glycosylation site are shared by both Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p><p>Crystal structures of LZ-8, Fip-fve, and Fip-gmi were used as templates to build the homology model of Fip-lti1/Fip-lti2, which was further refined by energy minimization. The predicted 3D structure of Fip-lti1/Fip-lti2 shows no residue in disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>, the predicted 3D structure of Fip-lti1/Fip-lti2 resembles the FIP typical structure with a fibronectin type III (FNIII) folder, which represents a transition between the seven <italic>&#946;</italic>-stranded s-type and the eight <italic>&#946;</italic>-stranded h-type topologies.

Effects of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 on Hepatic Necrosis</title><p>Protective function of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 in mice with Con A-induced hepatic necrosis was assessed by histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Liver sections from the control group showed normal liver architecture and cell morphology. Con A administration led to remarkable histological changes including extensive vacuolization and necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration in vast areas.

To investigate protective concentrations of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2, an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment with L02 cells that were analyzed by MTT assay was performed. After Con A was included, the viability of L02 cells was significantly lower compared with the control group.

Effect of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 on Expressing Components of the Signaling Pathway</title><p>It was proposed that immunity, oxidation, and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of liver injury induced by Con A.

Discussion</title><p>Fungal immunomodulatory protein, isolated from higher basidiomycetes, is a class of small molecule protein with immunomodulatory activity. Purification of FIPs from wild or cultivated mushrooms remains low yielded, complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Such effort is now focused on identifying new FIPs by other molecular methods and characterizing their expression. To obtain sufficient FIPs for practical applications, many genetic engineering approaches have been performed to improve the yields of FIPs. So far, the most effective system to express new FIPs is DNA recombination. However, the expression systems are faced with the disadvantages of long growth cycle, high cost, and complicated purification procedure. In this article, for the first time, we tried to isolate new FIP genes from genomic DNA data and express them to obtain Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2. This bioinformatics approach is time-saving and efficient. Furthermore, we identified the immunomodulatory activity of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2.</p><p>In this study, normal human hepatic L02 cells and mice were utilized as models to investigate the protective function of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 and the potential molecular mechanisms in Con A-induced liver injury. We demonstrated (<italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic>) that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 protected liver cells against Con A-induced injury. Both Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 can retard proinflammation cytokine production and exert antioxidative activity. Autoimmune hepatitis is a liver inflammatory disease with increasing incidence. No effective treatment is available because of a lack of mechanistic understanding of this disease [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Con A-induced liver injury is a well-established model to investigate mechanisms of immunity-associated liver diseases [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and we used this model to elucidate the beneficial functions of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2.</p><p>Furthermore, we showed that the protective effect of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 was likely mediated through modulating the GATA3/T-bet pathway-mediated restoration of Th1/Th2 balance. CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells consist of three populations; each demonstrates a distinctive pattern of major cytokine production: IFN-<italic>&#947;</italic>-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th1), IL-4-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th2), and IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17). Since the discovery of the importance of Th1-Th2 balance in mice in 1986, many studies have shown how imbalanced Th1-Th2 functions may upset immune homeostasis and cause liver injury [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that the hepatoprotective effect of Fip-lti1, Fip-lti2, and LZ-8 similarly correlated with ameliorating the imbalanced Th1/Th2 (IFN-<italic>&#947;</italic>/IL-4) function, which was likely mediated through modulating the expression of GATA3 and T-bet in the spleen. In addition, the loss of functional Tregs was attributed to the abnormal inflammatory and immune response detected in liver injury and sufficient expression of cell surface markers CD4 and CD25 and the transcription factor FoxP3 is indispensable for Tregs functions [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We showed that a supplement of regulatory T cells contributed to the recovery of liver Con A-induced injury.</p><p>The immune response process can facilitate the oxidative and inflammatory reaction [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. MDA is a reliable index reflecting the extent of cell injury. SOD indicates a cellular capacity to scavenge excessive ROS. It has been suggested that an imbalanced SOD and MDA level was involved in the pathogenesis of liver injury [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Inflammatory cytokines including TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, and IL-6 are involved in initiating and aggravating the inflammation. Our results showed that the levels of TNF-<italic>&#945;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, IL-6, and MDA were significantly higher, and the SOD activity was lower (both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>), with Con A treatment compared to the control group. However, such proinflammatory cytokine production and oxidative markers were effectively retarded by administering Fip-lti1, Fip-lti2, or LZ-8. The results suggest that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties as demonstrated in Con A-induced liver injury.</p><p>The results were shown that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 could effectively regulate the level of IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>. In order to understand the role of NLRP3 inflammatory complexes in the Fip-lti1- and Fip-lti2-decreased IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic> production, the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 of inflammatory body components was analyzed, and the results showed that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 could inhibit the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 induced by Con A.</p><p>Earlier studies suggested that NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B was critical in the liver injury [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B is activated by various stimuli [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Clearly, NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B initiates and regulates the inflammatory process and is responsible for the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. As an inhibitor of NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>Bp65, I<italic>&#954;</italic>B<italic>&#945;</italic> is governed by I<italic>&#954;</italic>B kinases (IKKs) [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. IKK complex consists of IKK-<italic>&#945;</italic> and IKK-<italic>&#946;</italic>. NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B subunit p65 is activated via the phosphorylation and degradation of the I<italic>&#954;</italic>B<italic>&#945;</italic>. Our results showed that the levels of p-I<italic>&#954;</italic>B<italic>&#945;</italic> and p-NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>Bp65 in Con A-induced livers and L02 cells were significantly lower following Fip-lti1 or Fip-lti2 treatment, suggesting the anti-inflammatory properties of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 are mediated through regulating the NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B pathway. Activation of the NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B signaling pathway only induced the production of pro-IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, and the maturation of IL-1b requires the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and further cleavage by caspase-1.</p><p>In response to oxidative stress, cells upregulate transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) and regulates heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. HO-1 can regulate the oxidative reaction and control ROS levels. In this study, both Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions were downregulated in the Con A-treated group. Such downregulations can be blunted with the Fip-lti1, Fip-lti2, or LZ-8 treatment, suggesting that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 might relieve the oxidative stress through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. We hypothesized that increased Nrf2 activation by Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 will prevent NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B activation and result in lower inflammation in Con A-challenged cells. And the result has shown that siRNA of Nrf2 prevented the secretion of IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>, which was activated by the NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B/NLRP3 pathway; in addition, it mitigated the effect on the NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B pathway. The differentiation of T helper (Th) cells is critically dependent on cytokine milieu. The innate immune monocytes produce IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic> which can affect the development of Th cells. A possible mechanism of action of Fip-lti is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>This study mainly focused on investigating the protective effect of Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 in hepatic injury models and the underling pathway. We note the differences in both <italic>&#946;</italic>1and <italic>&#946;</italic>2 regions between Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2. Both <italic>&#946;</italic>1and <italic>&#946;</italic>2 regions are located in the FNIII fold, which is considered important for different immunomodulatory functions [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our structural comparative analysis indicates that Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 may possess different immunomodulatory functions, which we will elucidate in our future experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, Fip-lti1 and Fip-lti2 effectively attenuated the Con A-induced liver oxidative injury <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> via the Nrf2/NF-<italic>&#954;</italic>B/NLRP3/IL-1<italic>&#946;</italic>-mediated pathway, which restored the Th1/Th2 balance.
