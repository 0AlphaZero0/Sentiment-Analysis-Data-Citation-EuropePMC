HNSCC are characterized by impaired functions of immune effector cells, dysregulated cytokine profiles and an increased frequency of intra-tumoral and circulating regulatory T cells (Treg).<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, Treg in HNSCC patients express high levels of immune checkpoint ligands such as CTLA4 and effectively downregulate anti-tumor functions of cytotoxic T cells.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref></sup> Immune therapies aiming to rejuvenate patients&#8217; immune responses are expected to have beneficial effects on disease control<sup><xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref></sup> and represent a critical addition to the standard of care therapy for patients with HNSCC.</p><p>An EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, is an established immunotherapy for HNSCC patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref></sup> Cetuximab improves survival when added to radiation therapy in locally advanced HNSCC or cytotoxic chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref></sup> However, the response rate for cetuximab monotherapy in HNSCC patients is less than 15%, and our studies suggest this might be due to diverse effects of cetuximab on immune cells that simultaneously enhance cytotoxic functions of effector T and NK cells and promote the expansion of CTLA4+ Treg.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that the addition of a CTLA4 inhibitor, such as ipilimumab, to a cetuximab-based regimen might promote the ablation of Treg and contribute to a better clinical response. Based on this rationale, we conducted a phase I clinical trial in which patients with locally advanced HNSCC received a curative-intent combination of cetuximab, ipilimumab and radiation therapy (RT). Immune recovery was a secondary objective of the trial, and thus patients were immunologically monitored using standard immune measures. The availability of serially collected plasma specimens provided an opportunity for the isolation and molecular characterization of circulating exosomes.</p><p>Exosomes are membrane-bound nano-sized (30&#8211;150nm) extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are derived from the endocytic compartments of parental cells and are present in all body fluids.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup> Among a broad variety of surface molecules exosomes carry are immune checkpoint receptors and ligands, and in their lumen are nucleic acids (mRNA, miRNAs, DNA) as well as numerous soluble factors and enzymes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref></sup> The luminal content of exosomes is protected from external enzymatic degradation and thus can be safely conveyed to recipient cells. Because exosome content partly recapitulates that of parent tumor cells, <sup><xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref></sup> and because T cell-derived exosomes have been reported to reflect the molecular attributes of parent T lymphocytes, <sup><xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> plasma-derived exosomes may serve as biomarkers of prognosis, response to therapy and outcome in cancer.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup></p><p>We reported earlier that relative to healthy donors, HNSCC patients with active disease had significantly increased levels of circulating exosomes, with a high enrichment in tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) and in immune suppressive factors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>-<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup> The levels of CTLA4 and PD-L1 ligands these exosomes carried on their surface correlated with disease activity, lymph node involvement and tumor stage.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> Recently, we have succeeded in the separation by immunocapture of CD3(+)T cell-derived exosomes and CD3(-) TEX-enriched exosomes from HNSCC patients&#8217; plasma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup> This antibody-based separation of exosome subsets allowed for the identification of the cargo of exosomes derived from different parent cells (i.e., T cells vs. tumor cells) as also described by us for melanoma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref></sup> Interestingly, TEX, as well as T cell-derived exosomes, carried similarly high levels of immunosuppressive markers in patients with advanced HNSCC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> Moreover, T cell-derived exosomes in HNSCC patients with stage III/IV disease carried significantly higher levels of CD15s, a marker of functional Treg, <sup><xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref></sup> than did T cell-derived exosomes in patients with stage I/Il disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup> These results suggested that plasma-derived exosomes of patients with HNSCC could serve as an easily accessible, non-invasive &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; of disease activity and stage. In this study, we used plasma samples from the patients enrolled in phase I clinical trial for the isolation of exosomes, separation of TEX from T cell-derived exosomes and evaluation of their potential role as biomarkers of response to therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>This study is the first to investigate the use of exosomes and their subsets in the monitoring of HNSCC patients&#8217; responses to oncological therapy. Of the 18 HNSCC patients treated with combination therapy (cetuximab, ipilimumab, and IMRT) in this clinical trial, five (28%) experienced tumor recurrence during the first 24 months of follow-up. Thirteen (72%) patients had no evidence of tumor progression during the same 24-month period. The study objective was to evaluate the predictive value of plasma-derived CD3(+) exosomes as surrogates for T lymphocytes and of CD3(-)TEX-enriched exosomes as surrogates for tumor cells. Instead of monitoring isolated lymphocytes or obtaining tumor biopsies, the profiling of exosomes derived from 1 mL of plasma was used to distinguish patients who benefited from oncological therapy from those who did not. By comparing the changes in exosome loads and cargos prior to and during therapy in patients who recurred vs those who remained NED in the 2-year follow-up period, it was possible to evaluate the potential role of plasma exosomes as biomarkers of the tumor as well as immune cells in cancer. Remarkably, despite the small patient numbers, which were limited to patients participating in the clinical trial, the results reached statistical significance in many, albeit not all, measurements of exosome molecular cargos.</p><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Time points for exosome monitoring</title><p>Exosomes were studied in plasma obtained prior to surgery (at baseline) and at weeks 5 and 14 of therapy. These time points were selected since patients received cetuximab-RT for 5 weeks, then began treatment with ipilimumab given in four doses for 12 weeks and completed it at week 14 (Supplemental Figure 1). Specimens for week 14 for two patients (#7 and #8) were not available for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Exosome protein levels correlate with response to therapy</title><p>Exosome protein levels in patients&#8217; plasma were higher at baseline in all patients relative to healthy donors, as also previously reported, <sup><xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup> but increased during therapy only in patients who experienced a recurrence within the 24-month follow-up period. In contrast, plasma exosome levels in 13 patients with NED decreased relative to pre-therapy levels (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(a)</xref>). At baseline and throughout therapy, exosome plasma levels were higher in HNSCC patients than in healthy volunteers.

The decrease from baseline in plasma exosome levels at week 5 in patients with no evident disease was highly significant (**p &lt; 0.005). These changes in plasma exosome protein levels could be potentially related to the decreased production of exosomes by the tumor responding to therapy. In contrast, in patients with recurrence increased levels of total plasma exosomes suggest more active exosome production due to progressive disease.<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/2162402X.2019.1593805-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Changes in protein concentrations of circulating exosomes for HNSCC patients prior to and during therapy.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the moderate increase in eTreg-derived (CD3(+)CD15s+) exosomes in patients with recurrence at week 5 shown in <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(b</xref>), paralleled increased levels of total CD3(+) exosomes (see <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(a</xref>)). This parallel increase suggested that eTreg expansion contributes to the increased total CD3(+) exosome fraction in response to cetuximab in patients with recurrence. In contrast, in patients with NED after therapy, the CD3(+) total exosomes, as well as CD15s+ eTreg exosomes, remained at the baseline levels. Taken together, these data imply that cetuximab-driven increases from baseline in levels of total CD3+ and CD3+ CD15s+ exosomes as measured on week 15 of therapy were more pronounced in patients with recurrence than in patients with NED.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2007"><title>Changes in levels of CD3(+) exosomes carrying PD-L1 and/or CTLA4</title><p>Expression of checkpoint inhibitory ligands, PD-L1 and CTLA4, on T cells has been associated with upregulated suppression in Treg<sup><xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref></sup> and with negative signaling of T cells in the TME.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup> At <italic>baseline</italic>, levels of CD3(+)PD-L1+ exosomes were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in patients who later recurred vs patients who remained disease free (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(a</xref>)).

Advantages of using plasma exosomes in place of immune cells for non-invasive monitoring of the tumor and immune cell responses to immunotherapies are obvious. In this &#8220;proof of principle&#8221; study, HNSCC patients whose cancers recurred vs patients who remained disease free in the 2-year follow-up period had measurable and distinctly recognizable changes in exosome molecular cargos at baseline and during therapy. Despite the small patient cohort in this clinical trial, total exosome levels, TEX/total exosome ratios, phenotypic characteristics of TEX or of T cell-derived exosomes were shown to discriminate patients who responded or did not respond to oncological therapy. It is important to note that exosomes were monitored in the context of a clinical trial, where therapy and clinical events were strictly recorded and correlated. While the reported data await validation of the role of exosomes as biomarkers of response to oncological therapy, the exosome-based monitoring platform emerges as an advantageous strategy that allows for non-invasive acquisition of data that can be used for establishing correlations between immune and clinical endpoints.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0003-S2001"><title>Study design</title><p>This study used specimens collected in phase I clinical trial designed to identify the recommended stage II dose of ipilimumab when administered with a standard combination of cetuximab and IMRT for high- or intermediate-risk patients with locally advanced HNSCC (see: NCT01935921).
