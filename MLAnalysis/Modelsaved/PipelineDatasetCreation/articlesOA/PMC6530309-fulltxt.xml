A recent meta-analysis of 47 studies found that burned-out doctors were more likely to provide poor quality care because of reduced professionalism, and they were more likely to be associated with poor patient satisfaction and incidents that jeopardise patient safety.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is a high prevalence of distress among doctors in the UK, with a systematic review of 30 studies showing that 17%&#8211;52% of doctors have psychiatric morbidity,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> higher than the prevalence rate of 19% in the general population,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and 31%&#8211;54% of doctors have a type of burnout called emotional exhaustion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Little is known, however, about whether occupational distress raises the risk of health problems (eg, insomnia, binge-drinking) that might compel doctors to be absent from work or take sick leave resulting in understaffing and a risk to patient safety.</p><p>Occupational distress can be described as a syndrome comprising burnout, depression, maladaptive coping strategies and other symptoms.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The potential implications for risks to patient safety due to sickness-absence make it useful to investigate the impact of different types of occupational distress on the relative risk of: (a) behaviours that have an impact on doctors&#8217; health such as alcohol/drug use and binge-eating; (b) health issues such as sleep disturbances and daily or weekly symptoms of ill health (eg, headaches or fatigue). This is the first study to examine such a broad spectrum of health consequences among doctors. The other innovation of the current study is that, whereas many previous studies have sampled US doctors<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or individual specialties such as oncology<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and surgery,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> this study sheds new light on the impact of occupational distress on health problems among doctors in the UK.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Does occupational distress increase the risk of doctors using alcohol or drugs?</title><p>Workers experiencing occupational distress are more likely to regularly drink alcohol, binge-drink or use drugs as a method of coping.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Doctors, on average, report equivalent or lower rates of alcohol abuse than the general population,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but daily alcohol consumption or binge-drinking that does not meet the threshold for diagnosis of alcoholism is still problematic,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and symptomatic of psychological distress. In the USA, 10% of doctors drink alcohol daily and 8% report severe alcohol or drug misuse or dependence at some point in their lives.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Prescription drug abuse is particularly problematic because doctors are up to five times more likely to use prescription drugs than the general population due to easier access or familiarity with prescription drugs, for&#160;example, 24% of US doctors use benzodiazepine and 40% use minor opiates.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There are many reasons why doctors use substances&#8212;not all of which are to do with being distressed&#8212;therefore research is needed to clarify the proportion of doctors who use alcohol/drugs as a way of coping with occupational distress. The coping function of alcohol/drug use among doctors, as with the general population, is plausible because alcohol and many drugs have psychoactive properties, for&#160;example, prescription drugs such as benzodiazepine and opiates; illicit drugs such as Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD). Occupational distress is known to predict alcohol misuse in the general population,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but little is known about whether, for example, doctors with high levels of burnout are at greater risk of using alcohol or drugs (including prescription or legally purchased drugs), and whether other types of occupational distress (eg, psychiatric morbidity, negative coping strategies) have similar effects. Little is also known about the impact of other job factors such as work experience on the risk of doctors engaging in substance use.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Does occupational distress increase the risk of doctors&#8217; binge-eating?</title><p>Like alcohol or drug use, binge-eating is more prevalent among workers experiencing occupational distress<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> but, unlike substance use, little is known about binge-eating rates among doctors and risk factors. Binge-eating can be defined as eating a larger amount of food than most people eat in one sitting and finding oneself unable to control one&#8217;s eating.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Binge-eating, like alcohol or drug use, is a common method of coping with psychological distress because eating offers an initial sense of comfort.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> The initial comfort is, however, followed by feelings of shame or guilt, thus exacerbating distress.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This is one of the first studies to assess the prevalence of binge-eating among UK doctors and to offer insights into whether doctors who binge-eat experience unpleasant emotions after bingeing. This study will also offer new insights into the impact of different types of occupational distress (eg, work-life imbalance) which, together with analysing substance abuse by doctors, will reveal the consequences of occupational distress for doctors&#8217; health-related behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Does occupational distress increase the risk of doctors having sleep disturbances?</title><p>There have been calls for research into the connection between sleep problems and doctors&#8217; health,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but most previous studies have focused on sleep deprivation rather than sleep disturbances that have a psychological aetiology, for&#160;example, trouble falling/staying asleep due to worry. Sleep deprivation can be defined as the lack of the opportunity to sleep, or more simply as sleeping too few hours each day. Sleep deprivation is associated with depression,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> burnout,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> suicide risk<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and immunity or cardiovascular health problems<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> among doctors but sleep deprivation in itself is not necessarily a sign of psychological distress. Doctors who work long shifts<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> or lack block-scheduled shifts<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> sleep too few hours because they have no choice. Therefore, rather than measuring sleep deprivation, this study measured types of sleep disturbance with a psychological aetiology such as trouble falling asleep, waking up prematurely because of worrying about work and insomnia. It is plausible that the risk of these types of sleep disturbance is higher among doctors suffering from work-life imbalance, psychiatric morbidity and other types of occupational distress. This study will evaluate whether UK doctors suffering from occupational distress have an increased risk of sleep disturbances.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Does occupational distress increase the risk of doctors presenting with ill health?</title><p>There is some research about the physical health of doctors in some specialties (eg, oncology),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but research is needed to assess whether occupational distress predicts the risk of doctors from various specialties suffering from daily or frequent headaches, gastrointestinal problems and other physical symptoms. Physical health has a complex range of causes (eg, health behaviours, genetics and infections), but people who are distressed are more susceptible to infections because psychological distress weakens the immune system.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The important question, therefore, is the relative risk of ill health symptoms, comparing doctors with and without occupational distress. We recognise that the physical health of doctors is shaped by a complex range of factors&#8212;only one of which is occupational distress&#8212;because working in a clinical environment can pose some risk to physical health.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This study is one of the first to shed light on the impact of occupational distress on ill health symptoms among UK doctors.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Study aims</title><p>This study aims to assess whether doctors suffering from occupational distress have an increased risk of (i) using alcohol or drugs (illicit, non-illicit); (ii) binge-eating; (iii) having sleep disturbances and (iv) presenting with physical health symptoms. This study will extend previous literature about occupational distress in medicine, which has focused on burnout and psychiatric morbidity,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> by measuring and defining occupational distress in additional ways, or&#160;example, work-life imbalance, job effort, coping with stress through self-blame or through substance use, drawing on previous literature highlighting the multiple dimensions of occupational distress.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This study will also provide new insights into the prevalence of alcohol/drug use, binge-eating, sleep and ill health problems among UK doctors, extending previous research about doctors from other countries or individual specialties.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6</xref>

We thus consulted 15 doctors before the main study, using online software (<italic>Qualtrics</italic>). The pilot study sought the doctors&#8217; feedback (through open-ended questions) about the relevance and clarity of the questionnaires. Doctors gave generally positive feedback. Some minor amendments included revising the wording of demographic questions, questionnaire instructions and reducing the number of questionnaires to eliminate similar measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>The research reported in this article is an analysis of data collected at the baseline stage of a randomised controlled trial (protocol #NCT02838290) of the effect of an intervention on doctors&#8217; levels of occupational distress and health problems. The trial took place from July to November 2016. Due to the complexity of the trial, this paper reports a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants and study size</title><p>Doctors took part in this study online (<italic>Qualtrics</italic>). They learnt about the study through medical Royal Colleges, NHS trusts and the British Medical Association (BMA). To prevent selection bias based on specialty, we invited all Royal Colleges from which nine agreed to distribute information about the research to their members. To prevent selection bias due to an NHS trust&#8217;s reputation we randomly selected 25% NHS trusts. From the ones possible to reach, nine distributed invitations to this study. The third source of data was the BMA&#8217;s research panel. The majority of UK medical doctors are members of the BMA and any of them can join the BMA&#8217;s research panel; therefore, this panel represented a broad spectrum of doctors. All medical doctors working in the UK were included in the baseline data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measures</title><p><italic>Outcome measures:</italic> doctors completed a variety of questionnaires assessing health problems. In some cases, we analysed responses to individual items in addition to the average of whole questionnaires because this offered richer insights into the prevalence of certain types of substance misuse (eg, binge-drinking), different symptoms of ill health (eg, backache), different signs of binge-eating (eg, uncontrollable eating) and sleep disturbances (eg, trouble falling asleep).

For sleep problems, we determined the cut-off points based on the guidance for the ISI.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For each item doctors reporting moderate or severe sleep problems were noted as having the symptom present, and reporting no/mild sleep problems were noted as having the symptom absent. Doctors&#8217; responses about using substances to cope with stress were dichotomised as either not doing so, or using substances a little bit, to a medium extent or a lot. Frequency of drinking was divided into drinking alcohol less than two to three times a week and more than two to three times a week. Ill health symptoms were recoded such that the presence of each symptom meant experiencing once/twice per week or more often (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for more details).

Five per cent of doctors met the criteria for alcohol dependence, but the rest of doctors did not report significant impairments in their occupational or other functioning as a result of drinking alcohol. In terms of illicit/non-illicit drug use, 44% of doctors used some type of drugs but almost all were non-illicit drugs: 3% of doctors used prescription opioids, 2% used benzodiazepines, 5% used sleep medication, 5% smoked tobacco, 7% used herbal or homeopathic remedies and 35% used over-the-counter medicines. Illegal drug use was rare: only one doctor reported cocaine use and one doctor used amyl nitrite. No doctor reported using amphetamines, anabolic steroids, cannabis, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, khat, LSD, magic mushrooms, mephedrone, methadone, methamphetamine or tranquillisers.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Are distressed doctors more likely to use alcohol/drugs?</title><p>Coping with stress was the reason given by many doctors for drinking alcohol or taking drugs, with 34% saying that they used substances in order to feel better, and 22% used substances to help them get through stressful events. <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows logistic regression results analysing the effects of occupational distress and job factors on alcohol and drug use. The model significance testing shows that the predictors significantly explained variance in doctors using substances to help them get through something (6%), drinking alcohol frequently (38%) and large amounts (12%), binge-drinking (28%) and being alcohol dependent (28%). The predictors did not explain variance in drug use and doctors using substances to feel better (p&gt;0.05). Doctors who coped with stress by using substances had a higher risk of frequent alcohol use, binge-drinking, alcohol dependence and drug use (p&#8804;0.022). The results also show that having more experience working in medicine raised the risk of a doctor drinking alcohol frequently (OR=1.036; p=0.002), but lowered the risk of binge-drinking (OR=0.970; p=0.007). Doctors who worked in a hospital were more likely to drink high amounts of alcohol on a typical day of drinking and to binge-drink (OR&#8805;1.672; p&#8804;0.044). Doctors who reacted to stress by blaming themselves were more likely to use substances to get through something (OR=1.374; p=0.039).

Even taking into consideration whether or not a doctor works in a hospital, the risk of health problems still rises when doctors have signs of occupational distress such as burnout. Previous research showed that distress,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 46</xref> coping strategies<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47&#8211;49</xref> and job factors<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50&#8211;55</xref> are associated with health problems. This study replicates previous findings while demonstrating the generalisability of the effects to a wider range of health issues among UK doctors from various specialties.</p><sec id="s4b1"><title>Alcohol/drug use</title><p>Distressed doctors are more likely to use alcohol, with 22%&#8211;34% of doctors reporting that they use substances to feel better or help them get through stressful events. Doctors who cope with stress by using substances have a higher risk of alcohol dependence (OR=6.165), binge-drinking (OR=6.355), drinking larger amounts of alcohol (OR=2.599) and a higher risk of using alcohol more frequently (OR=18.836). Doctors who react to stress by blaming themselves are more likely to use substances to get through something (OR=1.374). Having more experience working in medicine makes a doctor more likely to drink alcohol frequently (OR=1.036) but lowers the likelihood of binge-drinking (OR=0.970). Doctors who work in a hospital are more likely to drink high amounts of alcohol on a typical day of drinking (OR=1.812) and to binge-drink (OR=1.672). In understanding the effects of occupational distress on alcohol or drug use, the results showed the usefulness of assessing the combined effects of different types of occupational distress, but that, except for psychiatric morbidity, burnout, work-life imbalance and job effort do not individually predict alcohol use. This suggests that occupational distress is best understood as a syndrome when understanding its effect on alcohol use. These findings extend previous studies which show that burnout, depression and psychiatric morbidity individually predict using alcohol dependence/abuse.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 56</xref> The results also show that&#8212;for UK doctors&#8212;occupational distress as a syndrome has no significant effect on legal or illegal drug use. Only doctors who cite substance use as a strategy that they use to cope with stress are significantly more likely to use drugs (OR=1.530)&#8212;and most of these are prescription or over-the-counter drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Binge-eating</title><p>The risks of doctors binge-eating and experiencing negative emotions after over-eating are raised by occupational distress (OR=1.311&#8201;to 1.841), for example, burnout, coping with stress by blaming oneself and work-life imbalance.

The amount of effort that a doctor puts into their job lowers the risk of their suffering from a binge-eating disorder (OR=0.187).

This means that the risk of sleep problems or insomnia exists even if doctors are suffering from just one of these types of occupational distress, which is particularly noticeable with the increase in psychiatric morbidity. The sleep problems doctors experience include trouble falling/staying sleep, worrying about work when trying to sleep, and finding that sleep problems interfere with daily functioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Daily or frequent ill health</title><p>Occupational distress increases the odds of doctors suffering from fatigue, upset stomach or nausea, headaches, acid/indigestion or heartburn, eye strain, diarrhoea and ringing in the ears but not back pain.

These findings extend previous studies which investigate how the working conditions experienced by doctors relate to ill health<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> by showing that occupational distress, especially psychiatric morbidity, increases the risk of physical health problems.

A weakness of this study is that the analysis is cross-sectional. We need future experimental research to test causation between occupational distress and health problems using a longitudinal design, and an evaluation of effect sizes using indicators such as Cohen&#8217;s d. It was not possible to reliably convert odds ratios into Cohen&#8217;s d within the current study because of the limitations of interpreting Cohen&#8217;s d from data with dichotomous outcome variables. We also encourage future research to measure hypotheses that were not possible to test within the current study, for example, whether the risk of gastrointestinal problems among doctors rises with patient caseload or infection exposure.</p><p>It was not possible to calculate the response rate because it was not clear whether all NHS trusts and medical Royal Colleges who agreed to take part in this study actually distributed the invitation and to how many doctors. We are also mindful that some participants might not have been comfortable answering some sensitive questions (eg, about illicit drug or alcohol use), but the risk of response bias was mitigated by allowing doctors to complete confidential self-reported questionnaires. This is a recognised methods of measuring health and health-related behaviours (eg, alcohol intake<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). We also recognise that using individual items from previously validated questionnaires (rather than all items) might have an impact on the validity and reliability of the measurement methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>The meaning of the study: possible implications for clinicians and policymakers</title><p>Occupational distress among doctors has a detrimental effect on the quality of care and patient safety.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This study has revealed that occupational distress also increases the risk of doctors suffering from health problems (OR=1.036&#8201;to 18.836). The impact of occupational distress on ill health could increase levels of sickness-absence among doctors, thus reducing patient safety because of understaffing. Likewise, the impact of occupational distress on substance use and sleep problems could mean that distress indirectly impairs doctors&#8217; fitness to practise, judgement or decision-making because of being intoxicated, hung-over or having disturbed sleep. Therefore, we recommend that doctors&#8217; mentors, supervisors, peers and occupational health support services recognise and act on (1) the prevalence of occupational distress and health problems among doctors; (2) the possibility that occupational distress raises the risk of several health problems and (3) the need to provide early interventions that prevent doctors who are experiencing occupational distress from suffering the long-term health effects of sleep disturbances, frequent symptoms of ill health and adopting negative health behaviours, such as binge-drinking or eating in order to cope.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e153"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-027362.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e154"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-027362.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AM and CK participated in the conception and design of the study.
