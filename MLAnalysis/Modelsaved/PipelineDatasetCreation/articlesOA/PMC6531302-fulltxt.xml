Due to the high incidence of recurrence and metastasis of HCC, patients with HCC typically exhibit poor prognosis <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Clinical routine treatments for HCC include surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as other surgical approaches. However, relapse and metastasis of HCC commonly occur following surgical therapy <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Until now, only one chemotherapeutic drug, Sorafenib (Nexavar, a kinase inhibitor drug), was approved by FDA in 2008 as first-line treatment of HCC <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. However, on average, this drug prolongs the overall survival of HCC patients for only two months <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Several other chemotherapeutic agents, including Dox, cisplatin, mitomycin, and epirubicin, have recently been evaluated for HCC treatment <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, none of them exhibited clear clinical benefits due to their nonspecific biodistributions <italic>in vivo</italic>, which resulted in insufficient drug accumulation in tumors and severe side effects <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In comparison, targeted drug delivery overcomes these challenges by both its passive and active targeting properties. Thus, developing effective HCC targeted drug therapy strategies is in urgent demand.</p><p>The major barrier in developing HCC-targeted drug therapies remains the lack of appropriate tumor biomarkers that serve as specific entry target into the tumor cells to be attacked. Although several biomarkers for HCC tumors have so far been reported, such as folate receptor (FR), asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), transferrin receptor (TfR), epithelial growth factor (EGF), CD44, and integrin receptors <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, none of these receptor-targeted therapeutic strategies exhibit significant benefits in clinical trials until now <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>One earlier study reported that a peptide called SP94 specifically binds to HCC cells <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, and was subsequently used as a promising ligand (of drug-carrier) for HCC-targeted therapy <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. However, the tumor-specific receptor of SP94 expressed on HCC cells remains unknown. Considering the promising HCC therapeutic potential, it is worth identifying the receptor of SP94.</p><p>In this study, we first identified the receptor of SP94 as GRP78, a 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein on the cell membrane of HCC cells. GRP78 is a member of the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) families <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, and has been identified earlier to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that facilitates protein folding and trafficking <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. More importantly, GRP78 serves as a marker for ER stress <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The expression of GRP78 typically increases and GRP78 tends to aggregate on the cell membrane of tumor cells in response to chronic stresses <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, which facilitates evasion of the tumor from immune surveillance. Simultaneously, GRP78 overexpression increases its resistance to apoptosis and tolerance to chemotherapy <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Therefore, GRP78 overexpressed on the cell surface in tumor tissues typically indicate that this type of tumor is invasive and metastatic, representing a highly malignant state of tumor. Thus, patients with tumor cells positive for cell surface GRP78 generally exhibit shorter survival times, poorer treatment effects and higher recurrence rates <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>Targeted drug delivery systems based on GRP78 targeting strategy for other malignant tumors have been described in other recent studies <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; however, few studies investigated the specific functions or target properties of GRP78 in HCC tumor therapy.</p><p>Here, we set out to design a GRP78-targeted HccFn-Dox nanocage structure, in which SP94 was displayed onto the exterior surface of ferritin (from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>) nanocage (HccFn), and the drug Dox was loaded into the cavities of HccFn. Due to the cell surface GRP78-based active targeting property and passive targeting property of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects, together with the high loading efficiency of Dox, our HccFn-Dox nanocages were shown to be a very effective anti-HCC drug delivery system.</p><p>HccFn nanocage possesses three advantages over currently developed anti-HCC drug delivery systems. First, due to the surface display ability of ferritin nanocage, the binding affinity of HccFn nanocage to HCC cells was dramatically increased over 700-fold when compared with SP94 peptides. Second, our experimental data showed that ferritin nanocages from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> possess ultra-high dose of Dox loading capacity, which is an unexpected superiority of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin over ferritin from other species. Third, ferritin nanocages from human or mouse have been reported to interact with several membrane proteins <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. To avoid the targeting interference, as well as maintain the sole HCC targeting ability of SP94 peptide, we chose <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin nanocages without targeting ability as motif to construct HccFn nanocarriers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>GRP78 is a receptor of SP94 peptide</title><p>To identify the receptor of SP94 which is specifically expressed on HCC <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, we incubated HepG2 cells with biotinylated SP94. Next, a chemical cross-linker DTSSP was added to stabilize the interaction of SP94 and its potential receptors. Following SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining identified a sharp band at ~72 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), which was then digested with trypsin. As listed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, 11 tryptic peptides were identified as GRP78 fragments using searching algorithms provided by MASCOT software. The coverage of the identified peptides was 23.55% of the GRP78 sequence, together with a probability score of 34.01 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C), suggesting that the protein immunoprecipitated from the HepG2 cell surface was highly homologous to the GRP78 protein. Importantly, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using mouse anti-GRP78 mAbs generated positive results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). Together, these assays strongly suggested that GRP78 is the membrane receptor recognized by the SP94 peptide.</p><p>When GRP78 expression was silenced using GRP78-specific siRNA in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>A), the binding activity of biotin-SP94 to GRP78 was decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E), whereas transient overexpression of GRP78 in 3T3 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>B) increased biotin-SP94 binding activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F). These results further support that membrane GRP78 is the receptor of SP94 peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>A nanocaged drug carrier HccFn-Dox with high stability is developed</title><p>Having verified that SP94 specifically binds GRP78&#8212;a marker of HCC, we developed a novel nanocaged drug carrier HccFn-Dox nanocages (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A) suitable to specifically kill HCC tumor cells. First, SP94 was linked to the N-terminal of the ferritin subunit to be properly oriented and displayed on the exterior surface of the ferritin (Fn) nanocages by a genetic engineering approach (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), then Dox was loaded into the cavities of HccFn nanocages according to our previous report <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>After these nanocages were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, we characterized their physical properties using size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) and Native-PAGE analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). Two parameters were measured to ensure Dox was successfully loaded into our HccFn-Dox constructs. First, a specific absorption peak of Dox at 485 nm was detected in HccFn-Dox (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), but not in the control nanocages (Fn and HccFn). Second, a red (color of Dox) band on the gel was present in HccFn-Dox, not, however in Fn or HccFn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). Importantly, the loading of Dox failed to affect the self-assembled spherical cage-like structure and monodisperse state of HccFn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C-D). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, our HccFn-Dox displayed a well-defined morphology, exhibiting a self-assembled spherical cage-like structure. Also, HccFn-Dox nanocages exhibited uniform size distributions, similar to those of the two controls. The average radius of HccFn-Dox, HccFn and Fn in solution were 8.7, 8.6, and 6.7 nm, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Importantly, the amount of encapsulated Dox inside of an HccFn nanocage was determined to be 404 (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>). The Dox loading capability of HccFn was more than 10-fold higher than the average level of current reported ferritin based nanocarriers <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>HccFn-Dox was stable under physiological conditions (pH=7.4), as indicated by lack of Dox release during a 72 h period of dialysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). However, at pH=5.0, Dox was rapidly released from the HccFn nanocages, and the portion of Dox remaining inside the cage decreased by 80% within 72 h (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G). Considering that the internal pH of lysosomes is approximately 5.0, HccFn nanocages most likely release their cargo once they are taken up by the lysosomal pathway downstream of the receptor internalization process.</p></sec><sec><title>HccFn-Dox nanocages specifically target HCC tumor both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Following the successful construction of the drug nanocarrier HccFn-Dox (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), we next tested whether HccFn-Dox specifically target HCC tumors, first in <italic>vitro</italic>, then<italic> in vivo</italic>.</p><p>HccFn were labeled with FITC and the binding of HccFn to HCC tumor cells was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, HccFn specifically bound to the membrane of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 <italic>in vitro,</italic> not however, the control Fn. The binding affinity of HccFn to HepG2 cells was calculated based on the flow cytometry (FACS) data. Results demonstrated that the binding affinity of HccFn to HepG2 cells was significantly higher (<italic>K</italic>d &#8804; 1 nM) than that of free SP94 peptide (<italic>K</italic>d &gt; 700 nM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). The cellular uptake of HccFn was reduced after GRP78 gene knockdown in HepG2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref>), which further demonstrated that HccFn is taken up by the HepG2 cells via the interaction with GRP78.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the Dox release from HccFn nanocages occurs in endo/lysosomes, we incubated HepG2 cells with HccFn-Dox, followed by Lamp1 (a lysosomal marker) staining of live cells. After rapid binding of HccFn-Dox to the surface of HepG2 cells, the fluorescence signal of Dox merged with that of lysosome. Merging of these two signals occurred within 1h, and after 24 h, the majority of Dox was released from lysosome and transported into the cell nucleus. These results strongly suggest that HccFn-Dox nanocages are endocytosed into lysosomes whereupon Dox is released, before diffusing into the nucleus and inducing tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C).</p><p>To show whether HccFn-Dox specifically target HCC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, Cy5.5-HccFn-Dox were intravenously (<italic>i.v.</italic>) injected into mice subcutaneously bearing HCC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D, Cy5.5-HccFn-Dox nanocages specifically accumulated in HepG2 tumor cells, while accumulation of control nanocage Cy5.5-Fn-Dox in the tumor area was significantly lower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D; Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>, S8). In addition to the tumor, liver and kidney, as the main organs for protein nanocages metabolism <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, also exhibited HccFn-Dox and Fn-Dox accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref>). Moreover, accumulation of Dox in the tumor area of HccFn-Dox treated mice was also significantly higher than that of Fn-Dox treated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref>).</p><p>Both our <italic>in vitro</italic> and<italic> in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated that HccFn-Dox nanocages specifically target HCC tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, B, D). Moreover, the accumulation of HccFn-Dox in tumor occurs to be dose-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E; Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref>). Above all, these results indicate that HccFn-Dox nanocages specifically targeted HCC tumor.</p></sec><sec><title>HccFn-Dox nanocages deliver Dox effectively into HCC tumors, with low toxicity and long drug retention time</title><p>As our HccFn-Dox nanocages were found to specifically target HCC tumors, we next examined whether these nanocages effectively deliver the drug Dox into HCC tumors.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, HccFn-Dox nanocages exhibited a longer drug retention time in plasma of mice than free Dox, suggesting that HccFn-Dox nanocages improved the levels of Dox retained in systemic circulation and facilitated time-dependent drug accumulation in tumors.</p><p>At 4h post-injection <italic>i.v.</italic> to mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumors, the tumor tissue was gradually infiltrated by HccFn-Dox, as indicated by the color change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). This result indicated that HccFn-Dox were successfully delivered into tumor cells.</p><p>Next, we studied the pharmacokinetic behavior of HccFn-Dox by tracking the fluorescence signal of Dox. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C-E, at 1 h post-injection, Dox mainly accumulated in tumors, but not in other major organs except liver and kidney (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C), suggesting that HccFn-Dox treatment will incur little toxic side effects on heart, spleen, lung or brain (further supported by the data from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, 4E). The amount of Dox accumulated in liver and kidney decreased rapidly at 4h post-injection and was almost completely eliminated at 24h post-injection, while the amount of Dox in tumors was kept relatively constant over the period studied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, 4E). Together, these results indicated that HccFn-Dox represents as an effective drug nanocarrier characterized by high biosafety, a large portion of HccFn-Dox injected into mice was effectively delivered to tumors, and those not delivered to tumors were rapidly metabolized in liver and kidney. In contrast, tumor-targeting of HccFn-Dox nanocages is likely to be based on an active GRP78-mediated process. As a result, the drug cannot be easily eliminated from the body; instead, it is likely to be endocytosed into lysosomes and transported into cell nuclei, where it induces tumor cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>HccFn-Dox nanocages effectively kill HCC tumors</title><p>To test whether HccFn-Dox nanocages effectively kill HCC tumors, we determined the appropriate dosage of HccFn-Dox nanocages by first performing a tolerability study.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, injection of HccFn-Dox at 20 mg/kg Dox equivalents to healthy BALB/c mice caused little visible effect since the body weight did not change. When HccFn-Dox nanocages were <italic>i.v.</italic> injected at 25 or 30 mg/kg Dox equivalents, the body weight gradually decreased before recovering to the levels of the control group. However, the recovery time following treatment of 30 mg/kg Dox equivalents was considerably longer than that for 25 mg/kg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). In addition, blood chemistry and immune response parameters upon injection of HccFn-Dox at 25 mg/kg Dox equivalents failed to show significant differences compared to either HccFn- or PBS-injected mice (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). Therefore, we chose HccFn-Dox at 25 mg/kg Dox equivalents for subsequent antitumor studies. In addition, we found that HccFn-Dox at 30 mg/kg Dox equivalents was the maximum dose tolerated by healthy mice, as their body weights still gradually recovered after the 11<sup>th</sup> day after injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). In comparison, the maximum tolerated dose for a single administration of free Dox was only 5 mg/kg <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. This difference in drug tolerance clearly demonstrated that the encapsulation of Dox into HccFn nanocages significantly improves the tolerance of mice to Dox, thus enabling higher concentrations of Dox to be used in therapy.</p><p>To test its therapeutic effects, we<italic> i.v.</italic> injected HccFn-Dox at 25 mg/kg Dox equivalents into mice subcutaneously bearing HCC tumors, with the first dose administrated at day 9 (when tumors reached ~50 mm<sup>3</sup>) and the second at day 34 post tumor implantation. We also administrated the same dose of non-targeted liposomal Dox (Doxil) (25 mg/kg Dox equivalents), Dox (5 mg/kg) as control. The tumor growth was significantly inhibited in HccFn-Dox administrated mice, while the tumors of the control groups grew rapidly and reached above 1,000 mm<sup>3</sup> at day 36 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). We also found complete tumor elimination from 4 of 6 HccFn-Dox-administrated mice, and all the HccFn-Dox administrated mice showed significant tumor necrosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E). In addition, all HccFn-Dox administered mice survived for up to 90 d (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D), with less than 10% weight loss after each drug application, as well as fast weight recovery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). In contrast, the average survival times for mice injected with Doxil, free Dox, HccFn, or PBS were less than 36 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). Importantly, while application of Doxil effectively reduced the tumor growth rate, these mice died quickly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D), suggesting that at this dose, Doxil is highly toxic.</p><p>To further test the toxicity of HccFn-Dox <italic>in vivo</italic>, we evaluated multiple dose toxicity of HccFn-Dox. We injected HccFn-Dox intravenously at 5 mg/kg Dox equivalents into HCC tumors bearing mice, twice a week, 10 times in total. Multiple dosing <italic>i.v.</italic> administrations of HccFn-Dox also significantly suppressed the tumor growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>A). Importantly, HccFn-Dox administered mice showed minimal weight loss even after 10 doses of <italic>i.v.</italic> administrations of HccFn-Dox, while the mice failed to tolerate 5 doses of same concentration of free Dox or Doxil, indicating that HccFn-Dox exhibits excellent biosafety in mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>B). In two months after first administration, HccFn-Dox administered mice exhibited no marked weight loss and much longer survival time (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>C) than other groups (mice injected with Doxil, free Dox, HccFn, or PBS). This data indicated that HccFn-Dox is well tolerated in mice, showed low multiple dose toxicity.</p><p>Together, these results demonstrated the effective antitumor activity and less toxicity of HccFn-Dox, even compared to clinically approved Doxil.</p></sec><sec><title>HccFn-Dox nanocages suppress lung metastasis of HCC</title><p>Due to its high metastasis rate, HCC is commonly fatal <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In this study, we found that knockdown of GRP78 suppressed the migration of HCC cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>), indicating that GRP78 plays a role in the invasion and metastasis of HCC. Therefore, we hypothesized that GRP78 is suitable to be used as a therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.</p><p>As the lung is the most easily affected organ when extrahepatic metastases occur <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, we established a lung metastasis model of HCC to investigate the above hypothesis. HepG2-Luc cells (HepG2 cells stably transfected with a luciferase gene) were <italic>i.v.</italic> injected into nude mice, in which metastatic HCC tumor nodules were formed in lungs at 14-18 days post injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). After Cy5.5-HccFn-Dox was <italic>i.v.</italic> injected, it effectively accumulated in lung metastasis tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B), with a significantly higher fluorescent signal compared to that in the healthy lung (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref>). Moreover, FITC-HccFn was shown to specifically recognize small HCC nodules in lung metastasis tissues from HCC bearing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C).

Statistical analysis of the fluorescence signal detected at day 28 in the metastatic HCC tumor nodules confirmed these results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E, right). At day 45, the number of metastatic HCC tumor nodules in the lung of HccFn-Dox treated group was significantly lower than that of control groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>F). In addition, 4 of 6 HccFn-Dox administered mice survived for up to 105 d (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D).

The <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin nanocage we used in this study possesses ultra-high Dox loading capacity, is a more efficient nanodrug carrier than currently reported ferritin nanodrug carriers <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. We found that our GRP78-targeted HccFn-Dox drug delivery system significantly suppressed HCC tumor growth, and even eradicated tumors both in mice bearing subcutaneous and lung metastatic HCC tumor.</p><p>The research for HCC-targeted drugs lasts for decades due to lack of appropriate biomarkers, which is the major barrier in developing HCC-targeted drug therapy <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Therefore, the identification of GRP78 as a biomarker for HCC represents an important progress in the field of HCC targeted therapy. The poor prognosis and high probability of HCC recurrence are largely due to the high rate of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of HCC metastasis remain largely unclear. Searching the biomarkers and therapy targets for metastatic HCC will inevitably speed up the development of HCC metastasis therapy and thus prolong the overall survival time of HCC patients <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Here, we found that GRP78 promotes the invasion of HCC cells, and GRP78-targeted HccFn-Dox nanocages significantly suppress lung metastasis of HCC. Our results also demonstrated that cell surface GRP78 is an effective therapy target for primary and metastatic HCC tumors, thus confirming previous studies indicating that GRP78 represents a potential choice for HCC treatment <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. These studies evaluated the anti-HCC efficiency of antibody-based GRP78 targeted nano-formulations by <italic>in vitro</italic> cell experiments. But none of them evaluated whether GRP78 is an effective therapy target for primary and metastatic HCC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>An efficient HCC targeted nanomedicine greatly depends on the specific accumulation and high loading capacity of the potential drug carrier <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In this study, we used ferritin (Fn) nanocage as a motif to construct drug nanocarrier. Fn nanocages own a protein shell-cavity structure, whose cargo is loaded with high efficiency and which releases its drugs in a controlled manner. The protein shells of Fn nanocages are easily modified, either chemically or genetically, thus endowing these structures with a plethora of functionalities <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. These features render Fn nanocage a powerful platform, with wide-ranging potential applications for clinical diagnostic and therapy.</p><p>Based on the self-assembly structure of ferritin, we believe that SP94 peptides are displayed on the 3-fold symmetry axes of the surface of ferritin in the form of 8&#215;3 bundles. Moreover, based on our binding affinity data, these clustered SP94 peptides may be flexible for antigen binding in spatial structure.</p><p>HccFn-Dox nanocages possess excellent dual HCC-targeting ability. HccFn-Dox specifically recognizes HCC tumor cells through GRP78-based active targeting capability; meanwhile, the diameter of HccFn-Dox nanocage is approx. 17nm, the size makes HccFn-Dox nanocages easily passive penetrate tumor <italic>via</italic> EPR effects <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Both active and passive HCC tumor targeting ability of HccFn-Dox nanocages resulted in a specific Dox accumulation at the tumor site.</p><p>Previously, Fn nanocages from human and horse were used to load Dox <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. Here, we used Fn nanocages from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, as we found that they exhibit intrinsic higher Dox loading properties. We also performed experiments to compare the drug loading capacity of HccFn and Fn from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> without SP94 fusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref>). As we calculated, 404 Dox molecules were contained within the HccFn nanocage, and 413 Dox molecules were contained within the<italic> Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin nanocage. This result suggested that the Dox loading capacity is from the intrinsic nature of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin. The reason for this difference might be that the inner surface structure of HccFn nanocages is more suitable for Dox binding than that of ferritin from other species.</p><p>Here, we showed that HccFn-Dox nanocages possess high drug-loading capability. This ability ensures a lower dosage of drug nanocarrier and thereafter less side effect. Thus, HccFn-Dox nanocages exhibited a better therapeutic effect than currently reported HCC-targeted nanomedicines. Most importantly, our toxicity analysis demonstrated that our HccFn-Dox exhibited excellent biosafety (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>), even did not induce significant changes of immune cells in blood (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref>). These unexpected results may be due to the highly conserved protein sequence and architecture between <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin and human ferritin <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Moreover, this study inspires us to rationally design protein cage nanocarriers according to the naturally evolved structure characteristics of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> ferritin. Based on this work, we can conceive new ways to improve the Dox loading capacity of human ferritin-based nanocarrier and facilitate the translational research of protein cage nanocarriers.</p><p>Moreover, HccFn nanocarrier is expected to be a universal drug loading platform for tumor targeted delivery. As for HccFn nanocage, the diameter of its inner cavity is approx. 8 nm, is suitable for loading many small molecule chemotherapy drugs <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Previous, different types of small molecules have been successful encapsulated into ferritin nanocages <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, indicating a potential universal drug loading ability of HccFn nanocage.</p><p>So far, there is no nanomedicine approved by FDA for HCC therapy <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, but meanwhile, there are two nanomedicines for HCC therapy are under clinical trials. One is liposomal Dox (ThermoDox), under phase III clinical trial; another is Lipid nanoparticles coated siRNA (DCR&#8209;MYC), under phase I clinical trial. Compared with these passive targeted liposome or lipid nanocarriers, our HccFn nanocages possess GRP78-based active HCC targeting capability. In addition, HccFn nanocages are easily produced in <italic>E. coli.</italic> at a high yield (more than 50 mg/L). The drug loading of HccFn is both simple and economical. These two features make HccFn a more superior nanocarrier for HCC-targeted nanomedicine, for its easy to scale up in preparation processes.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that GRP78-targeted HccFn-Dox nanocage is an ideal nanomedicine for HCC-targeted therapy. Also, the HccFn nanocarrier possesses a potential to be a universal chemotherapy drug nanocarrier for HCC therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The gene encoding peptide SP94 was constructed according to the amino acid sequence (SFSIIHTPILPL) provided by Albert <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.

Then, mice were killed, tumors and the major tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) were collected to image using IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Xenogen).</p><p>For biodistribution study, female BALB/c mice bearing HepG2 tumors were <italic>i.v.</italic> injected with HccFn-Dox (25 mg/kg Dox equivalents), then the signal of Dox was detected to quantify Dox distribution in each tissue. At 1, 4, and 24 h post-injection, mice were killed. Tumors and the major tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain) were collected, and Dox signals in each organ were measured using IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Xenogen). Lastly, Dox concentrations in each tissue were quantified using IVIS Spectrum Imaging analysis software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM0"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplementary figures and table.</p></caption><media xlink:href="thnov09p2167s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ms. Jingnan Liang for technical support in TEM imaging at the Core Facility of Equipment, Institute of Microbiology.
