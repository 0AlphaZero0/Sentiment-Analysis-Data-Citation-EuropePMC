While the pathological mechanism underlying MD is still poorly understood, many studies have postulated that various factors may be involved, including endolymphatic hydrops, allergy, inflammation, infection, and autoimmune disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among these theories, it seems that the immune system plays a critical role in a large population of MD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the role of the immune system in patients with MD has not been well studied.</p><p id="Par8">Histamine receptors are critically involved in the function of human immune system, and the pathophysiology of MD, which is evident by the effectiveness of antihistamine treatment (e.g. Betahistine) in MD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Betahistine is an approved treatment for MD and it associated vertigo symptoms. Betahistine is a weak agonist for histamine H1 receptors and an antagonist for H3 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous animal studies have shown that Betahistine can improve vestibular compensation in animal models by promoting blood flow of vestibulocochlear and decreasing excitatory responses induced by histamine in vestibular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In human MD patients, multiple studies have shown that betahistine can reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo, and improve symptoms of vertigo, such as vomiting and nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, recent animal studies also pointed out that histamine H4 receptor antagonists have a pronounced inhibitory effect on mammalian vestibular neuron activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], indicating an important pharmacological target for MD. However, no study so far has been conducted to investigate the involvement of histamine H4 receptors in human MD. Importantly, many studies have demonstrated that histamine H4 receptors play a key role in immune and inflammatory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given that histamine H4 receptors are highly expressed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and increasing evidence showed that proinflammatory cytokines contribute to pathogenesis of MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we hypothesized that histamine H4 receptor gene polymorphisms is a potential contributor to MD.</p><p id="Par9">To test this hypothesis, a group of patients was enrolled with a diagnosis of definite MD based on the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and a control group of patients without any vestibular disease.

A second group of 90 patients who did not exhibit any vestibular disease (control group) was also enrolled. This control group of patients had other otolaryngologic reasons to attend our facilities during the same time of this project as MD patients. The clinical data of MD patients were inspected by on-site physicians to determine the disease severity. We recorded the number of vertigo attacks, the frequency (per year) of the vertigo attacks, and the duration (months) of symptoms as indicators of severity of vertigo. In addition, the worst hearing level at attack periods for patients was expressed by the four frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4&#8201;kHz averages in pure-tone audiometry and was divided into four stages according to AAO-HNS.

Furthermore, basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945;, in PBMCs are increased in patients with MD compared to control patients. This increased basal level of proinflammatory cytokines is prominent in MD patients with the A allele. These results suggested that <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247 polymorphism may be an important mediator in regulating proinflammatory cytokines, which are involved in the pathogenesis of MD.</p><p id="Par20"><italic>HRH4</italic> is located in chromosome 18 ql1.2 and it contains 2 introns (&gt;&#8201;7 kbp) and 3 exons with its corresponding mRNA of 3.689&#8201;kb (NM 021624) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that <italic>HRH4</italic> mRNA expresses widely in various peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Notably, <italic>HRH4</italic> is preferentially expressed in inflammatory-response-related tissues, including peripheral blood cells, bone marrow, spleen, small intestine, and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Notably, the prevalence of rheumatoid history, asthma, diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis in our enrolled MD groups as compared with control group. These results are consistent with previous reports that these disorders are common comorbidities of MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hence, <italic>HRH4</italic> polymorphisms may be a linker between inflammatory disorders and pathophysiology of MD. Indeed, a few studies have reported that <italic>HRH4</italic> polymorphisms are involved in multiple disorders, such as allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], ankylosing spondylitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], atopic dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These studies reported the involvement of multiple <italic>HRH4</italic> polymorphisms in these disorders. In the present study, while we focused on <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247 polymorphism, future studies will be necessary to conduct a more comprehensive investigation on multiple <italic>HRH4</italic> polymorphisms and understand not only the association of these polymorphisms with the risk of MD, but their associations with and the efficacy of antihistamine treatment of MD patients.</p><p id="Par21">While our study focused on IL-1&#946;, it should be noted that three cytokines are encoded by the human IL-1 complex genes, not only including IL-1&#946;, but also IL-1&#945; and IL-1RA, the antagonist receptor. It is known that the balance between the levels of IL-1 RA and IL-1&#946; reflects the severity of inflammation. Consistent with previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we found that IL-1&#946; levels are very low in PBMCs of healthy individuals. Remarkably, we also found that IL-1&#946; basal levels were elevated in MD patients, more prominently in MD patients who have an allele of <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247. This phenomenon was similarly observed in TNF-&#945; basal level in PBMCs. Although the evidence to validate our findings is limited in MD patients, it has been shown in a case control study that 21% of patients with MD had elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#946;, IL-1RA, TNF&#945;, and IL-6 in the supernatant from patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While it is not clear the consequence of elevated basal levels of TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; in PBMCs of MD patients, we postulated that this might be mediated by H4 receptor induced cytokine production. Accumulating evidence shows that H4 receptor in immune system plays an immunomodulatory role in the production of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Specifically, H4 receptor is involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of various inflammatory conditions such as asthma, autoimmune diseases, and other allergic disorders. Hence, it is likely that <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247 polymorphism may be involved in the maintenance of inflammation by regulating inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Adding to the literature, our study provided additional evidence that MD represents a heterogeneous disorder, which is likely associated with altered basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines in immune system that are mediated by H4 receptor. These results may explain why betahistine treatment has only good response in some MD patients, but not in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], since the antihistaminic effects of betahistine are thought to be mediated by being a weak H1 receptor agonist and a potent H3 receptor antagonist. Interestingly, studies on human endolymphatic sac tissue (ES) found that the expression of the histamine receptor gene <italic>HRH1</italic> was primarily in the epithelial lining of the ES, whereas <italic>HRH3</italic> was expressed exclusively in the sub-epithelial capillary network. <italic>HRH2</italic> or <italic>HRH4</italic> were not expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These results together indicated that betahistine effects on MD may primarily be mediated by the antagonism of H3-receptor, resulting in the inhibition of vestibular neurotransmission. When considering the potential contributions of H4-receptor mediated immune-regulation, as indicated by our study, we may postulate that diverse populations of histamine receptors are likely involved in the pathophysiology of MD. Therefore, future antihistaminic therapeutics for the treatment of MD should consider these subpopulations of histamine receptors.</p><p id="Par23">The main strengths of our study include perspective enrollment of patients and direct comparison of patients with definite MD with any control patients who had no vestibular disease. However, there are several limitations of our study. First, a major limitation of the present study is that we only enrolled a limited number of patients for each group (<italic>N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;90 per group) in an adjacent area. Like many available case-control studies on MD, a relatively small number of patients were reported. This is likely due to the epidemiological issue because of the challenges of enrolling patients with MD for data collection and analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few studies of MD available with larger cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Another limitation is that the population of patient in our study was primarily eastern Asian Chinese and cannot represent the other populations that may have higher risk of MD, such as Caucasian population. For example, in a study that was conducted in the US, Caucasians have a higher prevalence than other major ethnicities, including Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Given that histamine H1 receptor expression exhibits genetic differences relative to race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we cannot rule out the possibility that there are racial predispositions to <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247 polymorphism in MD patients. Hence, further study will be needed to validate our findings in a larger and more diverse population of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">In summary, our exploratory study reported an interesting finding that <italic>HRH4</italic> rs77485247 polymorphism may be associated with the risk of MD. Together with recent animal study that demonstrated the efficacy of selective H4 receptor antagonisms in mammalian vestibular neuron activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], our results suggested that heterogenous populations of H4 receptor may be involved in the pathophysiology of MD. Furthermore, we reported that MD patients exhibited increased basal levels of TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; in PBMCs. Particularly, individual patient with MD who had prominent elevated basal levels of I TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946;, may benefit from target therapies to block TNF-&#945; or IL-1&#946;. Taken together, our study supported that MD is a heterogenous disorder and future research on therapeutic development should consider multimodal approach, which is likely to have improved treatment outcome than currently available monotherapy (e.g., betahistine).</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p id="Par5">Meniere&#8217;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBMCs</term><def><p id="Par6">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par25">None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par26">Not applicable.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#8217; contributions</title><p>DXQ, HZ, JHW performed the experiments; ZQH wrote the paper; All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interest</title><p id="Par27">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></notes><notes><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par28">All human experiments were approved by the ethical committee of Quanzhou 1st Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, with written informed consent obtained.</p></notes><notes><title>Consent for publication</title><p id="Par29">Not applicable.</p></notes><notes><title>Publisher&#8217;s Note</title><p id="Par30">Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sajjadi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Paparella</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Meniere's disease</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2008</year><volume>372</volume><issue>9636</issue><fpage>406</fpage><lpage>414</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61161-7</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18675691</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Paparella</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Djalilian</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Etiology, pathophysiology of symptoms, and pathogenesis of Meniere's disease</article-title><source>Otolaryngol Clin N Am</source><year>2002</year><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>529</fpage><lpage>545</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0030-6665(02)00019-1</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greco</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fusconi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Marinelli</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Macri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>De Vincentiis</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Meniere's disease might be an autoimmune condition?</article-title><source>Autoimmun Rev</source><year>2012</year><volume>11</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>731</fpage><lpage>738</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.autrev.2012.01.004</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22306860</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Autoimmunity as a candidate for the etiopathogenesis of Meniere's disease: detection of autoimmune reactions and diagnostic biomarker candidate</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><year>2014</year><volume>9</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>e111039</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111039</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25330336</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">James A, Burton MJ: Betahistine for Meniere's disease or syndrome.
