In this prospective trial, five patients with IBS and SIBO and 21 patients with IBS without SIBO were administered an oral capsule containing <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (Lactolevure<sup>&#174;</sup>) every 12&#160;h for 30&#160;days. SIBO was defined by quantitative culture of the third part of the duodenum; IBS was defined by the Rome III criteria. Severity of symptoms was graded by the IBS severity scoring system (SSS). The primary study endpoint was the efficacy of probiotics in improvement of symptoms of IBS in patients with SIBO. Thirty days after the end of treatment, a 71.3% decrease of the total IBS score was detected in patients with IBS and SIBO compared to 10.6% in those without SIBO (<italic>p</italic> 0.017). A similar decrease was achieved among patients with constipation-predominant IBS without SIBO. Post-treatment satisfaction from bowel function was greater in patients with SIBO. Similar satisfaction improvement was found among patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS irrespective from SIBO; pain intensity score decreased in patients with constipation-predominant IBS irrespective from SIBO. The benefit of probiotics was greater among patients with a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern in the duodenal fluid. This is the first study that prospectively demonstrated superior clinical efficacy of probiotics in patients with IBS with SIBO. Analysis also showed considerable benefit from probiotic intake regarding certain symptoms of patients with diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS.</p><p id="Par2">Trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT02204891.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Irritable bowel syndrome</kwd><kwd>Intestinal bacterial overgrowth</kwd><kwd>Probiotics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Uni-Pharma SA, Athens, Greece</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder. Pathogenesis remains multifactorial. Better understanding of the interaction of the host with intestinal microbiota the last decade led to the knowledge that many of the symptoms of IBS, mainly bloating and diarrhea, are related with the overgrowth of bacteria of colonic type in the small intestine. This overgrowth frames the syndrome of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) where colonic type of bacteria predominates in the proximal parts of the small intestine. Fermentation of dietary carbohydrates by the bacteria colonizers of SIBO ends with the over-production of gas generating thus symptoms of IBS. The relationship between IBS and SIBO was found by a series of prospective observational studies using the lactulose and the glucose breath tests for the diagnosis of SIBO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Using these tests, the prevalence of SIBO in patients with IBS ranged between 65 and 85%. We conducted a large-scale study on 897 patients undergoing upper GI tract endoscopy collecting samples from the third part of the duodenum for quantitative culture. The frequency of SIBO ranged between 10.6 and 17.6% depending on the cutoff used for the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our data also showed that among patients with IBS the prevalence of SIBO defined at a cutoff of 10<sup>3</sup>&#160;cfu/ml was 37.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Oral supplementation with probiotics may be a candidate approach for the eradication of SIBO and subsequently of the symptoms of IBS. The majority of probiotic bacteria belong to the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genera. They are Gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria that constitute a major part of the normal human intestinal microflora. The rationale behind their use as a therapeutic strategy in IBS is that orally administered probiotics may replace the overgrown enteric-type bacteria of SIBO. Four randomized clinical trials are available evaluating the efficacy of orally administered probiotics in IBS. The common findings of these trials are as follows: (a) they improve the symptoms of bloating and diarrhea which are typical of the presence of SIBO; and (b) efficacy is usually detected when mixtures of different species of probiotics are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, irrespective of the above results, there is lot of ambiguity on the efficacy of probiotics in IBS because not all conducted studies administered the same probiotic species whereas no evidence is provided on a possible effect of probiotics on the mechanisms of pathogenesis of IBS.</p><p id="Par5">The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a mixture of four species of probiotics (<italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> BB-12, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> LA-5, and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>) on the symptoms of IBS patients with culture verified SIBO compared to those without SIBO. The selection of these probiotic species was based on the fact that they are well-described commensals of the proximal intestinal flora even though normal bacterial microbiota is more stable than the mycobiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Prebiotics were not studied since many of patients with IBS present with fructose intolerance whereas diets low in oligo-saccharides have been shown beneficiary for these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We anticipated that findings might provide an insight on the role of probiotics in treating one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of IBS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par6">This was an open-label clinical study that was conducted during the period April 2014&#8211;September 2016 in patients followed in the Hepatogastroenterology Unit of the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine-Propedeutic and the Outpatients Department of Immunology of Infections of the 4th Department of Internal Medicine of ATTIKON University Hospital in Greece. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital (approval 4/19-03-2014) and it was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>before enrolment of the first patient (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT02204891). All patients were screened after written informed consent.</p><p id="Par7">Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) age &#8805;&#8201;18&#160;years; (b) patients of both genders; (c) written informed consent by study participants; and (d) presence of IBS according to Rome III criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

If TSH was within the normal range and serology was negative, the patient underwent colonoscopy. After negative for cancer and diverticula colonoscopy, the patient underwent upper GI tract endoscopy. During endoscopy, upon entrance of the endoscope at the third section of duodenum, intestinal fluid was aspirated. Aspirate was collected by placing a sterile suction catheter inside a sterile overtube, which was passed through the suction channel of the endoscope. The aspirate was placed immediately in transport vials and transported to the laboratory for quantitative cultures. At the same time, three duodenal biopsy samples were obtained to exclude celiac disease.</p><p id="Par9">Cultures of duodenal fluid were done, as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When the results of quantitative duodenal culture were available, patients could be divided into those with SIBO and into those without SIBO. For the needs of the study, SIBO was defined as any equal to or more than 10<sup>5</sup>&#160;CFU/ml of duodenal aspirate and/or presence of colonic type bacteria in the duodenal aspirate. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#945;), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured in the duodenal fluid by an enzyme immunosorbent assay (R&amp;D Inc., Minneapolis MN); the lower detection limit was 3.9&#160;pg/ml for all cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions and Study Visits</title><p id="Par10">When a patient was enrolled in the study, study procedures and follow-up visits were done by study physicians who were completely blind to the information if the patient had SIBO or not. At enrolment, patients were classified based on their symptoms into diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), and mixed-type IBS (IBS-M). They were also asked to report the total number of days on which they felt abdominal pain the last 15&#160;days. Then patients were subject to three visits. At visit 1, patients were provided with 60 capsules of a commercially available preparation of four probiotics containing per capsule 1.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cfu <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>, 1.75&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cfu <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> BB-12, 1.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cfu <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5</italic>, and 0.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cfu <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (Lactolevure<sup>&#174;</sup>, Uni-Pharma S.A., Athens, Greece). Capsules were administered orally every 12&#160;h 30&#160;min before meal for 30&#160;days. At the end of treatment, patients were subject to visit 2 on day 30&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7 where they had to provide the empty capsule cartridges as a proof of compliance with treatment. Patients were also coming for visit 3 on day 60&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7 for follow-up. On visit 1 before start of treatment, on visit 2, and on visit 3, patients were asked to complete a modified IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire in the Greek language that was composed of five questions on the current intensity of abdominal pain, the overall intensity of abdominal pain, the intensity of bloating, the effect of IBS on the quality of life, and on the level of satisfaction from the bowel function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Each question was self-assessed from 0 to 100 so that the IBS-SSS was ranging from 0 to 500. For the question of the effect of IBS on the quality of life, it was explained to the patients that 0 represented no effect and 100 represented complete effect. For the question of the level of satisfaction from the bowel function, it was explained to the patients that 0 represented full satisfaction and 100 the complete lack of satisfaction. On each visit, patients were demonstrated a chart with the Bristol stool scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and they were asked to score the form of their stool the last 7&#160;days at a scale from 1 to 7. The days from work abstinence due to IBS were also reported. Occurrence of adverse events was recorded over study visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p id="Par11">The primary study endpoint was the rate of patients with IBS and SIBO achieving any &#8805;&#160;50% decrease of IBS-SSS compared to patients with IBS without SIBO on visit 3. This cutoff of decrease of IBS-SSS was selected according to published criteria of significant efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Four secondary endpoints were set: (a) changes of the IBS-SSS among patients without SIBO; (b) the comparisons on the five components of the IBS-SSS; (c) the effect on the form of stool as assessed by the Bristol stool scale; and (d) the effect on the number of lost days of work. The association between the level of cytokines in the duodenal fluid and the change of IBS-SSS was an exploratory endpoint.

To demonstrate this difference 10% significance with 80% power, it was calculated that 30 patients with IBS and SIBO and that 30 patients with IBS without SIBO should be enrolled. However, awareness of the extensive exclusion criteria and of the strict definition of SIBO using cutoff 10<sup>5</sup>&#160;cfu/ml that could limit the enrolment rate, a first read-out for the primary endpoint was done in December 2015 to decide on the progress of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par13">Frequencies were reported as percent and 95% confidence interval (CI).

The vast majority of conducted clinical trials with probiotics are based on the assumption that the efficacy of probiotics may rely on the substitution of colonic-type bacteria colonizing the upper GI tract of the patients that cause SIBO with the administered probiotics. In these studies, the improvement of bloating is used as indirect evidence for the modulation of SIBO, since bloating is a major symptom of SIBO. However, no direct evidence for an effect of probiotics on SIBO has been published yet. The current non-randomized study aimed to provide direct evidence of the effect of probiotics on SIBO among patients with IBS. Our results showed a statistically greater reduction of the IBS-SSS score among IBS patients with SIBO than among those without SIBO. Moreover, subgroup analysis revealed IBS-C and IBS-D patients to be those the most benefitted target populations for probiotics treatment; patients with IBS-D and IBS-C presented post-treatment with great satisfaction for their bowel function scores and with improvement of the characteristics of defecation. Our findings point towards an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of probiotics since most of the efficacy was shown for patients with a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern in the duodenal fluid. This insight into the mechanism of probiotic action in IBS has never been shown before.</p><p id="Par22">Available randomized studies are characterized by great controversy regarding the type of administered probiotics and the duration of treatment. A meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials concluded that most of benefit in the quality of life is coming from the administration of mixed preparations containing species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and with treatment duration not longer than 4&#160;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The significant decrease of the abdominal pain severity score among IBS-C and IBS-D irrespective of the presence of SIBO was a secondary study finding; this benefit being higher in patients with IBS-C. However, not all available studies showed a similar efficacy on abdominal pain severity, so far. In a randomized trial that enrolled 45 patients treated with <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> and 45 patients treated with placebo, an overall improvement of the quality of life was detected. Enrolled patients were suffering from IBS-D and IBS-M and they did not report any significant decrease of their abdominal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A similar lack of effect on abdominal pain was reported in a randomized study of the administration of a mixture of seven probiotics compared to placebo among patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In another randomized trial where a mixture of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus faecium</italic> was administered to patients with IBS without diarrhea, a decrease of the abdominal pain score was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In a recent randomized clinical trial, the efficacy of a liquid mixture of <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> in 124 patients was compared to that of placebo in 62 subjects. The administered preparation contained three species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, exactly as it was the case with the probiotic mixture of our study. The achieved mean decrease of the overall symptom IBS score was 63.3% in the actively treated group compared to 28.3% of the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This decrease was similar to the decrease reported for the IBS-SSS score among our IBS patients with SIBO<italic>.</italic> This last study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] also evidenced a significant decrease of pain intensity, as it was the case with the study presented herein.</p><p id="Par24">Although SIBO is most often present among patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], our data show a beneficial effect of the intake of probiotics also for IBS-C patients, irrespective of the presence of SIBO. This positive effect may indicate that beyond SIBO treatment, probiotics may express their effect with a different mechanism of action. In a recent study, 34 IBS patients were randomized to treatment either with <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> or placebo for 4&#160;weeks. Whole blood was collected at the end of treatment and at 4&#160;weeks after the end of treatment for genomic expression. It was striking to identify a significant down-regulation of the EIF2 signaling pathway in the treatment arm that is associated with stress-related adverse behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Our study presents major strengths and several limitations. A major strength is the use of Rome III criteria of classification in the inclusion of patients. The limitations of the study are as follows: (a) the non-randomized design; (b) the small sample in the SIBO positive group; (c) the lack of analysis of the 16S rDNA gene; and (d) the lack of evaluation of SIBO using breath test. The largest randomized trials ever conducted for IBS are the TARGET I and TARGET II studies in which the efficacy of oral treatment with rifaximin was compared to placebo. The response rate of the placebo arm in the two TARGET studies did not exceed 32% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As a consequence, we do believe that the goal of at least 50% decrease of IBS-SSS set in our study is of clinical significance. Furthermore, the achievement of a positive response rate in all patients with SIBO makes our findings of significance despite the small sample size. In our era, SIBO characterization should rely on sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene as already described in a recent study of our group. That study showed decrease of microbial diversity in the small intestine of patients with IBS so that species that predominate are also isolated with conventional microbiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This limits the impact of the lack of 16S rDNA sequencing in the interpretation of our findings. Glucose and lactulose breath tests are the gold standards for the diagnosis and follow-up of SIBO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Their absence in our study design should be acknowledged as a limitation.</p><p id="Par26">The studied probiotic preparation contained <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic>. Although several concerns have been addressed on the safety of probiotics preparations enriched with yeasts, analysis have failed to disclose this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, it is empirically suggested that these preparations should be avoided in patients with severe immunodeficiency and neutropenia.</p><p id="Par27">Our study prospectively demonstrated for the first time using very strict definition criteria that IBS patients with SIBO benefited most from the administration of this specific multi-strain preparation of probiotics. The study also demonstrated that many clinical aspects mainly related with improvement of stool form and satisfaction from bowel function after probiotics treatment are seen among patients either with IBS-D or IBS-C, irrespective of the presence of SIBO.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Lactolevure<sup>&#174;</sup> probiotic preparation was a kind gift by Uni-Pharma SA, Athens, Greece.
