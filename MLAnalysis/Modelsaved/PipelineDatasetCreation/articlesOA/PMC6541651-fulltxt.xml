Clinical presentation of TB patients is very diverse and disease heterogeneity is associated with changes in biomarker signatures. Here, we compared at the molecular level the extent of individual inflammatory perturbation of plasma protein and lipid mediators associated with TB in patients in China versus India. We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing the overall degree of inflammatory perturbation in treatment-na&#239;ve pulmonary TB patients and uninfected individuals from India (TB: n&#8201;=&#8201;97, healthy: n&#8201;=&#8201;20) and China (TB: n&#8201;=&#8201;100, healthy: n&#8201;=&#8201;11). We employed the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) adapted to plasma biomarkers to examine the overall changes in inflammation between these countries. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection caused a significant degree of molecular perturbation in patients from both countries, with higher perturbation detected in India. Interestingly, there were differences in biomarker perturbation patterns and the overall degree of inflammation. Patients with severe TB exhibited increased MDP values and Indian patients with this condition exhibited even higher degree of perturbation compared to Chinese patients. Network analyses identified IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#946;, IL-1RI and TNF-&#945; as combined biomarkers that account for the overall molecular perturbation in the entire study population. Our results delineate the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory perturbation in pulmonary TB and reveal qualitative changes in inflammatory profiles between two countries with high disease prevalence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Infection</kwd><kwd>Interleukins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation | Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&amp;amp;#x00ED;fico e Tecnol&amp;amp;#x00F3;gico (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Division of Intramural Research of the NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI115940</award-id><award-id>R01AI069923-08</award-id><award-id>R01AI20790-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>Bruno B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tuberculosis (TB) is now the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to a single infectious agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is widely disseminated geographically, with up to 23% of the world&#8217;s population exposed to the bacterium. India and China are in the top five group countries having the largest number of cases in 2016, 56% of the total, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). With such a high burden of disease, associated with the socioeconomics conditions, the treatment and control of new cases is only partially effective in both countries, contributing to the appearance of multi-drug resistant strains, that represent 25% of cases in China and the emergence of totally resistant strains in India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, despite tremendous efforts from both private and governmental initiatives to reduce TB burden, deaths attributed to this disease remain high in both countries. Noteworthy, India presents substantially higher mortality rates than China in both HIV unexposed and exposed populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The major determinants of such high burden and mortality are still largely unknown.</p><p id="Par3">Numerous factors are known to influence TB risk and disease presentation, including genetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, epigenetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, environmental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, nutritional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and socioeconomic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> characteristics. India and China are very distinct with regard to several of these determinants, which could contribute to the diversity in TB clinical presentation and likely in clinical prognosis such as response to treatment. Whether such differences also result in divergences in immune and inflammatory responses against Mtb is not completely understood.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we applied an adaptation of the molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) to previously published data on plasma concentrations of a defined panel of protein and lipid mediator biomarkers from China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and from India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This statistical approach was employed to determine possible differences in the inflammatory stress in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) between the two countries when the biomarker measurements were performed in different laboratory facilities. The concept which gives basis for calculation of the MDP scores is inspired by the Molecular Distance to Health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and infers a degree of difference in expression levels of biomarkers between cases and controls (healthy uninfected controls), such differences were compared between countries. In addition, we determined the distance to health in mild TB (acid-fast bacilli [AFB] negative and unilateral lung lesion) and severe TB (AFB positive and bilateral lung lesion) and the interference of the imbalance caused by Mtb on the inflammatory profile in both countries. The results of this analysis have important implications for the design of more uniform measures for the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of TB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par5">All clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

The South Indian study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT; protocol numbers NCT01154959 and NCT00342017). The Chinese study is registered on the platform ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01071603) and has been approved and reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) from Henan Chest Hospital (HCH), China, and US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and participants in China</title><p id="Par6">The original clinical protocol, from which the biomarker study was derived, was performed in Zhengzhou, China, between 2010 and 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> with inclusion criteria of persons with signs and symptoms indicative of active TB, who were HIV-unexposed and administered less than two weeks of anti-tubercular treatment (ATT)&#160;and exclusion criteria of HIV infection, diabetes, cancer and other lung diseases identified at the first clinical visit and reported resistance to anti-TB drugs. In the present study on biomarkers, only treatment na&#239;ve individuals were included to reduce variability. Plasma samples were collected from 100 patients with active PTB and 11 healthy controls (HC). Six patients with PTB were excluded due to lack of sample available for the laboratory assays. All the enrolled subjects underwent a chest Computer Tomography (CT) scan, provided three sputum samples for AFB smear and culture by both the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (Becton, Dickenson and Company) and Lowenstein&#8211;Jensen medium (Chuang Xin Company; Hangzhou, China). The HCH radiology department provided a scored assessment of the chest CTs that included locations of disease by lobe, type of abnormalities and number of cavities for each CT. The sputum smears were prepared by the Zeil&#8211;Neilsen method using 1% carbolfuchsine and scored using the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) scale. HC participants presented in this analysis lacked radiologic and microbiological signs of active <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, had no pulmonary symptoms of tuberculosis and had a negative result in the Quantiferon Gold in-the-tube test.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and participants in India</title><p id="Par7">Active TB cases were recruited at the Government Stanley Medical Hospital, at TB clinics supported by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, India. The diagnosis of PTB was based on sputum smear and culture positivity. At the time of enrollment, all active TB cases had no record of prior TB disease or ATT. ATT was given to all patients with active TB using the directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy following the WHO guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Healthy donors were asymptomatic with normal chest X-rays, negative tuberculin skin test (TST) (indurations, 5&#8201;mm in diameter) and Quantiferon as well as negative sputum smear or culture results. All participants were BCG vaccinated and were HIV negative.

The Fisher&#8217;s exact test was used to compare categorical variables between study groups. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. P-values were adjusted for multiple measurements using Holm-Bonferroni&#8217;s method. A multivariable regression model using variables with univariate p-value&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.2 was performed to assess the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the associations with country of residence. Hierarchical cluster analyses (Ward&#8217;s method), with 100X bootstrap of z-score normalized data were employed to depict the overall expression profile of indicated biomarkers in the study groups. Dendograms represent Euclidean distance.</p><p id="Par10">Profiles of correlations between biomarkers in different clinical groups were examined using network analysis of the Spearman correlation matrices (with 100X bootstrap). In indicated analyses, only correlations with Spearman rank coefficient (r) values&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.7 or &lt;&#8722;0.7 and p-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 after adjustment were included in the network visualization. In such analyses, markers that exhibited similar correlation profiles were clustered based on a modularity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which infers sub-networks inside the of the correlation network and depicted using Fruchterman Reingold (force-directed graph drawing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) modelling was employed to assess whether combinations of circulating biomarkers could discriminate between subgroups of patients. The CCA model was chosen because many variables were studied. This model is able to perform dimensionality reduction for two co-dependent data sets (MDP biomarker profile and baseline characteristics profile, which were age and gender) simultaneously so that the discrimination of the clinical endpoints represents a combination of variables that are maximally correlated. Thus, trends of correlations between parameters in different clinical groups rather than their respective distribution within each group are the key components driving the discrimination outcome. In our CCA model, simplified and adapted from previously reported investigations of biomarkers for TB diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, linear regression graphs represent coefficients from different combinations of plasma factors and baseline characteristics. In the biomarker profile dataset, we included values of all the inflammatory marker variables. The diagnostic class prediction values obtained were calculated using receiver operator characteristics (ROC)&#160;curve analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Adaptation of the molecular degree of perturbation to examine plasma concentrations of biomarkers</title><p id="Par12">The plasma measurements of both datasets were normalized equally with a log2 transformation and the batch effect within the different study datasets was corrected using Combat algorithm from SVA package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The ComBat algorithm is a widely used method for adjusting batch effects in microarray and RNA-Seq data associated with technical variance effects. The molecular inflammatory perturbation is based&#160;on the&#160; molecular degree of perturbation (MDP) method, which is an adaptation of the MDH described by Pankla <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In the present study, instead of using gene expression values as in Prada-Medina <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> we inputted plasma concentrations of a defined set of biomarkers pre-selected based on previously published studies from our group which investigated TB pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, herein, the average plasma concentration levels and standard deviation of a baseline reference group (healthy uninfected controls) were calculated for each biomarker. The MDP score of an individual biomarker was defined by taking the differences in concentration levels from the average of the biomarker in reference group divided by the reference standard deviation. Essentially, the MDP score represents the differences by number of standard deviations from the healthy control group.

Because PTB patients from India and China were also different with regard to age, sex, high AFB smear grade (&#8805;2+) and presence of bilateral lung lesions, it was important to test whether such differences account for the discrepancies in MDP values. To try to answer this question, we stratified the patients from both countries according to these characteristics (Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with the z-score normalized values of the overall MDP score as well as of that for each biomarker in patients presenting with different mycobacterial loads in sputum smears.

Univariate analyses confirmed the differences in several markers (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Additional analysis revealed that frequency of individuals with molecular perturbation of IL-18, IFN-&#945;, TNF-&#945;, sIL-1RI, IL-17 and IL-1&#946; was higher in PTB patients than in controls whereas only sIL-1RI was more often molecularly perturbed in Chinese TB patients (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Further investigation utilizing a discriminant model based on canonical correlation analysis confirmed that the combination of the plasma markers exhibited high accuracy in identifying PTB both in India (ROC AUC: 1.0, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001) and China (ROC AUC: 0.98, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). Moreover, the canonical model indicated that the markers that contributed the most for the discrimination in India were IL-1RI, IL-1&#946;, LXA4, IL-1RII and IL-18 whereas the markers identified in China were LXA4, IL-18, PGF2&#945;, IFN-&#945;, IL-12p70 and IL-1RII (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>, right panels). Interestingly, molecular degree of perturbation of 3 out of 5 markers which were relevant to identify PTB patients in India (LXA4, IL-1RII and IL-18) were also part of the TB signature observed in China, revealing a degree of similarity. Nevertheless, when values from all the markers were considered simultaneously for the PTB patients, we found that the MDP score profiles were very distinct between India and China (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). In contrast these profiles were not different between uninfected controls from either country (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>).

Many of these studies employ distinct methodologies to measure the analytes and for this reason, even in scenarios in which clinical and microbiological definitions are harmonized, there is a significant challenge to compare results and perform analyses across countries. This issue potentially delays the validation of biomarkers and, maybe more importantly, the progress towards our understanding about nuances in TB pathogenesis in diverse populations. In order to circumvent this issue, multicentric studies perform measurements in a single or few laboratory facilities, mitigating inter-assay variability. In the present study, we have introduced a mathematical maneuver that employs standardization of biomarker data from TB patients over measurements from a healthy, uninfected control group (baseline reference) which results in a new metric that represents molecular distance to health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or molecular degree of perturbation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This type of approach has been used previously in the context of gene expression assays such as transcriptome analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The results presented here expand the current knowledge in this field by demonstrating that molecular degree of perturbation can be used to compare soluble protein and lipid mediator biomarker profiles in plasma from TB patients with measurements performed at different laboratories in distinct countries.</p><p id="Par28">A major observation of our study was that, although healthy uninfected controls from both India and China were undistinguishable in terms of MDP values, PTB patients exhibited very distinct values. Indian PTB patients were on average &gt;3 times more molecularly perturbed than those from China. Although PTB patients from India had more frequent unilateral lung lesions and increased AFB smear grades than those from China, the association between increases of overall MDP score values and India was independent of such clinical and microbiological characteristics. This finding is intriguing and suggests that other factors may account for the differences in MDP. The impact of country of residence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, race and ethnicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> on plasma biomarkers in the context of TB has been previously explored. Race and gender differences in inflammatory profile have also been studied in several other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It is likely that Indian and Chinese individuals respond differently in terms of immune response to Mtb infection. Indeed, additional analyses revealed that the biomarkers examined here, when considered combined, could cluster TB away from uninfected individuals in both countries, but were at the same time capable of discriminating TB patients from the two different countries. Hierarchical clustering, PCA and canonical discriminant analyses confirmed that healthy controls were very similar between India and China, whereas TB was associated with substantial discrepancies in the systemic inflammatory profile. Thus, the impact of ethnicity and/or country of residence on systemic inflammation was dependent on an environmental trigger, exemplified here by Mtb infection.</p><p id="Par29">Of note, the discriminant analyses based on canonical correlations identified that the biomarkers likely responsible for the distinction between active TB and healthy controls were different between the countries. In India, sIL-1RI was the marker that contributed the most for this discrimination, with values significantly higher in active TB patients compared to uninfected controls. In China, the top discriminant marker was LXA4, with substantially lower levels detected in active TB versus controls. The most relevant markers driving the distinction of the inflammatory profiles between the countries were LXA4, IFN-&#946; and TNF-&#945;, all of which have been described to play relevant roles in TB pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. LXA4 promotes necrosis of macrophages infected with Mtb&#160;by interfering in cell membrane repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, we and others have shown that type I IFNs promote mycobacterial growth and unrestrained inflammation-driven tissue damage in mice and patients with more severe forms of TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The detrimental role of type I IFNs also involves inhibition of the IL-1 pathway which is required to induce host resistance against Mtb infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. TNF-&#945; is described as one of the most important cytokines in the protective immune responses against TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Loss of TNF signaling causes progression to active TB in Mtb infected individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, likely due to disruption of granulomas and accelerated intracellular mycobacterial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Host genetic and/or epigenetic differences in expression of the markers described above as well as in other related immune pathways could be the underlying factors driving such discrepancies in different countries.</p><p id="Par30">Overall, in transcriptome studies, MDP scores serve as a readout of the inflammatory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In agreement with this idea, our results in protein quantification indicate that, in both India and China, PTB patients with bilateral lung lesions and presence of AFB in sputum smears exhibited higher MDP score values than those with unilateral lesions and negative smears. This finding is not surprising as progression of TB and increased mycobacterial loads drive major stress in the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Importantly, patients with PTB from India were more molecularly perturbed than those from China independent on the bacterial loads and/or radiographic extension of lung lesions. These results argue that country of origin may be a relevant driver of certain observed differences in pro-inflammatory biomarker expression in plasma of PTB patients.</p><p id="Par31">One limitation of the present study was that we have not performed detailed genetic characterization of the Mtb isolates. The mycobacterial strains responsible for TB in India and China may differ. Studies have indicated that in India, the most prevalent Mtb lineage is the SIT26/cas1-Delhi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, whereas in China, Beijing is the most relevant strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, Mtb lineages are spread out around the world and Beijing strains are commonly found in India, for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Different Mtb isolates are well known to induce distinct immune activation and disease presentation in both experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and clinical settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In fact, the Beijing lineage has been commonly associated with development of multi-drug resistant TB in several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Hypervirulent isolates are known to cause significant lung necrosis and hematogenous dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It is possible that infection with distinct mycobacterial strains may be an important component underlying the differences in MDP score values between the countries evaluated. Should this hypothesis be correct, then it is likely that the majority of the Indian TB patients were infected by more virulent Mtb isolates. Perhaps more importantly, different countries may have unique endemic infectious agents other than Mtb, that could influence inflammatory responses and biomarker levels. In addition, the microbiome profile, which shows geographic variation and is highly influenced by diet and life-style<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, could affect biomarker status. Thus, a combination of host and microbe genetic backgrounds may account for the systemic inflammatory changes described here. Future studies are needed to directly test this hypothesis. Another limitation of the present analysis was lack of control for air pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> as well as other behavioral and psychosocial factors, which may play a role in inducing changes in inflammatory responses as well. It is also possible that differences in time from TB disease onset to diagnosis differed may have resulted in distinctions in disease presentation between India and China, e.g. delayed diagnosis in India could have led to inclusion of patients with more advanced disease compared to that in China. We have not specifically tested this hypothesis and additional investigations are required. Finally, the data available for the researchers were not prospective, meaning that we did not have information on response to treatment or antibiotic resistance, which could have been different between the countries.</p><p id="Par32">In summary, our data using the MDP metric suggest that systemic inflammation driven by Mtb infection may vary significantly between countries. Additional studies are needed to evaluate if and/or how the differences described here contribute to TB treatment response and prognosis in diverse populations worldwide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
