We found that the high expression of CBLL1 was associated with the tumor size in NSCLC tissues. It has been recently reported that CBLL1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion in A549 and H460 cells. Our results confirmed that CBLL1 promoted the proliferation by promoting G1/S cell cycle transition in NSCLCs cells. Moreover, CBLL1 knockdown inhibited cell invasion via increased E&#8208;cadherin protein expression, and decreased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in NSCLC cell lines. The protein expression of E&#8208;cadherin was increased after CBLL1 depletion while the E&#8208;cadherin mRNA was not affected after knockdown of the endogenous CBLL1.</p></sec><sec id="tca13097-sec-0004a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results provide important insights for using CBLL1 as an oncogenic marker gene in the development and progression of non&#8208;small cell lung cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0001">CBLL1</kwd><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0002">E&#8208;cadherin</kwd><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0003">E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0004">invasion</kwd><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0005">non&#8208;small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd id="tca13097-kwd-0006">proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Innovation Team in Colleges and Universities of Shenyang, China</funding-source><award-id>LT2015029</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>81101599</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province</funding-source><award-id>L20180551229</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="5090"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>component-id</meta-name><meta-value>tca13097</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>June 2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:5.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:11.06.2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="tca13097-sec-0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related deaths worldwide,<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="tca13097-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> among which non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main type.

In colorectal epithelial cells, the autocrine Slit&#8208;Robo pathway promotes CBLL1&#8208;mediated downregulation of E&#8208;cadherin to promote carcinogenesis. CBLL1 expression is inversely correlated with E&#8208;cadherin in several colon adenocarcinoma tissues. Second, knockdown of E&#8208;cadherin in CBLL1&#8208;overexpressing epithelial cells does not promote cusp formation, suggesting CBLL1 affects cell phenotypes in an E&#8208;cadherin&#8208;independent manner. In MDCK cells, CBLL1 is involved in regulating cell dynamic expansion and mobility.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> CBLL1 affects the adhesion of cells to the matrix and invasion of MDCK epithelial cells.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Additionally, in estrogen receptor alpha&#8208;dependent breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells, CBLL1 overexpression inhibits estrogen&#8208;dependent cell proliferation and migration and plays a negative role in the progression of estrogen&#8208;dependent breast cancer.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> A recent study reported that inhibition of CBLL1 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion and increases the chemosensitivity to cisplatin in A549 and H460 cells.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>
</p><p>However, the expression level and location of CBLL1 in NSCLC tissues remain unclear.

Analysis of CBLL1 expression in NSCLC tissues and clinicopathological factors showed that high CBLL1 protein expression was associated with tumor size in NSCLC. Thus, abnormal expression of CBLL1 in lung cancer plays an important role in the progression of NSCLC.</p><p>To further explore the effects of CBLL1 on the biological behavior of lung cancer cells, CBLL1 siRNA was transfected into cells to inhibit the expression of endogenous CBLL1. Our results showed that the cell proliferation and colony formation abilities were decreased after depletion of CBLL1 in A549 and H1299 cells, which is consistent with the MTT assay results in A549 and H460 cells.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Cell cycle analysis showed that the cell cycle was stopped at G0/G1 after interrupting the expression of CBLL1. CBLL1 was predicted to promote cell cycle progression by inducing the G0/G1&#8208;S transition in A549 and H1299 cells. Our results also showed that expression of the cell cycle&#8208;related proteins cyclin D1 and CDK4 were decreased in CBLL1&#8208;depleted A549 and H1299 cells, suggesting that CBLL1 affected the cell cycle by regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. The protein expression of CDK4, was unchanged, while the expression of cyclin D1 was decreased after interference with CBLL1 expression in MCF7 and HEK293 cells.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p><p>The invasive ability of A549 and H1299 cells was decreased after the expression of endogenous CBLL1 was depleted. MMP&#8208;2 and MMP&#8208;9 are well&#8208;studied members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, and play a leading role in lung cancer invasion and metastasis.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="tca13097-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> The expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 were found downregulated in CBLL1 knockdown cells, which indicated that CBLL1 probably participated in the degradation of ECM through MMP2 and MMP9 to promote the metastasis of NSCLC. In contrast, another study has found overexpression of CBLL1 decreased the breast cancer cell proliferation and migration capacity as a strong blockade of ER&#945; in breast cancer cell line.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>
</p><p>In addition, CBLL1 can degrade E&#8208;cadherin by ubiquitination to reduce cell adhesion and promote cell invasion.<xref rid="tca13097-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="tca13097-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In order to further clarify the effect of CBLL1 on E&#8208;cadherin in NSCLC cells, we found that the protein expression of E&#8208;cadherin was increased after CBLL1 depletion while the E&#8208;cadherin mRNA was not affected after decreasing the expression of endogenous CBLL1. These findings further confirmed that CBLL1 could probably degrade E&#8208;cadherin by protein level in lung cancer cells, which also facilitate the metastasis of NSCLC. However, the correlations between CBLL1 expression and membrane E&#8208;cadherin degradation were not significant (data not shown) and additional NSCLC cases should be tested in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CBLL1 is highly expressed in NSCLC cancer tissues compared with corresponding lung tissues. Our study shows that the high expression of CBLL1 is correlated with tumor size in NSCLC cases. Moreover, CBLL1 promotes the cell proliferation by inducing the G0/G1&#8208;S transition and cell invasion by increasing degradation of ECM of NSCLC cells. These observations suggested CBLL1 as a potential target for the treatment of NSCLC. More research work is needed to elucidate the molecular functions of CBLL1 in NSCLC in the future.</p></sec><sec id="tca13097-sec-0022"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="tca13097-sec-0021"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from Innovation Team in Colleges and Universities of Shenyang, China 2015 (grant No.LT2015029), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81101599) and the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (No. L20180551229).</p></ack><ref-list id="tca13097-bibl-0001" content-type="cited-references"><title>References</title><ref id="tca13097-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="tca13097-cit-0001">
