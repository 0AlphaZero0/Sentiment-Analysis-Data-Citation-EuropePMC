The prevalence of birch pollen sensitization in adults has been estimated to be more than 20% in some areas of central Europe<bold>,</bold> with a mean prevalence of 8% of the population in 13 developed countries worldwide.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Based on amino acid sequence homology of the major allergens and IgE cross&#8208;reactivity, five tree species (birch, alder, hornbeam, hazel, and oak) have been assigned to the same homologous group<xref rid="all13606-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> termed the &#8220;birch homologous group&#8221;, with birch as the representative species. An additional two species (beech and chestnut) have been suggested as members of the birch homologous group.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> The relevance of birch pollen as a representative allergen source has been confirmed by in&#160;vitro IgE inhibition studies in which birch pollen extract almost completely inhibited human IgE binding to alder, hazel, hornbeam, and oak allergen extracts.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Patients who are allergic to birch pollen may also experience symptoms in response to pollen from the other members of the birch group, which, due to successive seasons and geographical distribution of the birch group species, increases the burden of tree pollen allergy in terms of relevant seasons and regions.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>
</p><p>The SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet is being developed as allergy immunotherapy (AIT) for treatment of ARC induced by pollen from the birch group.

DU has been used as a standardized potency unit during the development programme and is based equally on the major allergen content (Bet v 1) and total allergenic activity. One DU corresponds to approximately 5&#160;&#956;g Bet v 1. The matrix used was identical to the other SQ SLIT&#8208;tablets (eg. grass, house dust mite, and ragweed). The placebo tablets were similar to the active IMP with regard to appearance, smell, and taste. The first dose was administered under medical supervision lasting at least 30&#160;minutes after tablet intake. Subjects were instructed to take one sublingual tablet daily. Before the subjects attended each of the EEC sessions, a washout period ranging from 3&#160;days (short acting antihistamines and nasal decongestants) to 120&#160;days (eg. for glucocorticoids and, systemic depot formulations) was specified for relevant concomitant medication that interfered with the efficacy evaluations. If deemed necessary by the investigator, subjects could be provided with antihistamines or a &#946;2&#8208;agonist inhaler after an EEC session.

SAEs were reported by three subjects (1%) (PTs: tibia fracture (2 DU), glioblastoma (7 DU), and depression (2 DU)); none of these were assessed as related to the IMP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="all13606-sec-0023"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This randomized double&#8208;blind, placebo&#8208;controlled phase II trial with the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet, showed statistically significant reductions of ARC as well as rhinitis symptoms in birch allergic subjects exposed to birch or oak pollen in an EEC. Statistically significant differences between 12 DU and placebo were reached after 16&#160;weeks of treatment and persisted until week 24 (end of trial). No significant treatment effect was shown for conjunctivitis symptoms alone; however, the level of conjunctivitis symptoms was generally low in all treatment groups.</p><p>An immune modulating effect of the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet was confirmed by induction of statistically significant changes from baseline in serum levels of both birch and oak specific IgE and IgG<sub>4</sub> for all active treatment groups compared to placebo. The Bet v&#8208;specific immunological changes observed during the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet treatment (IgG<sub>4</sub>, IgE&#8208;BF) are similar to those observed for SQ grass SLIT&#8208;tablet, where sustained clinical effect has been demonstrated for up to 2&#160;years after end of treatment,<xref rid="all13606-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> which suggests a durable treatment effect of SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet with continued daily treatment.</p><p>The SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet was generally well tolerated in all administered doses. The most frequently reported IMP&#8208;related AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and most were local reactions related to the sublingual administration of the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet, which was expected from prior trials conducted with the grass, ragweed and HDM SLIT&#8208;tablets.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="all13606-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Generally, tolerability during the trial was similar to observations from prior trials with the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet suggesting that doses up to 12 DU has a tolerability profile suitable for self&#8208;administration, provided that the first dose is administered under medical supervision.</p><p>A particularly important finding from the current trial is the reduction in ARC symptoms during oak pollen exposure, which provides proof of concept for clinically relevant therapeutic cross&#8208;reactivity between birch and oak. Since the trial subjects were selected based on birch sensitization it remains an open question whether patients recruited in an area completely devoid of birch trees would have a similar sensitization profile and response to the treatment. The possibility that clinically relevant AIT coverage with the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet extends to the entire birch homologous group is supported by the very high level of immunological cross&#8208;reactivity between birch and all the birch homologous group species. This is further substantiated by the finding that treatment with the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant symptom reduction upon exposure to oak pollen despite oak being a birch homologous group member that did not show the highest level of immunological cross&#8208;reactivity to birch among the group members. Taken together, the demonstrated IgE and IgG<sub>4</sub> cross&#8208;reactivity supports the use of birch as a representative for the birch homologous group, as also suggested by Lorenz<xref rid="all13606-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> on basis of structural homology between Bet v 1 and homologous PR10 proteins and antibody binding data. The IgE and IgG<sub>4</sub> data provided here also demonstrate immunological cross reactivity between birch and beech at the same level as between the birch homologous group species. This indicates that beech may be considered along with the original five birch homologous group species, as suggested by the European Medicines Agency, EMA<xref rid="all13606-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. This trial was carried out using an EEC, leading to some inherent limitations, especially concerning the reproducibility in an outpatient setting during natural pollination. Existing EEC chambers have been technically validated and it is widely acknowledged that EEC trials eliminate variations in pollen exposure and other potentially confounding environmental conditions.<xref rid="all13606-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> EEC trials are thus optimal for dose&#8208;finding trials and for obtaining information about the onset of efficacy of AIT, while in&#8208;field trials remain essential to measure efficacy during an entire pollen season<xref rid="all13606-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Consequently, a double blind, placebo&#8208;controlled, in&#8208;field phase III trial has been initiated with the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet (12 DU) (EudraCT: 2015&#8208;004821&#8208;15).</p><p>In conclusion, the current trial demonstrates that the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet reduce rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms triggered by birch pollen. Results from oak EEC exposure and IgE and IgG<sub>4</sub> measurements suggest that the use of the SQ tree SLIT&#8208;tablet may be extended to treatment of ARC induced by all other species within the birch homologous group. The combined evidence from reduction of birch and oak induced rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms during pollen exposure in an EEC suggests that the optimal dose for further development is 12 DU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="all13606-sec-0025"><title>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>Dr. Couroux reports grants from ALK, during the conduct of the study.
