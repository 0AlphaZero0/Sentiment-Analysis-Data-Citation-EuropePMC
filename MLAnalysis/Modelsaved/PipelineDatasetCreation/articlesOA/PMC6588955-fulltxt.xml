The exact overall incidence of sarcomas is unknown due to diagnostic difficulties and the various histological subtypes (over 80 subtypes). However, the apparent increasing incidence of sarcomas suggests environmental causes such as pesticides. Except for some specific factors (ie, ionising radiation, vinyl chloride, dioxin and genetic predispositions) the scientific knowledge on the aetiology of sarcomas is sparse and inconsistent. France is a particularly appropriate country to set up a study investigating the causes of sarcoma occurrence due to the French organisation in treatment and care of sarcoma patients, which is highly structured and revolved around national expert networks. The main objective of the ETIOlogy of SARcomas (ETIOSARC) project is to study the role of lifestyle, environmental and occupational factors in the occurrence of sarcomas among adults from a multicentric population-based case&#8211;control study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Cases will be all incident patients (older than 18 years) prospectively identified in 15 districts of France covered by a general population-based cancer registry and/or a reference centre in sarcoma&#8217;s patient care over a 3-year period with an inclusion start date ranging from February 2019 to January 2020 and histologically confirmed by a second review of the diagnosis. Two controls will be individually matched by sex, age (5&#8201;years group) and districts of residence and randomly selected from electoral rolls. A standardised questionnaire will be administered by a trained interviewer in order to gather information about occupational and residential history, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyle factors. At the end of the interview, a saliva sample will be systematically proposed. This study will permit to validate or identify already suspected risk factors for sarcomas such as phenoxyherbicides, chlorophenol and to generate new hypothesis to increase our understanding about the genetic and environmental contributions in the carcinogenicity process.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The present study is promoted by the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (identification number C17-03).

Besides multiple and complex histology (approximatively over 80 subtypes), these tumours can occur in almost any anatomic site. It is usual to distinguish bone sarcomas (osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas) from soft-tissue sarcomas (muscles, joints, fat, nerves, skin tissues and blood vessels) and visceral sarcomas. Even though it accounts for &lt;1% of adult cancers, sarcoma is one of the most frequent cancer types in young adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Based on statistics of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results programme from 2008 to 2012, median age at diagnosis for soft-tissue sarcomas and bones sarcomas were 59 and 42 years of age, respectively, and median age at death was 65 years old for soft-tissue sarcomas and 59 years old for bones sarcomas.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>At the genetic level, sarcomas can be split into two large categories based on the rearrangement level of the genome. On the one side sarcomas with very simple genetics (50% of all sarcomas) based on point mutation (gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), desmo&#239;d tumour) or a specific and recurrent translocation (Ewing, Synovial sarcoma, Myxo&#239;d liposarcoma and so on); and on the other side, sarcomas with a very complex genetics (50% of all sarcomas, leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and so on).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The incidence of sarcomas has been very imperfectly estimated due to both diagnostic confusion with carcinomas of the same organ and the variety of localisation of these tumours. Thirty per&#160;cent of sarcomas are misclassified at initial diagnosis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Cancer incidence is often reported by site possibly leading to an under-estimation of incidence for some subtypes. In France, the world age-standardised incidence rates of overall sarcomas was estimated at 4.8 per 100&#8201;000 inhabitants per year<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and soft-tissue sarcoma&#8217;s incidence, which account for &gt;50% of sarcomas patients was estimated at 3.3 per 100&#8201;000 inhabitants per year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While some authors did not confirm an incidence increase over last years,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> others reported a statistically significant raise of the incidence of sarcomas<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> leading to the hypotheses of an implication of environmental factors in the aetiology of this cancer. However, the role of diagnostic and reporting practice cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The various histological subtypes, various anatomical sites as well as the rarity of the disease make the aetiology of this cancer difficult to study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Some studies have attempted to investigate the role of some environmental factors; however, results are often inconclusive or inconsistent from one study to another. Thus, to date, it is impossible to draw strong conclusions on the aetiology of sarcomas from existing studies. Indeed, there are some methodological considerations to explain discrepancies between studies: sample sizes are often limited leading to insufficient power to detect small but relevant increases in risk. As a consequence, sarcomas are studied as a single outcome and not by histological subtypes; at most they are segregated into bone sarcomas and soft-tissue sarcomas. Such analyses support the strong hypothesis that the same aetiology is shared between each subtype and each site. The inclusion periods of patients are usually old and ascertainment of patients may be incorrect. Indeed, a second expert review of diagnosis is essential to correctly classify sarcoma&#8217;s tumours.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Diagnostic procedures have been refined in expert centres during the last several years with the inclusion of new genetic and molecular data leading to a better understanding and definition of tumours. As a consequence, a new WHO classification of soft-tissue tumours was published in 2013.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>From International Agency for Research on Cancer&#160;(IARC) evaluation, the strongest evidence for environmental cause is for ionising radiations (including radiotherapy) for both soft tissue and bone sarcomas that are classified in group 1 as carcinogenic to humans.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Convincing evidence also exists for linking vinyl chloride to the occurrence of a specific type of sarcoma (liver angiosarcoma). This conclusion arises from consistent observations in vinyl chloride industry that conducted IARC to classify this agent also in group 1 as carcinogenic in humans.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, released to the environment during the combustion of fossil fuels and wood, and waste incineration has also been classified carcinogenic by the IARC, with evidence for soft-tissue sarcoma.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Because epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated higher mortality and incidence rates from soft-tissue sarcomas in farmers, specific attention has been paid to the potential role of pesticide exposure in the occurrence of these tumours.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Several case&#8211;control studies assessed the relationship between herbicide and chlorophenol with soft-tissue sarcoma risk but results varied from no association to a strong relationship for exposed populations.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;20</xref> Discrepancies between studies may be due in part to the low statistical power due to small sample sizes but most importantly to difficulties in exposure assessment. Indeed, disentangling the various contributions of chlorophenols, herbicides and dioxins is complicated because chlorophenols are used in the production of herbicides and dioxins are also a contaminant in herbicides production.</p><p>Some studies have also suggested that other pesticides than phenoxys could play a role in the occurrence of sarcomas. Increased risk of soft-tissue sarcoma have been observed in a cohort of workers in an organochlorine production plant,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> in a population living in the vicinity of an organochlorinated-compounds factory in Spain<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and also in a case&#8211;control study in Canada exploring some specific pesticides.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This last study found significant associations with two insecticides: aldrin (OR=3.71, 1.00&#160;to&#160;13.76) and diazinon (OR=3.31, 1.78&#160;to&#160;6.23) and a trend with formaldehyde (OR=2.07, 0.94&#160;to&#160;4.56). A case&#8211;control study in Kansas failed to find associations with pesticides used on crops, including herbicides<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> but found an increased risk with the use of insecticides to animals,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> higher for farmers who mixed or applied themselves and for those who did not use any protective equipment, also more pronounced for so-called &#8216;fibrous&#8217; and &#8216;myomatous&#8217; sarcomas. A European study on risk of adult bone sarcomas also found an association with pesticides that was similar for insecticides and herbicides.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Other occupational exposures have also been explored and, besides farming, some industries have been associated in some studies with elevated risks of soft-tissue sarcomas: gardeners, meat packers, sawmill workers, machinists and ground maintenance workers.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#8211;29</xref> Exploring specific chemicals or agents, positive associations have been found with wood dust,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> radium<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and 1&#8211;3 butadiene<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> for soft-tissue sarcoma. A multicentre case&#8211;control study in seven European countries specifically focused on bone sarcomas found increased risks among blacksmiths, toolmakers, machine-tool operators and construction workers.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Besides occupational factors, few studies investigated other environmental factors related to lifestyle, including the potential role of female hormones, tobacco smoke, alcohol, nutrition, fluoride in drinking water&#160;and body mass index. These studies reported inconclusive or inconsistent results with the exception of viruses like the HIV and human herpes virus 8 for Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Finally, while there is increased evidence regarding genetic determinants of sarcoma risk,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and growing evidence that gene &#215; environment (G&#215;E) interactions are determinants of development and progression of complex disease,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> to date, there are no data related to such G&#215;E interactions with regards to sarcoma risk. However, studying G&#215;E interactions may help to identify susceptible groups of individuals which is essential to better target prevention programmes or to develop precision medicine.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Several hypotheses have been studied regarding the aetiology of sarcomas. Nevertheless, the methodological limitations such as diagnosis certification, small sample sizes, exposure assessment methodology&#160;and the analysis strategies that do not distinguish the various histological subtypes making the hypothesis that the aetiology is homogeneous across all histological subtypes prevent any definite conclusions. There is a clearly identified need to further investigate the aetiology of sarcomas with improved study designs including a systematic centralised diagnosis review by a second expert, increased sample sizes, more refined exposure assessment methods and also a biological component to increase our understanding of biologic mechanisms of carcinogenesis and to study the interaction between the genetic and environment component.</p><p>France is a particularly appropriate country to set up such study due to the French organisation in treatment and care of sarcoma patients around three national networks labelled by the French National Cancer Institute: the network of reference for soft-tissue sarcoma pathology (RRePS: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rreps.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm">https://rreps.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm</ext-link>), the network of reference for bone sarcoma pathology (ResOs: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://resos.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm">https://resos.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm</ext-link>) and the clinical sarcoma network (NetSarc: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://netsarc.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm">https://netsarc.sarcomabcb.org/home.htm</ext-link>). The objectives of RRePS and ResOs are to ensure systematic and free secondary reviews for all new diagnoses of soft tissue and visceral sarcomas, GIST, desmoid tumours and bone sarcomas across the whole of France, and to facilitate access to molecular biology analyses, collection of samples for biological resource centres, to participate in research and clinical trials, to draft good clinical practice guidelines for professionals and information documents for patients&#160;and to organise continuing education and information for patients.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The NetSarc clinical network for sarcoma is the clinical network of the French Sarcoma Group dedicated to clinical patient care. NetSarc is managed by three sites (Centre Leon Berard in Lyon, Institut Bergonie in Bordeaux and Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif) working closely with 25 expert regional centres, ensuring good coverage of the whole French territory.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Besides, the French population-based cancer registries are organised in a collaborative network named Francim. The main objectives of this network are to coordinate the 14 general cancer registries and 11 specialised cancer registries that exhaustively register all newly diagnosed and confirmed cancer patients according to international procedures, to harmonise patients registration and data quality, to provide epidemiological indicators (incidence, survival, prevalence) and to&#160;coordinate epidemiological and surveillance research on cancer.</p><p>The main objective of the ETIOSARC study is to assess the role of lifestyle, environmental and occupational factors in the occurrence of sarcomas among adults from a multicentre population-based case&#8211;control study.</p><p>Specific objectives are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To identify environmental risk factors for sarcomas as a whole and for the most frequent subtypes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the interactions between gene polymorphisms and environmental exposures in sarcoma susceptibility.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess whether some specific genetic characteristics of sarcoma&#8217; tumours are associated with environmental exposures.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We will also explore the feasibility of classifying sarcomas by genetics types (simple vs complex genomic profile) instead of by histological subtypes as part of the objective of identifying environmental risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The ETIOSARC study is a prospective multicentre population-based case&#8211;control study.

In districts where a general cancer registry is active, the process of identifying incident sarcoma patients is well defined, which warrants the efficiency and exhaustiveness of the recruitment. However, poor survival for some cancer patients will not allow to rely on routine inclusion procedure and the registries will implement a rapid patient ascertainment procedure to minimise the delay between diagnosis and enrolment and interview. Patients will be identified from pathology laboratories and multidisciplinary sarcoma tumour board (including sarcoma, gynaecological, digestive, skin and bone tumour board). CRA will regularly contact laboratories and hospitals (within a 3-month&#160;window) to identify newly diagnosed sarcoma patients and to collect associated reports. The CRA will retrieve the clinical file in order to check inclusion and non inclusion criteria and to collect names and addresses of eligible patients and their physicians. Then, the CRA will contact the patients&#8217; physicians in order to gather their clinical advice to include their patients in the study.

The selection of controls and the recruitment of patients will take place simultaneously. Every time a patient will be diagnosed and identified, two controls will be randomly selected at that time from the electoral rolls of the same district as the patient district of residence. For each patient, a list of 20 potential controls with the same age (within a 5-year age group) and sex as the patients will be constituted and randomly selected in order to account for potential refusal. Calls to contact potential controls will be centralised and will be made by an investigator specifically trained to better understand the objectives of the study.

Since our definition of environmental exposures is very broad, we have based our sample size calculation on various scenarios of exposure prevalence, from 5% (relevant for domestic, environmental but also some occupational exposures such as farmer in the general population) to 20% (relevant for some occupational exposures such as fibres). For a total sample size of 2000 patients and a 1:2 individually&#160;matched design, considering a statistical power of 80% at a significance level of 5%, the minimum detectable OR will be 1.39 and 1.21 under an exposure prevalence of 5% and 20%, respectively. Considering subtypes analyses, the four main histological types are GIST, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and unclassified sarcoma, which account for 18%, 15%, 11% and 16% of sarcomas, respectively. Considering a sample size of 300 patients, the minimum detectable OR will be 2.21 and 1.61 under an exposure prevalence of 5% and 20%, respectively. Typically in environmental epidemiology, the relative increases in disease risks due to environmental exposures are usually low around 1.5, thus, it is essential to recruit a minimum of 2000 patients in order to be able to perform subtype analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Relationship between patient/control status and each exposure variable and 95% CI will be individually estimated using conditional logistic regression models. If necessary, a multilevel logistic model will be implemented in order to take into account the data variability due to the multicentre design and the various CRA that will administer the questionnaires (even if each CRA will be trained to the administration of the questionnaires).</p><p>As previously mentioned, previous case&#8211;control studies had limited sample sizes leading to insufficient power to detect small but relevant increases in risk. As a consequence, sarcomas were studied as a single outcome and not by histological subtypes; at most they were segregated into bone sarcomas and soft-tissue sarcomas. Such analyses supported the strong hypothesis that the same aetiology is shared between each subtype and each site. In this study, we plan to perform stratified histological subtypes analyses. Moreover, since sarcomas may be classified into four groups on a molecular basis (ie, sarcomas with recurrent translocation, sarcomas with specific activating or inactivating mutations, sarcomas with Mouse double minute-2 homolog (MDM2) amplifications and sarcomas with a complex genomic profile), we will explore the feasibility of classifying sarcomas by genetic types instead of by histological subtypes for the objective of identifying environmental risk factors. The underlying hypothesis is that the aetiology among these four molecular groups may be homogeneous.</p><p>Sensitive analyses will be systematically implemented in order to assess the robustness of the produced results and to analyse the impact of potential bias (especially selection bias) on the produced results.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Methods for coordinating the project and for quality control</title><p>This study is organised around three different centres or committees: a national coordination centre, a steering committee&#160;and local centres.</p><p>The national coordination centre will be in charge of running routine operations, assisting participating local centres, guaranteeing the quality of the data collection, centralising data, supervising the data coding and exposure assessment.
