One class in grade 5 was selected from each school. The 28 classes were randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention or control group. School-based salt-reduction education programme was delivered to all the children and their families in the 14 classes of the intervention group, while no specific intervention was delivered to the control group. The duration of the intervention was a school semester (&#8776;3.5 months). Around 10 children were randomly selected from each class and 2 adult family members of each of these children were invited to collect two-consecutive 24-hour&#160;urine at both baseline and the end of trial. A detailed report of the study design and the main results can be found elsewhere.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref> Only brief methods related to this study were described here.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The children social networks study</title><p>The subjects of this study were all the schoolchildren aged 11.2&#177;0.6 (SD) years in the intervention group. The primary outcome was the score on salt-reduction behaviours (hereinafter referred to as SRB score), validated by the reduction in salt intake measured by 24-hour&#160;urinary sodium excretion before and after the intervention. Primary exposure measurements were factors related to the three major domains of the networks of children, including family support, peer network and teacher engagement. Children&#8217;s peer networks were sociocentric networks with each of the 14 classes being a complete network, and all 603 children receiving intervention were recruited. For family and teacher network, only family support and teacher engagement were assessed due to data availability.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participant and public involvement</title><p>The school principals and head teachers of the included schools were involved in the study design stage for the development of intervention activities and for the feasibility assessment of the main trial, from which the present study was further developed.

The post-trial survey was carried out among all the children in the intervention classes 9&#8201;months after the end of the intervention. In this survey, children were asked to fill out a self-administered questionnaire at school time for data on children&#8217;s peer network, their recall of their family members&#8217; support for the School-EduSalt intervention programme during the trial period, and behaviours related to salt reduction. Almost all children (603 out of 604) completed the survey. In the main trial, two-consecutive 24-hour&#160;urine for each child, both before and after the intervention, was collected among a random sample of 141 children to estimate the change in salt intake.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref> More details are given below.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>School-EduSalt network study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-028126f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p>The SRB score was derived from three questions on behaviours related to salt reduction that were collected in the post-trial survey. The three questions were the frequency of eating high-salt snacks (&#8805;3&#8201;days/week, 1&#8211;3&#8201;days/week, almost never), the frequency of eating high-salt pickles (&#8805;3&#8201;days/week, 1&#8211;3&#8201;days/week, almost never) and whether their families are taking actions to reduce salt intake (never, used to, now). Scores ranging from 1 to 3 were assigned to the answer of each question in order. The SRB score was calculated by summing up the standardised score (ie, the z-score, to make the weight of each question comparable) from each question.</p><p>To validate SRB score, we assessed the association of SRB score with the reduction in salt intake measured by 24-hour urinary sodium excretion before and after the intervention among a random sample of children who made 24-hour urine collection as described above. Mixed linear models were used with school and class as random effects, with additional adjustment for age, gender and baseline body mass index. The 24-hour urine collections deemed incomplete were excluded from the analyses.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The number of children with both valid measurements of social network and completed 24-hour urine collection was 135.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assessment of network measures</title><p>Family support for the salt-reduction intervention from each family member was assessed by asking all children in the post-trial survey (ie, supporting, opposing, neither supporting nor opposing). Children&#8217;s peer network was defined as friends within the same class. Each child (ie, the nominator) was asked to nominate his/her friends (ie, the nominees) from the same class who met at least two of the following conditions: (1) play together almost every day during school time, (2) often play or do homework together after school time (&gt;3 days/week), (3) often share snacks and toys, (4) often share extracurricular books and (5) often go to school or go home after school together. In order to take the strength of relation ties into account, we examined friendship ties weighted by the number of above conditions that were met. Peer network measures also included the size and density of the network, as well as degree centrality and peer exposure of each child. Specifically, network size is the number of children in each class. Network density is the total number of friendship connections (ties) divided by the total possible number of ties within the same class, which reflects the overall interconnectedness of the children in the same class.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Degree centrality is the total number of friends the child had, and it reflects the degree to which the child is connected to the network.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We used normalised degree centrality that was divided by the size of class in order to make it comparable across classes. Both density and degree centrality reflect the connectivity of a network, the former at network level and the latter at individual level. Peer exposure (peers&#8217; salt-reduction behaviours) of a child was calculated by summing and averaging the SRB scores of his/her friends. Teacher engagement was recorded during the intervention and was defined as full engagement (both the principal and headteacher attended all activities they had been invited to), partial engagement (attending some of the activities) and no engagement (attending none of the activities).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The association of family support with SRB score was assessed using mixed linear models, which accounted for the clustering effect of children nested within the same class, with the adjustment for age and gender.</p><p>For measures on peer networks, their association with SRB score was first assessed using mixed linear models, with the adjustment for age and gender. Peer networks of all children and their SRB scores were then visualised using network mapping techniques. Additionally, to examine whether SRB scores of the children were influenced by the SRB level of their friends (ie, peer influence), analysis was performed from individual-focused and relation-focused facet, respectively. We first built traditional (individual-focused) mixed models on children&#8217;s SRB score, with children&#8217;s peer exposure, age and gender as covariates. This traditional method using mixed models considered the dependence of observations, but it may not be the optimal method to address the dependence due to the overlap of peer exposures. To address this issue and make inference from network structures, we then used exponential random graph models (ERGM).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The ERGM of social network structure was fit for each peer network based on the difference in SRB scores between each pair of friend ties. This model explained whether the probability of the existence of friend ties between two children was associated with the similarity in SRB scores.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We applied the same model to each of the 14 classes and then used meta-analysis to pool the results across classes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> Fixed-effect model would be used in the absence of significant heterogeneity as assessed by I<sup>2</sup> statistics, otherwise random-effect model would be used.</p><p>Teacher engagement was examined using methods consistent with those for family support. To additionally explore which network (family, peer and teacher) would be potentially more important in influencing the salt-reduction behaviours of children, as a secondary analysis, we examined the role of children&#8217;s social networks simultaneously by including a representative factor for each network in the mixed linear model.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>To test the robustness of primary findings, we performed a sensitivity analysis in a random sample of children (n=135) with completed 24-hour&#160;urine collection at both baseline and the end of the trial. Specifically, change in salt intake (latter-former), assessed by 24-hour&#160;urine sodium excretion, was used as the outcome. The association of three network components (ie, peer, family and teacher network components) with change in salt intake of children were investigated using mixed models with adjustment for age, gender and baseline body mass index.</p><p>Traditional data analysis was performed in SAS V.9.4.

Consistently, according to meta-analysis of the 14 ERGM&#160;built for each of the 14 networks, similarity in SRB score among friends was not found (OR=1.02, 95%&#8201;CI&#160;0.93 to 1.11, p=0.68, online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure S1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028126.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p>

Findings were similar for size and density of peer networks (data not shown). The association of SRB score with teacher engagement was also attenuated (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p><p>In the final sensitivity analysis replacing SRB score with the change in salt intake measured by 24-hour&#160;urinary sodium excretion as the outcome, results were consistent with primary findings. Specifically, with more family members not supporting salt reduction, the reduction in salt intake of children tended to be less (p for&#160;trend=0.01). Children whose father did&#160;not support salt reduction also had an average of 1.39 g (95%&#8201;CI&#160;0.38 to 2.41) less reduction in daily salt intake compared with the children with support from all family member (p&lt;0.001). The role of family support remained statistically significant after further accounting for factors of peer and teacher networks. The association of change in salt intake with peer and teacher network factors were not statistically significant, with point estimates showing essentially similar patterns (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study is the first to explore the role of social networks in salt-reduction behaviours. We found that salt-reduction behaviours in children were related to their family support, peer networks and teacher engagements from multiple aspects. These findings offer new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying successful salt-reduction interventions in the School EduSalt trial. In this trial, interventions were implemented at the class level, with activities strategically designed to engage families, peers, teachers and school administrators. This study provides new evidence on how to design effective behaviour change programmes to reduce salt intake from a social network perspective.</p><p>Our findings on the role of family networks in salt-reduction interventions were consistent with the main body of evidence that demonstrates the role of family support in shaping smoking, physical activity and dietary behaviours.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#8211;33</xref> Our results also suggest that family network, especially family support, could play a more important role in shaping the behaviours of children to reduce salt intake, compared with peer and teacher networks. One explanation could be that children recruited in this study usually had meals at home and therefore their family members had more opportunities to exert a significant influence on their eating behaviours. For peer networks, both density and degree centrality, which reflect better interconnectivity of network members, were associated with favourable behaviours to reduce salt intake. It is possible that the networks that are better interconnected could provide children with more opportunities to gain peer support<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and to influence their peers, which would in turn lead to better salt-reduction behaviours. Likewise, children with more friends within the same class may have a better sense of belonging to the class and were thus more likely to get involved in salt-reduction activities in the class. Similar inverse association between obesity and density of friend networks was also reported in an observational study.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> By contrast, peer influence and homophily phenomena, reported for obesity<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and smoking,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> were not observed for salt reduction in this study. One possibility could be that children with obesity and smoking behaviours are likely to play together but children with similar salt intakes may not necessarily do so. It indicates that, unlike smoking and obesity, salt reduction behaviours of a child may not influence its peer friendship, or vice versa. Furthermore, as first reported in this study, the engagement of school teachers in the intervention activities may also significantly influence the salt-reduction behaviours of children. Their role might be directly exerted through strengthening the children&#8217;s attention to the intervention activities or reinforcing their beliefs in the salt-reduction messages delivered during the health education classes. It could also be mediated through their indirect influences on parents so that parents were more actively engaged in the intervention activities.</p><p>The role of social networks in shaping attitudes and behaviours related to non-communicable chronic diseases has been increasingly recognised.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Emerging intervention studies incorporating network components have achieved desired behaviour changes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;13</xref> For example, it was reported that observing videos of heroic peers eating fruit and vegetables increased fruit consumption in children.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It was also reported that intervention for smoking cessation delivered by peers was more effective compared with usual care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, modifying individual&#8217;s network structures may enhance the social diffusion of desired behaviours.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> One study found that assigning intervention groups based on naturally&#160;formed network, compared with random assignment, enhanced the effect of tobacco control among children.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Similarly, a nutritional intervention that targeting nominated friends of individuals was also demonstrated to increase the adoption of a nutritional intervention.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Nevertheless, given the difficulty in implementing effective dietary and lifestyle interventions, the evidence on incorporating individuals&#8217; social networks into behaviour change interventions is far from sufficient. This is particularly true considering that non-communicable diseases are rooted in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Our study, together with existing evidence,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> suggests the great potential to promote desired behaviour changes and to effectively prevent non-communicable diseases through assessing the social network context and engaging appropriate network interventions.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Our data on peer networks and family support were collected after the end of the trial, which limited our ability to draw causal conclusions on the association of peer network factors with salt-reduction behaviours. Recall bias is also possible and it is more likely that individuals misreported less favourable support as desired support rather than the other way around, possibly resulting in underestimates of the relationships. Additionally, for family and teacher networks, we only examined family support and teacher engagement due to limited data availability. Finally, although peer exposure was not associated with individuals&#8217; behaviours to reduce salt intake in the current study, peer networks beyond the scope of the current study may play a role, such as friends beyond the class and from social media. Our study also has several strengths. This is the first study to explore the role of social network factors in salt-reduction behaviours. This study is based on a well-designed randomised controlled trial that successfully reduced salt intake in children and their families in the intervention arm by about one-fourth in a school semester. Moreover, the primary outcome, that is, SRB score, was validated by sodium intake assessed by 24-hour urine collection&#8212;the current gold method for measuring salt intake&#8212;in a random sample of children.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Though an ideal solution would be assessing behaviours using 24-hour&#160;urine collection for children, it is not feasible to implement this on a large scale as it is costly, resource consuming&#160;and challenging to ensure the completeness of 24-hour&#160;urine collection.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that social networks may play an important role in shaping the behaviours to reduce salt intake in children. It provides new evidence for the benefit of integrating social network components into behaviour change interventions. It has a significant implication for the development of salt-reduction strategies. In a broader context, the study also sheds light on the great potential of incorporating social networks in other diet and lifestyle interventions for the prevention and control of lifestyle-related diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e340"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-028126.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e341"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-028126.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the children and their families, the head teachers and school principals who participated in the study.
