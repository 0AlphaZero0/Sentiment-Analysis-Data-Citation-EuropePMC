Here focus on the site of &#8216;Ein Qashish as a cases study. Located in present-day northern Israel, the area of this site is estimated to have been &gt;1300 m<sup>2</sup>, of which ca. 670 were excavated. The site is located at the confluence of the Qishon stream with a small tributary running off the eastern flanks of the Mt. Carmel. At the area of this confluence, water channels and alluvial deposits created a dynamic depositional environment. Four Archaeological Units were identified in a 4.5-m thick stratigraphic sequence were dated by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to between&#8212;71 and 54 ka, and probably shorter time span&#8211;~70-~60 ka. Here we present the diverse material culture remains from the site (lithics, including refitted sequences; modified limestone pieces; molluscs; faunal remains) against their changing paleogeographic backdrop. Skeletal evidence suggests that these remains were associated with Neanderthals. The large-scale repeated accumulation of late Middle Paleolithic remains in the same place on the landscape provides a unique opportunity to address questions of occupation duration and intensity in open-air sites. We find that each occupation was of ephemeral nature, yet presents a range of activities, suggesting that the locale has been used as a generalized residential site rather than specialized task-specific ones. This role of &#8216;Ein Qashish did not change through time, suggesting that during the late Middle Paleolithic settlement system in this part of the southern Levant were stable.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Derekh Eretz Inc.</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barzilai</surname><given-names>Omry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006363</institution-id><institution>National Geographic Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8943-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7855-6573</contrib-id><name><surname>Hovers</surname><given-names>Erella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005966</institution-id><institution>Leakey Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7855-6573</contrib-id><name><surname>Hovers</surname><given-names>Erella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Irene Levi-Sala CARE Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7855-6573</contrib-id><name><surname>Hovers</surname><given-names>Erella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1232-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7855-6573</contrib-id><name><surname>Hovers</surname><given-names>Erella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science, Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shahack-Gross</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>Athene programme of the University of T&#252;bingen</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stahlschmidt</surname><given-names>Mareike C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution>David Gita &amp; Michael Hoffman Memorial Scholarships, Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nir</surname><given-names>Nadav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award009"><funding-source><institution>Palumbo Carasso Scholarship Fund in Archeology, Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nir</surname><given-names>Nadav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Derekh Eretz Inc.

Researchers have approached the issue of location decisions from a dichotomous perspective placing sheltered (caves, rock shelters) habitation sites vs. short-term task specific open-air sites. Such an approach is anchored in the perception biases of both prehistoric groups and present-day scholars. In the past, the fixed locations of sheltered sites and their visibility on the paleo-landscape drew the attention of humans, leading to repeated occupations that formed long and rich sequences. Although closed sites provide less opportunities for resource procurement (e.g., they cannot be used for hunting or for raw material acquisition), they offer better shelter especially to the more vulnerable members of the group (very young; very old; pregnant females), and are likely to preserve the variable (albeit time-averaged) signatures of social groups. Combined with their visibility on the modern landscape, such characteristics have attracted prehistorians, who targeted sheltered sites as their primary research focus and were often rewarded by spectacular findings. This in turn often biased research in favor of sheltered sites (see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]: appendix 3 for the Levant and [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] for the European record). In the Levant, specifically, material culture remains from caves (mainly stone tools and bones) have constituted the main source of information for comprehending Middle Paleolithic lifeways. In contrast, the location of open-air would often be decided upon in relation to specific traits or activities (e.g., permanent water sources, raw material procurement, hunting and/or plant processing) that cannot take place within sheltered sites. The range of behavioral activities at open-air sites may be more variable than that of cave sites [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Still, the lack of physical boundaries to such sites suggested to many researchers that prehistoric groups did not necessarily return to the exact same spot on the landscape, rendering excavated sequences shorter and less useful for diachronic studies. Also, open-air sites are susceptible to landscape-scale processes in addition to localized anthropogenic, geochemical and taphonomic depositional processes (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), which affect both site preservation and opportunities for archaeological discovery.</p><p>While Levantine Middle Paleolithic (MP) open-air sites were studied in the past [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a renewed research over the last two decades has focused on this type of sites as a source of information complementary to that provided by sheltered sites (e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]).

It is situated in proximity to a number of MP open-air and cave sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The sediments that contain the archaeological materials generally consist of black to greyish-brown loamy clay deposited along the Qishon stream by low-energy flows and accumulated as floodplain/overbank deposits. Throughout the sequence the sediments are dominated by smectitic clay derived from thick vertisols upstream. In addition, the sediments contain aeolian silt and windblown marine fine sand, and are rich in aeolian and reworked quartz and calcite [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Gravel clusters, present in some of the units, may be related to rare larger floods of the Qishon stream. It is more likely, however, that such gravels derived from episodic flows from a steep tributary, Wadi Qashish, which runs off the eastern flanks of Mt. Carmel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g002">Fig 2</xref>), indicating the toe of its alluvial fan. The field relations between the clay and gravel differ spatially from one place to another on the floodplain and diachronically, as is apparent through the sequence within each excavation area. The shifts in the location of the dynamic contacts between the two facies are controlled by the fluvial activity of the ephemeral Wadi Qashish and the perennial flows in the Qishon stream. The increased fluvial activity of Wadi Qashish between 15&#8211;10 ka pushed the alluvial fan contact eastward into the Qishon floodplain and changed its location compared to its presumed location during MP times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g002">Fig 2</xref> and see below).</p><p>The stratigraphic scheme used here is based on correlations across all the excavation areas and trenches exposed during the various seasons of fieldwork (<xref rid="pone.0215668.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s001">S1 section</xref>) and revised for the purpose of this study on the basis of new dating, sedimentological and mineralogical data.

The continuous deposition and aggradation of the fine alluvial overbank sediments, which originate from the upper part of the basin, is interrupted by several unconformities. Some of these unconformities probably correspond to short periods, such as between Unit 3b and Unit 4 and between Unit 4 and Unit 5a. The OSL dating could not distinguish clearly between the ages of the lowermost and uppermost MP layers in units 1&#8211;5, and it appears that the sediments were deposited rapidly (Tables <xref rid="pone.0215668.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s004">S1</xref> and supplementary material in [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Given the resolution of the OSL dates and the dynamic processes affecting the area, a tentative average rate of deposition is three centimeters in one thousand years.</p><p>The site presents eight main depositional phases. The first phase (<italic>phase I</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0215668.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><italic>)</italic>, represented by Units 1 and 2, is alluvial. The sediments consist of coarse and fine gravel lens within a silty clay matrix, indicating a fluvially- dynamic environment, without indications of marsh development or reducing conditions, nor pedogenic properties. The second phase (depositional <italic>phase II</italic>) is an inland, shallow marsh environment [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], developed over the Qishon floodplain and represented by Unit 3 (sub-units 3a and 3b). During the third phase (depositional <italic>phase III)</italic> a limited seasonal water body was formed (Unit 4). A second marsh environment developed during depositional <italic>phase IV</italic> which is represented by Unit 5 (sub-units 5a-5b).</p><p>The characteristics of the various marshes differ. During the two marsh <italic>phases II</italic> and <italic>IV</italic>, sedimentary units include features that indicate hydromorphic conditions and water saturation, such as gley, mottling, Fe-Mn concretions and stains, increasing with depth and proximity to the local modern-day groundwater level. The presence of rhizoliths indicates that these sediments served as substrate for vegetation, the surface of the marsh was stabilized and exposed to aerobic processes and oxidation. This suggests that the marsh may had been seasonal or discontinuous. These observations are consistent with the results of macromorphological [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and micromorphological [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] studies of sediments from Units 1&#8211;3 in the 2009 excavations north of the site (i.e., equivalent to Units 3 and 5 of the 2013 excavations). On the basis of micromorphological and geochemical studies, it was suggested that <italic>phase III</italic> (Unit 4) was a water body extending across an area of at least 600 m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Fe-rich, reddish clay and the presence of large gypsum crystals indicate cycles of dissolution and re-precipitation through evaporation from the proposed shallow water body. This suggests the occurrence of short-term reducing conditions followed by vegetation cover/oxidation and evaporation, consistent with a seasonal rather than permanent water body. The presence of slickensides, formed by shrink-swell cycles, testifies to wetting and drying episodes as well as argilliturbation.</p><p>The well-developed calcic soil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s002">S2 section</xref>) overlying the marsh deposit of Unit 5b developed on an exposed and stable surface over a time span &lt;11 kyr. The site&#8217;s area was then covered by a third marsh phase (<italic>Phase V</italic>) at about 43 ka (Unit 6), with macro-properties similar to those of the earlier marshes. This was followed by a fourth marsh (<italic>Phase VI</italic>) at about 27 ka (Unit 7). A parallel marsh episode around 30 ka was documented by [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in cores from Haifa Bay. An unconformity between <italic>phases V</italic> and <italic>VI</italic> does not allow us to reconstruct the environment between 43 and 27 ka.</p><p>The formation of the major marsh phases was related to blockage of the narrow Qishon water gap by sand transported by westerly winds during periods of low sea level. At such times the coastline would have been several km to the west, the continental shelf exposed [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the climate was wetter. This suggestion is supported by the traces of marine sand at the site [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as well as by adsorption of barium and chlorine, elements that are associated with seawater spray, in Unit 4 [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Large floods in the Qishon stream, which opened the sand blockages and drained the marshes, were related to Heinrich events [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The accumulation of Unit 7 (<italic>Phase VI</italic>) was followed by a &lt;11 kyr long period of exposure and pedogenesis, as indicated by the presence of a moderately-developed calcic soil at the top of the unit. The alternating gravelly and reddish-brown clay sedimentary complex of Unit 8 (<italic>phase VII</italic>) is interpreted as stemming from large, energetic flows from Wadi Qashish into the alluvial fan in the then-deserted area of the MP site, at 15 to 10 ka. In some places, the flows along the alluvial fan cut the MP landscape, depositing large gravel in channels, whereas in other places the area was covered with reddish-brown clay. This period of exposure is also documented at the nearby Epi-Paleolithic site of Ein Qashish South [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This site, which is located a few hundred meters south of the MP site and further away from the Qishon stream, was occupied by Kebaran, Geometric Kebaran and Natufian settlements (Units 6, 5, 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g003">Fig 3</xref> within [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), radiocarbon and OSL dated between 25 and 14 ka. The time span of 25&#8211;14 ka, corresponding to the LGM and post-LGM periods, was probably characterized by large floods along the Qishon stream (Fig 9 within [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). The 0.5 m-thick sedimentary section deposited during this period at &#8216;Ein Qashish South which is probably partly anthropogenic, includes also large angular rock clasts, clay and some sand, suggesting that this site was away from the Qishon floodplain and closer to the slopes of Mt. Carmel. The sediments that accumulated during the Natufian time at &#8216;Ein Qashish South were truncated at a similar time as the truncation and coverage of the MP site by Unit 8 (<italic>phase VII</italic>). Stabilization and soil development characterize the end of this period as shown in trench TQ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>The Holocene deposits (Unit 9 to Unit 11, <italic>phase VIII</italic>) are composed of dark brown clay with some gravel and contain pottery of various periods, as well as black clays deposited from time to time during larger floods along the Qishon stream.</p><p>MP human activities were exposed in four main depositional units: 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b, spanning a maximum time period to ~ 71&#8211;54 ka. Unit 1, in which there were MP lithics, was only exposed in geological trenching but not in the excavation areas, and therefore will not be discussed further. A micromorphological study suggests that fluvial and argilliturbation reworking of sediments in the different areas and various stratigraphic units was limited to the scale of a few centimeters to a few decimeters [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

The faunal remains collected in the 2013 excavation did not show visual evidence of burning (i.e., in coloration, brittleness or fragility), an observation supported by a geochemical study of a comprehensive bone sample from all the excavation areas and all the stratigraphic units, which did not identify any evidence of bone heating or burning [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s003">S3 section</xref>). In addition, no signs of fire were found in micromorphological thin sections [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, burnt flint artifacts were identified in all excavation areas, based on the presence of creasing and potlids, two visual properties that are reliable markers of burning (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Excluding other, less secure indications for burnt flint (e.g., color alterations; [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]), these two characteristics help to identify a minimal number of burnt flint items.</p><p>In the small 2009&#8211;2011 excavation area, burnt flint items constituted 8.4% across all size classes [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In all the archaeology-bearing units of the 2013 excavation a total of 170 burnt flint artifacts &gt;2 cm (1.9% out of the large lithic elements), and 254 &lt;2 cm, (5.1% of the microartifacts) were recovered. Burnt artifacts co-occur both vertically and laterally with the highest densities of lithic artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g016">Fig 16</xref>). Given the site&#8217;s location in an area subject to ongoing fluvial and alluvial processes, such evidence is not necessarily an indication of <italic>in situ</italic> &#8216;phantom hearths&#8217; (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]), or of the original location of activities. Still, the evidence suggests that fire was used at the site in the context of human occupations. That some spatial re-arrangement occurred due to post-depositional movement would suggest that such putative hearths were altered beyond recognition. Alternately, it is possible that combustion features from whence the burnt artifacts derived were located outside the excavated areas [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Paleoclimatic reconstructions suggest that while temperatures were lower than at present, the general trend of temperature increase [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

This in turn caused backward inundation. This inland wetland was drained when stream flows of increased flood magnitudes breached the blocking sand [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] during cooler and drier Heinrich events (H6 and H4) associated with low Lake Lisan levels [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

In this study we sampled four archaeological units, each with a relatively large spatial exposure. The human occupation took place concomitantly with cycles of marshes and draining of ephemeral water bodies, interspersed with periods of landscape stabilization, at an interface of marsh and floodplain dynamics. It was suggested that the MP human occupation could only be seasonal [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] since in winter the area was likely flooded repeatedly with seasonal high water stands. Human occupation would be feasible from early summer to early autumn, namely some 6&#8211;8 months of the year (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The availability of water in the Qishon stream would make the area especially attractive during the summer.</p><p>With the exception of a handful of pollen grains [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and traces of vegetation growing on stabilized soils [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], no plant remains were preserved in EQ. Based on present-day analogues [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], the riverbank habitats combined with marshes and localized seasonal water bodies suggest a diverse vegetation that likely persisted, at least partially, into the dry summer months and may have been a main attraction for animals and humans. Located in the narrow water gap between Mt. Carmel and the Tiv&#8217;on Hills, the landscape around the site made this area suitable for the hunting of large herbivores, using topography to disadvantage prey such as <italic>Bos</italic> (cf.

Small game and carnivore skeletal elements are entirely absent from the faunal sample. The four main mammalian species at the site are aurochs, equids, fallow deer and gazelle. These as well as other animals present at the site have diverse habitat preferences. The aurochs&#8217; preferable habitat is extensive dense vegetation intermingled with swamps and river valleys [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Wild boar exists in dense wetland environments. Other species, such as mountain gazelle, Mesopotamian fallow deer, the equids, and roe deer represent habitats ranging from grasslands, open parkland and dense woodland [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, the animal species known from the site reflect an ecological ecotone that was exploited by the site&#8217;s dwellers.</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Perspectives on site functions</title><p>The unusually large excavated area exposed a range of activities practiced during the different occupations. Three main proxies (knapped lithics, MLP and fauna) are used here to examine the nature and function of EQ and changes through time.</p><p>Preliminary comparisons between excavation areas in the same stratigraphic context, as well as between stratigraphic units, show low intra- and inter-assemblage variability. Yet, there are spatial differences within stratigraphic units in lithic densities, faunal presence, and the relative abundance of each category. For example, Area F presents a high density of faunal remains while in Area B lithics are relatively more abundant.</p><p>The lithic assemblages constitute the most prolific source of information for possible activities at the site. Throughout time and space, flint constitutes a nearly exclusive raw material used in lithic production (99.7% out of 12,329 large items; Table b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s005">S2 Table</xref>), the remaining 0.3% percent being limestone and basalt. The flint originated from several sources at variable distances from the site ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; and see below). On-site knapping is evident by the refitted core-and&#8211;flake sets as well as by the presence of cores and hammerstones in the assemblages, but the initial stages of reduction are poorly represented.</p><p>Lithic production within each unit involved three main technological systems: Levallois [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], cores-on-flakes ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and references therein) and bladelet production ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and reference therein) (Table b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s005">S2 Table</xref>). In addition, expedient lithic production was documented. The lithic assemblages at EQ represent a range of technological options. With the exclusion of the bladelet production, the flaking systems used do not aim to obtain products of particular shape or size. Blank production, core maintenance (attested by refits) and tool discard suggest provisioning of place [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], consistent with a general activity site, despite the relatively low densities of artifacts.</p><p>Some 24 artifacts (including MLP in the assemblages) were made of limestone. This raw material was probably collected from nearby channels, where cobbles of suitable sizes for making MLPs were present. The four MLPs were found in Areas B and F in units 3a and 3b. All the items exhibit shared characteristics, such as reworking of the edges and (possibly) working surfaces with depressions or grooves. In other cases, use wear and residue analyses, as well as experimental work on similar limestone or basalt items (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]) linked pitted anvils to plant processing (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]), bone processing (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]), or bipolar lithic production (e.g.[<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]). In the absence of evidence for the latter, it is suggested that the MLPs in the various units of EQ were used for processing vegetal material and/or faunal resources.</p><p>Linking the MLPs to edible faunal species may be plausible given that percussion marks were documented on the faunal elements of the 2009&#8211;2011 bone assemblage ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). In contrast, plant remains did not preserve at the site (see above). Notably, evidence from other Levantine sites suggests that Neanderthals relied on edible plants ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]; see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and references therein; [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]), even though processing tools were not identified. The functional and behavioral significance of MLPs at EQ remains to be studied through investigating the spatial association of modified bones with the MLPs (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]) and through residue and use-wear analyses.</p><p>Faunal body part representation is another proxy that can be used to understand site function. Cave sites usually contain bones from whole carcasses of smaller animals and meaty parts (usually of high nutritional value) of larger animals that were selectively transported to the sites ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and references therein). At the place of hunting/butchery on the open landscape, one may expect a more complete representation of medium- and large-bodied species [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] or even a &#8220;reversed&#8221; body part profile that is biased against the exported meaty parts. Preliminary observations suggest that at EQ limb bones were fragmented anthropogenically. These occurrences indicate that humans were responsible for the accumulation of the animal remains, most probably following hunting. The presence of an almost complete skull of <italic>Bos</italic> and associated neck vertebrae in the area excavated in 2009&#8211;2011 may support an interpretation of hunting grounds for herbivores [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The proxies of hominid fire use at EQ are conflicting. It is possible to identify in open-air contexts signs of fire use other than clear combustion features (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). At EQ no evidence was detected for hearths or combustion features (see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] for the distinction between the two forms of fire use). The human occupations at EQ took place in muddy surroundings with high moisture, where ash would dissolve quickly [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This may in part explain the absence of macroscopic evidence for fireplaces. Still, no burnt bones were identified, either physically or geochemically. The latter phenomenon cannot be attributed to preservation bias [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and demands explanation either through behavior or through formation processes. On the other hand, the presence of burnt artifacts, typically in close association with lithic assemblages in the various stratigraphic units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g016">Fig 16</xref>) does suggest fire use at the site by humans.</p><p>One complicating factor related to the use of fire in open-air sites are wildfires. In the Mediterranean climatic zone, lightening is the major cause of wildfires [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], typically occurring during winter ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]:76), and are usually of relatively low temperature and/or last for short periods. Rarer occurrences of high intensity and/or prolonged wildfires exceeding 500&#176;C may cause visible signs of burning (pot-lids, cracking and crazing; [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]) in open-air sites where flint was used as raw material. These could mistakenly be ascribed to human agency. At the specific case of EQ, since winter occupation was highly unlikely (see above), the feasibly of wildfire as the cause of lithic burning is low.</p><p>Given the variable lines of evidence, we suggest that the locality of EQ was used for different purposes, including raw material provisioning, knapping, possibly procurement and clearly consumption of faunal resources, and, potentially, processing of animal and or/other resources as hinted by the limestone implements. While the remains of EQH-3 could not be attributed with certainty to mortuary practices, it is possible that activities unrelated to subsistence may have taken place during some occupation episodes (e.g., the occupation in Unit 3b), as attested by the presence of the marine mollusk, and knapping, as identified by refitting. Because the clear lateral and vertical associations and the refitted items suggest that the variable finds represent diverse activities on the paleo-landscape, the archaeological units at EQ are interpreted as generalized occupations rather than as palimpsests of successive task-specific occupations.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Occupation duration and intensity</title><p>Estimating the duration and intensity of occupation(s) at EQ is a major challenge. Based on artifact densities, the composition of the lithic assemblages and the refitted sets, we posit that occupations were both ephemeral and repetitive.</p><p>Artifact densities in EQ are overall low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Even the higher densities suggested for the occupation of archaeological Unit 5b are rather sparse (ca. 221 items per cubic meter) in comparison to MP cave sites ([<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]: table 7.2;[<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]). For example, in Amud cave where the original sediment volume did not go significant compaction due to diagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the densities of lithic items was calculated as &gt;1000/ m&#179; items per 1,000&#8211;1,500 TL years. Other open-air sites (Hummal upper layers, [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; Umm el Tlel, [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]; Quneitra, [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) exhibit higher densities than EQ. Higher densities of lithic artifacts were observed in several sites due to mostly differential depositional histories (Negev sites: [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]; Givat Rabi East: [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; and some of the Nesher Ramla site units: [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]).</p><p>The thickness of the archaeological units suggests repeated occupations on a given paleo-landscape (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g012">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s007">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s008">S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215668.g016">Fig 16</xref>, the low densities of lithic artifacts may indicate short, ephemeral occupations. Unit 4 presents an exceptionally low density of artifacts, which likely were transported sporadically by geogenic or anthropogenic agents into a water body.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that raw material was obtained within the daily exploitation territory of the site [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and knapped locally, with some of the tools produced off-site and brought to EQ as personal gear and maintained at the site [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The short refitting sets from the 2013 excavation areas consist of only 2&#8211;3 pieces and up to only 8 items. Only a few of the refitted items represent early stages of core reduction. This as well as the low percentage of cortical elements (Table a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215668.s005">S2 Table</xref>) in the lithic assemblages suggests that initial knapping typically occurred off-site, while core maintenance took place at the site. These lines of evidence suggest a mobile toolkit.</p><p>The ephemeral character in combination with a high rate of sedimentation and local depositional conditions may explain the invisibility of fire residues (see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for a formal model of this scenario). In Levantine caves, high frequencies of burnt bones stem from repeated use of hearths in the same places within the cave [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], causing charring of pre-existing bone refuse, high bone fragmentation sometimes accompanied by cementation of large amounts of ash (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In MP open-air sites, there are no natural or built boundaries of the human settlement, therefore the location of fireplaces may have shifted spatially from one episode of occupation to another. If such was the case at EQ, the signatures of fire use would be lost to the archaeological eye.</p><p>To summarize, the sedimentary and archaeological records at EQ represent minimally four short and repetitive human occupations during a time span of several thousand years. Importantly, the areas exposed in the excavations were not the only ones occupied, as we estimated the site area at minimally 1300 square meters [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This persistent use of the site suggests a special attraction to the particular point, perhaps due to its location on the landscape, in the narrow corridor between the Carmel flank and the Tiv&#8217;on Hills near a source of fresh water, for the purpose of monitoring and hunting animals. We suggest that the repeated use of this location present the retention of memory from one occupation phase to the other. EQ seems to have been a long-standing focal point within the settlement system of the late Levantine MP in northern Israel.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>EQ within its broad settlement system</title><p>EQ is geographically close to major late MP cave sites in northern Israel. The closest MP occupation is ca. 3 km away in Raqefet cave [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].

The case study of EQ allows us to re-examine the structure of late MP settlement patterns.</p><p>Two main areas of lithic raw material procurement were identified [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The main one, from which the bulk of the lithic material originates, is located west of the site (on Mt. Carmel). The second procurement area is found southwest of the site in the Menashe Hills, where several flint types were obtained, mostly from secondary sources. High quality, abundant flint sources are located east of EQ but appear to not be imported into the area of the site sampled during the 2009&#8211;2011 project [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A minute portion of artifacts in the much larger 2013 assemblage was attributed to sources in the latter area, perhaps due to the larger sample size. In general, EQ inhabitants focused on local raw material sources found within daily exploitation territories around the site. Few artifacts were brought as personal gear from more distant sources.</p><p>Another item that was brought to the site from beyond the daily exploitation territory is the single <italic>Hexaplex</italic> mollusk. Some of the large ungulate species may have been brought from areas beyond the immediate flood plain and marshes of EQ. Dense vegetation around the site likely prohibited the presence of mountain gazelle and equid, which were most likely procured beyond the immediate surrounding of the locality.</p><p>The exploited territory around EQ may have been shared with the occupants of other (broadly contemporaneous) nearby late MP cave sites. For example, the areas of Menashe Hills and Mt. Carmel were probably used as flint procurement areas by the inhabitants of Kebara Cave [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].

Others (e.g., the occurrence of a bladelet reduction system at EQ and the paucity of points compared to Kebara) differ. EQ shared similarities in the lithic assemblage also with penecontemporaneous sites further away (e.g., Amud, Quneitra, NMO, Umm el Tlel and Hummal), suggesting that groups with similar economic goals, knowledge, and mobility strategies repeatedly inhabited the area Thus these sites can be studied as components of integrated settlement systems [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the occupants of late MP sites in the Mediterranean zone of the Levant practiced residential mobility in relatively small areas around cave sites, resulting in many returns to any given location [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Caves were selected for use based on shelter properties and ease of access [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] as well as proximity to ecotones, and were used for varied and generalized functions characterizing social groups, including flint knapping, food processing, mortuary practices and information transfers (e.g., Amud, Kebara caves) [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Many of the open-air sites were interpreted as locations where a narrower range of activities was carried out, often related to hunting (e.g., NMO;[<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Umm El Tlel;[<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] and butchering (Quneitra; [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] about sites in the Negev; but see [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]), and as short-term occupations. The absence of physical boundaries in such sites reduces the odds of discovering superimposed anthropogenic deposits similar to those found in caves. Where such repeated occupation events could be identified, open-air sites sometimes demonstrate changes in site functions (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]).</p><p>An increasing interest in open-air sites and an overall change in the perception of the MP has led researchers to the understanding that both caves and open-air sites should be studied as components of integrated settlement systems. In the late MP in particular, it has become clear that open-air sites and caves found in the same geographical vicinity are penecontemporaneous and may represent complementary location choices within a settlement system. This allows us to identify the hierarchy among site locations in the settlement systems of this period. While caves retain their place as first and foremost &#8216;home base&#8217; locations, the diverse characteristics of open-air sites represent a continuum of roles from task-specific to more generalized &#8216;home bases&#8217; [<xref rid="pone.0215668.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This in turn implies that residential mobility during the late MP included also logistical visits between sites (open-air sites and caves). While linking specific caves and open-air sites based on archaeological finds alone is currently unattainable (also due to precision constraints of dating methods), it may not be a necessary step for reconstructing the bigger picture of decision-making criteria and behaviors.</p><p>The case of EQ provides an intermediate example between the two polarizing scenarios of site typologies. The site represents a series of consecutive ephemeral occupations, within each of which a range of activities were carried out. Throughout the time of its occupation, EQ functioned mainly as a residential site in which general activities took place, indicating a stable settlement system during the late MP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>EQ includes minimally four diachronic occupations and potentially more than one occupation on a given landscape. At least some of the occupations were short-lived and underwent rapid burial. Unlike other stratified open-air sites currently known from the southern Levant, the series of occupations at EQ does not show drastic changes in site function or in activities carried out. Rather, this locale seems to have been used repeatedly as a generalized residential site (&#8216;home base&#8217;), albeit occupations were of an ephemeral nature.</p><p>Open-air sites are an integral part of the settlement systems in the Levant during the MP. Together with cave sites, they constitute complementary components of settlement/mobility systems. The case of EQ demonstrates that the rigid dichotomy between &#8216;home base&#8217; sites of long duration, typically associated with sheltered locales, and task-specific, short-term occupations on the open landscape, is an oversimplification of a complex behavioral system. The challenge for the next phase of research is to come up with analytical and methodological tools to address such complex past realities and to delineate the range of behaviors and processes that may have created them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215668.s001"><label>S1 section</label><caption><title>Site stratigraphy and sedimentology.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215668.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215668.s002"><label>S2 section</label><caption><title>Calcic soils.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215668.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215668.s003"><label>S3 section</label><caption><title>Bones analysis.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215668.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215668.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Laboratory data and OSL ages for &#8216;Ein Qashish.</title><p>S2A Table.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215668.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215668.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><p>(a) The Lihtic assemblages of &#8216;Ein Qashsi according to stratigraphic units and excavation areas.
