Cell lines with high specific productivities may simplify the FSH production process. Here, we used our previously established expression system based on vector p1.1 to create new cell lines secreting heterodimeric FSH protein. To this end, we linked open reading frames of both FSH subunits by the wild-type internal ribosome entry site from the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV IRES). Intact and double-negative for the dihydrofolate reductase CHO cells were stably transfected by the FSH-coding plasmids. Stably transfected intact cells showed higher level of the FSH secretion and were utilized for subsequent methotrexate-driven transgene amplification, which doubled their productivity. The excess of the free &#945;-subunit was corrected by transfecting the cells by the additional p1.1-based plasmid encoding the &#946;-subunit of the FSH. Clonal cell lines obtained secreted mostly the heterodimeric FSH and possessed specific productivities up to 12.3&#177;1.7 pg/cell/day. Candidate clonal cell line C-P1.3-FSH-G4 maintained a constant specific productivity for at least 2 months of culturing without the section pressure. The resulting FSH protein conformed to the international pharmaceutical quality criteria as evidenced by the receptor binding kinetics, distribution pattern of hormone isoforms and biological activity. In conclusion, our expression system offers a simple and cost-effective approach to production of FSH.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-34-60242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orlova</surname><given-names>Nadezhda A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>IVFarma, LLC</institution></funding-source><award-id>&#8470; 105/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0064-4458</contrib-id><name><surname>Vorobiev</surname><given-names>Ivan I.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The project was supported by the grant 16-34-60242 of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Moscow, Russia; website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/eng">https://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/eng</ext-link>) to NAO in a part of p1.1 derivative vectors comparison and investigation.

Urinary-derived and recombinant forms of FSH are widely used in infertility treatment for assisted reproducing technologies [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since both of the above have the same efficacy and safety profiles, the clinical choice of FSH source is usually defined by availability, convenience, and cost [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As patents on innovative recombinant FSH products approach expiration, there is an increasing global interest in developing methodology for biosimilar FSH generation [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>FSH consists of two dissimilar, non-covalently linked subunits with two sites for N-glycosylation at each polypeptide chain [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; mature &#945;-chain of the FSH consists of 96 aminoacids (10.3 kDa), mature &#946;-chain is of 111 aminoacids (12.5 kDa). FSH is abundantly glycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight of about 34 kDa. Glycosylation plays an important role in its specific activity because affinities for the receptor and half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> for different isoforms vary in wide range. Namely, acidic hormone isoforms, containing more terminal sialic residues on the N-linked glycans, demonstrated lower affinity toward the FSH receptor and lower specific activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> tests, but show longer half-life in the bloodstream [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, neutral FSH isoforms are as active as moderately acidic ones <italic>in vitro</italic> and have significantly decreased plasma half-life. The FSH preparations for clinical use should be devoid of non-sialylated variants and possess a proper balance between slightly acidic and more highly acidic isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since bacterial and yeast expression systems cannot recapitulate the relevant glycosylation profile, the currently used expression systems for recombinant FSH production are based on mammalian cell lines, especially CHO cells [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The typical FSH production rate reported to date is 0.5&#8211;1.5 pg/cell/day [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Clonal CHO-based cell line, described as being able to produce a &#8220;highly expressed&#8221; FSH demonstrated a specific productivity of only 0.0085 mIU/cell/48 hours, which corresponds to 0.32 pg/cell/day level [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>There are multiple ways of balancing the expression level of two genes encoding subunits of the heterodimeric protein. The simplest way is the co-transfection of two plasmids with different selection markers, each encoding one of the two polypeptide chains under the control of the same promoter [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this case, successive target genes amplification in the genome of host cells, performed as the gradually increase of the selection pressure of the dihydrofolate (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) inhibitor methotrexate (MTX) is questionable. Many individual cells will amplify only one target gene, linked with the DHFR selection marker, leaving the second gene un-amplified and under-expressed. As the result, many individual cell clones should be obtained from the initial stably transfected cell population and screened for the ability to increase production of the heterodimeric protein after exposure to increasing MTX levels.</p><p>Another method consists in the construction of the single plasmid, containing both genes under control of two identical or different promoters. In this case, both genes may be MTX-amplified right in the polyclonal population of stably transformed cells, but relative levels of two genes expression will remain constant. This will result in the secretion of the mixture of target heterodimeric protein and one of its subunits in the monomeric form (i.e. free chain) [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two genes may be linked in one expression plasmid by the IRES sequence instead of the promoter duplication. This design can provide the tightest link between two target genes and make the MTX-driven amplification more effective, although the resulting expression level of two genes still may be not balanced [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The second plasmid, coding the under-expressed chain with another selection marker may be transfected to the polyclonal MTX-amplified cell population and cell clones secreting mostly the heterodimeric protein may be picked up and used for target protein production.</p><p>Previously we have designed the set of vectors, based on endogenous translation elongation factor 1 &#945; 1 (EEF1A) gene from Chinese hamster (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>) and the fragment of long terminal repeats from Epstein-Barr virus, named p1.1 and p1.2 respectively [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These vectors allow the high level of target genes expression in CHO cells at the relatively low insertion copy numbers. Also, unlike the initial EEF1A1-based vector pDEF38, the p1.1 vector yields much more stably transfected cell colonies at the initial selection stage due to the presence of the terminal repeat fragment from the Epstein-Barr virus [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The vector p1.1 utilizes the DHFR selection marker and is suitable for methotrexate-driven target gene amplification and p1.2 vectors with antibiotic resistance genes may be co-transfected for expression of additional genes. We used the p1.1 vector for development of cell lines, secreting human blood clotting factor VIII with the end-titer up to 40 IU/ml and utilized p1.1 and two p1.2 vectors for cell lines, secreting fully active blood clotting factor IX with the end-titer 6 IU/ml in the simple batch culturing [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the latter case, p1.2 vectors with the zeocin and hygromycin selection markers were utilized to transfect supporting genes, coding enzymes VKORC1 and PACE/furin, which enabled the proper post-translational modifications of the factor IX molecule [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both these genes were expected to express at lower levels than the target gene.</p><p>We hypothesized that in the case of heterodimeric protein, the vector pair consisting of one genome-amplifiable p1.1 vector and one non-amplifiable vector may be utilized for creation of cell lines with high specific productivity. The proper balance between expression levels of two polypeptide chains may be achieved if the genome-amplifiable p1.1 vector encodes both chains by the single multicistronic RNA and the second non-amplifiable vector encodes one chain, under-expressed by the first vector plasmid. Open reading frames of two chains may be interspersed by the wild-type IRES of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), this variant of IRES is known to provide the highest level of translation initiation [<xref rid="pone.0219434.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the p1.1 vector plasmid the target ORF is already linked to the mouse DHFR ORF by the attenuated EMCV IRES, so the resulting mRNA will be tricistronic, this order is expected to provide the tightest connection of both target ORFs with the selection marker ORF. This tight link may be more resistant to the MTX-driven genome amplification of the selection marker alone, possible in cases of expression vectors with the separate selection marker gene with its own promoter and terminator.</p><p>Human FSH was used as the target heterodimeric protein for testing the vector combination design because it is a practically useful and abundantly glycosylated protein. In this paper, we present the development of CHO cell line, secreting mostly the heterodimeric FSH in large quantities and the process of FSH purification.

To test this, we lowered the density and shortened the passage time, for the most productive cell line G4, using the seed density 0.2 mln cells/ml, three days planned passage time and maximal allowable cell density 1.8 mln cells/ml.

We used previously designed specialized plasmid vectors, containing non-coding areas of the EEF1A1 gene and the fragment of the long terminal repeat from the Epstein-Barr virus. Open reading frames of two FSH subunits were connected by the wild-type EMCV IRES and linked to the mouse DHFR ORF area by the attenuated EMCV IRES, forming the tricistronic mRNAs. It was found that secretion of heterodimeric FSH is evident only in the case of &#945;-chain ORF in the first cistron position, the opposite order of chain&#8217;s ORFs resulted in non-secreting stably transfected cell population. DHFR-positive CHO S cells, stably transfected by the p1.1-FSH-BIA, demonstrated much higher specific productivity, than DHFR-negative CHO DG44 cells. Excess of the free &#945;-chain of FSH in the culture medium was compensated by the second transfection of the polyclonal cell population by the plasmid, coding only the &#946;-chain of FSH. Several of the clonal cell lines derived from the doubly transfected cells secrete heterodimeric FSH in large quantities. Therefore, the combination of genome-amplifiable tricistronic plasmid vector and monocistronic vector with the DHFR-compatible selection marker is sufficient for generating cell lines secreting large quantities of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones.</p><p>Since the best-producing clonal cell line C-P1.3-FSH-G4 maintains the constant titer of secreted FSH for at least 2 months of cultivation in batch culture, it may be used for large-scale long-term FSH production. Purified FSH, derived from the C-P1.3-FSH-G4, was analyzed on receptor binding, glycan structure, FSH <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. It has very similar structural properties to other original and biosimilar FSH preparations described in the literature. Taking together, we have shown that EEF1A1-based vectors with multicistronic operons are suitable for the generation of cell lines producing large quantities of heterodimeric proteins for therapeutic applications in humans. High specific cell productivity achieved using our approach may have significant implications for industrial applications&#8211;much smaller bioreactor vessels, simple batch culturing instead of perfusion-based process and complete absence of ultrafiltration-diafiltration operations will greatly diminish both capital and operational costs of biosimilar FSH production.</p><p>A method for clonal cell line generation resulting in large quantities of secreted heterodimeric proteins with only minor levels of free chain by-products, as described in this article, may be a promising general strategy for production of various glycosylated heterodimeric hormones, including lutheinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, chorionic gonadotropin and other biotherapeutic proteins with the comparable size and level of glycosylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219434.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>qPCR analysis of the expression cassette copy numbers per haploid genome for p1.1-FSH-AIB and p1.1-FSH-BIA plasmids.</title><p>IRES-DHFR area&#8212;RT-ID-F, RT-ID-R primer pair; &#946;-chain area&#8212;SQ-FB-F, SQ-FB-R primer pair.
