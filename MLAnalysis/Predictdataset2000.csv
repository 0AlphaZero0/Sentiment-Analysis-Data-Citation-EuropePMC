PMC5045879	E-MEXP-569	Methods	ArrayExpress	False	Use	nan	To examine how mechanical stress contributes to the response of VSMC and its underlying signal transduction pathways, we made use of the microarray experiment, E-MEXP-569, downloaded from the ArrayExpress database (Brazma et al., 2003). 	The experiment compared the gene expression profiles of the VSMC in response to a cyclical mechanical strain over a time-course of 0, 2, 4 and 24 h. Each sample consisted of two replicates prepared from human aortic VSMC purchased from Cambrex Bioscience. 	7.534220230551938e-07	0.0002416666025583741	0.9997575799754186

This additional information brought by the analysis at the protein-level indicates that a virus distantly related to the TYMV could be present in the dataset. 	0.05218459288184567	3.342458157867657e-10	0.9478154067839086

PMC4299518	AB266616	Results	ENA	False	Use	For this study we selected three Fusarium genes with different characteristics. 	The first targeted gene, FOW2 (Genbank AB266616.1) encodes a putative transcription regulator belonging to the Zn(II)2Cys6 family and has been shown to be essential for pathogenicity of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis (Imazaki et al., 2007). FOW2-targeted mutants completely lost pathogenicity, being unable to colonize the roots of the host but were not impaired in vegetative growth or conidiation when grown in culture. 	In addition, mutations in the same gene of a different forma specialis (f. sp. lycopersici) also resulted in loss of pathogenicity, implying the universal importance of the gene for pathogenicity. The second gene selected was FRP1 (Genbank AY673970.1) which encodes an F-box protein that interacts with SKP1 to facilitate targeting of proteins to the SCF-ubiquitination complex. 	0.01497401050376099	3.7126243590111806e-06	0.9850222768718799

The final target of our study is a gene encoding for a protein with homology to 12-oxo-phytodienoate reductase (OPR) (Genbank AFQF01002613), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in plants (Wasternack, 2007). 	0.0038812073890579857	2.3492244917363975e-10	0.9961187923760195

PMC4299518	AAT85970	Discussion	ENA	False	Background	Disruption in FRP1 led to a complete loss of pathogenicity in tomato with mutant fungi unable to colonize the roots (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). 	The fact that FRP1 is an F-box protein and that it physically interacts with F. oxysporum SKP1 (Genebank AAT85970.1) suggests that FRP1 is part of a SCF ubiquitin kinase complex. 	The F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici FRP1 protein has highly homologous counterparts (86–100% identity) in other Fusarium species (F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans; f. sp. cubense races 1 and 4, F. fujikuroi, F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum) and it is also present in other plant pathogenic fungi such as Colletotrichum graminicola (63% identity) and even non plant pathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (66% identity) and Neurospora crassa (55% identity). The relatively high level of homology is probably due to the conservation of the F-box motif and points to the suggestion that an FRP1-associated SCF ubiquitin ligase complex plays an important role in degradation of pathogenicity-related proteins through ubiquitination (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). 	0.9990435125843454	1.7129359151942393e-10	0.000956487244361062

Another ATF2 splicing variant is expressed in myometrial tissues during pregnancy/labor (GenBank: AY029364.1) [50]. 	ATF2-small (ATF2-sm) only comprises the first two and last two exons, lacking therefore the most part of the functional domains, i.e. the sequence encompassing the two threonine residues 69 and 71 of the activation domain and the bZIP domain. Nevertheless, it was intriguingly described to exhibit a CRE-binding activity and to be transcriptionally active to an equivalent degree to that of full length ATF2 [50]. 	0.5957505333612656	3.307428132659505e-09	0.40424946333130635

The full sequences of the ATF7-4 transcript (787 nucleotides) and protein (117 amino acids) have been given the GenBank and Swissprot accession numbers BC042363 and Q8IVR8 respectively. 	The pG4-ATF7(2–82) and pG4-ATF2(19–96) plasmids encode the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein fused to the human activation domain of either ATF7-FL (amino acids 2–82) or ATF2 (amino acids 19–96), as previously described [39], [52]. The (17m5)-TK-Luc reporter [61] contains the luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter and five Gal4 binding sites. 	0.026066667731791705	0.00030242657545418025	0.9736309056927541

The results showed that the knockdown of NR_027457 and AF085938 significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro (Figure 4A, 4B), while the silencing of G36948 and AK002210 in SVneo cells significantly promoted the cell migration and invasion abilities (Figure 4C, 4D).

Strikingly, when we analyzed the genomic synteny between M. lepraemurium, M. intracellulare, and M. avium subsp. hominissuis, all the synteny breaks in M. lepraemurium occurred at the locations of this particular IS (Fig. S3A and B). The synteny plot between M. lepraemurium and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis looked different from the aforementioned genomes, which is probably due to genomic rearrangements in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Fig. S3C). 	0.00021590730095876672	3.7637554569746e-08	0.9997840550614866

Mutational analysis of the MLK4 kinase domain in 147 colorectal cancers revealed a rather high frequency (6.8%) of somatic mutations.31 In this study, our MLK4 sequence was used (GenBank database, accession No. AJ311798). 	However, Shao et al. 2007 did not find any mutations in the MLK4 kinase domain in 46 colorectal samples isolated from Japanese patients and only two of 24 cell lines in the study harbored the mutation R470C in the MLK4 gene.32 No mutations in MLK4 were found in gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas from Korean patients either, suggesting that the MLK4 kinase domain mutations are rare and may not contribute to the development of these carcinomas.33 The relevance of these observations is unclear and currently, no evidence suggests that any MLK family member functions as an oncogene in humans. MLK4β-transgenic mice were produced but, surprisingly, no obvious phenotypical abnormalities were observed compared to the non-transgenic mice after 12 months’ observation. 	0.0010359433470680487	6.16121783085142e-08	0.9989639950407535

PMC4247701	HM585369	Introduction	ENA	False	Use	In our earlier findings, we have reported that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) increases withanolide content due to the presence of stress regulatory elements within the upstream promoter regions of their genes [20,23]. 	We, in present study report isolation, heterologous expression and transcript profiling of two A-type P450 monooxygenases viz. WsCYP98A (GenBank: HM585369) and WsCYP76A (GenBank: KC008573). 	These are supposed to be involved mainly in the shikmate and phenylpropanoid pathway biosynthesizing the various defence molecules during biotic and abiotic stress. CYP98A (p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase) catalyzes the meta-hydroxylation of p-coumarate derivatives for the biosynthesis of lignins and chlorogenic acid, which constitutes a crucial bottleneck in phenylpropanoid pathway [24]. 	0.0007155116327023571	1.532810771533997e-11	0.9992844883519696

PMC6004538	CP000424	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	As the operon was more highly expressed in the absence of cysteine, it may indeed be involved in the transport of cysteine or of the precursors needed for cysteine biosynthesis. 	This transport system was also found on a plasmid in L. paracasei ATCC 334 (GenBank acc. no.CP000424) but not in other L. paracasei genomes in the GenBank database. 	Since cheese is a cysteine-poor environment, the presence of a cysteine transport system apparently does not provide an evolutionary advantage for this bacterium, which could explain why this transport system is not widely distributed in L. paracasei strains, especially those of dairy origin. Analysis of the RNA-seq data enabled identification of the genes that formed transcriptional units (Figure 3). 	0.0009241079977394262	2.744526947073233e-07	0.9990756175495659

To determine whether gene amplification could account for the broadly improved replication of passaged VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 we performed paired-end Illumina based deep sequencing (Short Read Archive #SRP033208). 	Based on read depth, we detected duplication of the rhtrs1 locus in all three passage 7 virus pools but not in VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 (Fig. 4A). Each of the passaged pools contained between 1.4 and 1.9 copies of rhtrs1 per genome, although these numbers reflect averages of a heterogeneous population of viral genomes. 	0.9828051623477672	0.0003856479553825911	0.016809189696850316

The lack of a Oshox14 mutant in the Tos17 insertion mutant collection (Hirochika 2001) does not contradict with the notion that HvHox2 is essential for plant growth and development in the cereals. In contrast, the loss of Vrs1 function both in natural variants, and in many induced mutants (including the total deletion of the gene) indicates that Vrs1 is non-essential for plant growth and development (Komatsuda et al. 2007). 	0.39358658102569183	4.2510518815301454e-10	0.606413418549203

PMC5577242	J04431	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	In the nucleus, this complex acts as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor by binding to a GC response element (GRE) in the promoter of a target gene. 	When we analyzed the promoter regions of TGF-β genes using the MatInspector V2.2 program56, our results showed that the promoters of the human (GenBank Accession # J04431), rat (GenBank Accession # AF239170 and # AF249327) and mouse (GenBank Accession # M57902) TGF-β1 gene have binding sites for consensus GRE (5′-AGAACA). 	These observations support the hypothesis that GCs may be involved in the regulation of TGF-β genes inhibited in skeletal tissue after denervation by a GR pathway. The results in this study are important from a clinical standpoint because reduction of bone formation is a significant metabolic response in denervated patients. 	0.00047208836119059253	1.4479218104888616e-09	0.9995279101908876

Further, we previously detected the promoter of CDC25a (GenBank accession no. AJ242714.1) contained three Y-box sequences (Figure 4A) that might bind by YBX1. 	So we hypothesized that if YBX1 could bind to CDC25a promoter and up-regulate CDC25a expression to promote tumor cell overcoming cell cycle checkpoint restriction to satisfy unlimited malignant amplification. Here we showed that the expression of CDC25a had close relationship with the expression of YBX1 in cancer tissues samples on the basis of novel adenocarcinoma subtypes classification by immunohistochemical staining for the first time. 	0.5935448252316157	7.708635071465548e-10	0.40645517399752074

PMC4928311	AB245021	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	Some of this variation in the qPCR outcome could relate to genetic variation in the target sequence of the forward primer, which may provide suboptimal conditions for the qPCR. 	Indeed, a BLAST® search on the targeted ITS2 sequence (GenBank accession no: AB245021.2, query range 1,036–1,126 bp) revealed a genetic variability of 1–2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the forward primer region among 31 % of the available O. ostertagi ITS2 sequences (Additional file 2).

PMC6193605	KU761334	Introduction	ENA	False	Background	At 5 days postinfection (dpi), the serum concentrations of 14 out of 26 cytokines tested (interleukin-10 [IL-10], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], IL-3, IL-1a, Ccl5, Ccl7, IL-13, IL-4, IL-23, IL-2, IL12p70, interferon gamma [IFN-γ], IL-6, and Ccl3) were reduced in mice infected with a T. gondii RHΔMAF1 mutant compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain (RH:WT) (12), although there were no significant MAF1-dependent differences in mouse morbidity. 	However, it has also been shown that expression of an HMA+ copy of MAF1 (specifically TgMAF1RHb1 [13; GenBank accession no. KU761334], here referred to as MAF1b) in parasites that do not normally exhibit HMA provided a competitive advantage in a mixed population of HMA+ and HMA− parasites during the acute phase of infection (13), suggesting that in the type II genetic, background, MAF1b expression (and therefore HMA itself) can influence infection outcome in vivo. 	Here we aimed to assess the impact of MAF1b complementation in naturally HMA− parasites on the progression and maintenance of chronic infections in mice and the cytokine responses that occur during the progression of disease over a 4-week period of infection. Recently published in vivo dual-transcriptional profiling of T. gondii and host (in this case, mouse) RNA, which is available at ToxoDB.org, suggests that MAF1 expression remains high (>80th percentile) during chronic infection (14). 	0.9923991048816649	1.827911168837377e-10	0.007600894935544117

We classified TAARs as putatively functional if the contig had high sequence similarity to a known TAAR and contained an open reading frame of appropriate length (approximately 1 kb) in the correct reading frame and location identified through BLASTx. We termed a TAAR a putative pseudogene if there was high sequence similarity to a known TAAR but there was no obvious open reading frame or if there was a disruption in the coding sequence that was predicted to produce a truncated or abnormal product. 	1.383477840657145e-10	2.115233033800941e-10	0.999999999650129

In particular, the assembly for chromosome XII was interrupted in the RDN1 locus—a repetitive region consisting of gene encoding ribosomal RNA estimated to be more than 1 Mbp long (Venema and Tollervey 1999). 	1.5854880373676701e-06	0.017125780978838254	0.9828726335331243

Thirty-seven lncRNAs were differentially expressed in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (Table 3).

PMC6184486	GSE12715	Results	GEO	False	Use	To check whether ethylene perception and signaling are involved in sensing NO, we tested the sensitivity to NO in hypocotyl shortening assays with the ethylene-insensitive etr1-3 and ein2-5 mutants (Roman et al., 1995). Figure 3A shows that etr1-3 and ein2-5 seedlings were fully insensitive to NO in inhibiting hypocotyl elongation, thus suggesting that ethylene perception and signaling were essential for NO sensing. 	The comparison of the NO-responsive transcriptome with the differential transcriptomes previously reported for the ein2-1 and etr1-1 mutants (Cheng et al., 2009; GEO Accession GSE12715) points to a significant overlap (Fig. 3B). 	There were 57 genes that were common for the three transcriptomes and an additional 73 and 129 genes in the intersections of the NO-responsive genes and ein2-1, and the NO-responsive genes and etr1-1, respectively (Fig. 3B), thus supporting a potential relevant involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing. We can rule out that the involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing was due to transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes by NO, as only slight increases below 1.6-fold in the corresponding transcripts were detected in NO-treated plants (Supplementary Fig. 	8.06729766820145e-06	1.4684312636196588e-05	0.9999772483896957

In the three-index sample library, the sample with the ACACAT index (NA10859) had approximately one-third less reads than the other two indexed samples in that library. 	However, in the nine-index sample library, where the read counts for all nine individual samples were within a tight range of each other, the same ACACAT index did not under perform compared with the other indexes. Differences in sample read counts are more likely due to pipetting or quantitation error when the sequencing libraries are initially combined prior to the enrichment process. 	7.283203835129482e-07	0.0008050211509787733	0.9991942505286378

Each caller was run on the high-quality Hi-C data generated for chromosome 6 of the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 (Fig. 1a). 	This model was chosen as it is one of the cell lines where Hi-C data have been generated at the highest resolution [2], and chromosome 6 had the average chromosome length and number of reads per kb. Results were often heterogeneous among callers and conditions, prompting caution when drawing conclusions from specific TAD partitions, but also highlighted consistent good performance for some callers. 	4.1022783586152387e-10	3.946955596332736e-07	0.9999996048942126

To specifically assess the performance of all callers when different numbers of reads are available, independent of the bin size of the matrix, we systematically subsampled Hi-C contacts determined for the GM12878 cell line (chromosome 6) and compared the TADs called with subsampled reads with those obtained from the complete contact matrix. 	For this test, we used ICE-normalized data binned in 50-kb intervals and generated 13 different matrices using different percentages of reads that ranged from 100 to 0.01%, corresponding to an estimated cost ranging from over $1000 to less than a dollar (Fig. 3 top panel). Some of the tested callers failed to return a TAD partition for low sequencing depth, in particular arrowhead and HiTAD did not identify TADs with less than 1% of the reads (Additional file 2: Figure S3). 	8.691836041967509e-11	2.7342391162833857e-05	0.9999726575219188

These activating hotspot mutations are identified in affected tissues, but not in the peripheral blood of ECCL patients, and are likely the result of post-zygotic constitutional mosaicism promoting locally constitutive activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway [1]. The same FGFR1 mutations occur in subgroups of sporadic low-grade gliomas (LGG) [7, 10, 12] indicating probable intersection between ECCL and tumorigenesis, possibility further substantiated by reports of brain tumors in nine ECCL cases with wide-ranging histopathological subtypes [1–3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13]. 	0.6258160608818332	5.630006785387317e-09	0.37418393348816

PMC5013595	1fg9	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	Interferon-γ receptor 2 is a cell-surface receptor that represents a crucial molecule in the interferon-γ (IFNγ) signalization pathway, influencing innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens and tumours (Schoenborn & Wilson, 2007 ▸; Lin & Young, 2013 ▸). 	The signalling cascade is initiated by the binding of IFNγ to its high-affinity cell surface receptor 1, forming a binary complex with a structure that has already been determined [PDB entries 1fg9 (Thiel et al., 2000 ▸) and 1fyh (Landar et al., 2000 ▸)]. 	However, to activate this binary complex and activate the JAK/STAT signalization pathway (Jung et al., 1987 ▸; Cook et al., 1994 ▸; Hemmi et al., 1994 ▸), IFNγ receptor 2 must participate in a ternary complex created by a homodimer of IFNγ, two molecules of receptor 1 and molecule(s) of receptor 2. To date, detailed structural and biophysical characterization of IFNγ receptor 2, the key molecule for proper IFNγ signalization, is lacking. 	0.9997488175292537	1.5210522858756235e-11	0.0002511824555358786

Several structural and sequential features of receptors of interferon-α and interferon-β (PDB entry 3se4; Thomas et al., 2011 ▸), here labelled IFNαR1 and IFNαR2, distinguishes them from the other analyzed receptors. 	Specifically, IFNαR1 is composed of four instead of two domains; here, we analyzed D1 and D2. The D3–D4 pair cannot be analyzed as D4 is not resolved in the electron density. 	0.012528317437721856	4.686740021811485e-09	0.9874716778755381

PMC4634563	4WSB	Results	PDBe	False	Use	Prompted by the lack of a tertiary structure of the EBOV polymerase to an atomic resolution level, we have developed a three-dimensional model of the RdRp domain of the EBOV L protein by using the PHYRE 2.0 web server and, with the addition of a Mononegavirales L protein secondary structure-based multiple sequence alignment, identify conserved residues within the enzyme that might help in the design of specific drugs that could counteract the EBOV epidemic. 	The best match yielded by the PHYRE 2.0 server to our EBOV polymerase sequence corresponds to the bat influenza A virus (PDB code 4WSB, chain B) [17]. 	Only 253 residues of the EBOV polymerase could be aligned with confidence levels of 91.7%, and the identity between the fragments of the two proteins is of 12% (S1 Fig). Although the ss(-)RNA LaCrosse virus polymerase is now available [15], its use as a template in the alignment and model prediction were not encouraging. 	0.0018069422923724604	7.348291898020338e-10	0.9981930569727984

The image shows that the EBOV RdRp central crevice has enough space to hold a dsRNA, and the interactions between the RNA and the protein are analogous to those previously observed in RdRps (Fig 5). The primer might could be bound to residues located in the thumb subdomain and residues within palm domain’s motif E, while the template might be coordinated by residues located in the fingers subdomain. 	0.4716873438135457	9.881208655184182e-11	0.5283126560876422

It was reported that low‐fidelity DNA polymerases differ from high‐fidelity DNA polymerases mainly in the efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation, whereas the incorporation of incorrect nucleotides is comparable.22 Thus, we reasoned that enhanced error rates opposite m6A would probably derive from decreased dTMP incorporation rather than from increased misincorporation. 	0.00018527511206708181	2.5746492973202484e-07	0.9998144674230032

For the apo form of prolin/sodium symporter PutP, a helix-loop-helix model based on EPR data revealed a kink of TMD 8 very similar to the one seen in LeuT (Hilger et al. 2009), whereas the same TMD is straight in inward-open conformations of vSGLT, which belongs to the same protein family of sodium substrate symporters (SSS) as PutP. However, in Mhp1 and LeuT, which could be crystallized in outward-open and inward-open structures, only slight straightening is observed (vide infra). 	0.9705612192787272	5.462544396890605e-12	0.02943878071581039

Instead of facing the membrane hydrophobic core in NMR structure (PDB: 2L35) which is energetically unfavorable, both side chains of Asps in DAP12 oriented toward the interface of the trimer complex. 	To decrease electrostatic repulsion between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer, both chains of DAP12 dimer shifted away and moved slightly vertical to facilitate the formation of two salt bridges between both Asps and Lys. These two stable salt bridges were further proven from the distances between each DAP12 Asp and NKG2C Lys, which were equally as close to approximately 0.5 nm and lower than the distance between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer. 	0.0004895428574418146	2.1769608987011723e-09	0.9995104549655973

Specifically, the fusion of two TelSAM domains maintained the helical polymeric nature with fewer units for each repeat turn. Thus, instead of 60° degrees rotation per unit, 120° degrees rotation per unit was obtained, and the 65 screw symmetry was transformed into 32 screw symmetry. 	0.9380916038985743	8.510782443856426e-11	0.06190839601631784

To determine whether the Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS localize between two segregated nucleoids in E. coli, we stained the nucleoids of E. coli WM2767 cells with DAPI (Fig. 2D): sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS formed multiple Z ring-like structures randomly at various positions over the nucleoids, suggesting that nucleoid occlusion did not function in the assembly of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in E. coli cells. 	However, these results indicate that if only anchored to the membrane, AtFtsZ2 per se can form Z ring-like structures in E. coli cells.Figure 2Membrane-tethered FtsZ2 forms multiple Z ring-like structures.

Given that the bacterial cell-division machinery correctly localizes at the inter-chromosomal space, the Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS detected over the bacterial chromosome might not be incorporated into the cell-division machinery of E. coli. 	Collectively, our results indicate that membrane-targeted AtFtsZ2 can assemble into Z ring-like structures as a filament backbone in the absence of EcFtsZ and other chloroplast division-related proteins in our bacterial expression system. The partly slanted AtFtsZ2 rings might be due to the lack of connection to the peptidoglycan machinery45. 	0.07322577994698357	2.198229652898254e-06	0.9267720218233635

Because the constricting ring of MTS-tagged AtFtsZ2 expressed in spherical P. pastoris cells has been proposed to slide along the membrane from the middle region to one end of the cell19, we suggest that the cell-wall integrity of E. coli restricts the constriction of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in our bacterial system. 	Notably, whereas long filaments of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 were observed only when endogenous EcFtsZ was present (Figs 1A and 2B), multiple Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS were formed even in the EcFtsZ-depleted strain (Fig. 2B), which suggests that EcFtsZ exerts a supportive effect particularly on AtFtsZ2 filamentation ability. The long filaments detected in wild-type cells are possibly generated by bundling of EcFtsZ and AtFtsZ2 homopolymers because EcFtsZ cannot heteropolymerize with AtFtsZ219. 	0.0016690388751836483	4.887973429091931e-09	0.9983309562368429

Consistently, nonbacterial ARC3 expression potently lowered the filament length of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 and reduced the number of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in bacterial cells (Fig. 3). 	Here, the AtFtsZ2 Z ring-like structures were forcibly tethered to the membrane by the MTS, and ARC3 strongly inhibited AtFtsZ2 filamentation, and thus the number of Z ring-like structures formed might have been reduced due to the inhibition of AtFtsZ2 filament assembly by ARC3. Notably, the cells expressing both AtFtsZ2-2MTS and ARC3 were much shorter than those expressing only AtFstZ2-2MTS were. 	0.0023848375818394216	4.6763044504844704e-07	0.9976146947877155
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	In our bacterial system, ARC6 colocalized with AtFtsZ2 and drastically altered its filament morphology, from linear filaments to Z ring-like structures (Fig. 4, see Supplementary Fig. S6B). 	This Z ring-like structure formation and the membrane attachment of AtFtsZ2 strongly depended on the C-terminal ARC6-interacting sequence of AtFtsZ2, which indicates that ARC6-tethered AtFtsZ2 behaves like AtFtsZ2-2MTS, an artificial membrane-targeting protein, and assembles into multiple Z ring-like structures. 	Conversely, the Z ring-like structures formed by AtFtsZ2 and ARC6 in bacterial cells reflect the natural condition of the chloroplast Z ring, which concurrently demonstrates that ARC6 functions as a genuine membrane-anchoring partner of AtFtsZ2. Recently, ARC6 was reported to be capable of stabilizing AtFtsZ2 polymers in yeast cells independently of its Z ring-tethering function25; the stromal region of ARC6 was observed to lower the turnover rate of AtFtsZ2 polymers. 	0.00210316168456472	2.8289085196985906e-09	0.9978968354865269

However, the tight interaction of NbGAK_1 with the upper lobe induces structural changes that distort slightly the catalytic spine alignment and the upper lobe itself, which also affects the conserved salt bridge between Lys69 and αC Glu85 increasing the optimal distance of 3 Å seen in the GAK–NbGAK_4 structure to a distance of 4 Å (Supplementary Figure S5A at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/459/bj4590059add.htm).

The discrepancy could be due to the factors that they used the crystal structure of NDM-1 (PDB 3Q6X, Zhang and Hao, 2011) as target without the bridged hydroxide ion and employed empirical docking and scoring function (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998) only to estimate the binding affinities of the compounds. 	From our QM calculations, MOs of the QM region shows that the HOMO with the bridged OH− between zinc ions has electron cloud delocalized over the Zn-OH-Zn cluster, while the LUMOs are similar with electron cloud concentrated at Zn2, independent of the hydroxide ion. As a result, the inhibitors of antibiotics resistance against the NDM-1 will be of conjugate nature, by binding over the Zn-OH-Zn, such as Curcumin, Catechin, and Feruclic acid (Figure 3). 	0.0221479879033838	6.888703589008005e-10	0.9778520114077458

The inter-domain torsion angle is approximately 120°, similar to those of IFNγR1 (Thiel et al., 2000 ▸; Walter et al., 1995 ▸) and human tissue factor (Harlos et al., 1994 ▸); the D1–D2 torsion angle is defined in Supplementary Table S3. The D1 domain is composed of three β-strands stacked on a layer of four β-strands, and the D2 domain is created by four β-strands arranged against four other β-strands; both domains are connected by a short linker (residues 134–143 in IFNγR2) comprising a short helix that is also found in IFNγR1, human tissue factor and other receptors. 	0.0033133713089012603	1.3581954360544381e-06	0.9966852704956628

Another cDNA in Genbank (NM_173654.1; [21]) lacks an internal segment that contains the DYD motif, and is therefore predicted to have low or no activity. In vivo, the human EOGT cDNA fully rescued homozygotes of a new P-element excision mutation of eogt (eogtex10). 	Both eogt RNAi knock-down and mutant clones exhibited blistered wing and vortex phenotypes, similar to the vortex class of dp mutants (dpv). The hallmark of the removal of eogt in the posterior wing in en>eogtIR flies was the temperature-dependent development of blisters, with essentially 100% frequency at 27°C (Table 1 and Fig. 5; [11]). 	0.002197602572247636	3.4617663158128196e-11	0.9978023973931348

Our previous study verified six miRNAs as potential biomarkers for pulmonary TB, including hsa-miR-3786, of which the mature sequence hsa-miR-378a-3p was among the 368 miRNAs that associated with NR_038221, indicating that NR_038221 and hsa-miR-378a-3p might play a similar function during the pathological process of pulmonary TB. 	In summary, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs in plasma of TB patients that may influence the activation of T cells. These lncRNAs could affect signal transduction between cells, thus influencing the pathological process of TB. 	0.01841839454644573	4.884562322948036e-09	0.981581600568992
PMC5314723	NM_000520.4	Abstract	RefSeq	False	Use	This study assesses the reliability of EA in comparison with HEXA sequence analysis in non-AJ populations. Methods: Five hundred eight Hispanic and African American patients (516 samples) had EA of their leukocytes performed and 12 of these patients who tested positive by EA (“carriers”) had subsequent HEXA gene sequencing performed. Results: Of the 508 patients, 25 (4.9%) were EA positive and 40 (7.9%) were inconclusive. 	Of the 12 patients who were sequenced, 11 did not carry a pathogenic variant and one carried a likely deleterious mutation (NM_000520.4(HEXA):c.1510C>T). Conclusions: High inconclusive rates and poor correlation between positive/inconclusive enzyme results and identification of pathogenic mutations suggest that ethnic-specific recalibration of reference ranges for EA may be necessary. 	Alternatively, HEXA gene sequencing could be performed. 	2.6106905194895763e-07	2.052890553515963e-07	0.9999995336418926

The indicated nucleotide position -276 to -13bp is related to the 5´end of annotated Mtss1 mRNA sequence with the accession number (NM_014751.5) [21]. 	Our data demonstrate that MTSS1 promoter activity was significantly higher in human t(8;21) positive AML cells (Kasumi-1) when compared to various AML1-ETO negative cell lines (Fig 4D). This suggests that the AML1-ETO fusion molecule is a positive regulator of MTSS1. 	0.00897032212722603	0.00021618033277627196	0.9908134975399978

Nonetheless, Vero cells were isolated from an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp.), and the sequence of the Chlorocebus genome contains the HER2 homologue (Chlorocebus sabaeus; RefSeq accession number XM_008012845.1) with 98% identity with the human HER2. 	We conclude from these results that the four insertion sites tested were all suitable for insertion in that the generated recombinants were viable, implying that gB carried out the fusogenic function. More importantly, the inserted GCN4 peptide mediated infection through the GCN4R, i.e., it was suitably located in gB not only to prevent any detrimental effect on gB function but also to contribute to its entry function, i.e., to the GCN4R-dependent infection and consequent gB activation. 	9.789384242699784e-06	3.4108736549658335e-07	0.9999898695283918

PMC5681741	rs9923304	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Matrix metalloproteinase 2, also known as gelatinase A, is a membrane-bound protein that is important for extracellular matrix turnover, preferentially cleaving collagen types IV, V, VII, and XI and gelatin (29). 	The MMP2 variant rs9923304 was found to be associated with formation of a periapical lesion when there is deep carious lesions in dentin (16). 	The underlying mechanism for this finding is possibly the same that explains the association of this genetic variant in MMP2 and failures of direct resin composite restorations of the present study. MMP2 gelatinolytic activity probably occurs both in partially demineralized dentin at the bottom of caries lesions and at the surface treated with either etch-and-rinse or self-etch adhesives. 	0.8376415511721446	4.293391075874626e-10	0.16235844839851635

Our data showed that melanoma patients carrying the variant allele for the rs4986790 polymorphism in the TLR4 gene were associated with a prolonged OS. 	The increase in survival was confined to the period after the detection of a first metastasis, which implied that the effect of the polymorphism might possibly modulated dependent on therapy or alternatively by biological processes associated with melanoma cell migration and/or invasion. The patients in stage IV melanoma in most instances received a chemotherapy containing DTIC/temozolomide and interferons, which is known for long time not having any clinical effect on overall survival of the entire metastatic melanoma population [14], [15]. 	4.261007624951509e-05	1.701904807519309e-08	0.9999573729047025

PMC5650161	rs1800088	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Use	In addition, recombinant expression and site-directed mutagenesis investigations have shown significant impact on receptor function leading to altered response to β2 agonists [33]. 	Interestingly, major evidence associating ADRB2 variants with functioning of the receptor comes from C→T base exchange (rs1800088) at the 491 position in ADRB2 gene that substitutes Threonine to Isoleucine at 164th position in the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). 	The consequence of variation is observed as diminished ligand-receptor interactions followed by depressed coupling of β2AR to adenylcyclases wherein dose-response binding curve shifts to right indicating the low affinity of the agonists to the T164I variant [34]. In addition, pioneering studies by Strader et al in 1989 suggested that Threonine to Isoleucine substitution in β2AR significantly decreases spontaneous toggling to the activated state and reduces agonist stabilized activation resulting in declined capacity of the receptor to interact with β2 agonists [35]. 	0.04436504039820164	5.493668512022414e-07	0.9556344102349471

SIFT—a vector based method calculates tolerance index (score ranging from 0 to 1) for a particular residue substitution based on structural and functional parameters using multiple sequence alignments against homologous amino acid sequences. PolyPhen 2 is also a vector based method that calculates the pathogenic potential of nsSNPS that considers comparison of sequences, 3D protein structures and residue contacts, returning results as PSIC score (higher PSIC score reflects higher the functional effect on protein and vice versa). 	0.0017380046063051986	3.708105445790382e-13	0.9982619953933239

We have selected 3 common functional SNPs (rs3745274, rs2279343, and rs3211371) found in CYP2B6 exons 4, 5, and 9, respectively. 	They were carefully selected based on evidence that they are common in Caucasians [10], they cause changes in CYP2B6 coding that would affect CYP2B6 enzyme expression or activity and are associated with a change in CPA activation and metabolism [24,26]. Our hypothesis is that the pharmacological activity of CPA could be altered by the functionality of CYP2B6 which might be reflected on the treatment response. 	0.0035263353936744223	2.106454079152029e-06	0.9964715581522464

In contrast to several studies which associated variants including CYP2B6rs2279343 with lower CPA hydroxylation or with poor response [17,29]. 	Raccor et al. found that CYP2B6rs2279343 genotype caused 50% reduction in 4-OH-CPA formation yet the sample size was too small to draw a reliable conclusion.

Thus, carriers of at least one mutant allele CYP2B6rs2279343 have a higher success rate for RMS therapy with CPA. 	In summary, our results provide a picture of the role of CYP2B6 polymorphisms in RMS. Our data suggests that pretreatment evaluation of CYP2B6rs2279343 may explain some inter-individual differences in treatment response. 	0.03249232680738	0.0017159572885176305	0.9657917159041024

PMC5179106	rs75932628	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Background	Most AD patients have sporadic late-onset disease, and are free from rare mutations in known causal AD genes (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) [3]. 	Sporadic AD is associated with multiple genetic variations of small effect (e.g., most GWAS loci) or moderate effect (e.g., APOE-ε4 [17] and TREM2 rs75932628 T-allele [18, 19]), and could be influenced by other risk factors (e.g., head trauma [20], diabetes [21] and aging [22]). 	The complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors lead to alterations in proteins, metabolites and epigenetic modifications in the brain tissue and/or body fluids of AD patients. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning. 	0.9999959300146856	2.7252888349032833e-13	4.069985041966284e-06

Among these polymorphisms, the most commonly studied is the MspI polymorphism (2A, m1, T3801C, or rs4646903), which is located in the 3′’ noncoding region of the CYP1A1 gene. 	Another commonly studied polymorphism is Ile462Val (2C, m2, or rs1048943), which gives rise to an amino acid transition in exon 7. The underlying biochemical hypothesis explaining the effect of the 2 variants is that both of them may influence mRNA expression or mRNA stability of the gene, resulting in a highly inducible activity of the enzyme.[8,9] 	0.43597825559706105	1.6963581771226068e-07	0.5640215747671213

The common occurrence of ε1369delG and εR311Q, and their strict association with the respective CHRNE SNP haplotypes (rs1053754-rs8834-rs7774-rs9914357: T A T G and G A G C) strongly suggests a founder for each of these mutations originating in North Western Europe, possibly in Holland. 	Most CMS with severe endplate AChR deficiency result from recessive mutations in AChR ε-subunit gene, or the gene encoding rapsyn. The mutations in the ε-subunit are found along the length of the gene, and result in frameshifts or nonsense codons that truncate the subunit polypeptide chain, or loss of residues essential for AChR assembly or function. 	0.9872376673384261	5.085694434671074e-07	0.01276182409213048

Four SNPs of the GHRL gene (rs26311, rs27647, rs696217, and rs34911341) have been extensively studied [22, 23]. 	GHRL SNPs rs26311 and rs27647 are the two common coding SNPs in the promoter region. The GHRL rs696217 polymorphism is characterized by a G to T substitution resulting in a leucine (Leu) to methionine (Met) exchange at position 72 in exon 2 of the coding region of the preproghrelin gene, whereas the rs34911341 polymorphism is characterized by a C to T transition causing an arginine (Arg) to glutamine (Gln) exchange at position 51 in exon 2. 	0.9995625334119632	0.0004352873052437323	2.1792827931580786e-06

This study found that only DNAJC10 gene variant rs13414223 was related to decreased PD risk. 	The DNAJC10 gene (MIM 607987), which is mapped to chromosome 2q32.1, contains 24 exons and spans ~64 kb, is a paralog of two known PD-related genes, DNAJC6 and DNAJC13232527.

Host genetic factors can alter the risk of acquiring C. difficile: a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin-8 gene increases susceptibility to C. difficile colitis3, and we have previously shown that a non-synonymous SNP, rs1137101, on the extra cellular domain of leptin receptor (LEPR) increases the risk of C. difficile diagnosis4. 	We found that individuals homozygous for the derived allele G, which encodes for Arginine (R) at position 223 (RR genotype) were at a higher risk of being diagnosed with CDI (odds ratio 3.03), as compared to individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the ancestral allele A, which encodes for Glutamine (Q, QQ or QR genotype) at the same position4. Q223R is a common SNP in humans with a mean allelic frequency of ∼50% in European-Americans and 40-60% in African-Americans (http://hgdp.uchicago.edu). 	0.49486354827486556	3.4196704195932225e-10	0.5051364513831673

We further substantiate this through functional studies showing that the MS risk allele directs expression of a novel, soluble form of TNFR1 that can block TNF. Importantly, TNF blocking drugs can promote onset or exacerbation of MS9-11, but they have proven highly efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is no association with rs1800693. 	7.783084631033161e-09	1.112832470750234e-06	0.9999988793844446

In the present study, we performed an extensive screening of the HLA class I and II genes to investigate possible associations of HLA alleles in the total, the EBV+, and the EBV− cHL (sub)populations. Furthermore, we intended to establish whether specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions in the HLA genes that might be shared by multiple HLA alleles are responsible for the observed genetic associations rather than specific HLA alleles. 	0.9999648156885425	4.456800381368345e-14	3.51843114130688e-05

PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	Use	We found that this effect was due to decreased expression of non-risk C allele (P =.02 in CC group and P =.06 in CT group), whereas PSCA expression of risk T allele was not associated with tumor staging (P =.63) (Figure 2, C). 	Together with allelic expression imbalance data in mRNA samples, these results reiterate functional changes on PSCA mRNA and protein expression reflected in both gain of T allele and loss of C allele of rs2294008 in bladder tumors compared with normal tissue and during progression through tumor stages. 	The PSCA function and the mechanism of the anti-PSCA antibody remain unclear.

PMC3536639	rs2294008	Article	RefSNP	False	Use	Although there are several reports on genetic association of rs2294008 with bladder, gastric, duodenal, and breast cancers (2,3,14,21,33–40), little data is available for relationships between rs2294008 and PSCA expression in different tissue types (21,39). 	Our study is a unique and detailed investigation of the allele-specific effects of rs2294008 on PSCA mRNA and protein expression in bladder tissue. 	Up to 75% of bladder cancer patients of European descent are estimated to carry the risk rs2294008 CT and TT genotypes. Possibly, if used at early cancer stages (Ta and T1), anti-PSCA immunotherapy might prevent progression to advanced muscle-invasive cancer, a devastating disease that is treated by radical bladder cystectomy together with removal of parts of surrounding organs and lymph nodes to prevent metastasis. 	6.427386365256182e-05	6.297414498244528e-07	0.9999350963948975

For instance, patients with the HOTTIP rs5883064 C allele or rs1859168 A allele have an increased risk of lung cancer [22]. 	In addition, the rs1859168 A>C polymorphism may regulate HOTTIP expression and reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population [23].

To determine whether this contradiction reflects causal processes, Winsløw et al.1 have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) in testing the association of a genetic variant, rs1051730 in CHRNA3, with measures of body weight among 80 342 members of the Copenhagen General Population Study. 	Among smokers, each minor (T) allele carried was associated with an increase of about one cigarette per day, but with a decrease in several measures of body weight, in contrast to the observational results. These results, in line with other recent studies,2–6 suggest that increased tobacco consumption causes reduced body weight, as does smoking itself. 	0.5613505017099294	6.584363875514619e-05	0.4385836546513153
PMC5841830	rs1051730	Article	RefSNP	False	Use	The question is whether smoking status should be considered as derived from the quantity consumed (one who smokes zero cigarettes per day is a non-smoker, others are smokers, Figure 1 arrow a), or as an exogenous variable whose value constrains the possible consumption (non-smokers must smoke no cigarettes per day, smokers must smoke a positive number, Figure 1 arrow b). 	Under the former, stratifying on smoking status would entail a collider bias, and an association would be seen between genotype and smoking status; but such an association was not observed by Winsløw et al., nor was any association between rs1051730 and known confounders when stratifying on smoking status. 	Thus the data support the view that smoking status is distinct (i.e. has distinct determinants) from tobacco consumption (Figure 1 arrow b). Indeed it seems reasonable that individuals would generally decide whether or not to smoke as a precursor to developing their usual consumption. 	4.442829333298391e-05	7.131165812981738e-07	0.9999548585900858

Previously, a SNP (rs3184504) in the SH2B3 gene was found associated with multiple sclerosis [48]. 	ATXN2 has similar features with SH2B3 since it contains proline-rich regions that interact with Src Homology 3 domains, it associates with receptor tyrosine kinases and modulates the signaling control of growth [23], [27].

PMC4871369	rs1462845	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Use	We have observed that variation in one CAD candidate gene—LSAMP—displays differential effects on survival two CAD case-control studies. 	Further, different SNPs within this same gene exert distinct effects on survivorship in established CAD populations; there may be allelic heterogeneity among two LSAMP SNPs: one variant conferred increased (rs1462845) while the other decreased risk for death (rs6788787) in the presence of CAD-diagnosed males with severe burden of coronary disease. 	If not confounded by survival bias, survival-variant genes may lead to improved understanding of the genetic contributions to survivorship in CAD. Identification of risk-factor mediated genetic effects—such as demonstrated here with sex- and disease-severity—may help to explain differential outcomes in patient subsets and may lead to more informed clinical decision-making for CAD patients in the future. 	6.543331712639812e-05	4.477611874947002e-07	0.999934118921686

The most studied polymorphisms of the CRP gene in association with CAD are the 1059G>C (rs1800947), 1444C>T (rs1130864), 717A>G (rs2794521) and 3872G>A (rs1205) variants [19,20]. 	It has been observed that these four principal variants increase or decrease the CRP serum levels and are rapidly up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CRP levels are a sensitive indicator of inflammation and a marker of CAD [21,22]. 	0.999999836709929	3.23890607044025e-13	1.632897470113359e-07
PMC4730494	rs1800629	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Background	Genetic variants in the TNF-α promoter region are reported to be associated with the TNF-α serum levels, these levels are correlated with the first-time cardiovascular disease and are also a marker for recurrent coronary events after a previous myocardial infarction [25,26]. 	Numerous polymorphisms of the TNF-α gene have been reported, including 308G>A (rs1800629), 238G>A (rs3615525), 857C>T (rs1799724), 863C>A (rs1800630) and 1031T>C (rs1799964) [27,28]. 	The polymorphisms 308G>A (rs1800629) and 238G>A (rs3615525) are the most studied variants of TNF-α, because several studies have found that patients with the A allele show high levels of TNF-α in serum, modifying the risk of developing CAD [29,30]. However, the association found between CAD and these genes must be validated using larger and independent sample populations, using case-case control studies, in order to prevent spurious associations [31,32] and better understand the incidence of cardiovascular events, a case-control study is contemplated. 	0.9999998747563524	5.5096126071533916e-11	1.2518855142298373e-07

In a sample from the PREDIMED trial they observed that a variant (rs3812316) in the MLXIPL gene encoding the carbohydrate response element binding protein and associated with lower serum TG, had cumulative beneficial effects when combined with high adherence to the MED diet [156]. 	Additionally, a dietary pattern was shown to influence the development of CVD also by inducing changes in the individual transcriptomic response of genes involved in cardiovascular risk. In a small subset of subjects from the PREDIMED trial, Castañer and colleagues performed an analysis of multiple genes’ expression profile and observed that MED diet either supplemented with olive oil or mixed nuts induced a variation in the transcriptomic response modulating 12 of the 18 signaling pathways analyzed [157]. 	0.002015905788670908	1.2958430239942315e-10	0.9979840940817448

In addition, the age estimate of the E90 allele (0.24±0.07 MY) suggests a relatively recent arising of the SERPINB11 gene, near the time of origin of moderns humans and long after the appearance of P303, rs953696, and rs953694 alleles (0.88±0.44 MY). 	Nonetheless, when the TMRCA of the full-length SERPINB11 variant was calculated using the decay of haplotype sharing (DHS), a statistical method that exploits the breaking of haplotypes by recombination in succeeding generations, the estimated time of origin was 16,500 years ago, with a minimum estimate of 8,500 years. 	5.806445796130469e-05	2.0070190125111426e-12	0.9999419355400317

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium study of patients with Crohn's disease detected a significant association with the X90E polymorphism (rs4940595; p-value 0.00063), as well as a 3% reduction in the frequency of the E90 variant [54]. 	Crohn's disease is a multifactorial inflammatory disease instigated and perpetuated by bacterial infections; it affects mainly ileum and cecum but may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract [55], [56]. Note that SERPINB11 expression has been detected in the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tract (lung, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, and mouth) and several other organs connected to innate immune functions (tonsil and placenta), which differs greatly from the ubiquitous expression of mouse Serpinb11 [15]. 	0.9231232608080671	1.6159376662393528e-10	0.07687673903033916

It is noteworthy that NDUFA6 has three reported functional isoforms in UniProt: the first (UniProt: P56556) represents the longest isoform with 154 residues (GenBank: NM_002490.4; Ensembl: ENST00000498737.6), the second (UniProt: A0A0C4DGSO) has 128 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000602404.5), and the third (UniProt: R4GN43) has 71 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000470753.1). 	All isoforms occur in frame and use alternative methionine residues for translation initiation (Figure 2C). Until now, no consensus on the clinically relevant transcripts has been reached, but Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and in-house RNA-seq data19 support ENST00000602404.5 as the predominant isoform, and RNA expression data specifically correlate with the 5′ UTR of ENST00000602404.5 (Figure S2). 	0.0028158524565147624	4.5900058104692145e-07	0.9971836885429043

The existence of the longer NDUFA6 isoform (UniProt: P56556) could explain the normal complex I activity reported for subject 3, whose variant would instead act as a homozygous missense variant in the encoding transcript (c.81G>A [p.Met27Ile]). In silico predictions suggest that the c.81G>A (p.Met27Ile) variant might be tolerated (Align-GVGD = C0, Grantham distance = 10.12, SIFT = 0.070 [tolerated], PolyPhen = 0.702 [possibly damaging], CADD = 34). 	The CADD score discordance is most likely due to the consideration of alternative transcripts in the prediction and is therefore exacerbated by the pathogenicity associated with the initiation methionine in the alternative transcript. Attempts to assess whether an alternative methionine was selected for translation initiation in vivo have been unsuccessful; analysis of tryptic fragments of subject proteins produced during complexome profiling was uninformative, and commercially available antibodies have failed to conjugate successfully with the target protein in subject and control tissues (data not shown). 	0.2906845654883692	1.4275677349837206e-11	0.7093154344973552

PMC5963842	P63162	Introduction	UniProt	False	Background	Of particular interest in the context of SMA pathology is SNRPN (this protein is also known as SmN, denoted with a lowercase ‘m’), which is expressed in neural tissues (Schmauss et al., 1992) and can replace SNRPB in the heptameric Sm protein ring (Huntriss et al., 1993). 	The human SNRPN protein differs from SNRPB′ by 17 amino acids (UniProt identifiers P63162 and P14678, respectively), and little is known about its behaviour other than its incorporation into snRNPs, although the SNRPN gene locus is within the paternally imprinted region of the genome critical in Prader–Willi syndrome (Özçelik et al., 1992). 	There is growing appreciation that some Sm proteins may ‘moonlight’ in functions beyond their presence in splicing snRNPs. In addition to the role of SNRPB in cytoplasmic trafficking vesicles in human cells, in Drosophila the homologues of SNRPB and SNRPD3 are implicated in mRNA localisation (Gonsalvez et al., 2010) and SNRPD1 has a role in micro (mi)RNA biogenesis (Xiong et al., 2015). 	0.9762642925922563	9.138734257152509e-11	0.023735707316356564

Several proteins were identified in the SNRPN interactome but not the SNRPB interactome, such as nuclear receptor co-activator 6 interacting protein (UniProt Q96RS0), and 7SK snRNA methylphosphate capping enzyme (UniProt Q7L2J0), both of which are associated with snRNA capping (Hausmann et al., 2008; Jeronimo et al., 2007).

Besides, we also found that a series of proteins (A0A096RTN1, A0A096T686, A0A0B4J3G7, B4FA32, B4FR89, B6SIF0, B6SQM0, C0HGH7, K7VC35, K7VH58, and P33679) involved with the defence categories were down-accumulated with S2 treatment. 	Similar results have been reported in rice that received a stress [60]. Moreover, a series of proteins that play roles in plant defences were identified in S4 treatment. 	5.125477163617076e-06	7.593580974566188e-10	0.9999948737634782
PMC6310946	A8IK79	Discussion	UniProt	False	Use	Asr proteins function in response to abiotic stresses in plants [67–71]. 	Therefore, the down-regulation of Asr protein (A8IK79) in ear leaves with S4 treatment indicated that removing four leaves weakened the tolerance of maize to abiotic stress. 	Zeamatin was first identified in corn seeds with high amino acid homology to PR-5 proteins. Besides, it has potent antifungal activity against a number of plant pathogens [72]. 	0.0008438291435965266	7.46949431766367e-08	0.9991560961614603
PMC6092840	F6YV64	Results	UniProt	False	Use	Based on RNA-seq data, a missense variant ((SH3RF2:c.796 T > C:(p.Ser266Pro)) affecting a conserved residue was detected.. 	Equine SH3RF2 (UniProtKB - F6YV64) contains 4 domains: one RING-type domain and three SH3 (src Homology-3) domains that are responsible for protein-protein interactions in signal transduction pathways [23]. 	The p.Ser266Pro substitutionis localized in the gene region encoding the protein fragment between the second and third SH3 domain (253 to 382 amino acids). Genesilico Metasever [24] based protein comparisons showed that the SH3RF2:c.796 T > C variant possibly affect protein structure and function. 	0.36859464442242434	2.1516040557076292e-07	0.63140514041717
PMC3990513	P25929	Methods	UniProt	False	Use	nan	The sequence of the hY1 receptor (Swiss-Prot accession number: P25929) was aligned with a multiple sequence alignment of all the inactive-like GPCRs of known structure using the GPCR-ModSim (http://gpcr.usc.es) web-server [39]. 	The human C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (hCXCR4) was considered the best template for modeling of the hY1 receptor because it is a peptide binding GPCR with high homology to hY1 in the C-terminal part of extracellular loop 2. This loop segment (Cys5.25-Ser5.31 in hY1) constitutes part of the orthosteric binding cavity wall and is often involved in ligand binding. 	1.674111699561304e-06	1.9326601896421664e-07	0.9999981326222814

PMC6458243	P20432	Discussion	UniProt	False	Use	In order to improve the credibility of data sets, the integration of multi-omic approaches has been applied in many fields (Dittmer et al., 2012). 	Based on the differential expression of target proteins/genes, we found four common up-regulated proteins/genes, i.e., GST (P20432), larval serum protein (Q24388), FKBP12 (P48375), and FoxO (B4G4S8). 	FKBP12 (Figure 4A) inhibits the activity of the TOR protein (Somarelli and Herrera, 2007). TOR is an atypical serine/threonine kinase in the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and a major regulator of growth in eukaryotes (Zoncu et al., 2010). 	0.006466219092744306	9.680144166464696e-07	0.993532812892839
PMC6458243	Q9VFE4	Discussion	UniProt	False	Use	In Aedes albopictus, FoxO may be involved with increasing the transcript levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, as observed in early diapause females (Poelchau et al., 2011). 	In addition, we identified six common down-regulated proteins/genes comprising 40S ribosomal protein (Q9VFE4), JHAMT (Q9VJK8), YP1 (P06607), YP2 (P02843), YP3 (P02844), and NADH (Q9V4E0) (Supplementary Table S2). 	JHAMT (Figure 4C) is the ultimate enzyme in the JH biosynthetic pathway, and it is considered to be critical for regulating JH synthesis (Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003). JH regulates many physiological processes in insects, such as diapause (Denlinger and Tanaka, 1989). 	0.0007350173000434336	2.1841467245179218e-10	0.9992649824815418
