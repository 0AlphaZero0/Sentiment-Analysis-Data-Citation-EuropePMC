PMC5592930	KT722338	Results	ENA	False	Use	While natural and experimental hybridization has been documented between the bobwhite and the scaled quail (Johnsgard 1970; Shupe 1990), the extent of historic hybridization has not been estimated using nuclear, genome-wide variation. 	However, a recent mitochondrial population study for the bobwhite (n = 53), which also produced a complete scaled quail mitochondrial genome for comparison (GenBank accession KT722338), failed to detect any evidence of historic hybridization (bobwhite ♂ × scaled quail ♀), despite sampling from regions where both species naturally occur (Halley et al. 2015). 	A subset of the nuclear microsatellites presented here may prove useful to facilitate low-cost investigations of management concerns using larger sample sizes, including issues related to population structure, gene flow, and nuclear introgression between the scaled quail and bobwhite. Beyond microsatellite loci, we also predicted genome-wide autosomal sequence variation resulting from biparental inheritance of alternative alleles (heterozygosity) for the scaled quail (v1.0) and the bobwhite (v2.0). 	0.0009902977156197436	1.6938582823759563e-05	0.9989927637015565

PMC3499474	P17563	Results	UniProt	False	Use	The immunoblot procedure does not always define all the possible residues subjected to posttranslational modifications. 	As shown in Figure 6, the phosphoserine specific MAbs pSset recognized aldehyde dehydrogenase (P47738) and selenium-binding protein 1 (P17563), but with the MAbs 4G10, MPM-2 and pYset only one of these proteins were detected. 	These two proteins are phosphorylated at different sites as reported elsewhere. Thus, by use of several anti-phosphoprotein Abs with different specificity in the recognition of epitopes a more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteins can be achieved. 	1.079797654681578e-05	1.1041858907706746e-07	0.9999890916048642
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Another possible explanation is that the blue eye phenotype is not being selected for; rather the TG allele of BEH2 has another phenotype, such as lighter skin pigmentation, which is under selection. 	In East Asia, we show that the C allele of the missense SNP rs1800414 is also under selection (Fig. 10). 	Again this result is not completely unexpected since this allele has been associated with lighter skin pigmentation in East Asians, and variants affecting skin pigmentation have previously been shown to be targets of selection (Edwards et al. 2010; Izagirre et al. 2006; Lao et al. 2007; Norton et al. 2007). 	0.13143795028331529	9.435507965073439e-07	0.8685611061658882

PMC6166924	rs1801131	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	Our results showed a significant association between MTHFR SNP rs1801131 and SN, supporting the suggestion of a role of variation in this gene and ART toxicity. 	SNP rs1801131 or A1298C causes a glu429-to-ala (E429A) substitution which decreases MTHFR activity [43], which theoretically would cause increased thymidylate synthetase levels and decreased d4T toxicity. 	This is consistent with our finding of a protective effect of rs1801131 against SN. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyses the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides [44] and therefore plays a critical role in de novo DNA synthesis and cell proliferation The tetrameric enzyme is composed of large RNR1 and small RNR2 subunits encoded by the RRM1 or RRM2 genes. 	0.000722345258912509	7.078007087526801e-10	0.9992776540332867

The latter is suggested by a study in Northeastern Chinese Han people indicating that the association in the Han is regionally distinct and involve the interplay of several STK39 alleles (rs6749447, rs35929607 and rs3754777) [56]. 	While the influence of STK39 genetic variation on blood pressure is not clear, genetic variation in its phosphorylation target, NCC, is important. Over 100 mutations in the SCL21A3 gene, which encodes for NCC, have been documented in patients with Gitelman syndrome. 	0.40368089734004403	1.850283732309034e-06	0.5963172523762236

Within the Asian population, the variant rs57095329 in the promoter region of the miR-146a gene, which is suspected of reducing efficient transcription factor binding (i.e., for Ets-1), contributes to the decreased expression of the miRNA and an increased risk to develop SLE (60). 	Similarly, an increased risk for SLE was identified in European individuals possessing the variant rs2431697 in the intergenic region of miR-146a, which reduces the expression of the miRNA (61). In contrast, screening for SLE-susceptible regions in the genomic segments around miR-146a did not show any significance in an alternate sampling of the Asian population (62). 	0.9989164725086811	3.0718175796350783e-05	0.0010528093155226176

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Background	In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. 	None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. Our findings may suggest that the effect of these CAD-loci on CAD development does not act through pathways significantly affecting these commonly used inflammatory biomarkers. 	0.9534476831400063	0.00019344808928818208	0.04635886877070551

Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P. 	0.002175548734321602	3.8217015923722356e-08	0.9978244130486624

These results, taken together with those from several forensic studies predicting iris pigmentation in mixed populations (Mengel-From et al. 2010; Spichenok et al. 2010; Valenzuela et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010; Pospiech et al. 2011), suggest that the SNPs of BEH2 (rs1129038 and rs12913832) are the best markers for blue eyes for forensic purposes. 	A recent study by Liu et al. (2010) found that rs12913832 has the strongest effect when eye color is measured quantitatively and can explain most of the variance in eye color amongst Europeans. However, several questions need to be answered. 	0.9999877157653104	3.3540185731539393e-08	1.2250694503853703e-05

Numerous transcripts homologous to the OBP-like EST JZ183505.1 were identified in both the 1st and 4th legs. 	5.186557301246705e-05	0.0006127177331465008	0.999335416693841

Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. 	0.886714736563878	0.0003212196035080967	0.11296404383261395

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Title	RefSNP	False	Use	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2]. 	4.973609113164316e-05	9.092297166613747e-13	0.9999502639079593

We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05). 	6.426584027617608e-10	1.354190655316528e-08	0.9999999858154351

The lactococcal Pip protein, first described in L. lactis C2 (GenBank accession number L14679), is a 901 aa membrane-spanning protein encoded by a 2706-bp gene (Geller et al., 1993) with homologues in most Gram-positive bacteria (Mooney et al., 2006); notably Bacillus subtilis orthologue yueB (São-José et al., 2004, 2006). 	It has been reported that inactivation of pip virtually eliminates infection by C2virus in lactococci without any apparent effect on the host (Garbutt et al., 1997; Kraus & Geller, 1998). Similarly, SPP1 requires YueB to infect B. subtilis, where the interaction has been extensively studied (Plisson et al., 2007; Jakuytė et al., 2012). 	0.9063297656417227	5.869624955304591e-07	0.09366964739578171

Highest similarity of the LSU sequences was found with “Mollisia incrustata” GenBank GU727556; however, this sequence does not appear to be congeneric with other Mollisia sequences on GenBank (data not shown) and thus the application of the supposed taxonomic lineage of Mollisia (Leotiomycetes; Helotiales; Dermateaceae) would not be confirmed here. 	Examination of the blast results also did not result in a clear affinity to any of the classes, with a more or less equal similarity to both Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes and therefore this genus is treated here as incertae sedis. It is quite possible that the genus belongs to a class that is currently not represented in the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database. 	2.138343756730841e-06	6.44680128375834e-06	0.9999914148549595

Histological analysis of intestinal biopsies at diagnosis (when disease is active) shows that CD is characterized by the loss of villi, crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in the gut, and there are circulating IgA and IgG class autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 and antibodies against gliadin (2). Clinical presentation varies from typical gastrointestinal symptoms to extraintestinal manifestations, all of which develop in the context of a sustained, chronic inflammation of the gut, but usually revert if gluten is totally excluded from the diet. 	0.9980335158573551	1.102402960845594e-08	0.001966473118615237

In the yeast Pol I crystal structure (Protein Data Bank structure 4C2M, (14)), this patch of amino acids in AC40 contacts the Pol I-specific A34.5 subunit (Figure 5E), suggesting that differences at these conserved positions in NRPA3 and NRPC3 of Arabidopsis (and related species) are good candidates for specifying Pol I- versus Pol III-specific interactions. 	By contrast, amino acid differences in NRPA3 versus NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast Y84 or I63 are less likely to be critical because these positions interact with Rpb12 and AC19 in yeast AC40 (Figure 5F), which are subunits common to Pols I and III in yeast and Arabidopsis (with the caveat that Rpb12 association with Pol I was not confirmed by mass spectrometry in our study). Amino acid differences in NRPA3 and NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast I72, Q93 or R293 are also potential candidates for mediating Pol I versus Pol III-specific interactions, as these positions make polymerase-specific contacts, such as with the A135 catalytic subunit of Pol I (Figure 5G and H). 	0.002814593322551633	1.2587347854047247e-08	0.9971853940901004

It was first described in 1966 and was originally named Job's syndrome.42 HIES has either a dominant or recessive pattern of autosominal inheritance, with the rare AR HIES largely shown to be caused by mutations in DOCK8 (OMIM ID: 243700); in addition, AD HIES has been shown to be mainly caused by germline heterozygous STAT3 mutations (OMIM ID: 147060).15 STAT3 has a central role in signal transduction downstream of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-27. 	The STAT3 mutations identified in AD HIES patients are loss-of-function (LOF) and exert a dominant-negative effect on wild-type STAT3-mediated signaling.15 In addition to their infectious phenotype, patients with STAT3 mutations present with multiple clinical manifestations, including characteristic facial features, high-arched palate, retained primary teeth, scoliosis, osteoporosis and hyperextensibility of joints. STAT3-deficient patients also frequently develop CMC associated with other infectious and clinical manifestations. 	0.9955293839075398	2.4405430804413725e-06	0.004468175549379839

In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations.

PMC3145266	ABO15549	Article	ENA	False	Use	This loss is likely due do the complete loss of the GLO gene because BLAST searches cannot identify GLO gene sequences in any of the completely sequenced teleost fish genomes [28]. 	These negative results are likely significant because BLAST searches using a chicken GLO protein sequence (GenBank accession number XP_001234314) as a query readily finds numerous GLO protein sequences, including that of the sturgeon species Acipenser transmontanus (GenBank accession number ABO15549, which is 74% identical to that of chicken) and even that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (GenBank accession number XP_ 002122023, which is 48% identical to that of chicken). 	Given the high degree of conservation of this gene, the fact that GLO orthologues cannot be identified from the currently available teleost genomes is likely the result of the fact that this non-functional gene has mutated beyond recognition or that it has been deleted from teleost genomes altogether. Furthermore, the gene coding for gulonolactonase, the penultimate enzyme in vitamin C synthesis (Fig. 1), is readily identified in BLAST searches using the human protein as a query (GenBank accession number EAL24133) in teleost genomes such as that of the zebra fish Danio rerio (GenBank accession number AAI52248), the salmon Salmo salar (GenBank accession number ACI69713) and the European flounder Platichthys flesus (GenBank accession number ACI69713), among others. 	0.10284167064825113	0.0035449333745006632	0.8936133959772482

PMC5471064	rs1401492	Article	RefSNP	False	Use	In 2011, based on the HyperGen study, a GWAS including 1,040 African Americans explored the association between insulin resistance and genetic variation. 	The results showed SNPs linked with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin near ATP10A (rs6576507 and rs8026527) and CACNA1D (rs1401492) [54]. 	Obesity is related with insulin resistance, and also a strong risk factor for T2DM. Thus, we can assume reasonably that some loci of obesity would also be insulin resistance loci, or possibly T2DM susceptibility loci. 	0.0016898113041333132	7.054134735404011e-07	0.998309483282393
PMC4293902	2F5Z	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	This limitation notwithstanding, the AUC and SAXS data are all consistent with a dimeric structure for PfaE3 and are not inconsistent with the augmented homology model. 	In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. 	The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3). 	0.00024781015759056923	1.0626356699307309e-08	0.9997521792160527

WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9].

PMC6121541	SRX3822957	Results	ENA	False	Use	These results thus indicated that our transcriptome datasets can accurately predict the unigenes potentially useful for further analysis of Lilium species. 	All the short reads were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and can be accessed in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (accession number SRX3822957 for PH-FB transcriptome dataset and SRX3822958 for PH-LF transcriptome dataset). 	A total of 31,648 unigenes (75.63% = 31,648/41,848 of ALL unigenes, Table S2) were annotated by using the BLASTX and a variety of protein databases taking into account the identity between the unigene sequences and the sequences in the database (E-value < 10−5). In addition, 30,853 (73.73%), 22,722 (54.29%), 7,060 (16.87%), 13,781 (32.93%), and 24,306 (58.08%) unigenes were aligned against the Nr, SWISS-PROT, GO (Gene Ontology), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins), and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases, respectively. 	1.1727953830404308e-05	0.35259655749361385	0.6473917145525557
PMC4190437	E-MTAB-2736	Results	ArrayExpress	False	Use	Thirty libraries were built and sequenced using the SOLID™ technology, generating 9 to 15 million reads for each library. 	All sequence data can be retrieved from the ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MTAB-2736. 	After adaptor trimming and size selection, about 70% of these reads were mapped to the EquCab2 horse genome for each sample, defining about 53998 to 97964 regions. Among these regions, 327 and 329 in cartilage and bone, respectively, overlapped with previously known mammalian miRNA (Additional file 2: Table S1-A, and Additional file 3: Table S1-B). 	1.1876498747296904e-06	0.14725149982263538	0.8527473125274899
