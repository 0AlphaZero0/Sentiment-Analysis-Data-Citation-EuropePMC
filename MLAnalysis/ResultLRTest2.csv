PMC5045879	E-MEXP-569	Methods	ArrayExpress	False	Use		To examine how mechanical stress contributes to the response of VSMC and its underlying signal transduction pathways, we made use of the microarray experiment, E-MEXP-569, downloaded from the ArrayExpress database (Brazma et al., 2003). 	The experiment compared the gene expression profiles of the VSMC in response to a cyclical mechanical strain over a time-course of 0, 2, 4 and 24 h. Each sample consisted of two replicates prepared from human aortic VSMC purchased from Cambrex Bioscience. 	1.8584222019216607e-05	0.004635591604909861	0.9953458241730709

This additional information brought by the analysis at the protein-level indicates that a virus distantly related to the TYMV could be present in the dataset. 	0.06846791558170964	2.194999730754165e-05	0.9315101344209828

PMC4299518	AB266616	Results	ENA	False	Use	For this study we selected three Fusarium genes with different characteristics. 	The first targeted gene, FOW2 (Genbank AB266616.1) encodes a putative transcription regulator belonging to the Zn(II)2Cys6 family and has been shown to be essential for pathogenicity of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis (Imazaki et al., 2007). FOW2-targeted mutants completely lost pathogenicity, being unable to colonize the roots of the host but were not impaired in vegetative growth or conidiation when grown in culture. 	In addition, mutations in the same gene of a different forma specialis (f. sp. lycopersici) also resulted in loss of pathogenicity, implying the universal importance of the gene for pathogenicity. The second gene selected was FRP1 (Genbank AY673970.1) which encodes an F-box protein that interacts with SKP1 to facilitate targeting of proteins to the SCF-ubiquitination complex. 	0.07809627746476833	0.04730129192766904	0.8746024306075626

FRP1 is necessary for F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopercisi pathogenicity and, as with FOW2, FRP1-deficient mutants were still able to grow in artificial media but did not colonize host plants (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). The final target of our study is a gene encoding for a protein with homology to 12-oxo-phytodienoate reductase (OPR) (Genbank AFQF01002613), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in plants (Wasternack, 2007). 	0.001084795226078477	6.569902279254739e-06	0.9989086348716422

PMC4299518	AAT85970	Discussion	ENA	False	Background	Disruption in FRP1 led to a complete loss of pathogenicity in tomato with mutant fungi unable to colonize the roots (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). 	The fact that FRP1 is an F-box protein and that it physically interacts with F. oxysporum SKP1 (Genebank AAT85970.1) suggests that FRP1 is part of a SCF ubiquitin kinase complex. 	The F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici FRP1 protein has highly homologous counterparts (86–100% identity) in other Fusarium species (F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans; f. sp. cubense races 1 and 4, F. fujikuroi, F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum) and it is also present in other plant pathogenic fungi such as Colletotrichum graminicola (63% identity) and even non plant pathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (66% identity) and Neurospora crassa (55% identity). The relatively high level of homology is probably due to the conservation of the F-box motif and points to the suggestion that an FRP1-associated SCF ubiquitin ligase complex plays an important role in degradation of pathogenicity-related proteins through ubiquitination (Duyvesteijn et al., 2005). 	0.9939078985882842	1.2582583204292766e-07	0.006091975585883743

Another ATF2 splicing variant is expressed in myometrial tissues during pregnancy/labor (GenBank: AY029364.1) [50]. 	ATF2-small (ATF2-sm) only comprises the first two and last two exons, lacking therefore the most part of the functional domains, i.e. the sequence encompassing the two threonine residues 69 and 71 of the activation domain and the bZIP domain. Nevertheless, it was intriguingly described to exhibit a CRE-binding activity and to be transcriptionally active to an equivalent degree to that of full length ATF2 [50]. 	0.3040545301310484	3.7816368429869623e-07	0.6959450917052674

The full sequences of the ATF7-4 transcript (787 nucleotides) and protein (117 amino acids) have been given the GenBank and Swissprot accession numbers BC042363 and Q8IVR8 respectively. 	The pG4-ATF7(2–82) and pG4-ATF2(19–96) plasmids encode the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein fused to the human activation domain of either ATF7-FL (amino acids 2–82) or ATF2 (amino acids 19–96), as previously described [39], [52]. The (17m5)-TK-Luc reporter [61] contains the luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter and five Gal4 binding sites. 	0.00033994937760872026	0.8225763081187155	0.1770837425036758

The results showed that the knockdown of NR_027457 and AF085938 significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro (Figure 4A, 4B), while the silencing of G36948 and AK002210 in SVneo cells significantly promoted the cell migration and invasion abilities (Figure 4C, 4D).

However, Shao et al. 2007 did not find any mutations in the MLK4 kinase domain in 46 colorectal samples isolated from Japanese patients and only two of 24 cell lines in the study harbored the mutation R470C in the MLK4 gene.32 No mutations in MLK4 were found in gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas from Korean patients either, suggesting that the MLK4 kinase domain mutations are rare and may not contribute to the development of these carcinomas.33 The relevance of these observations is unclear and currently, no evidence suggests that any MLK family member functions as an oncogene in humans.

We, in present study report isolation, heterologous expression and transcript profiling of two A-type P450 monooxygenases viz. WsCYP98A (GenBank: HM585369) and WsCYP76A (GenBank: KC008573). 	These are supposed to be involved mainly in the shikmate and phenylpropanoid pathway biosynthesizing the various defence molecules during biotic and abiotic stress. CYP98A (p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase) catalyzes the meta-hydroxylation of p-coumarate derivatives for the biosynthesis of lignins and chlorogenic acid, which constitutes a crucial bottleneck in phenylpropanoid pathway [24]. 	0.0002010137767925076	1.1982513208161054e-07	0.9997988663980754

PMC6004538	CP000424	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	As the operon was more highly expressed in the absence of cysteine, it may indeed be involved in the transport of cysteine or of the precursors needed for cysteine biosynthesis. 	This transport system was also found on a plasmid in L. paracasei ATCC 334 (GenBank acc. no.CP000424) but not in other L. paracasei genomes in the GenBank database. 	Since cheese is a cysteine-poor environment, the presence of a cysteine transport system apparently does not provide an evolutionary advantage for this bacterium, which could explain why this transport system is not widely distributed in L. paracasei strains, especially those of dairy origin. Analysis of the RNA-seq data enabled identification of the genes that formed transcriptional units (Figure 3). 	0.00033126496213473745	5.3633996527993086e-05	0.9996151010413373

To determine whether gene amplification could account for the broadly improved replication of passaged VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 we performed paired-end Illumina based deep sequencing (Short Read Archive #SRP033208). 	Based on read depth, we detected duplication of the rhtrs1 locus in all three passage 7 virus pools but not in VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 (Fig. 4A). Each of the passaged pools contained between 1.4 and 1.9 copies of rhtrs1 per genome, although these numbers reflect averages of a heterogeneous population of viral genomes. 	0.9796892739824097	0.004481886307544269	0.015828839710045957

The origin of the severity of the 1976 Fort Dix strain is explained by its strongly hydrophobic head amino acid content, especially near site 110. The advent of swine flu (2001–2007) and the response (2009–2011) to its vaccination program flattened (smoothed) current strains (like New York 2009) and reduced their virulence. 	5.313297593505721e-19	2.666419212381021e-13	0.9999999999997333

The lack of a Oshox14 mutant in the Tos17 insertion mutant collection (Hirochika 2001) does not contradict with the notion that HvHox2 is essential for plant growth and development in the cereals. In contrast, the loss of Vrs1 function both in natural variants, and in many induced mutants (including the total deletion of the gene) indicates that Vrs1 is non-essential for plant growth and development (Komatsuda et al. 2007). 	0.2276459611578759	8.324638645622285e-07	0.7723532063782595

PMC5577242	J04431	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	In the nucleus, this complex acts as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor by binding to a GC response element (GRE) in the promoter of a target gene. 	When we analyzed the promoter regions of TGF-β genes using the MatInspector V2.2 program56, our results showed that the promoters of the human (GenBank Accession # J04431), rat (GenBank Accession # AF239170 and # AF249327) and mouse (GenBank Accession # M57902) TGF-β1 gene have binding sites for consensus GRE (5′-AGAACA). 	These observations support the hypothesis that GCs may be involved in the regulation of TGF-β genes inhibited in skeletal tissue after denervation by a GR pathway. The results in this study are important from a clinical standpoint because reduction of bone formation is a significant metabolic response in denervated patients. 	0.0005374906007859137	6.538714558346574e-05	0.9993971222536306

Further, we previously detected the promoter of CDC25a (GenBank accession no. AJ242714.1) contained three Y-box sequences (Figure 4A) that might bind by YBX1. 	So we hypothesized that if YBX1 could bind to CDC25a promoter and up-regulate CDC25a expression to promote tumor cell overcoming cell cycle checkpoint restriction to satisfy unlimited malignant amplification. Here we showed that the expression of CDC25a had close relationship with the expression of YBX1 in cancer tissues samples on the basis of novel adenocarcinoma subtypes classification by immunohistochemical staining for the first time. 	0.11730585407540073	1.8831037650804386e-05	0.8826753148869485

PMC4928311	AB245021	Discussion	ENA	False	Use	Some of this variation in the qPCR outcome could relate to genetic variation in the target sequence of the forward primer, which may provide suboptimal conditions for the qPCR. 	Indeed, a BLAST® search on the targeted ITS2 sequence (GenBank accession no: AB245021.2, query range 1,036–1,126 bp) revealed a genetic variability of 1–2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the forward primer region among 31 % of the available O. ostertagi ITS2 sequences (Additional file 2).

PMC6193605	KU761334	Introduction	ENA	False	Use	At 5 days postinfection (dpi), the serum concentrations of 14 out of 26 cytokines tested (interleukin-10 [IL-10], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], IL-3, IL-1a, Ccl5, Ccl7, IL-13, IL-4, IL-23, IL-2, IL12p70, interferon gamma [IFN-γ], IL-6, and Ccl3) were reduced in mice infected with a T. gondii RHΔMAF1 mutant compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain (RH:WT) (12), although there were no significant MAF1-dependent differences in mouse morbidity. 	However, it has also been shown that expression of an HMA+ copy of MAF1 (specifically TgMAF1RHb1 [13; GenBank accession no. KU761334], here referred to as MAF1b) in parasites that do not normally exhibit HMA provided a competitive advantage in a mixed population of HMA+ and HMA− parasites during the acute phase of infection (13), suggesting that in the type II genetic, background, MAF1b expression (and therefore HMA itself) can influence infection outcome in vivo. 	Here we aimed to assess the impact of MAF1b complementation in naturally HMA− parasites on the progression and maintenance of chronic infections in mice and the cytokine responses that occur during the progression of disease over a 4-week period of infection. Recently published in vivo dual-transcriptional profiling of T. gondii and host (in this case, mouse) RNA, which is available at ToxoDB.org, suggests that MAF1 expression remains high (>80th percentile) during chronic infection (14). 	0.3474651184863889	1.829627491426012e-05	0.6525165852386968

In particular, the assembly for chromosome XII was interrupted in the RDN1 locus—a repetitive region consisting of gene encoding ribosomal RNA estimated to be more than 1 Mbp long (Venema and Tollervey 1999). 	2.6164697363483168e-05	3.854889411937808e-06	0.9999699804132247

Thirty-seven lncRNAs were differentially expressed in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (Table 3).

PMC6184486	GSE12715	Results	GEO	False	Use	To check whether ethylene perception and signaling are involved in sensing NO, we tested the sensitivity to NO in hypocotyl shortening assays with the ethylene-insensitive etr1-3 and ein2-5 mutants (Roman et al., 1995). Figure 3A shows that etr1-3 and ein2-5 seedlings were fully insensitive to NO in inhibiting hypocotyl elongation, thus suggesting that ethylene perception and signaling were essential for NO sensing. 	The comparison of the NO-responsive transcriptome with the differential transcriptomes previously reported for the ein2-1 and etr1-1 mutants (Cheng et al., 2009; GEO Accession GSE12715) points to a significant overlap (Fig. 3B). 	There were 57 genes that were common for the three transcriptomes and an additional 73 and 129 genes in the intersections of the NO-responsive genes and ein2-1, and the NO-responsive genes and etr1-1, respectively (Fig. 3B), thus supporting a potential relevant involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing. We can rule out that the involvement of ETR1 and EIN2 in NO sensing was due to transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes by NO, as only slight increases below 1.6-fold in the corresponding transcripts were detected in NO-treated plants (Supplementary Fig. 	0.0012735540527565902	0.002007775582063048	0.9967186703651805

In the three-index sample library, the sample with the ACACAT index (NA10859) had approximately one-third less reads than the other two indexed samples in that library. 	However, in the nine-index sample library, where the read counts for all nine individual samples were within a tight range of each other, the same ACACAT index did not under perform compared with the other indexes. Differences in sample read counts are more likely due to pipetting or quantitation error when the sequencing libraries are initially combined prior to the enrichment process. 	0.019873593576526013	1.4751596883377515e-05	0.9801116548265906

Each caller was run on the high-quality Hi-C data generated for chromosome 6 of the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 (Fig. 1a). 	This model was chosen as it is one of the cell lines where Hi-C data have been generated at the highest resolution [2], and chromosome 6 had the average chromosome length and number of reads per kb. Results were often heterogeneous among callers and conditions, prompting caution when drawing conclusions from specific TAD partitions, but also highlighted consistent good performance for some callers. 	1.6232811878167385e-07	5.61542721583189e-08	0.9999997815176092

To specifically assess the performance of all callers when different numbers of reads are available, independent of the bin size of the matrix, we systematically subsampled Hi-C contacts determined for the GM12878 cell line (chromosome 6) and compared the TADs called with subsampled reads with those obtained from the complete contact matrix. 	For this test, we used ICE-normalized data binned in 50-kb intervals and generated 13 different matrices using different percentages of reads that ranged from 100 to 0.01%, corresponding to an estimated cost ranging from over $1000 to less than a dollar (Fig. 3 top panel). Some of the tested callers failed to return a TAD partition for low sequencing depth, in particular arrowhead and HiTAD did not identify TADs with less than 1% of the reads (Additional file 2: Figure S3). 	3.907237685156709e-07	6.757328739924308e-06	0.9999928519474915

For these analyses, we selected a subset of 6 callers that exhibited variable performance across our tests: arrowhead, CaTCH, HiCseg, ICFinder, spectral, and TopDom.

They constitute a eukaryotic protein superfamily, characterized by the presence of the p25alpha domain (Pfam05517, IPR008907), and named after the first identified member, TPPP/p25, exhibiting microtubule stabilizing function. 	TPPP-like proteins can be grouped on the basis of two characteristics: the length of their p25alpha domain, which can be long, short, truncated or partial, and the presence or absence of additional domain(s). TPPPs, in the strict sense, contain no other domains but one long or short p25alpha one (long- and short-type TPPPs, respectively). 	0.011049815478013513	9.119358107046851e-10	0.9889501836100506

Heterozygous germline mutations in FH were initially found in 25 of 42 probands in European families segregating HLRCC.

(2011) describing the neurological disorder linked to a novel heterozygous missense mutation in MFN2 (1p36.2) (Rouzier et al., 2011). MFN2 mutations typically cause autosomal dominant axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT2A, OMIM 609260), with peripheral nerve degeneration occasionally associated with visual failure and optic atrophy (Zuchner et al., 2004, 2006). 	Interestingly, the clinical manifestations among mutational carriers in this Tunisian family were even more variable, ranging from asymptomatic subclinical disease to an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy complicated by optic atrophy, deafness, cerebellar ataxia and proximal myopathy. Furthermore, the intriguing finding of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in skeletal muscle biopsies suggest that MFN2 mutations can result in disturbed mitochondrial DNA maintenance and an overt respiratory chain defect, in addition to marked fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. 	0.9999999750382111	6.086521417926384e-11	2.49009235133744e-08

The same FGFR1 mutations occur in subgroups of sporadic low-grade gliomas (LGG) [7, 10, 12] indicating probable intersection between ECCL and tumorigenesis, possibility further substantiated by reports of brain tumors in nine ECCL cases with wide-ranging histopathological subtypes [1–3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13]. 	0.7544347855159022	2.973622045471563e-09	0.24556521151047583

In 2002, mutations in the IRF6 gene, which accounts for 75% of VWS (OMIM: 119300) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS; OMIM: 119500), were first reported (Kondo et al. 2002). 	Resequencing of IRF6 gene in nonsyndromic OFC (a phenocopy of VWS) identified a missense mutation in IRF6 p.Val247Iso that was more frequent in cases than controls and significantly overtransmitted in affected families using the family based approach (Zucchero et al. 2004). These findings suggest that common polymorphisms in IRF6 are associated with nonsyndromic clefts and rare variants in this gene are associated with VWS and PPS. 	0.9999985285149519	2.4840867153997553e-10	1.4712366395102916e-06

PMC5013595	1fg9	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	Interferon-γ receptor 2 is a cell-surface receptor that represents a crucial molecule in the interferon-γ (IFNγ) signalization pathway, influencing innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens and tumours (Schoenborn & Wilson, 2007 ▸; Lin & Young, 2013 ▸). 	The signalling cascade is initiated by the binding of IFNγ to its high-affinity cell surface receptor 1, forming a binary complex with a structure that has already been determined [PDB entries 1fg9 (Thiel et al., 2000 ▸) and 1fyh (Landar et al., 2000 ▸)]. 	However, to activate this binary complex and activate the JAK/STAT signalization pathway (Jung et al., 1987 ▸; Cook et al., 1994 ▸; Hemmi et al., 1994 ▸), IFNγ receptor 2 must participate in a ternary complex created by a homodimer of IFNγ, two molecules of receptor 1 and molecule(s) of receptor 2. To date, detailed structural and biophysical characterization of IFNγ receptor 2, the key molecule for proper IFNγ signalization, is lacking. 	0.9991996651510439	5.002062430939391e-10	0.0008003343487498978

Several structural and sequential features of receptors of interferon-α and interferon-β (PDB entry 3se4; Thomas et al., 2011 ▸), here labelled IFNαR1 and IFNαR2, distinguishes them from the other analyzed receptors. 	Specifically, IFNαR1 is composed of four instead of two domains; here, we analyzed D1 and D2. The D3–D4 pair cannot be analyzed as D4 is not resolved in the electron density. 	0.1638135505195521	2.321224006528372e-08	0.8361864262682078

The primer might could be bound to residues located in the thumb subdomain and residues within palm domain’s motif E, while the template might be coordinated by residues located in the fingers subdomain. 	0.39003510915496853	3.2015487685118728e-09	0.6099648876434826

It was reported that low‐fidelity DNA polymerases differ from high‐fidelity DNA polymerases mainly in the efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation, whereas the incorporation of incorrect nucleotides is comparable.22 Thus, we reasoned that enhanced error rates opposite m6A would probably derive from decreased dTMP incorporation rather than from increased misincorporation. 	1.561108318307869e-05	7.502496376063185e-08	0.9999843138918532

For the apo form of prolin/sodium symporter PutP, a helix-loop-helix model based on EPR data revealed a kink of TMD 8 very similar to the one seen in LeuT (Hilger et al. 2009), whereas the same TMD is straight in inward-open conformations of vSGLT, which belongs to the same protein family of sodium substrate symporters (SSS) as PutP. However, in Mhp1 and LeuT, which could be crystallized in outward-open and inward-open structures, only slight straightening is observed (vide infra). 	0.9895061621818091	1.914752668831252e-09	0.010493835903438366

In the SLC 7 family of amino acid transporters TMD 8 is straight in the outward-open structure of the arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC (3NCY) and kinked in the inward-open structure of ApcT (3GIA). 	Hence, even if a change of internal conformation of TMD 8 is a universal feature of the transition from the outward-open to the inward-open state, extent and direction of this change differ between different proteins for currently unknown reasons. We have taken advantage of the small internal conformation variability of TMD 4 to define a robust parameter θΒ,4 (see Sect. “Methods”) that characterizes relative orientation of the bundle of TMDs 1, 2, 6, and 7 and the hash motif made up by TMDs 3, 4, 8, and 9 (see Fig. 1b). 	0.001305148981411058	9.1142492106444e-09	0.9986948419043397

Instead of facing the membrane hydrophobic core in NMR structure (PDB: 2L35) which is energetically unfavorable, both side chains of Asps in DAP12 oriented toward the interface of the trimer complex. 	To decrease electrostatic repulsion between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer, both chains of DAP12 dimer shifted away and moved slightly vertical to facilitate the formation of two salt bridges between both Asps and Lys. These two stable salt bridges were further proven from the distances between each DAP12 Asp and NKG2C Lys, which were equally as close to approximately 0.5 nm and lower than the distance between both Asps of the DAP12 dimer. 	6.89476185936502e-05	3.8319744913251e-10	0.9999310519982089

Specifically, the fusion of two TelSAM domains maintained the helical polymeric nature with fewer units for each repeat turn. Thus, instead of 60° degrees rotation per unit, 120° degrees rotation per unit was obtained, and the 65 screw symmetry was transformed into 32 screw symmetry. 	0.8321048059237169	7.392090746648653e-08	0.1678951201553755

Because the constricting ring of MTS-tagged AtFtsZ2 expressed in spherical P. pastoris cells has been proposed to slide along the membrane from the middle region to one end of the cell19, we suggest that the cell-wall integrity of E. coli restricts the constriction of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in our bacterial system. 	Notably, whereas long filaments of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 were observed only when endogenous EcFtsZ was present (Figs 1A and 2B), multiple Z ring-like structures of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS were formed even in the EcFtsZ-depleted strain (Fig. 2B), which suggests that EcFtsZ exerts a supportive effect particularly on AtFtsZ2 filamentation ability. The long filaments detected in wild-type cells are possibly generated by bundling of EcFtsZ and AtFtsZ2 homopolymers because EcFtsZ cannot heteropolymerize with AtFtsZ219. 	0.049111911492867165	3.734245628587507e-08	0.9508880511646765

Consistently, nonbacterial ARC3 expression potently lowered the filament length of sfGFP-AtFtsZ2 and reduced the number of Z ring-like structures formed by sfGFP-AtFtsZ2-2MTS in bacterial cells (Fig. 3). 	Here, the AtFtsZ2 Z ring-like structures were forcibly tethered to the membrane by the MTS, and ARC3 strongly inhibited AtFtsZ2 filamentation, and thus the number of Z ring-like structures formed might have been reduced due to the inhibition of AtFtsZ2 filament assembly by ARC3. Notably, the cells expressing both AtFtsZ2-2MTS and ARC3 were much shorter than those expressing only AtFstZ2-2MTS were. 	0.010276694906793171	2.9773870382224376e-07	0.9897230073545029
PMC5471200	2MTS	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	In our bacterial system, ARC6 colocalized with AtFtsZ2 and drastically altered its filament morphology, from linear filaments to Z ring-like structures (Fig. 4, see Supplementary Fig. S6B). 	This Z ring-like structure formation and the membrane attachment of AtFtsZ2 strongly depended on the C-terminal ARC6-interacting sequence of AtFtsZ2, which indicates that ARC6-tethered AtFtsZ2 behaves like AtFtsZ2-2MTS, an artificial membrane-targeting protein, and assembles into multiple Z ring-like structures. 	Conversely, the Z ring-like structures formed by AtFtsZ2 and ARC6 in bacterial cells reflect the natural condition of the chloroplast Z ring, which concurrently demonstrates that ARC6 functions as a genuine membrane-anchoring partner of AtFtsZ2. Recently, ARC6 was reported to be capable of stabilizing AtFtsZ2 polymers in yeast cells independently of its Z ring-tethering function25; the stromal region of ARC6 was observed to lower the turnover rate of AtFtsZ2 polymers. 	0.0037492468382443766	4.8948798619073285e-09	0.9962507482668758

The MD simulations of insulin in the closed state were validated by comparing with the corresponding crystal structure 2G4M. 	As shown in Table 1, the average distances between the Cα atoms of BC-CT and B-chain α-helix agree with the experimental values within 1 Å. We note that the fluctuations in distances increase from F24 to T30, which points to an effective interaction that diminishes with the distance from the hinge towards the C-terminal. As discussed in Fig 1B, the side chains of F24 and Y26 contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic core, which is responsible for maintaining insulin in the closed state. Table 2 lists the strongest hydrophobic interactions involving the F24 and Y26 side chains and compares the average distances obtained from the MD simulations with the experimental values. 	0.5659031749620707	3.322655469788963e-06	0.4340935023824595

Superimposition of the PKA–ATP–peptide complex (PDB code 1ATP) revealed that a docking groove created within the active site of GAK would be suitable to accommodate a peptide substrate (Figure 3D), which therefore suggests that this conformation of the activation segment may serve as an active conformation of the enzyme to enable peptide binding. 	However, the tight interaction of NbGAK_1 with the upper lobe induces structural changes that distort slightly the catalytic spine alignment and the upper lobe itself, which also affects the conserved salt bridge between Lys69 and αC Glu85 increasing the optimal distance of 3 Å seen in the GAK–NbGAK_4 structure to a distance of 4 Å (Supplementary Figure S5A at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/459/bj4590059add.htm).

The vacant sixth coordination site of iron is the position where molecular oxygen will bind during the catalytic cycle.

The discrepancy could be due to the factors that they used the crystal structure of NDM-1 (PDB 3Q6X, Zhang and Hao, 2011) as target without the bridged hydroxide ion and employed empirical docking and scoring function (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998) only to estimate the binding affinities of the compounds. 	From our QM calculations, MOs of the QM region shows that the HOMO with the bridged OH− between zinc ions has electron cloud delocalized over the Zn-OH-Zn cluster, while the LUMOs are similar with electron cloud concentrated at Zn2, independent of the hydroxide ion. As a result, the inhibitors of antibiotics resistance against the NDM-1 will be of conjugate nature, by binding over the Zn-OH-Zn, such as Curcumin, Catechin, and Feruclic acid (Figure 3). 	0.25964270988645083	5.997874824150829e-07	0.7403566903260668

PMC3650022	NM_173654.1	Discussion	RefSeq	False	Use	We show that transfection of this EOGT cDNA causes O-GlcNAcylation of Drosphila N, Dl and Ser EGF repeats; it also requires a conserved DXD motif for optimal activity, and it is primarily responsible for the transfer of O-GlcNAc to high molecular weight proteins, including Dp, in Drosophila larvae. 	Another cDNA in Genbank (NM_173654.1; [21]) lacks an internal segment that contains the DYD motif, and is therefore predicted to have low or no activity. In vivo, the human EOGT cDNA fully rescued homozygotes of a new P-element excision mutation of eogt (eogtex10). 	Both eogt RNAi knock-down and mutant clones exhibited blistered wing and vortex phenotypes, similar to the vortex class of dp mutants (dpv). The hallmark of the removal of eogt in the posterior wing in en>eogtIR flies was the temperature-dependent development of blisters, with essentially 100% frequency at 27°C (Table 1 and Fig. 5; [11]). 	0.002944910467230021	4.1648169226876335e-11	0.9970550894911218

Our previous study verified six miRNAs as potential biomarkers for pulmonary TB, including hsa-miR-3786, of which the mature sequence hsa-miR-378a-3p was among the 368 miRNAs that associated with NR_038221, indicating that NR_038221 and hsa-miR-378a-3p might play a similar function during the pathological process of pulmonary TB. 	In summary, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs in plasma of TB patients that may influence the activation of T cells. These lncRNAs could affect signal transduction between cells, thus influencing the pathological process of TB. 	0.06513603951369189	6.111759010854373e-10	0.9348639598751323
PMC5314723	NM_000520.4	Abstract	RefSeq	False	Use	This study assesses the reliability of EA in comparison with HEXA sequence analysis in non-AJ populations. Methods: Five hundred eight Hispanic and African American patients (516 samples) had EA of their leukocytes performed and 12 of these patients who tested positive by EA (“carriers”) had subsequent HEXA gene sequencing performed. Results: Of the 508 patients, 25 (4.9%) were EA positive and 40 (7.9%) were inconclusive. 	Of the 12 patients who were sequenced, 11 did not carry a pathogenic variant and one carried a likely deleterious mutation (NM_000520.4(HEXA):c.1510C>T). Conclusions: High inconclusive rates and poor correlation between positive/inconclusive enzyme results and identification of pathogenic mutations suggest that ethnic-specific recalibration of reference ranges for EA may be necessary. 	Alternatively, HEXA gene sequencing could be performed. 	0.007563965466850511	4.343913292143579e-10	0.9924360340987581

PMC5681741	rs9923304	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Matrix metalloproteinase 2, also known as gelatinase A, is a membrane-bound protein that is important for extracellular matrix turnover, preferentially cleaving collagen types IV, V, VII, and XI and gelatin (29). 	The MMP2 variant rs9923304 was found to be associated with formation of a periapical lesion when there is deep carious lesions in dentin (16). 	The underlying mechanism for this finding is possibly the same that explains the association of this genetic variant in MMP2 and failures of direct resin composite restorations of the present study. MMP2 gelatinolytic activity probably occurs both in partially demineralized dentin at the bottom of caries lesions and at the surface treated with either etch-and-rinse or self-etch adhesives. 	0.7319711161291085	4.904048774012772e-12	0.26802888386598744

PMC3170315	rs4986790	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	We assumed that genetic polymorphisms in various TLRs were functional and influenced melanoma susceptibility and disease outcome. 	Our data showed that melanoma patients carrying the variant allele for the rs4986790 polymorphism in the TLR4 gene were associated with a prolonged OS. 	The increase in survival was confined to the period after the detection of a first metastasis, which implied that the effect of the polymorphism might possibly modulated dependent on therapy or alternatively by biological processes associated with melanoma cell migration and/or invasion. The patients in stage IV melanoma in most instances received a chemotherapy containing DTIC/temozolomide and interferons, which is known for long time not having any clinical effect on overall survival of the entire metastatic melanoma population [14], [15]. 	7.256136597046273e-06	1.2792676699750219e-09	0.9999927425841352

PMC5650161	rs1800088	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Use	In addition, recombinant expression and site-directed mutagenesis investigations have shown significant impact on receptor function leading to altered response to β2 agonists [33]. 	Interestingly, major evidence associating ADRB2 variants with functioning of the receptor comes from C→T base exchange (rs1800088) at the 491 position in ADRB2 gene that substitutes Threonine to Isoleucine at 164th position in the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). 	The consequence of variation is observed as diminished ligand-receptor interactions followed by depressed coupling of β2AR to adenylcyclases wherein dose-response binding curve shifts to right indicating the low affinity of the agonists to the T164I variant [34]. In addition, pioneering studies by Strader et al in 1989 suggested that Threonine to Isoleucine substitution in β2AR significantly decreases spontaneous toggling to the activated state and reduces agonist stabilized activation resulting in declined capacity of the receptor to interact with β2 agonists [35]. 	0.00972450340854373	2.9393344489065777e-08	0.9902754671981118

On the basis of single gene analyses of alcoholism, we conducted pathway analysis that revealed that the alcoholism pathway is associated with DRD2, GRIN2B, and NTRK2 and the cocaine addiction pathway is associated with DRD2 and GRIN2B. DRD2 is involved in behavior rewarding and its dysfunction leads to aberrant substance-seeking behavior17. Our identified TaqI B (rs1079597) polymorphism on DRD2 had a higher allele frequency of B1 (i.e., minor allele a in this study) in a Caucasian severe alcoholic group than in nonalcoholic and less severe alcoholic groups37. GRIN2B is a glutamate-gated ion channel38 involved in memory and learning, and mutations in GRIN2B result in a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype with mental retardation39. 	2.2026421079319024e-08	8.409122223550144e-13	0.999999977972738

PMC4936837	rs2279343	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Use	In this context, our hypothesis generated in this study is that patients carrying CYP2B6rs2279343 (heterozygous or mutant homonozygous genotypes) have a predicted rapid metabolic phenotype; consequently, maintaining an increased CPA activation to 4-OH-CPA, while patients with the wild-genotype will have a higher ratio of CPA to 4-OH-CPA in plasma. 	Thus, carriers of at least one mutant allele CYP2B6rs2279343 have a higher success rate for RMS therapy with CPA. 	In summary, our results provide a picture of the role of CYP2B6 polymorphisms in RMS. Our data suggests that pretreatment evaluation of CYP2B6rs2279343 may explain some inter-individual differences in treatment response. 	0.11316444234491484	9.656952106238073e-05	0.8867389881340227

PMC5179106	rs75932628	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Background	Most AD patients have sporadic late-onset disease, and are free from rare mutations in known causal AD genes (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) [3]. 	Sporadic AD is associated with multiple genetic variations of small effect (e.g., most GWAS loci) or moderate effect (e.g., APOE-ε4 [17] and TREM2 rs75932628 T-allele [18, 19]), and could be influenced by other risk factors (e.g., head trauma [20], diabetes [21] and aging [22]). 	The complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors lead to alterations in proteins, metabolites and epigenetic modifications in the brain tissue and/or body fluids of AD patients. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning. 	0.9999580867803624	1.9173288914058333e-13	4.1913219445733005e-05

Among these polymorphisms, the most commonly studied is the MspI polymorphism (2A, m1, T3801C, or rs4646903), which is located in the 3′’ noncoding region of the CYP1A1 gene. 	Another commonly studied polymorphism is Ile462Val (2C, m2, or rs1048943), which gives rise to an amino acid transition in exon 7. The underlying biochemical hypothesis explaining the effect of the 2 variants is that both of them may influence mRNA expression or mRNA stability of the gene, resulting in a highly inducible activity of the enzyme.[8,9] 	0.4703158610359305	1.6370750849987226e-06	0.5296825018889845

Second-generation tracers radiolabeled with 18-F, which has a longer half-life, have made this technique available for nuclear imaging centers without cyclotron, although their use is complicated by the existence of a polymorphism (rs6971) in humans that occurs in 30% of the European population. 	Therefore, genotyping of study subjects at this locus is essential to allow interpretation of TSPO PET studies, by stratifying between genetic groups and exclusion of low-affinity subjects. As a meta-analysis is lacking for this specific research domain, the results of the existing studies are summarized in Table 2. 	0.1196034262588714	2.9876789298428455e-06	0.8803935860621988

The common occurrence of ε1369delG and εR311Q, and their strict association with the respective CHRNE SNP haplotypes (rs1053754-rs8834-rs7774-rs9914357: T A T G and G A G C) strongly suggests a founder for each of these mutations originating in North Western Europe, possibly in Holland. 	Most CMS with severe endplate AChR deficiency result from recessive mutations in AChR ε-subunit gene, or the gene encoding rapsyn. The mutations in the ε-subunit are found along the length of the gene, and result in frameshifts or nonsense codons that truncate the subunit polypeptide chain, or loss of residues essential for AChR assembly or function. 	0.9710189293078234	1.275646228834386e-06	0.028979795045947818

Recent GWAS of SUA [9, 10] identified several genes including GLUT9/SLC2A9 and ABCG2/BCRP, which have been revealed to have associations with urate disorders such as renal hypouricemia [11, 12] and gout [13, 14]. Recent reports also show the significance of transporter genes such as ABCG2 [15, 16], NPT1/SLC17A1 [17], MCT9/SLC16A9 [18], and OAT4/SLC22A11 [19], for the pathogenesis of gout. LRP2 was first reported to have the association with SUA in the GWAS by Kamatani et al. [1]. 	0.7487975794512499	8.857099257920642e-07	0.25120153483882446
PMC3953547	rs2229268	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	LRP2 is originally found as a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family and has been suggested to mediate endocytosis of LDL. 	Indeed, Mii et al. [2] reported that one variant of LRP2, rs2229268, has an association with serum LDL levels in humans, indicating the direct association between LRP2 and LDL. 	Since dyslipidemia is known as a risk to increase the insulin resistance, rs2229268 seems to have an association with SUA variation. Otherwise, LRP2 could be associated with SUA variation through the endocytosis of urate-binding proteins. 	0.9995750007127134	1.3272495559230692e-11	0.00042499927401421476

Interestingly, a significant overrepresentation of the QQ genotype and the Q allele was observed in the hospitalized patients compared with controls (OR = 3.275, 95% CI: 1.221–8.705; p = 0.019 and OR = 1.586, 95% CI: 1.027–2.449; p = 0.037 respectively).

This finding is further underlined by the association of this SNP with neuroticism, a well-established risk factor of depression, while the fact that neuroticism only partially mediated the association between rs1106634 and depression indicates a differential involvement of rs1106634 in these two phenomena. 	Our results also show that the effect of rs1106634 on lifetime risk of depression may be due to the association of the A allele with hippocampal dysfunction, thought to play a central role in the development of depression. We must also mention that while rs1106634 was implicated in several GWAS-s in psychiatric patients, it was not among the 15 genetic loci identified in major depression in a most recent study using an extremely large cohort with less intensive phenotyping approach using self-reported lifetime depression,10 the same phenotype as used in our study. 	0.4236236147139816	2.1306694628789453e-10	0.5763763850729514

The location of this SNP (5q31.1), marked by a strong recombination hotspot, is far away from any annotated genes, and the nearest gene is follistatin-like 4 (FSTL4) (>70 kb away) (Figure 1).

Host genetic factors can alter the risk of acquiring C. difficile: a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin-8 gene increases susceptibility to C. difficile colitis3, and we have previously shown that a non-synonymous SNP, rs1137101, on the extra cellular domain of leptin receptor (LEPR) increases the risk of C. difficile diagnosis4. 	We found that individuals homozygous for the derived allele G, which encodes for Arginine (R) at position 223 (RR genotype) were at a higher risk of being diagnosed with CDI (odds ratio 3.03), as compared to individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for the ancestral allele A, which encodes for Glutamine (Q, QQ or QR genotype) at the same position4. Q223R is a common SNP in humans with a mean allelic frequency of ∼50% in European-Americans and 40-60% in African-Americans (http://hgdp.uchicago.edu). 	0.29209434749533764	2.5640962956010944e-10	0.7079056522482526

We hypothesise that the risk allele at rs3791679 might lead to the overexpression of EFEMP1 in synovium and may contribute to increased tethering and impaired gliding of the median nerve, thus predisposing it to shear stress and subsequent fibrosis. 	Interestingly, miR-338-5p has recently been shown to inhibit the synthesis of EFEMP1 by directly binding to the EFEMP1 mRNA 3′-UTR region in glioblastoma-derived cells66, illustrating the potential of this pathway as a modifiable therapeutic target. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) plays a critical role in the regulation of extracellular matrix gene expression67, and several previous studies have reported the role played by TGF-β and the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway in the development of SSCT fibrosis in CTS68,69, including the finding that the inhibition of TGF-β1 in SSCT fibroblasts from CTS patients resulted in the down-regulation of several fibrosis-related genes and the inhibition of Smad activity68. 	0.032417559226716505	5.519564928756858e-09	0.9675824352537187

We further substantiate this through functional studies showing that the MS risk allele directs expression of a novel, soluble form of TNFR1 that can block TNF. Importantly, TNF blocking drugs can promote onset or exacerbation of MS9-11, but they have proven highly efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is no association with rs1800693. 	6.152349276655915e-05	1.1524336419107775e-10	0.99993847639199

In the present study, we performed an extensive screening of the HLA class I and II genes to investigate possible associations of HLA alleles in the total, the EBV+, and the EBV− cHL (sub)populations. Furthermore, we intended to establish whether specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions in the HLA genes that might be shared by multiple HLA alleles are responsible for the observed genetic associations rather than specific HLA alleles. 	0.9947582518563205	1.1865184612729249e-11	0.005241748131814329

Non-synonymous SNP rs141193530 is located in exon 11 of the GRHL3 gene and it introduces P455A amino acid residue substitution in the encoded GRHL3 protein. 	It seems likely that the presence of this SNP may be indeed deleterious for the functioning of the GRHL3 gene, as this polymorphism is associated with two very different diseases: nsCL/P and NMSC ([32] and present study). However, in both these diseases the GRHL3 gene serves a protective role. 	0.9995234004521502	6.12406109222712e-13	0.00047659954723755586

Together with allelic expression imbalance data in mRNA samples, these results reiterate functional changes on PSCA mRNA and protein expression reflected in both gain of T allele and loss of C allele of rs2294008 in bladder tumors compared with normal tissue and during progression through tumor stages. 	The PSCA function and the mechanism of the anti-PSCA antibody remain unclear.

Our study is a unique and detailed investigation of the allele-specific effects of rs2294008 on PSCA mRNA and protein expression in bladder tissue. 	Up to 75% of bladder cancer patients of European descent are estimated to carry the risk rs2294008 CT and TT genotypes. Possibly, if used at early cancer stages (Ta and T1), anti-PSCA immunotherapy might prevent progression to advanced muscle-invasive cancer, a devastating disease that is treated by radical bladder cystectomy together with removal of parts of surrounding organs and lymph nodes to prevent metastasis. 	5.117369731871989e-05	1.6006934141522025e-09	0.9999488247019879

The PDGFRA variants studied here have the characteristics of genetic effects in the second group, since (as judged by the inheritance of copies of the minor A allele of SNPs such as rs6554163; Figure 3) they act to reduce corneal curvature (i.e., steepen it) and to reduce axial eye length. 	As visual function is exquisitely dependent on the careful scaling of the eye’s component parts, observing such pleiotropy is not surprising.

PMC6504661	rs1859168	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Background	The association of HOTTIP SNPs with cancer susceptibility or prognosis has been preliminarily explored. 	For instance, patients with the HOTTIP rs5883064 C allele or rs1859168 A allele have an increased risk of lung cancer [22]. 	In addition, the rs1859168 A>C polymorphism may regulate HOTTIP expression and reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population [23]. To date, however, no investigation has focused on the association between HOTTIP SNPs and CRC. 	0.9999449405392806	2.410991182226937e-08	5.503535080749382e-05

Consequently, five eligible tagSNPs were selected as research targets, including rs3807598, rs17501292, rs2067087, rs17427960, and rs78248039 (Figure 1).

A possible explanation is that the observation regarding disease risk may not be due to the analyzed SNP rs17427960 but another unknown variant in strong LD harbored in HOTTIP or nearby genes [33]. 	In conclusion, HOTTIP rs3807598, rs2067087, and rs17427960 polymorphisms could be predictive biomarkers for CRC susceptibility.

Previous studies have investigated the effect of the interaction between genetic variation and alcohol intake on CRC.

PMC5841830	rs1051730	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	Among smokers however, increasing consumption has been associated with increased body weight. 	To determine whether this contradiction reflects causal processes, Winsløw et al.1 have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) in testing the association of a genetic variant, rs1051730 in CHRNA3, with measures of body weight among 80 342 members of the Copenhagen General Population Study. 	Among smokers, each minor (T) allele carried was associated with an increase of about one cigarette per day, but with a decrease in several measures of body weight, in contrast to the observational results. These results, in line with other recent studies,2–6 suggest that increased tobacco consumption causes reduced body weight, as does smoking itself. 	0.7252579150708641	1.0775690228982833e-05	0.27473130923890693
PMC5841830	rs1051730	Article	RefSNP	False	Use	The question is whether smoking status should be considered as derived from the quantity consumed (one who smokes zero cigarettes per day is a non-smoker, others are smokers, Figure 1 arrow a), or as an exogenous variable whose value constrains the possible consumption (non-smokers must smoke no cigarettes per day, smokers must smoke a positive number, Figure 1 arrow b). 	Under the former, stratifying on smoking status would entail a collider bias, and an association would be seen between genotype and smoking status; but such an association was not observed by Winsløw et al., nor was any association between rs1051730 and known confounders when stratifying on smoking status. 	Thus the data support the view that smoking status is distinct (i.e. has distinct determinants) from tobacco consumption (Figure 1 arrow b). Indeed it seems reasonable that individuals would generally decide whether or not to smoke as a precursor to developing their usual consumption. 	9.619946868400287e-05	2.3090154671249897e-09	0.9999037982223005

PMC3423429	rs3184504	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Preliminary studies in the nervous system indicate that SH2B3, expressed in cortical neurons from embryonic stages, competes with the other family members (SH2B1 and SH2B2) and inhibits the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells reducing the neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons, through binding of its SH2 domain to the NGF receptor and repressing the PI3K pathway [47]. 	Previously, a SNP (rs3184504) in the SH2B3 gene was found associated with multiple sclerosis [48].

PMC3537668	rs11190870	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Use	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most common spinal deformities found in adolescent populations. 	Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population indicated that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11190870, rs625039 and rs11598564, all located near the LBX1 gene, may be associated with AIS susceptibility [1]. 	This study suggests a novel AIS predisposition candidate gene and supports the hypothesis that somatosensory functional disorders could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIS.

Moreover, we obtained DNA samples to analyze associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the OXTR (dogs: −213AG, −94TC, −74CG, rs8679682, children: rs53576, rs1042778, rs2254298) and behavior. 	We found that OXTR genotype was significantly associated with reactions to an aversive social interaction both in dogs and children, confirming the anxiolytic effect of oxytocin in both species. In dogs, the genotypes linked to less fearful behavior were associated also with a higher willingness to follow gaze whereas in children, OXTR gene polymorphisms did not affect gaze following success. 	4.4639934938081516e-07	6.771387407915528e-14	0.9999995536005829

A third SNP, rs1042778 (in exon 4 3′ UTR) has also been linked to the regulation of social interactions, in particular by modulating prosocial behavior (Israel et al., 2009). 	The OXTR SNPs that may account for the variability in the social behavior of dogs are less well known.

We examined two LSAMP SNPs—rs1462845 and rs6788787—using CAD case-only Cox proportional hazards regression for additive genetic effects, censored on time-to-all-cause mortality or last follow-up among Caucasian subjects from the Catheterization Genetics Study (CATHGEN; n = 2,224) and the Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study (IMHC; n = 3,008). 	Only after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, histories of smoking, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension (HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.01–1.22, p = 0.032), rs1462845 conferred significantly increased hazards of all-cause mortality among CAD cases.

We wish to note that the Kaplan-Meier graphs are presented with the same y-axes scales for cases and controls in order to most accurately compare patterns among the survival data.

PMC4871369	rs1462845	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Use	We have observed that variation in one CAD candidate gene—LSAMP—displays differential effects on survival two CAD case-control studies. 	Further, different SNPs within this same gene exert distinct effects on survivorship in established CAD populations; there may be allelic heterogeneity among two LSAMP SNPs: one variant conferred increased (rs1462845) while the other decreased risk for death (rs6788787) in the presence of CAD-diagnosed males with severe burden of coronary disease. 	If not confounded by survival bias, survival-variant genes may lead to improved understanding of the genetic contributions to survivorship in CAD. Identification of risk-factor mediated genetic effects—such as demonstrated here with sex- and disease-severity—may help to explain differential outcomes in patient subsets and may lead to more informed clinical decision-making for CAD patients in the future. 	0.00033064367873090507	2.7994525622117376e-07	0.9996690763760129

In a sample from the PREDIMED trial they observed that a variant (rs3812316) in the MLXIPL gene encoding the carbohydrate response element binding protein and associated with lower serum TG, had cumulative beneficial effects when combined with high adherence to the MED diet [156]. 	Additionally, a dietary pattern was shown to influence the development of CVD also by inducing changes in the individual transcriptomic response of genes involved in cardiovascular risk. In a small subset of subjects from the PREDIMED trial, Castañer and colleagues performed an analysis of multiple genes’ expression profile and observed that MED diet either supplemented with olive oil or mixed nuts induced a variation in the transcriptomic response modulating 12 of the 18 signaling pathways analyzed [157]. 	0.005755933736414087	3.7234796066562714e-10	0.9942440658912378

This domain displays the closest similarity with the snake toxin sequence TFT MALT0070C (UniProt ID: F5CPE6) from the venom gland of Micrurus altirostris (Correa-Netto et al. 2011). 	The TFTs encompass a large family of toxic polypeptides from snake venom; these polypeptides are mainly monomeric and are characterized by the archetypical three β-strand loops constrained by four disulfide bonds, spatially resembling fingers protruding from a core. Despite minor but critical structural variations, TFTs evolved to produce an array of pharmacological activities and targets, such as neurotoxins (α-neurotoxins, β-cardiotoxins, muscarinic toxins, and Ca2+-channel blockers), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cytotoxins (cardiotoxins), platelet aggregation inhibitors, coagulation factor inhibitors, heparin binders, and K+-channel, and integral-receptor ligands (Kini and Doley 2010; Kini 2011; Utkin 2013). 	0.007141656995300432	4.440639984194564e-10	0.9928583425606357

PMC6174280	P56556	Article	UniProt	False	Use	The encoded polypeptide is predicted to harbor 34 alternative amino acids at the C terminus, extending the polypeptide by 17 residues and affecting the tertiary structure of the mature protein and thus possibly resulting in proteolytic degradation. 	It is noteworthy that NDUFA6 has three reported functional isoforms in UniProt: the first (UniProt: P56556) represents the longest isoform with 154 residues (GenBank: NM_002490.4; Ensembl: ENST00000498737.6), the second (UniProt: A0A0C4DGSO) has 128 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000602404.5), and the third (UniProt: R4GN43) has 71 residues (Ensembl: ENST00000470753.1). 	All isoforms occur in frame and use alternative methionine residues for translation initiation (Figure 2C). Until now, no consensus on the clinically relevant transcripts has been reached, but Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data and in-house RNA-seq data19 support ENST00000602404.5 as the predominant isoform, and RNA expression data specifically correlate with the 5′ UTR of ENST00000602404.5 (Figure S2). 	0.003799582964733973	1.9787230737209154e-09	0.9962004150565429
PMC6174280	P56556	Article	UniProt	False	Use	Although the fibroblast cell line from subject 3 also demonstrated normal complex I activity (data not shown), a clear growth defect was demonstrated when glucose-rich culture medium was replaced with galactose-rich (and glucose-free) medium, forcing the cells to be dependent upon oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (Figure S6). 	The existence of the longer NDUFA6 isoform (UniProt: P56556) could explain the normal complex I activity reported for subject 3, whose variant would instead act as a homozygous missense variant in the encoding transcript (c.81G>A [p.Met27Ile]). In silico predictions suggest that the c.81G>A (p.Met27Ile) variant might be tolerated (Align-GVGD = C0, Grantham distance = 10.12, SIFT = 0.070 [tolerated], PolyPhen = 0.702 [possibly damaging], CADD = 34). 	The CADD score discordance is most likely due to the consideration of alternative transcripts in the prediction and is therefore exacerbated by the pathogenicity associated with the initiation methionine in the alternative transcript. Attempts to assess whether an alternative methionine was selected for translation initiation in vivo have been unsuccessful; analysis of tryptic fragments of subject proteins produced during complexome profiling was uninformative, and commercially available antibodies have failed to conjugate successfully with the target protein in subject and control tissues (data not shown). 	0.1815180908410388	7.215995595190283e-11	0.8184819090868014

PMC5963842	P63162	Introduction	UniProt	False	Background	Of particular interest in the context of SMA pathology is SNRPN (this protein is also known as SmN, denoted with a lowercase ‘m’), which is expressed in neural tissues (Schmauss et al., 1992) and can replace SNRPB in the heptameric Sm protein ring (Huntriss et al., 1993). 	The human SNRPN protein differs from SNRPB′ by 17 amino acids (UniProt identifiers P63162 and P14678, respectively), and little is known about its behaviour other than its incorporation into snRNPs, although the SNRPN gene locus is within the paternally imprinted region of the genome critical in Prader–Willi syndrome (Özçelik et al., 1992). 	There is growing appreciation that some Sm proteins may ‘moonlight’ in functions beyond their presence in splicing snRNPs. In addition to the role of SNRPB in cytoplasmic trafficking vesicles in human cells, in Drosophila the homologues of SNRPB and SNRPD3 are implicated in mRNA localisation (Gonsalvez et al., 2010) and SNRPD1 has a role in micro (mi)RNA biogenesis (Xiong et al., 2015). 	0.9972852945391902	1.7696280750892258e-12	0.002714705459040325

Several proteins were identified in the SNRPN interactome but not the SNRPB interactome, such as nuclear receptor co-activator 6 interacting protein (UniProt Q96RS0), and 7SK snRNA methylphosphate capping enzyme (UniProt Q7L2J0), both of which are associated with snRNA capping (Hausmann et al., 2008; Jeronimo et al., 2007). 	Additionally, RNA-binding protein 40 (UniProt Q96LT9) was uniquely identified within the SNRPN interactome, and is involved in the minor spliceosome (Benecke et al., 2005).

Induction of EAU and anti-CD28 treatment B10.RIII mice (n = 5–10/group), male and female at 4 to 6 weeks-old, were immunized subcutaneously at the flanks with 50 μg/animal of 161–180 IRBP peptide emulsified in 200μL of complete Freund’s adjuvant (v/v) [8]. 	0.02939395963107155	5.371893748983848e-07	0.9706055031795536

PMC6458243	P20432	Discussion	UniProt	False	Use	In order to improve the credibility of data sets, the integration of multi-omic approaches has been applied in many fields (Dittmer et al., 2012). 	Based on the differential expression of target proteins/genes, we found four common up-regulated proteins/genes, i.e., GST (P20432), larval serum protein (Q24388), FKBP12 (P48375), and FoxO (B4G4S8). 	FKBP12 (Figure 4A) inhibits the activity of the TOR protein (Somarelli and Herrera, 2007). TOR is an atypical serine/threonine kinase in the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and a major regulator of growth in eukaryotes (Zoncu et al., 2010). 	0.15696247741729097	1.8068356833782297e-07	0.8430373418991407
PMC6458243	Q9VFE4	Discussion	UniProt	False	Use	In Aedes albopictus, FoxO may be involved with increasing the transcript levels of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, as observed in early diapause females (Poelchau et al., 2011). 	In addition, we identified six common down-regulated proteins/genes comprising 40S ribosomal protein (Q9VFE4), JHAMT (Q9VJK8), YP1 (P06607), YP2 (P02843), YP3 (P02844), and NADH (Q9V4E0) (Supplementary Table S2). 	JHAMT (Figure 4C) is the ultimate enzyme in the JH biosynthetic pathway, and it is considered to be critical for regulating JH synthesis (Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003). JH regulates many physiological processes in insects, such as diapause (Denlinger and Tanaka, 1989). 	0.0019902701601544723	9.966775877787585e-11	0.9980097297401778
PMC6350856	B2IV87	Methods	UniProt	False	Use	To confirm the presence of diazotrophic microorganisms in the sub-community co-cultures, we searched for the NifH protein sequence, an enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation and relevant in symbiotic relationships (Warshan et al 2018). 	We used the NifH protein from N.punctiforme PCC 73102 (B2IV87), Bradyrhizobium japonicum OX = 375 (I4DDG5), and Mesorhizobium japonicum LMG 29417 (Q98AP7) from the NCBI databases (July 2018), as query sequences to perform standard protein BLAST searches with the default parameters. 		1.7879009793356515e-06	2.3724584101297357e-08	0.9999981883744367
PMC4443022	P14867	Methods	UniProt	False	Use	The 2.97 Å crystal structure of the GABA β3 homopentamer (Miller and Aricescu, 2014) was used as basis for homology modeling. 	We carried out a sequence alignment of the α1 sequence (Uniprot entry P14867, The UniProt Consortium, 2013) and the β3 subunit sequences from the crystal structure with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004; default settings). 	The resulting alignment showed 35.3% sequence identity and 61.9% sequence similarity and is included in the Supplementary Material. As we know from GPCR modeling, an identity >35% is a good basis for homology modeling of transmembrane proteins (Wolf et al., 2008; Kufareva et al., 2011). 	7.630579167257274e-09	8.385248383967908e-10	0.999999991530896
