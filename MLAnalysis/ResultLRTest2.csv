Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs. 	0.00011744958985887273	3.3164577384949973e-06	0.9998792339524027

The lactococcal Pip protein, first described in L. lactis C2 (GenBank accession number L14679), is a 901 aa membrane-spanning protein encoded by a 2706-bp gene (Geller et al., 1993) with homologues in most Gram-positive bacteria (Mooney et al., 2006); notably Bacillus subtilis orthologue yueB (São-José et al., 2004, 2006). 	It has been reported that inactivation of pip virtually eliminates infection by C2virus in lactococci without any apparent effect on the host (Garbutt et al., 1997; Kraus & Geller, 1998).

PMC5346417	KFX50394	Article	ENA	False	Background	This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. 	It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). 	The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure. 	0.9990162379252877	1.6152088880276858e-06	0.0009821468658243655
PMC5393452	AY129241	Article	ENA	False	Background	When mapped onto the medaka genome, 22 of these sex-specific RAD-tags were found to be on the Y chromosome (LG1) and 30 on unordered scaffolds, probably due to an incomplete assembly of the medaka Y chromosome. 	Among these sex-specific RAD-tag sequences, nine mapped to the Y non-recombinant sex-specific region (Gen-Bank ID: AP006153) including two sequences that were less than 1 kb downstream of the 5′ end of the dmrt1bY medaka sex-determining gene (GenBank ID: AY129241) [10]. 	These results clearly demonstrate that the RAD-Sex approach is highly efficient because it enabled the identification of sex-specific sequences located very close to the previously known SD gene even in a GWAS that does not allow a simultaneous genetic mapping of the RAD-tags. It should be noted, that our analysis, although conducted on a species with a sequenced genome, did not use the genome sequence for the analysis of sex-associated RAD-tags: the genome sequence only provided validation of the proof of principle. 	0.9998379474700556	5.715862609020083e-07	0.0001614809436836483

PMC3794799	M73321	Introduction	ENA	False	Use	Among the thermophilic actinomycetes, Thermobifida fusca is a major degrader of plant cell walls owing to its abundant extracellular cellulases and xylanases [23]. 	In this study, one gene cel6A (GenBank accession No. M73321) encoding an endoglucanase was selected to study the capacity of the novel expression vector we constructed in this paper. 	The reason for selecting endoglucanase Cel6A lies in the potential industrial application because of its thermostability, utility through a broad pH range and high activity [24]. Although an expression vector for production of endoglucanase Cel6A from T. fusca YX in Streptomyces has been reported recently, its maximum expression level was relatively low (about 64 mg/L) [25]. 	9.656309196532743e-05	7.581742584109015e-06	0.9998958551654505

We determined the full-length cDNA sequences of a novel YSK2-type dehydrin CdDHN4 from Tifway (drought-tolerant) and C299 (drought-sensitive) (GenBank accession no. KX243552). 	The objective of this study was to determine the regulation of dehydrin genes in drought conditions. The main steps were as follows: (1) isolating the promoter sequence of CdDHN4 and analyzing its cis-acting elements in bermudagrass; (2) identifying environmental stresses that can activate the CdDHN4 promoter and inducing the CdDHN4 expression; (3) the response of CdDHN4 expression under drought and ABA conditions in Tifway and C299. 	8.897427203615305e-05	4.403946807925563e-05	0.9998669862598846

PMC3145266	ABO15549	Article	ENA	False	Use	This loss is likely due do the complete loss of the GLO gene because BLAST searches cannot identify GLO gene sequences in any of the completely sequenced teleost fish genomes [28]. 	These negative results are likely significant because BLAST searches using a chicken GLO protein sequence (GenBank accession number XP_001234314) as a query readily finds numerous GLO protein sequences, including that of the sturgeon species Acipenser transmontanus (GenBank accession number ABO15549, which is 74% identical to that of chicken) and even that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (GenBank accession number XP_ 002122023, which is 48% identical to that of chicken). 	Given the high degree of conservation of this gene, the fact that GLO orthologues cannot be identified from the currently available teleost genomes is likely the result of the fact that this non-functional gene has mutated beyond recognition or that it has been deleted from teleost genomes altogether. Furthermore, the gene coding for gulonolactonase, the penultimate enzyme in vitamin C synthesis (Fig. 1), is readily identified in BLAST searches using the human protein as a query (GenBank accession number EAL24133) in teleost genomes such as that of the zebra fish Danio rerio (GenBank accession number AAI52248), the salmon Salmo salar (GenBank accession number ACI69713) and the European flounder Platichthys flesus (GenBank accession number ACI69713), among others. 	0.0013309627254986744	8.491677376712254e-06	0.9986605455971246

This variability in peptide catabolism might be the consequence of C. jejuni isolates having variable number of peptidases: GGT, the putative S15 family dipeptidyl-peptidase CJJ81176_1680 or the putative subtilisin-like serine peptidases Cj1365 / CJJ81176_1367 and CJJ81176_1371 occur in a subset of C. jejuni strains (Champion et al., 2005; Hofreuter et al., 2006; Hepworth et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2009; Zautner et al., 2011). 	Only ggt-positive C. jejuni strains can efficiently use the tripeptide glutathione as carbon/energy (Hofreuter et al., 2008) and cysteine source (Vorwerk et al., 2014). A recent study using the BIOLOG phenotype microarray technology suggested that the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 transporter protein Cj0917c, which has homology to the carbon starvation protein A (CstA) of E. coli, is involved in the catabolism of several tri- and dipeptides (Rasmussen et al., 2013). 	0.9994776284494332	7.14872117392371e-08	0.0005223000633550697

The dmsA gene (cju34 / cjj81176_1570) of C. jejuni 81–176 is organized in a gene cluster together with three other gene genes encoding for the iron-sulfur containing DMSO reductase subunit DmsB (CJJ81176_1571), the DMSO reductase anchor subunit DmsC (CJJ81176_1572) and chaperon protein TorD (CJJ81176_1572) that are predicted to participate with DmsA at the electron transfer to DMSO / TMAO or other S- and N-oxides (Hofreuter et al., 2006). 	Several human pathogens harbor nitrate and nitrite respiration systems (Sparacino-Watkins et al., 2014). C. jejuni encodes for the periplasmic located Nap-type nitrate reductase (Cj0780-Cj0785) catalyzing the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (Pittman and Kelly, 2005). Nitrite can subsequently be used as electron acceptor and reduced to ammonia by C. jejuni through the concerted activity of the pentaheme nitrite reductase NrfA (Cj1357c) and the electron donor protein NrfH (Cj1358c) of the tetraheme NapC/NirT cytochrome C family (Pittman et al., 2007). 	0.9992670092138553	3.9790101349555457e-07	0.000732592885131367

PMC4251355	K01803	Results	ENA	False	Use	Absence of length mutation (nucleotide position 473–481) in Malaysian FeLV isolates, as observed in FeLV isolates from Taiwan (FeLV-TW-25 and FeLV-TW-30) and a European isolate (FeLV-GM1), might suggest limited influence of geography in evolutionary patterns of FeLV, unlike its lentiviral counterpart, feline immunodeficiency virus [33, 48]. 	Phylogenetic analysis based on the U3LTR-gag sequence revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates are closely related (Tables 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c)) but when compared with reference isolates, separated into two distinct clusters, with the majority (86.2%) being closely related to FeLV-K01803 isolate from UK. 	The remaining local FeLV isolates (13.8%) clustered with FeLV-GM1 (Figure 2). The reason for the observed similarity between local FeLV isolates and European isolates, but not with Taiwanese isolates, may suggest the lack of geographical influence, this should be explored further. 	0.0003526956885024319	3.838809314234185e-07	0.9996469204305661

Based on the U3LTR-gag sequence, Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly conserved and more closely related to K01803 isolate from UK compared to Taiwanese and other reference isolates. 	Presence of multiple enhancers some of which have been linked with FeLV induced tumours may contribute to the development of poor prognostic outcome in naturally infected Malaysian cats although this needs further investigation. Overall, this is the first molecular study for evidence of FeLV in Malaysia. 	3.9747016210097435e-06	3.531362168382201e-06	0.9999924939362106

Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and clinically relevant retinoids-ATRA and 4-HPR. 	Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs, the critical activators of eIF4E. Degradation of MNKs by VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to 5′ mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation initiation [30]. 	0.002662466498804219	2.3560428540565607e-05	0.9973139730726553

PMC4957768	ECK36980	Introduction	ENA	False	Background	Although their function has yet to be fully elucidated, putative vertebrate-like male hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; as well as steroidogenic androgen- and estrogen-producing enzymes, such as aromatase and 5α-reductase; have been found in the gonads and digestive tract of several invertebrate groups [19–23], particularly mollusks and annelids. 	Moreover, the genes encoding for 5α-reductase have been sequenced in several mollusk species (e.g. Crassostrea gigas (ECK36980), Lottia gigantea (Pid: 194080)), perhaps suggesting that similar mechanisms exist in invertebrates. 	Prior to the commencement of the research presented in this manuscript, the presence of a ‘classical’ androgen receptor (AR) in mollusks had been inferred [24,25], but this has remained an area of controversy [26], since homologues have not been identified despite investigations specifically searching for the gene [27]. Recently, systematic searches of mollusk genomes have failed to identify an androgen receptor [28,29] homolog suggesting that the reported effects of androgens in mollusks must be attributed to a different mechanism, either using different nuclear receptors or potentially through non-genomic membrane-bound receptors. 	0.9996452987368375	6.208226327317384e-05	0.00029261899988939846

With the identified Illumina 1st and 4th leg TRPA transcripts having such low sequence homology (34%) to the I. scapularis TRPA (EEC13968.1), it is questionable if the identified TRPA transcripts are indeed members of the “A” subfamily, and not another TRP subfamily.

However, a recent mitochondrial population study for the bobwhite (n = 53), which also produced a complete scaled quail mitochondrial genome for comparison (GenBank accession KT722338), failed to detect any evidence of historic hybridization (bobwhite ♂ × scaled quail ♀), despite sampling from regions where both species naturally occur (Halley et al. 2015). 	A subset of the nuclear microsatellites presented here may prove useful to facilitate low-cost investigations of management concerns using larger sample sizes, including issues related to population structure, gene flow, and nuclear introgression between the scaled quail and bobwhite. Beyond microsatellite loci, we also predicted genome-wide autosomal sequence variation resulting from biparental inheritance of alternative alleles (heterozygosity) for the scaled quail (v1.0) and the bobwhite (v2.0). 	0.9988200455479398	5.989164767854163e-06	0.001173965287292401

The scaffold removed from the scaled quail assembly was 1287 bp in length, and produced a blastn alignment with 100% identity (across 1287 bp) to the bacterium Dietzia timorensis (strain ID05-A0528) complete genome (accession: CP015961.1), indicating the presence of an unknown bacterium, and produced no meaningful blastn alignments to the chicken or zebra finch genomes (MaSuRCA scaffold ID: jcf7180005140066; File S2).

In the present study, we analyzed public breast cancer expression profiles made using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (NCBI GEO database 20, accession GSE65194) for the expression of alpha subunits of NKA. 	We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05). 	2.5265717248820896e-10	3.536509197321972e-09	0.9999999962108337

As shown in Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 4, after being challenged by 1.0 M sorbitol, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that the VgrR of the WT strain was potentially bound to the promoters of 87 genes (GenBank GEO: GSE120292). 	In the Δprc mutant, VgrR bound the promoters of 105 genes. Only 41 VgrR-regulated genes were shared by the two strains under osmostress (Fig. 7a). prc may regulate VgrR-promoter binding, and, therefore, a prc deletion may cause changes in genome-scale binding events. 	8.316391021131015e-07	5.886525052025583e-08	0.9999991094956474

This ORF contains an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (class II) domain (InterPro ID: IPR004364) suggesting that it may also function to add asparagine to its cognate tRNA. 	Its specificity to parasitic eukaryotes, coupled with its functional importance, high expression level, and the availability of an AsnA crystal structure make the protein a promising potential drug target [55]. Maintaining supplies of glutamine is important for the generation of GSH, a detoxifying molecule required for the prevention of damage by reactive oxygen species [57]. 	2.430979575798198e-05	2.1040497768661268e-10	0.999975689993837

Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9].

Thus, it is of interest that there is a longstanding connection in the literature between RP and polycystic kidney disease (see “266900 renal dysplasia and retinal aplasia” at the online Mendelian inheritance in man website, www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?266900). 	For example, both Senior-Loken and Jeune syndrome, which appear to be separate diseases, are characterized by retinal degeneration and cystic kidneys (Traboulsi et al., 1998). Tg737/IFT88 and other IFT components are likely candidates for causing these hereditary systemic disorders involving RP. 	0.9999911415222581	8.40020405839049e-11	8.858393739894934e-06

The 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of the FMR1 gene harbors a variable-length trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element that, when expanded into the premutation range (55–200 CGG repeats), is known to both up-regulate transcription and inhibit translation (3–10). For larger expansions (> 200 CGG repeats; full mutation range), the promoter region of the gene generally becomes hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced, with loss of FMRP resulting in the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (11,12), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment and the leading known disorder associated with autism. 	0.00753375858944965	3.244417216503089e-08	0.9924662089663783

Of those, OCA2 [MIM 611409], named for an abnormal pigmentation phenotype, oculocutaneous albinism type II (OCA2 [MIM 203200]), is a large gene extending over 300 kb on chromosome 15. OCA2 encodes the protein P, a transmembrane protein, and has been shown to play a role in pigmentation in both humans and mice (Frudakis et al. 2003). 	In humans, it has been implicated in iris, skin, and hair pigmentation (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007).

Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29). 	0.9999969760474029	2.7875418507392478e-11	3.0239247217432928e-06

PMC3884852	1LM0	Article	PDBe	False	Background	CcmE is a heme-binding protein, discovered as an essential System I component as early as the late 1990's [63]. 	CcmE is a monotopic membrane protein, anchored to the membrane via its N-terminal TM segment and exposing its active site to the periplasm; it is the only Ccm component of the heme trafficking and delivery module of System I for which a three-dimensional structure is available ([21] PDB: 1SR3; [64] PDB: 1LM0). 	The 3D structure of the apo-state (without bound heme) consists of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, reminiscent of the classical OB-fold [65] with N- and C-terminal extensions. CcmE can be considered a “heme chaperone,” as it protects the cell from a potentially dangerous compound by sequestering free heme in the periplasm [66]; it is thought to act as an intermediate in the heme delivery pathway of Cytc maturation. 	0.999997250129972	5.1440474621558034e-12	2.7498648838676683e-06

The 3D structure of the TRX-like domain of CcmG from different bacteria has been solved by X-ray crystallography (E. coli: PDB 1Z5Y [85]; PDB 2B1 K [86]; B. japonicum: PDB 1KNG [87]; P. aeruginosa: PDB 3KH7, 3KH9 [22]) and is generally well conserved, as proved by the low RMSD (0.8 Å between Pa-CcmG and Ec-CcmG; 1.35 Å between Pa-CcmG and Bj-CcmG). 	Although all these proteins adopt a TRX-like fold and contain the redox-active motif CXXC in the first α-helix, they are inactive in the classic insulin reduction assay [75, 88]; CcmG proteins are therefore considered specific thiol-oxidoreductase, able to recognize and selectively interact only with their upstream and downstream binding partners in the thioreduction process leading to reduced apoCytc. Looking at the 3D structure of the periplasmic domain of the prototypical Pa-CcmG, it is possible to identify the βαβ and ββα structural motifs of the TRX fold linked by a short α-helix and forming a four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three helices; the protein contains an additional N-terminal extension (residues 26–62) and a central insert (residues 102–123). 	0.9995753435275722	3.5870299762962584e-09	0.0004246528853978082

PMC4146382	4BUM	Results	PDBe	False	Background	This resulted in their simple addition to the protein structure model according to a random coiled backbone conformation. 	Recently [30], the crystallographic structure of VDAC2 has been solved for zebra fish (PDB code 4BUM) at high resolution (2.8 Å), showing a very high degree of similarity with both the human and mouse VDAC1 3D structure. 	The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between zebra fish VDAC2 and the mVDAC reference structure used in this work is only 0.98 Å. The zebra fish VDAC2 amino acid sequence has 84% identity and 98% similarity with the human VDAC2, with the main differences located in the external loops. In agreement with the solved 3D structures, the N-terminal fragment crosses the lumen with a helical folding from the residue 6 to 20 in all the isoforms, and is horizontally located close to the lumen center. 	0.9999344474421776	1.4111269583839053e-08	6.553844655259123e-05
PMC4146382	4BUM	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	Thus, the 3D structure of the VDAC2 and VDAC3 isoforms have been predicted on the basis of secondary structure prediction servers [5]. 	It was only during revision of the present work that a crystallographic structure of VDAC2 was published [30] (zebra fish VDAC2; PDB code 4BUM at 2.8 Å resolution) confirming the very high degree of structural similarity with the VDAC1. 	The most striking difference between the three human isoforms is certainly the longer N-terminal fragment of hVDAC2, which has 11 residues more than the other two isoforms (figure 1). The N-terminal fragment of VDAC, comprising the first 25 amino acid residues (36 in the case of hVDAC2), is located inside the channel in the 3D structures, partially closing the wide pore [20]–[22]. 	0.9999987242056144	8.862093882931562e-11	1.2757057645687975e-06
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	False	Background	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17). 	0.9999999886322145	2.310461830281229e-09	9.057323613935386e-09

Similarly, T0470 (PDBid:3DJB) has a correct RDCC of 0.001 Å, since Ser112 is mistakenly numbered as Ser101. Figure 1e plots the frequency distribution of RDCC values of protein structures based on their resolution. 	1.7569815254610145e-05	1.245523395674968e-07	0.9999823056324058

The G88R mutation also results in two additional inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds (Lys104-NZ to Glu29-OE2 and Arg134-NE to Glu29-OE1) in M(NLS-88R)-neutral (see Supplementary Table S3) that make the subunit rotation slightly difficult than similarly face-to-back-oriented wt-M1 neutral structure 1EA3. 	This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles.

In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. 	The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3). 	0.0002918234817979638	1.0384966868890095e-09	0.9997081754797055

When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. 	3.2143043938058668e-06	1.784410220492735e-11	0.999996785677762

(B) Summary showing the consequences of β2m cleavage of the N-terminal hexapeptide that generates ΔN6 as a persistent IT state (PDB code 2XKU). 	Once formed ΔN6 is able to nucleate and elongate its own fibrils and also to cross-seed elongation of its fibrillar seeds with the wild-type protein, leading to the development of long straight amyloid-like fibrils (the image of the fibrils was redrawn from the cryo-EM structure of β2m amyloid fibrils from [139]). Furthermore, ΔN6 can transform the innocuous native state of β2m via bimolecular collision. 	6.454227882525176e-16	2.2766522841134257e-15	0.9999999999999971

In the yeast Pol I crystal structure (Protein Data Bank structure 4C2M, (14)), this patch of amino acids in AC40 contacts the Pol I-specific A34.5 subunit (Figure 5E), suggesting that differences at these conserved positions in NRPA3 and NRPC3 of Arabidopsis (and related species) are good candidates for specifying Pol I- versus Pol III-specific interactions. 	By contrast, amino acid differences in NRPA3 versus NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast Y84 or I63 are less likely to be critical because these positions interact with Rpb12 and AC19 in yeast AC40 (Figure 5F), which are subunits common to Pols I and III in yeast and Arabidopsis (with the caveat that Rpb12 association with Pol I was not confirmed by mass spectrometry in our study). Amino acid differences in NRPA3 and NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast I72, Q93 or R293 are also potential candidates for mediating Pol I versus Pol III-specific interactions, as these positions make polymerase-specific contacts, such as with the A135 catalytic subunit of Pol I (Figure 5G and H). 	0.0005191110075428491	4.311680876386635e-10	0.999480888561289

Similar to a previously deposited but unpublished NMR structure (PDB ID 1UGJ), the CKK3core has a compact, globular structure composed of two N-terminal α-helices, which are connected by a disordered loop (loop1) and pack against a central, five-stranded β-sheet (Supplementary Fig. 3). 	Although CKK shows clear preference for MT minus ends, at high concentrations it can also decorate the whole MT lattice. We reasoned that a high-resolution structure of the lattice-bound CKK domain might shed light on the mechanism of its MT minus-end recognition. 	0.00026345003997952976	2.1401738933862412e-07	0.9997363359426311

To do this, we compared the solution NMR (PDB ID 1UGJ) and our X-ray crystallographic results of free CKK with 2D ssNMR data recorded on [13C,15N] labelled CKK in complex with MTs. 	This allowed us to identify CKK residues that underwent significant chemical-shift/intensity changes on MT binding (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5a-d, labelled red) and those that experienced no significant change (labelled blue). For example, in our EM density, helix-α1 of the CKK domain sits across the β1- and β2-tubulins, while beneath it, loop7 and adjacent regions of the beta barrel wedge in between the β-tubulin subunits (Fig. 3a-c and Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). 	7.6223280260208595e-06	2.3620129509440357e-08	0.9999923540518445

The SCA10 mutation is an unstable expansion of an (ATTCT)n repeat in intron 9 of ATAXIN 10 (ATXN10; NCBI GeneID: 25814; Genomic DNA Accession: NG_016212.1) on chromosome 22q. 	The polymorphic repeat expands up to 4,500 repeats in SCA10 patients [3] (normal range: ≤32 [4]; reduced penetrance range: 280–850 repeats [5]–[7]). All reported SCA10 cases occur in patients from Latin America with oral family histories, and in most cases physical characteristics, of Amerindian ancestry [1], [2], [8]–[13]. 	0.9993784814715633	5.409072957348405e-11	0.0006215184743460365

Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P. 	0.9995481656960091	5.794915822016742e-11	0.00045183424604166585

Considering the well-established relationship between increasing levels of hs-CRP and adverse cardiovascular outcome [20], it may be surprising that the CAD risk allele of rs2075650 was associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in our sample. 	However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies.

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Background	In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. 	None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. Our findings may suggest that the effect of these CAD-loci on CAD development does not act through pathways significantly affecting these commonly used inflammatory biomarkers. 	0.9967086232543427	8.686964723315089e-08	0.0032912898760100165

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 	In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. 	0.9999648329762517	5.418955181746061e-12	3.5167018329264177e-05

Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. 	0.01173085111313166	1.816484940838056e-06	0.9882673324019275

PMC3325407	rs1800407	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Background	Mutations in the gene OCA2 are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 2, but polymorphisms in and around OCA2 have also been associated with normal pigment variation. 	In Europeans, three haplotypes in the region have been shown to be associated with eye pigmentation and a missense SNP (rs1800407) has been associated with green/hazel eyes (Branicki et al. in Ann Hum Genet 73:160–170, 2009). 	In addition, a missense mutation (rs1800414) is a candidate for light skin pigmentation in East Asia (Yuasa et al. in Biochem Genet 45:535–542, 2007; Anno et al. in Int J Biol Sci 4, 2008). We have genotyped 3,432 individuals from 72 populations for 21 SNPs in the OCA2-HERC2 region including those previously associated with eye or skin pigmentation. 	0.9999999959808556	7.28182064044042e-10	3.2909624449082653e-09

Again this result is not completely unexpected since this allele has been associated with lighter skin pigmentation in East Asians, and variants affecting skin pigmentation have previously been shown to be targets of selection (Edwards et al. 2010; Izagirre et al. 2006; Lao et al. 2007; Norton et al. 2007). 	0.01762005954543676	2.5346271201045717e-09	0.982379937919936

This evidence suggests that BEH2 may contain the causal allele for blue eyes or at minimum is the best marker for the region in LD that does contain the causal allele.

Both Eiberg et al. (2008) and Sturm et al.

Eiberg et al. based their conclusion on lower activity when they used their blue-eye associated haplotype in a luciferase assay compared to other haplotypes. Sturm et al. based their conclusion on not finding a better associated SNP of known SNPs in the 5′ region of OCA2 or the 3′ end of HERC2 and that the probability of there being an unknown SNP with a stronger association was unlikely. 	0.9998364465085303	4.723334164415279e-12	0.00016355348674643622

Both PvuII and XbaI can affect ESR1 transcription activity and possibly contribute to the elevated risk of prostate cancer [3], [6], [16], but the exact effects of ESR1 gene mutations on prostate epithelial cells are still debated despite the fact that estrogen is already used in treatming prostate cancer due to its growth-inhibitory effects [17].

Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) recently shown to be a genetic risk factor for CVD (minor allele of rs10757274 on chromosome 9p21) was detected in at least one of these mummies, despite the fact that it was initially believed that this gene modification arose much later in history (Zink et al., 2014). 	Many putative mechanisms have been considered to account for the presence of CVD that far back in human history (Thompson et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2014). In contrast, risk factors most commonly associated with disease in modern populations include modifiable risks—such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, and physical inactivity—and non-modifiable risks—including age, gender, numerous identified SNPs in germ cells, and race (Yusuf et al., 2004; Goldschmidt-Clermont et al., 2012). 	0.9999997445699293	1.0070731230092437e-11	2.554199998929238e-07

In this integrated pharmacogenomic analysis, genotype and concentration–time data from 458 healthy volunteers in 14 completed phase 1 studies were pooled to examine the impact on edoxaban PK parameters of allelic variants of ABCB1 (rs1045642: C3435T) and SLCO1B1 (rs4149056: T521C), which encode for P-gp and OATP1B1. 	Although some pharmacologic inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 increase edoxaban exposure, neither the ABCB1 C3435T nor the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism affected edoxaban PK. A slight elevation in M4 exposure was observed among SLCO1B1 C-allele carriers; however, this elevation is unlikely to be clinically significant as plasma M4 concentrations comprise <10% of total edoxaban levels. 	0.0007077146584577013	1.5584976435457465e-11	0.9992922853259573

Assuming the expected mean ratio was within the range of 95% to 105% with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons among the three rs1045642 variant subgroups, a genotype subgroup of at least 37, 105 and 98 subjects for edoxaban AUCinf, Cmax and C24, respectively, was required in order to have at least 80% power so that the 90% CI for the mean ratio would fall within the range of 80–125%. Using similar criteria, rs4149056 genotype subgroups required a minimum of 26, 75 and 70 subjects for edoxaban AUCinf, Cmax and C24, respectively, while the corresponding PK measures for M4 required 57, 103 and 96 subjects, respectively. 	7.325757126570582e-09	3.85603702199947e-09	0.9999999888182057

PMC6032224	rs7170178	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	In search of the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of AnxA2 on human osteoclast formation [88,89], a novel type I membrane protein was identified as a putative AnxA2 receptor [90]. 	A recent study linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AnxA2 gene (rs7170178) to osteonecrosis in sickle cell patients. 	The SNP frequency of the AnxA2 gene polymorphism was higher in sickle cell osteonecrosis patients than those without osteonecrosis [91]. Interaction of AnxA2 with the AnxA2 receptor also mediates adhesion and activation of the cells responsible for the initiation and maintenance of multiple myeloma [92] and this signal pathway could be used as a therapeutic target. 	0.9999626676450643	1.9349557104731567e-10	3.73321614402187e-05

PMC6060540	rs10900296	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Background	To date, four missense exon 10 RET variants have been implicated in this association, most frequently in codon C620 (mostly C620R and occasionally C620S, and rarely C620W), but also in other areas (e.g., C609, C611, and C618) (6). 	Common variants in the RET promoter (rs10900296; rs10900297), at a SOX10 binding site in intron 1 (rs2435357), and in exon 2 (rs1800858; c.135G>A;p.A45A) have also been associated with Hirschsprung's disease, suggesting that common as well as rare variants might influence the occurrence of Hirschsprung's disease (17). 	It is important to mention that the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in our two patients was excluded based on clinical evaluation. However, the association between MTC and exon 2 p.L56M variant, which in turn is also related with a disease involved in MEN 2 phenotype, underlines the possibility of a pathogenic role of p.L56M variant in MTC. 	0.999067974965802	1.7465158956119462e-07	0.0009318503826084929

Other polymorphism in CYP4A11gene is (T8590C) polymorphism which reduces its catalytic activity (White et al., 2013). 	0.9999996403053338	1.125766529250602e-11	3.5968340840352917e-07

PMC6448008	rs1360780	Article	RefSNP	False	Background	The GR regulating gene, FKBP5, has also been the subject of several studies investigating differential methylation in peripheral tissue. 	Certain polymorphisms of FKBP5 (rs1360780, rs9296158, rs3800373, and rs9470080) interact with ELA to predict MDD and suicide attempts (Roy et al., 2010; Appel et al., 2011). 	One study by Klengel et al. (2012) examined FKBP5 methylation levels in the blood of individuals with a history of ELA and found hypomethylation in intron seven. Another study collected saliva samples from children who had experienced ELA, and assessed them for DNA methylation levels at two CpG sites in intron seven of FKBP5 (Tyrka et al., 2015). 	0.9990897310943776	4.1280744440518855e-08	0.0009102276248778825

Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. 	0.00012666392894992531	3.859997757607365e-11	0.9998733360324501
