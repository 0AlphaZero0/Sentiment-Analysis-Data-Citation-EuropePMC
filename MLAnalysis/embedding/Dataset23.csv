PMC6192618;10.5281/zenodo.1164782;Introduction;DOI;False;Background;LexiRumah is a Cross-Linguistic Linked Database (http://clld.org/), based on the open source Lexibank (http://github.com/clld/lexibank/ [17]) and CLLD [18] software projects originally initiated by Martin Haspelmath at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, and further developed by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena. ;The data of LexiRumah is published under the Open-Access CC-BY-4.0 license and available online under http://model-ling.eu/LexiRumah/, while supporting software (in the shape of the pylexirumah Python package, https://pypi.org/project/pylexirumah/) and the CLDF conform dataset ([19], http://cldf.clld.org) is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1164782. ;LexiRumah is designed as a tool to investigate the linguistic history of the Lesser Sunda Islands and contains the lexicon of 101 varieties from two language families spoken in the region: Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) and Timor-Alor-Pantar. The database contains words for 596 concepts covering both basic and non-basic concepts, including culture-specific notions (e.g. ‘betel nut’), concepts for words that have been reconstructed to proto-Malayo-Polynesian (e.g. ‘canoe’) and concepts known to be highly borrowable (e.g. ‘to worship’) [20]. 
PMC5156332;AAO49840;Introduction;ENA;False;Background;"[Note that in NC_001629.1 (Schouler et al., 1994); bIL67 genes ORF34–35–36 are annotated as gp04–03–02. ";For ease of clarity we will refer to the gene products using their respective ORF gene numbers.] gpl15 (NP_043563) is a minor structural protein, while hypothetical protein gp35 (AAO49840) is proposed to be a host-determinant protein (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). ;gpl15/gp35 show conservation at the N termini and to a lesser degree the C-terminal ends while the middle is variable and likely to be involved in host recognition. It has been shown that recombinant bIL67 isolates which maintained the 5′ and 3′ ends of gene ORF35 but exchanged the middle section for that of phage CHL92 ORF2 acquired the host range of CHL92. 
PMC3509713;EDO31964;Discussion;ENA;False;Background;A genetic exchange from viruses to their metazoan hosts was demonstrated among short proteins [34]. ;However, for a number of sequences the apparent relatedness to metagenomic sequences is clearly spurious (e.g., EDO31964.1, 130 amino acids). ;
PMC5070816;AFW98990;Discussion;ENA;False;Background;A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. ;The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. ;Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67]. 
PMC4107892;AF384860;Article;ENA;False;Background;Additionally, they observed morphological characteristics typical of Sebacinales such as dolipore septa with continuous parenthesomes in specimens of C. chaetosporum. ;The ITS sequence data of E. albescens (type species of the genus Efibulobasidium, AF384860) shows 98.9 % similarity with CBS 154.59 (neotype of C. chaetosporum), suggesting that they are congeneric, and that Chaetospermum (1892) should have preference over Efibulobasidium (1975) (Wells 1975). ;
PMC5156332;AAD20610;Introduction;ENA;False;Background;Adsorption patterns of these hybrid bIL67 isolates were equivalent to those of CHL92 (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). ;Lastly, gpl16 (NP_043564) is a minor structural protein while hypothetical protein gp36 (NP_042309) is possibly a collar protein (AAD20610). ;"In the infection process, lactococcal phages including C2viruses initially recognize carbohydrate receptors to bind to the host cell wall (for recent reviews see Ainsworth et al., 2014; Chapot-Chartier, 2014; Mahony et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2015). More extensive studies have been performed on carbohydrate receptors of the 936 and P335 type phages while studies of C2viruses have focused on a cell membrane protein secondary receptor designated Pip (phage infection protein) (Valyasevi et al., 1991; Monteville et al., 1994).

PMC5219038;CAP08294;Article;ENA;False;Background;An acidic region of this polypeptide, VFYANLDEEHK, shared 100 % coverage and 91–100 % amino acid sequence identity with Hr-like protein subunits from annelids, Scoloplos armiger (Accession no. ;XP_013415662) and H. medicinalis (Accession no. Q674M7), and a brachiopod, Lingula anatina (Accession no. CAP08294). ;The authors compared their polypeptide to myoHr, yet in the absence of a known Hr within the Crustacea, caution and further information are required before categorising this protein as an immune effector. The use of Hr as a defence strategy is not only employed by metazoan hosts. 
PMC3730352;AB065375;Introduction;ENA;False;Background;For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. ;"In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). ";Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010). 
PMC5156332;L14679;Introduction;ENA;False;Background;"For phage c2, binding to carbohydrate receptors is reversible, and interaction with Pip results in irreversible binding followed by phage DNA ejection (Monteville et al., 1994; Geller et al., 1993). ";"The lactococcal Pip protein, first described in L. lactis C2 (GenBank accession number L14679), is a 901 aa membrane-spanning protein encoded by a 2706-bp gene (Geller et al., 1993) with homologues in most Gram-positive bacteria (Mooney et al., 2006); notably Bacillus subtilis orthologue yueB (São-José et al., 2004, 2006). ";"It has been reported that inactivation of pip virtually eliminates infection by C2virus in lactococci without any apparent effect on the host (Garbutt et al., 1997; Kraus & Geller, 1998). Similarly, SPP1 requires YueB to infect B. subtilis, where the interaction has been extensively studied (Plisson et al., 2007; Jakuytė et al., 2012). "
PMC5156332;AAO49840;Results;ENA;False;Background;HHpred analyses of gpl16/gp36 from all phages in this study likewise identified carbohydrate binding domains with top hits to 1GU3 and 1GU1. McGrath et al. (2006) showed that the saccharide binding site of Tuc2009 Bpp A is more similar to 1GU1 in structural comparisons. ;gpl15/gp35 is a minor structural protein proposed to be involved in phage adsorption to the host (NP_043563/ AAO49840) (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). ;As with gpl14/gp34, HHpred analyses of all phages, except M6162, gave a top domain hit to 5E7T (5e7t_B). It has been previously reported that the N termini of gpl15/gp35 are conserved, the C termini less conserved, and the middle region variable and probably responsible for host recognition (Stuer- Lauridsen et al., 2003). 
PMC3027480;DQ328212;Discussion;ENA;False;Background;Our knowledge of North American taxa is very limited. ;Their sequences included in our sample are originating from a large study on the evolution of sequestrate, secotioid and epigeous cortinarioid fungi [8] or were not yet used in any published datasets (AY945302, FJ789604, DQ328212). ;Unfortunately, a morphological comparison is impossible because descriptions and specimens have been unavailable. The synonymy of the above-mentioned species has to be treated with caution. 
PMC4480729;AJ224005;Methods;ENA;False;Background;Retroviral and Lentiviral Vectors ;The EGFP and DsRed-expressing retroviral vectors used are based on pSF91 (GenBank accession no. AJ224005) with the 3′ LTR of spleen focus-forming virus and the leader of the murine embryonic stem cell virus [58, 59]. ;To generate retroviral producers, the Phoenix-gp packaging cell line was transfected with pSF91/eGFP or pSF91/DsRed, and a plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. Culture supernatants containing viral particles were collected at 24-48 h after transfection, passed through 0.22-μm Millex GP filters (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) and stored at –80oC. 
PMC6372515;CP018254;Discussion;ENA;False;Background;The gene encoding the MdfA efflux pump was detected in the 810CP genome, the overexpression of which has been associated with resistance to several antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin (Vila et al., 2007). ;Other important findings by our group include the identification of a 9996-bp resistance island that has recently been described in other A. baumannii strains [e.g., AR0101 (GenBank CP027611.1), 11510 (Graña-Miraglia et al., 2017), AF401 (GenBank NZ_CP018254.1), AbH120-A2 (Merino et al., 2014), and AB030 (Loewen et al., 2014)]. ;"The blaOXA-23 gene has been considered an important resistance biomarker and is located in either the plasmid or chromosome and is highly prevalent (Mugnier et al., 2010; Opazo et al., 2012; Evans and Amyes, 2014; Luo T.L. et al., 2015). MLST analyses have identified several clonal complexes, groupings of unique genotypes that share at least five loci, and these genotypes have diversified and increased their frequency in the population.

PMC5458457;AAH82300;Results;ENA;False;Background;The specificity of the custom‐made antibody was verified using western blot analysis (Fig. 3). ;The theoretical size of the SLC38A10 protein in mouse is 116.3 kDa (AAH82300.1, 1081 amino acids). ;The western blot detected a strong band at approximately 110 kDa, suggesting epitope‐specific binding of the antibody to the SLC38A10 protein. Verification of the anti‐SLC38A10 antibody specificity. 
PMC4941682;AB274813;Conclusion;ENA;False;Background;The type species of Arthroxylaria, A. elegans, is herein placed in Xylaria. ;Although Stadler et al. (2013) connected Geniculisynnema with Nemania, a BLAST search with the ITS sequence of G. termiticola (AB274813), type species of Geniculisynnema, showed top matches with Xylaria species associated with termite nests.. ;These four generic names are now considered synonyms of Xylaria. Given its widespread use, the number of species, and priority, Xylaria is recommended for use. 
PMC4724163;AF188480;Methods;ENA;False;Background;These consensus sequences were used as references in further assemblies, where reads were reiteratively mapped until there was no further contig extension. ;Previously published MaHV-1 genome sequence data [GenBank:AY048539, GenBank:AF188480] was used to aid scaffold construction. ;Medium and high sensitivity default settings with a minimum of 90–95 % overlap identity in Geneious version 6.1.7 were used in these assemblies. Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) using Glimmer3 was restricted to those larger than 240 bp, and ORF annotations were determined by Blastx and Blastn searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases, respectively [38, 39]. 
PMC3027480;EU784360;Results;ENA;False;Background;This cluster corresponds to a moderately supported clade (82%/83% bootstrap support under ML/MP). ;It is a taxonomically rather consistent cluster, containing 27 sequences identified as H. olivaceus except for the GenBank sequences AF325641 (“H. bulliardii”) and EU784360 (“H. citrinus”). ;
PMC5346417;KFX50394;Article;ENA;False;Background;This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. ;It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). ;The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure. 
PMC5393452;AY129241;Article;ENA;False;Background;When mapped onto the medaka genome, 22 of these sex-specific RAD-tags were found to be on the Y chromosome (LG1) and 30 on unordered scaffolds, probably due to an incomplete assembly of the medaka Y chromosome. ;Among these sex-specific RAD-tag sequences, nine mapped to the Y non-recombinant sex-specific region (Gen-Bank ID: AP006153) including two sequences that were less than 1 kb downstream of the 5′ end of the dmrt1bY medaka sex-determining gene (GenBank ID: AY129241) [10]. ;These results clearly demonstrate that the RAD-Sex approach is highly efficient because it enabled the identification of sex-specific sequences located very close to the previously known SD gene even in a GWAS that does not allow a simultaneous genetic mapping of the RAD-tags. It should be noted, that our analysis, although conducted on a species with a sequenced genome, did not use the genome sequence for the analysis of sex-associated RAD-tags: the genome sequence only provided validation of the proof of principle. 
PMC5589870;APG79361;Results;ENA;False;Background;;Bronnoya virus was the most divergent virus found in our study, exhibiting only 28% amino acid identity to the most similar published virus sequence – Hubei orthoptera virus 2 (APG79361.1) – and tentatively positioned between the Phleboviruses and Hantaviruses (Fig. 2, Suppl. ;
PMC3683164;AC235550;Methods;ENA;False;Background;;The methylation profile of the rabbit Oct4 promoter (GenBank: AC235550.2) was determined by bisulfite mutagenesis and sequencing as previously described (Borghol et al., 2008). ;Two regions of the Oct4 promoter were subjected to duplex-nested PCR. Region 1 is situated between positions −307 and +96 (25 CpG), and encompasses Conserved Region 1 (CR1) as defined by Kobolak et al. (Kobolak et al., 2009).

PMC4660618;GO:0000309;Results;Gene Ontology (GO);False;Background;The EC number, which was predicted from comparisons with protein structures that were registered in databases, was 2.7.7.1/18, which is consistent with an adenylyltransferase function of the NMNAT. ;Likewise, the predicted GO terms for the function of the protein are consistent with the functional characteristics that are known for NMNAT proteins: GO:0005524, ATP binding (94% confidence), GO:0004515, nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase activity (94% confidence) and GO:0000309, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase activity (75% confidence). ;TcNMNAT cloning - Taking into account the sequence of theTcCLB.507047.170 gene from the genome of CL Brener Esmeraldo-like, primers for the subsequent PCR amplification were designed.T. cruzi strain CL Brener genomic DNA was used as a template. A single fragment with an approximate size of 870 bp was amplified according to the electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 3). 
PMC3044699;194072;Introduction;OMIM;False;Background;A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. ;Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. ;WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18]. 
PMC4564166;601705;Introduction;OMIM;False;Background;Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). ;A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. ;As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs). Predicted RA Response Elements (RAREs) in the promoter regions of both genes where evaluated to be recognized by RARs, using C57BL/6J (B6) mice, in two developmental stages.

PMC5751318;107730;Discussion;OMIM;False;Background;The molecular defect was identified in the absence of activity of MTTP, a factor critical to lipidation of APOB. ;In familial hypo-beta-lipoproteinemia (FHBL) (OMIM# 107730), a genetic heterogeneous autosomal codominant disorder [21], defects of APOB genes are involved in most cases, leading to the formation of prematurely truncated APOB species. ;However, a number of defects affecting the rate of synthesis or the rate of removal of APOB is also emerging [21]. The second point to bring into discussion is the colocalization of the two proteins (the abnormal fibrinogen and the normal APOB) in the same ER inclusions. 
PMC4682451;193040;Discussion;OMIM;False;Background;The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. ;The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. ;The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

PMC3472925;603937;Introduction;OMIM;False;Background;;Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa 1 gene (RP1, OMIM 603937) are thought to account for approximately 5.5% of adRP cases and only 1% of arRP cases, depending on the type and the position of the mutations [6]. ;To date, more than 50 disease-causing mutations in the RP1 gene have been identified. They are predominantly frameshift or nonsense mutations in individuals with dominant RP, clustered in a region spanning codons 500–1053 in exon 4 [6-24]. 
PMC3472925;268000;Introduction;OMIM;False;Background;;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP, OMIM 268000) represents a clinically heterogeneous group of progressive inherited retinal disorders that primarily affect rod photoreceptor cells, followed by secondary cone photoreceptor cell degeneration [1-3]. ;RP is the most frequent cause of inherited blindness, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide. This disease is initially characterized by night blindness followed by visual field constriction that can ultimately lead to legal blindness at a later stage [4]. 
PMC5766183;4pxg;Discussion;PDBe;False;Background;According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). ;Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). ;We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

PMC3884852;1LM0;Article;PDBe;False;Background;CcmE is a heme-binding protein, discovered as an essential System I component as early as the late 1990's [63]. ;"CcmE is a monotopic membrane protein, anchored to the membrane via its N-terminal TM segment and exposing its active site to the periplasm; it is the only Ccm component of the heme trafficking and delivery module of System I for which a three-dimensional structure is available ([21] PDB: 1SR3; [64] PDB: 1LM0). ";"The 3D structure of the apo-state (without bound heme) consists of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, reminiscent of the classical OB-fold [65] with N- and C-terminal extensions. CcmE can be considered a “heme chaperone,” as it protects the cell from a potentially dangerous compound by sequestering free heme in the periplasm [66]; it is thought to act as an intermediate in the heme delivery pathway of Cytc maturation. "
PMC3884852;3KH9;Article;PDBe;False;Background;CcmG is a membrane-anchored protein, linked to the membrane via an N-terminal TM helix and exposing its soluble TRX-like domain in the periplasm. ;"The 3D structure of the TRX-like domain of CcmG from different bacteria has been solved by X-ray crystallography (E. coli: PDB 1Z5Y [85]; PDB 2B1 K [86]; B. japonicum: PDB 1KNG [87]; P. aeruginosa: PDB 3KH7, 3KH9 [22]) and is generally well conserved, as proved by the low RMSD (0.8 Å between Pa-CcmG and Ec-CcmG; 1.35 Å between Pa-CcmG and Bj-CcmG). ";"Although all these proteins adopt a TRX-like fold and contain the redox-active motif CXXC in the first α-helix, they are inactive in the classic insulin reduction assay [75, 88]; CcmG proteins are therefore considered specific thiol-oxidoreductase, able to recognize and selectively interact only with their upstream and downstream binding partners in the thioreduction process leading to reduced apoCytc. Looking at the 3D structure of the periplasmic domain of the prototypical Pa-CcmG, it is possible to identify the βαβ and ββα structural motifs of the TRX fold linked by a short α-helix and forming a four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three helices; the protein contains an additional N-terminal extension (residues 26–62) and a central insert (residues 102–123).

PMC5346138;2MNA;Results;PDBe;False;Background;Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). ;We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). ;The NMR data suggest that this base-stacking mechanism is conserved between ssDNA and RNA. An in-silico model (Fig. 4f–g), calculated based on the NMR structure of the DNA-bound SsoSSB (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015) (assuming that replacing the ssDNA by RNA does not lead to a major change in the conformation of the nucleotide), provides further strong support for this notion.

Aflibercept, also known as VEGF-trap, is a decoy receptor where two binding domains, the domain 2 (d2) of VEGFR1 and the domain 3 (d3) of VEGFR2 (from N-terminus to C-terminus of primary sequence) are connected to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin (Ig) (Holash et al., 2002). 
PMC3884852;2KCT;Article;PDBe;False;Background;Recently, it was shown that CcmE proteins from the proteobacteria D. desulfuricans and D. vulgaris contain the unusual CXXXY heme-binding motif, where the Cys residue replaces the canonical His binding residue. ;NMR solution structure of D. vulgaris CcmE (PDB: 2KCT) revealed that the proteins adopt the same OB-fold characteristic of the CcmE superfamily. ;Contrary to what reported for the D. desulfuricans CcmE [69], the homologous protein from D. vulgaris binds ferric heme noncovalently through the conserved C127 residue [70]. An additional conserved residue in CcmE proteins is Tyr134, which was shown to provide a coordination bond to the heme iron of holoCcmE [71, 72] once it is released from CcmABCD complex [36], as discussed below.

In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21]. 
PMC4427008;rs7975232;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;In fact, VDR polymorphisms have been identified in various diseases, such as cancer [25] or cancer risk [26], asthma [27], and kidney diseases [28]. ;The best-studied polymorphisms include BsmI (rs1544410), FokI (rs2228570), TaqI (rs731236), and ApaI (rs7975232). ;"However, the results of these still few studies in IBD patients are contradictory (Table 1): for example, no statistical significance compared to controls was found in two studies on IBD patients for BsmI, FokI, TaqI, and ApaI [29, 30] with a borderline significance for heterozygous carriage of the FokI allele [29]. In three Chinese studies on ulcerative colitis (UC) patients [31, 32] and on CD patients, no difference [32] or an association of the Bb genotype of the BsmI variant with UC [31] was reported; whereas no association was found for ApaI, TaqI, and BsmI with CD [33].

PMC5501546;rs2075650;Conclusion;RefSNP;False;Background;In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. ;Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. ;None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. Our findings may suggest that the effect of these CAD-loci on CAD development does not act through pathways significantly affecting these commonly used inflammatory biomarkers. 
PMC6303916;rs2228570;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;It has been reported that the vitamin D interaction with its receptor (VDR) is associated with CRC susceptibility [76]. ;It was observed that the ff (TT) genotype of rs2228570 can be suggested as a risk factor genotype for CRC susceptibility among a group of Iranian CRC patients [77]. ;Moreover, another group also reported that the VDR ApaI genotype “aa” is correlated with higher risk of CRC among a sub population of Iranian patients [78]. Insulin is involved in cell proliferation and has an anti-apoptotic role in the target tissues. 
PMC6303916;rs3135500;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. ;There was a significant correlation between AA genotype of rs3135500 and increased risk of CRC in Iranian population [42]. ;CD86 is expressed by immune cells and is associated with inflammation related malignancies and cancer susceptibility. The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43]. 
PMC6303916;rs12953717;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;It was shown that there was a significant difference between the rs4464148 AG frequency of SMAD7 in the CRC and control groups. ;It was demonstrated that the allele T at rs12953717 of SMAD7 can be introduced as a risk factor of CRC among Iranian patients [24]. ;Canonical Wnt/b-catenin is one of the critical pathways during the tumorigenesis in which the unphosphorylated and activated b-catenin enters into nucleus and activates the LEF/TCF/PYGO2 transcriptional complex [25]. GSK3b, AXIN, and APC are the components of a complex which is responsible for the regulation of b-catenin. 
PMC5591096;rs3765467;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. ;In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. ;The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. 
PMC2928273;rs1799983;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. ;This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. ;Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant results in production of a variant allozyme with reduced enzyme activity [43] resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide production [44]. These observations support our findings of decreased pneumonitis due to decreased inflammatory signaling. 
PMC5501546;rs7310615;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;Other CAD-associated loci have also emerged in GWASs of inflammatory markers. ;A large study from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology) consortium demonstrated a significant association between fibrinogen and variants near LIPA (rs2250644) and SH2B3 (rs7310615) [36]. ;"Although these variants are in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs genotyped in our study (CEU: r2 = 1.00 for both), we did not find evidence of such association. Other GWASs have also demonstrated weak associations between variants at the AB0 locus (rs657152 and rs8176704; CEU: r2 = 0.46 and r2 = 0.02 with rs495828) and IL-6 [34,37], and a Chinese GWAS of C3 found an association with rs11575839 close to HLA-C (CEU: r2 = 0.02 with rs3869109) [38].

PMC4479853;rs1420101;Introduction;RefSNP;False;Background;SNPs associated with childhood asthma could be consistently linked to transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.13 The second asthma GWAS analyzed sequence variants affecting blood eosinophil counts in Icelanders, and the ten most significant SNPs were further studied in 12118 Europeans and 5212 East Asians including Koreans. ;While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. ;In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17 
PMC5346417;rs3754777;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;So, it remains unclear whether the association of BP with STK39 alleles is a false positive one or is population specific. ;The latter is suggested by a study in Northeastern Chinese Han people indicating that the association in the Han is regionally distinct and involve the interplay of several STK39 alleles (rs6749447, rs35929607 and rs3754777) [56]. ;While the influence of STK39 genetic variation on blood pressure is not clear, genetic variation in its phosphorylation target, NCC, is important. Over 100 mutations in the SCL21A3 gene, which encodes for NCC, have been documented in patients with Gitelman syndrome. 
PMC5501546;rs4845625;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;Some previous GWASs have explored the association between CAD-associated risk variants and common inflammatory markers, of which the IL6R locus has been associated with several. ;In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. ;Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response. 
PMC2928273;rs1061622;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. ;For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. ;Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy.

PMC5501546;rs2075650;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;The CAD risk allele (G) has been associated with a range of other phenotypes including reduced longevity [24], reduced BMI [25], increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [22,26], and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [27]. ;Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene. ;The APOE encodes the apolipoprotein E with three different isoforms (ε2, ε3, and ε4 defined by the combination of rs7412 and rs429358. Northwestern European ancestry (CEU): r2 = 0.02 and r2 = 0.20 with rs2075650, respectively), of which the ε4 isoform has long been known to associate with LDL-C, Alzheimer’s disease, and hs-CRP [28,29].

PMC3794799;M73321;Introduction;ENA;False;Use;Among the thermophilic actinomycetes, Thermobifida fusca is a major degrader of plant cell walls owing to its abundant extracellular cellulases and xylanases [23]. ;In this study, one gene cel6A (GenBank accession No. M73321) encoding an endoglucanase was selected to study the capacity of the novel expression vector we constructed in this paper. ;The reason for selecting endoglucanase Cel6A lies in the potential industrial application because of its thermostability, utility through a broad pH range and high activity [24]. Although an expression vector for production of endoglucanase Cel6A from T. fusca YX in Streptomyces has been reported recently, its maximum expression level was relatively low (about 64 mg/L) [25].

PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. ;The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies.

Above a critical concentration, the latter coalesce into a lipid phase that becomes visible in the form of lipid droplets at both light and ultrastructural levels.

PMC3145266;ABO15549;Article;ENA;False;Use;This loss is likely due do the complete loss of the GLO gene because BLAST searches cannot identify GLO gene sequences in any of the completely sequenced teleost fish genomes [28]. ;These negative results are likely significant because BLAST searches using a chicken GLO protein sequence (GenBank accession number XP_001234314) as a query readily finds numerous GLO protein sequences, including that of the sturgeon species Acipenser transmontanus (GenBank accession number ABO15549, which is 74% identical to that of chicken) and even that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (GenBank accession number XP_ 002122023, which is 48% identical to that of chicken). ;Given the high degree of conservation of this gene, the fact that GLO orthologues cannot be identified from the currently available teleost genomes is likely the result of the fact that this non-functional gene has mutated beyond recognition or that it has been deleted from teleost genomes altogether. Furthermore, the gene coding for gulonolactonase, the penultimate enzyme in vitamin C synthesis (Fig. 1), is readily identified in BLAST searches using the human protein as a query (GenBank accession number EAL24133) in teleost genomes such as that of the zebra fish Danio rerio (GenBank accession number AAI52248), the salmon Salmo salar (GenBank accession number ACI69713) and the European flounder Platichthys flesus (GenBank accession number ACI69713), among others.

PMC3943257;JQ690762;Abstract;ENA;False;Use;In this study, a variant of CAV was detected using PCR with CAV-based primers in fecal samples of stray cats. ;The genome of CAV variant was sequenced and the results suggest that it could be a recombinant viral strain from parental CAV strains JQ690762 and AF311900. ;Recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism that contributes to genetic diversification. These findings indicate that CAV variant might have originated from CAV-infected chickens. 
PMC3943257;JQ690762;Introduction;ENA;False;Use;Viral surveillance programs have isolated more than 50 CAV samples from different provinces in China during 2009–2012, and the epidemiological analysis suggested that CAVs were prevalent in China. ;"We also analyzed the characteristic of one strain (GD-1-12), which was isolated in Southern China in 2012; the GD-1-12 isolate's genome at position 183 has a 21 nt deletion (TCCGTACAGGGGGGTACGTCA) in comparison with the genome (accession no. JQ690762) of the CAV isolate from human fecal samples. ";It is unclear if the 21 nt deletion is related to host specificity or pathogenicity [5].

The VP1, VP2, and VP3 genes of the CAV variant showed nucleotide variations of 1–63.1%, 0.5–51.9%, and 0.5–50.5%, respectively, among the 36 relevant sequences from GenBank. 
PMC3943257;KC414026;Results;ENA;False;Use;;The above results suggested that CAV variant (accession no: KC414026) was a potential recombinant isolate between two CAV strains, namely, CAV strain AF311900 as the minor parent and CAV strain JQ690762 as the major parent (Figure 2) with the recombination breakpoints mapping to position 2,100 (beginning breakpoint) and 158 (ending breakpoint). ;The recombination region of CAV variant was located in the partial VP1 coding region, the entire 3′ untranslated region (UTR), and a portion of the 5′UTR (Figure 3). In order to identify if the two breakpoints are precise, we divided the CAV variant genome into two segments: the recombinant region from genomic nucleotide position 2,100-158 and the nonrecombinant region from genomic nucleotide positions 159-2,099.

PMC4178425;CJJ81176;Results;ENA;False;Background;"BIOLOG phenotype microarray analysis suggested that dipeptides like glycyl-glutamine and glycyl-proline enhance the respiratory activity of C. jejuni and can be used as carbon sources though strain specific differences exist (Gripp et al., 2011; Muraoka and Zhang, 2011). ";"This variability in peptide catabolism might be the consequence of C. jejuni isolates having variable number of peptidases: GGT, the putative S15 family dipeptidyl-peptidase CJJ81176_1680 or the putative subtilisin-like serine peptidases Cj1365 / CJJ81176_1367 and CJJ81176_1371 occur in a subset of C. jejuni strains (Champion et al., 2005; Hofreuter et al., 2006; Hepworth et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2009; Zautner et al., 2011). ";Only ggt-positive C. jejuni strains can efficiently use the tripeptide glutathione as carbon/energy (Hofreuter et al., 2008) and cysteine source (Vorwerk et al., 2014). A recent study using the BIOLOG phenotype microarray technology suggested that the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 transporter protein Cj0917c, which has homology to the carbon starvation protein A (CstA) of E. coli, is involved in the catabolism of several tri- and dipeptides (Rasmussen et al., 2013). 
PMC4178425;CJJ81176;Results;ENA;False;Background;This oxidoreductase has 28% protein sequence identity with Cj0264c and may catalyze the reduction of DMSO / TMAO as well. ;The dmsA gene (cju34 / cjj81176_1570) of C. jejuni 81–176 is organized in a gene cluster together with three other gene genes encoding for the iron-sulfur containing DMSO reductase subunit DmsB (CJJ81176_1571), the DMSO reductase anchor subunit DmsC (CJJ81176_1572) and chaperon protein TorD (CJJ81176_1572) that are predicted to participate with DmsA at the electron transfer to DMSO / TMAO or other S- and N-oxides (Hofreuter et al., 2006). ;Several human pathogens harbor nitrate and nitrite respiration systems (Sparacino-Watkins et al., 2014). C. jejuni encodes for the periplasmic located Nap-type nitrate reductase (Cj0780-Cj0785) catalyzing the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (Pittman and Kelly, 2005). Nitrite can subsequently be used as electron acceptor and reduced to ammonia by C. jejuni through the concerted activity of the pentaheme nitrite reductase NrfA (Cj1357c) and the electron donor protein NrfH (Cj1358c) of the tetraheme NapC/NirT cytochrome C family (Pittman et al., 2007).

";All haptophyte genomes also contain an identical complement of five ribosomal proteins (rps3, rps8, rps12, rps14, and rpl16) except for P. antarctica and P. globosa which are missing the rps8 or the rps8 and rps14 genes respectively (Table 1). Most notably, nad7, nad9 and nad11 are consistently missing from all haptophyte and rhodophyte mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date.

PMC4226036;C19847;Results;ENA;False;Use;The chloroplast genome of the phylogenetically distant haptophyte, P. lutheri, is missing 7 genes, and contains an additional 9 genes that are not found in available haptophyte chloroplast genomes (Table 2). ;While gene content is similar among all of the haptophytes analyzed, the freshwater C. tobin actually has the highest sequence identity to the marine uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847. ;This result is not too surprising given recent studies that document the occurrence of multiple, independent freshwater colonizations by haptophytes [20, 35]. 
PMC4226036;C19847;Results;ENA;False;Use;However, C. tobin has only tRNA alanine in inverted repeat A, and tRNA isoleucine in inverted repeat B (Figure 4). ;This pattern is also likely present in the uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847. ;Only a single operon was assembled for this organism, but that operon solely contained tRNA-Ile within the ISR.

The reason for the observed similarity between local FeLV isolates and European isolates, but not with Taiwanese isolates, may suggest the lack of geographical influence, this should be explored further. 
PMC4251355;K01803;Conclusion;ENA;False;Use;This study revealed the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA among naturally infected Malaysian cats. ;Based on the U3LTR-gag sequence, Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly conserved and more closely related to K01803 isolate from UK compared to Taiwanese and other reference isolates. ;Presence of multiple enhancers some of which have been linked with FeLV induced tumours may contribute to the development of poor prognostic outcome in naturally infected Malaysian cats although this needs further investigation. Overall, this is the first molecular study for evidence of FeLV in Malaysia.

PMC4413647;CGP57380;Discussion;ENA;False;Use;In the present study, NRs treatment dramatically reduced the expression of MNK1, MNK2, and peIF4Eser209 without affecting total eIF4E expression. ;Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and clinically relevant retinoids-ATRA and 4-HPR. ;Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs, the critical activators of eIF4E. Degradation of MNKs by VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to 5′ mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation initiation [30].

PMC4957768;ECK36980;Introduction;ENA;False;Background;"Although their function has yet to be fully elucidated, putative vertebrate-like male hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; as well as steroidogenic androgen- and estrogen-producing enzymes, such as aromatase and 5α-reductase; have been found in the gonads and digestive tract of several invertebrate groups [19–23], particularly mollusks and annelids. ";Moreover, the genes encoding for 5α-reductase have been sequenced in several mollusk species (e.g. Crassostrea gigas (ECK36980), Lottia gigantea (Pid: 194080)), perhaps suggesting that similar mechanisms exist in invertebrates. ;Prior to the commencement of the research presented in this manuscript, the presence of a ‘classical’ androgen receptor (AR) in mollusks had been inferred [24,25], but this has remained an area of controversy [26], since homologues have not been identified despite investigations specifically searching for the gene [27]. Recently, systematic searches of mollusk genomes have failed to identify an androgen receptor [28,29] homolog suggesting that the reported effects of androgens in mollusks must be attributed to a different mechanism, either using different nuclear receptors or potentially through non-genomic membrane-bound receptors.

Amino acid differences in NRPA3 and NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast I72, Q93 or R293 are also potential candidates for mediating Pol I versus Pol III-specific interactions, as these positions make polymerase-specific contacts, such as with the A135 catalytic subunit of Pol I (Figure 5G and H).

PMC3689664;rs2234693;Introduction;RefSNP;False;Background;Generally, ESR1 is implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility by stimulating aberrant prostate growth, controlling prostate cell growth and programming prostate cell death [15]. ;Recently, several ESR1 gene polymorphisms have been identified as candidates for prostate cancer susceptibility and among these, ESR1 PvuII (rs2234693 C>T) and XbaI (rs9340799 A>G) polymorphisms were suggested to possess significant associations with the development of prostate cancer. ;Both PvuII and XbaI can affect ESR1 transcription activity and possibly contribute to the elevated risk of prostate cancer [3], [6], [16], but the exact effects of ESR1 gene mutations on prostate epithelial cells are still debated despite the fact that estrogen is already used in treatming prostate cancer due to its growth-inhibitory effects [17].

In addition, we found a significant association with lower stomach tumor formation among gastric cancer patients for three adjacent polymorphisms near the transcriptional start sites of [MMP-1 −422 T/A (P = 0.043, OR = 2.182, CI = 1.03–4.643), MMP-1 −340 T/C (P = 0.075, OR = 1.97, CI = 0.94–4.158) and MMP-1 −320 T/C (P = 0.034, OR = 2.224, CI = 1.064–40731)]. 
PMC3914871;rs1799750;Introduction;RefSNP;False;Use;Although the enhanced expression of MMP-1 was associated with local invasion and poor prognosis in gastric cancer [25], the role of the MMP-1 promoter SNPs and their haplotypes in the development of gastric cancer is currently unknown in any human population. ;In the present study, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study to explore the association of the MMP-1 gene promoter SNPs [−1607 1G/2G (rs1799750) (MMP-1.1), −519A/G (rs1144393) (MMP-1.2), −422T/A (rs475007) (MMP-1.3), −340C/T (rs514921) (MMP-1.4), and −320C/T (rs494379) (MMP-1.5)] and their haplotypes with the risk of gastric cancer development in an eastern Indian population. ;We also explored the relationship between the polymorphisms and the clinicopathological factors among gastric cancer patients. The study demonstrated the putative association of MMP-1.3, MMP-1.4, and MMP-1.5 polymorphisms with the risk of lower stomach tumor formation in gastric cancer. 
PMC3914871;rs1144393;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;The low degree of linkage disequilibrium between the MMP-1 gene polymorphisms likely reflects the presence of recombination hotspots at this genomic locus. ;Three of the five polymorphisms, i.e., MMP-1.2 (rs1144393), MMP-1.3 (rs475007) and MMP-1.4 (rs514921) have been studied in the international HapMap project, and have been shown to be located near a recombination hotspot and thus accounted for low LD [24]. ;We found nearly 16 haplotypes for studied MMP-1 polymorphisms, none of which contribute a major part in the population. In the MMP-1 gene promoter, in which linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms is substantially weaker, to partition the different haplotypes would require the genotyping of four of the five polymorphisms (MMP-1.1 and MMP-1.5 are in complete linkage).

PMC4964384;rs1801278;Results;RefSNP;False;Use;Interestingly, as schematized in Figure 2, rs34130495 (in the SLC22A1 gene) disrupts the consensus sequence recognized by Tcf12, Tfap2a, Tfap2c and Max, and the rs35167514 in the same gene alters a binding site for Max, a master transcriptional regulator. ;The SNP rs1801278 (IRS1 gene) falls within a Pol2a consensus sequence, while the rs3842570 in CAPN10 gene falls within the binding site of Znf263, a negative transcriptional regulator. ;Using a similar approach, we also analyzed whether drug resistance-associated SNPs map to genomic regions hypersensitive to DNAseI digestion, i.e., nucleosome-free transcriptional regulatory regions usually accessible to transcription factors. In line with the previous analysis, the rs34130495 and rs35167514 SNPs in SLC22A1 falls within a strong DNAseI hypersensitive site (DHS), supported by experimental evidence in 80 cell lines. 
PMC4964384;rs3842570;Results;RefSNP;False;Use;Weaker evidence has been also found for rs5030952 in CAPN10 and rs757110 in ABCC8 genes (DHS reported in 23 and 14 cell lines, respectively). ;The rs12208357 in SLC22A1 gene falls in a DHS were reported only in hepatocytes and medulloblastoma, while, for the SNP rs3842570, in chorion cells and pancreatic islets. ;Similar analysis was also carried out on computationally predicted consensus for TFBS (Jaspar and TRANSFAC databases). The rs5219 SNP—which causes the K23E substitution in KCNJ11 gene (Figure S3)—maps to the consensus of the nuclear receptor PPARγ, and it is predicted to alter the binding affinity of this TF, a crucial player in glucose and lipid homeostasis and that is associated with metabolic disorders [19]. 
PMC4964384;rs3792267;Results;RefSNP;False;Use;The new transcript reconstructed from RNA-Seq overlaps an AceView [20] gene model (CAPN10 and GPR35.mAug10-unspliced) and EST BF528146. ;Similarly, the SNP rs3792267—located in the third intron of the same gene—overlaps a new transcribed region—unspliced ESTs (BQ899318, AL703891 and DA094595) from sciatic nerve and cerebellum libraries and a transcript annotated as “retained intron” in Ensembl and GENCODE databases (ENST00000494738). ;Taking advantage of RNA-Seq transcript reconstruction combined with a RT-PCR assay in RT+ (Reverse Transcriptase) and RT-cDNA from HEK293 cell line (Methods), we could confirm that both of the SNPs map to actively transcribed regions, despite being currently annotated as “intronic” SNPs of the CAPN10 gene. Direct Sanger sequencing validated our findings (Figure 3). 
PMC4964384;rs12255372;Results;RefSNP;False;Use;We concluded that rs5030952 should be considered an ”intronic” SNP of this new transcript encompassing CAPN10 and GPR35 loci. ;Similarly, we found that the intronic SNPs associated with TCF7L2 (rs12255372 and rs7903146) map to a transcribed region (data not shown) and overlap two unspliced ESTs (details in the Table S1). ;Finally, taking advantage of our recently published—and still unpublished—RNA-Seq datasets, we investigated whether the presence of these SNPs may correlate to gene expression levels. RNA-Seq datasets of two HEK293 replicates, 22 thyroid [21], 2 MCF7 [22], eight heart biopsies (manuscript in preparation) were analyzed in order to find samples homozygous for the wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous for the alternative alleles. 
PMC4964384;rs5219;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Use;Interestingly, we found that all analyzed SNPs fall within at least one TF binding site or genomic region overlapping a DHS and/or CpG island or a splicing regulatory region, according to public ChIP-Seq data and computational predictions. ;In particular, since few studies investigated the role of polymorphism rs5219 in the KCNJ11 gene in therapeutic response to sulphonylureas [9] or hypoglycemia risk [29], we inferred that this SNP falls in a PPARγ binding site and within a CpG island located in the gene body, possibly linking such variant to altered KCNJ11 expression. ;However, although we could not find any statistically significant association between this SNP and mRNA levels in our RNA-Seq datasets, we cannot definitely exclude such a mechanism. More interestingly, we found that SNPs, until now annotated as “intronic” or “intergenic”, are misannotated. 
PMC4964384;rs3842570;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Use;Indeed, through ab initio transcriptome reconstruction and experimental validations we have shown they map inside mature mRNAs. ;Two intronic CAPN10 SNPs (rs3842570 and rs3792267) belong to actively transcribed (and spliced) CAPN10 transcripts. ;Our findings are in line with the gene predictions of AceView database and with ESTs. Notably, the former SNP (a 1 bp deletion) is located in an intron splicing enhancer region, and its presence is predicted to affect the binding of two different splicing factors.

PMC6032224;rs7170178;Article;RefSNP;False;Background;In search of the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of AnxA2 on human osteoclast formation [88,89], a novel type I membrane protein was identified as a putative AnxA2 receptor [90]. ;A recent study linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AnxA2 gene (rs7170178) to osteonecrosis in sickle cell patients. ;The SNP frequency of the AnxA2 gene polymorphism was higher in sickle cell osteonecrosis patients than those without osteonecrosis [91]. Interaction of AnxA2 with the AnxA2 receptor also mediates adhesion and activation of the cells responsible for the initiation and maintenance of multiple myeloma [92] and this signal pathway could be used as a therapeutic target. 
PMC6060540;rs145633958;Introduction;RefSNP;False;Use;However, the germline RET proto-oncogene variants identified during the past 20 years are localized in specific regions and involve eight exons (exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16) (9). ;"We here report the first two cases of MTC associated with the variant of exon 2 of RET proto-oncogene causing the substitution of Leucine with Methionine at codon 56 (p.L56M; rs145633958), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported in association to MTC. ";In one case, the diagnosis of MEN2A cannot be excluded, considering the concomitant occurrence of pheochromocytoma.

PMC6060540;rs10900296;Discussion;RefSNP;False;Background;To date, four missense exon 10 RET variants have been implicated in this association, most frequently in codon C620 (mostly C620R and occasionally C620S, and rarely C620W), but also in other areas (e.g., C609, C611, and C618) (6). ;"Common variants in the RET promoter (rs10900296; rs10900297), at a SOX10 binding site in intron 1 (rs2435357), and in exon 2 (rs1800858; c.135G>A;p.A45A) have also been associated with Hirschsprung's disease, suggesting that common as well as rare variants might influence the occurrence of Hirschsprung's disease (17). ";It is important to mention that the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in our two patients was excluded based on clinical evaluation. However, the association between MTC and exon 2 p.L56M variant, which in turn is also related with a disease involved in MEN 2 phenotype, underlines the possibility of a pathogenic role of p.L56M variant in MTC.
