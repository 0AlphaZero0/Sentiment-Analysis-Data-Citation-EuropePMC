INTRODUCTION</title><p>Peptides are involved in a wide number of physiologic and biochemical processes, including metabolism, pain, 
reproduction, and the immune response. While many naturally 
occurring peptides are linear compounds, nature also provides us 
with a wide variety of monocyclic and polycyclic peptides and 
proteins of all different shapes and sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among 
them, diketopiperazines (DKP), cyclic dipeptides, are the smallest 
head-to-tail cyclic peptides and form a very attractive family 
because of their many potential uses. In fact, useful biological 
properties have been demonstrated for some of them such as 
antibacterial, fungicidal, herbicidal, antiviral, 
immunosuppressor, and antitumour activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although 
the number of newly isolated naturally occurring DKPs has 
increased during the last few years, the biosynthetic pathways of 
these molecules remain largely unexplored. Generally, DKP 
derivatives seem to be produced by three different ways. The first 
one is nonribosomal pathway and product formation takes place 
under the catalytic control of a large multimodular enzyme 
complex, termed NRP synthetase (NRPS). Molecular characterization 
of NRPS genes has revealed a modular organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in 
which each module within this biosynthetic assembly line is 
responsible for the recognition, activation, and incorporation of 
a certain amino acid into the nascent peptide product. Such 
catalytic unit (module) is composed of functionally specific and 
independent domains, each of them responsible for catalyzing one 
single reaction. Much of the attention in the field of NRPSs is 
attracted by the potential to obtain new peptide products with 
novel biological activities by directed engineering of the 
biosynthetic genes. In fact, the modular organisation of NRPSs 
lends itself to biocombinatorial approaches, such as domain and 
module swapping, as well as fusion and truncation of existing 
catalytic units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].
</p><p>DKP derivatives can be also obtained as a side product in 
the course of nonribosomal synthesis. It is the case 
of the Cyclo (Phe-Pro) formation during the nonribosomal 
synthesis of tyrocidine A and gramicidin S in certain strains of 
<italic>Bacillus brevis</italic>. Tyrocidine A, 
(Phe-Pro-Phe-DPhe-Asn-Gln-Tyr-Val-Orn-Leu-)<sub>cyc</sub>, is 
produced at the onset of the stationary phase of growth of 
<italic>Bacillus brevis</italic> ATCC 8185 strain via a nonribosomal 
pathway and possesses antibiotic activities against several gram 
positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Gramicidin S, a cyclic decapeptide 
consisting of two identical pentapeptides 
(Phe-Pro-Val-Orn-Leu)<sub>2</sub>, is produced via a nonribosomal 
pathway by <italic>Bacillus brevis</italic> ATCC 9999 and presents 
antibacterial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The third DKP biosynthesis way has been
described from <italic>Streptomyces noursei</italic>. However, very little is known about
the DKP derivatives from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species and their biosynthetic
pathways. The only isolated and studied DKP biosynthetic gene cluster from this
bacterium genus is that of albonoursin of the <italic>Streptomyces noursei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].
It has been reported by these authors that the biosynthesis of the albonoursin
diketopiperazine is independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases.</p><p>We have previously reported the isolation from Tunisian soil of a 
new actinomycete strain called <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 
producing divers biological activities, the purification, and the 
structure elucidation of two active molecules from this bacterium 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The first one is the 3-indolethanol and the second 
active molecule is a DKP derivative, the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) 
diketopiperazine. The aim of this work was to detect the 
biosynthetic pathway of this DKP derivative. Our strategy is based 
on gene disruption approach by homologous recombination via a 
suicide vector derived from pSET152 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] containing a 696 bp 
DNA fragment amplified by PCR using the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. 
US24 genomic DNA as a template. The detection of the biosynthetic 
pathway of the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) diketopiperazine (DKP) 
derivative from the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain will 
permit the study and the comprehension of the natural biosynthesis 
of diketopiperazines from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus and 
consequently the production of hybrid DKP molecules having 
interesting biological and pharmacological activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1.

US24 DNA fragment potentially involved in the Cyclo 
(L-Phe, L-Pro) DKP derivative biosynthesis</title><p>Although the biosynthetic pathways of DKP derivatives remain 
largely unexplored, in bacteria and fungi these active molecules 
generally seem to be produced by nonribosomal pathways (NRPS: 
nonribosomal peptide synthetases). In analogy to type-I polyketide 
synthases (PKSs), NRPSs exhibit a modular architecture and a 
module can be further subdivided into different domains, each 
responsible for a certain biochemical reaction. The adenylation 
domain (A-domain) controls the entry of the substrates into the 
peptide as it recognizes and adenylates its cognate substrate. The 
thiolation domain (T-domain) is referred to as peptidyl 
carrier protein (PCP), from where it is condensed with the 
aminoacyl or peptidyl moieties at the neighboring modules. The 
latter reaction is catalyzed by the condensation domain 
(C-domain). These three domains, C, A, and T, constitute a minimal 
elongation module, the basic repetitive unit of multimodular 
NRPSs. Accordingly, the first module of an NRPS complex lacks a 
C-domain, whereas the last module usually contains also a 
termination domain (Te-domain) to release the product. This 
modular architecture offers a real potentiality to construct new 
hybrid peptides with novel biological activities by directed 
engineering of the biosynthetic genes. The aim of this work was to 
detect the biosynthetic pathway of the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) active 
molecule produced by <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24. For that 
purpose, two degenerate oligonucleotides (P1 and P2) were 
prepared, according to the typical <italic>Streptomyces</italic> codon 
usage, based on the amino acid sequences alignment of two 
synthetases 1 of the Tyrocidine A and Gramicidin S, respectively. 
For these two decapeptides, Phe and Pro are the residues number 
one and two, respectively. Three genes (<italic>tycA</italic>, 
<italic>tycB</italic>, and <italic>tycC</italic>) coding for three proteins of 
124, 405, and 724 kDa, respectively, are involved in the 
biosynthesis of the Tyrocidine A. TycA (synthetase 1) comprises 
only one module corresponding to the phenylalanine activase 
(phenylalanine activing domain) and racemase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the 
biosynthesis of the Gramicidin S, three open reading frames 
organised in one transcriptional unit were identified and the 
corresponding genes are called <italic>grsT</italic>, <italic>grsA</italic>, and 
<italic>grsB</italic>. The GrsA (Gramicidin S synthetase 1) is an enzyme 
with a molecular weight of 126.6 kDa which activates and racemize 
the amino acid phenylalanine as the first step in nonribosomal 
biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotic gramicidin S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. 
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of GrsA and TycA revealed 
an extensive degree of homology over 56%. If similar amino 
acids are also considered, the degree of homology increases to 
over 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This amino acid comparison lets us find 
two conserved regions IYTSGTTG and MYRTGDL belonging to the 
adenylation domains of the two synthetases 1 GrsA and TycA. These 
two conserved regions are part of the known highly conserved core 
motifs of the adenylation domains of all known NRPSs. Accordingly, 
two degenerate PCR primers forward P1 and reverse P2 were designed 
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and used in a PCR reaction with the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 genomic DNA as template. A PCR 
product with an expected size of approximately 700 bp was 
obtained. After purification, this DNA fragment was cloned in the 
pGEM-T Easy vector, yielding the pSS1 plasmid. The insert of four 
randomly chosen clones was sequenced. All obtained 
nucleotide sequences are identical and showed a typical 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> GC content (about 76%). This identity 
can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low 
degree of degeneration of the two used primers. Frame analysis of 
the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed 
the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. The 
alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all 
available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST 
program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] showed as expected important aa identities with 
different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% 
and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I 
(PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, 
respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These two adenylation domains 
activate the two amino acids L-threonine and L-aminobutyric of the 
PI produced by <italic>Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</italic>, and the 
three amino acids proline, <italic>N</italic>-methylglycine and

polyethylene glycol transformation and electroporation procedures 
(data not shown). Therefore, we decided to use another approach 
involving intergeneric conjugation from <italic>E coli</italic> into 
<italic>Streptomycetes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As part of this 
approach, we have constructed a conjugative suicide vector derived 
from the integrative conjugative pSET152 vector.  This 
plasmid was chosen because it is successfully transferred from 
<italic>E. coli</italic> ET12567/pUZ8002 into <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. 
US24 strain by intergeneric conjugation, and corresponding 
directed-site specific recombination has been characterised and 
analysed (data not shown). To obtain a nonintegrative form of 
pSET152, the plasmid was partially digested by the restriction 
endonuclease <italic>Hind</italic>III and a resulting 4.8 kb DNA fragment 
was purified, in which, a part of the integrase encoding gene of 
the pSET152 has been deleted. After ligation and transformation of 
<italic>E. coli</italic> cells, recombinant clones were obtained 
harbouring the desired pSET152 suicide derivative vector called 
pSS2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.3"><title>3.3. Integration by homologous recombination</title><p>The 696 bp DNA fragment was purified from pSS1 after its 
digestion by <italic>EcoR</italic>I and then cloned into pSS2 digested by 
the same enzyme giving pSS3. This plasmid can be integrated into 
the chromosome of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain only 
via homologous recombination. After transfer of the pSS3 plasmid 
into the <italic>E. coli</italic> ET12567 (pUZ8002) strain, we have 
realized an intergeneric conjugation between <italic>E. coli</italic> 
ET12567 (pUZ8002/pSS3) and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain. 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 Apr<sup>R</sup> (apramycin 
resistant) exconjugants were obtained with a frequency of 
10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>. This frequency is a thousand times less 
comparing  to the transconjugation efficiency 
(10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) (data not shown) of the native pSET152 which 
integrates into the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 chromosome by 
site-specific recombination between its <italic>attP</italic> and the 
chromosomal <italic>attB</italic> site. This observation lies well with 
the previously reported finding illustrating that integration via 
homologous recombination usually occurs 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3</sup> times 
less frequently than <italic>attB/P</italic>. mediated integration. All 
obtained exconjugants grew well and there are no morphological 
differences comparing to the wild-type strain. Homologous 
integration of pSS3 was verified by Southern hybridisation using 
the 696 bp DNA fragment and the pSS2 as probes 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). When the 696 bp DNA fragment is used as 
probe, <italic>Bam</italic>HI digested chromosomal DNA of the wild-type 
strain <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 hybridized with only one 
6 kb DNA fragment, whereas with the <italic>Bam</italic>HI digested 
chromosomal DNA of one analysed exconjugant, two hybridization 
signals of about 4 and 10 kb were obtained. Using as probe the 
pSS2 plasmid linearized by <italic>Bam</italic>HI, there is single 
<italic>Bam</italic>HI site within the multiple cloning site of this 
vector, one hybridization signal of about 10 kb was obtained for 
the chromosomal DNA of the analysed mutant strain and no signal 
for the wild type. Knowing that the 696 bp amplified DNA fragment 
has no <italic>Bam</italic>HI site, obtained hybridization results are in 
concordance with a homologous recombination of the 696 bp  
DNA fragment via a single crossover into the chromosome of the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2(b)</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec3.4"><title>3.4. The 696 bp amplified DNA fragment required  
for the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) DKP derivative  biosynthesis</title><p>To determine whether the amplified DNA fragment of 
696 bp is really involved in Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) biosynthesis, 
approximately 100 mg of crude extract for each culture, 
obtained after ethyl acetate extraction from 1 L supernatant culture of the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain and of three different 
Apr<sup>R</sup> exconjugant mutants (MI, MII, and MIII), was 
dissolved in 500 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L dichloromethane-methanol 1:1 and 
fractioned with an analytical HPLC column. For the three analysed 
exconjugants, obtained chromatograms are identical and present 
global profiles quite similar to that of the wild type. Six 
fractions were collected separately between 0 and 50 minutes both 
for the wild type and one exconjugant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). F1 to 
F6: (F1 &#x0201c;0&#x02013;13 minutes&#x0201d;; F2 &#x0201c;13&#x02013;21 minutes&#x0201d;; F3 &#x0201c;21&#x02013;26 
minutes&#x0201d;; F4 &#x0201c;26&#x02013;31 minutes&#x0201d;; F5 &#x0201c;31&#x02013;40 minutes,&#x0201d; and F6 
&#x0201c;40&#x02013;50 minutes&#x0201d;). These fractions were concentrated by 
Rotavapor and then tested for their antibacterial activities 
against <italic>M. luteus</italic>. For the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 
strain, an inhibitory activity was detected for the two fractions 
F3 and F5. However, concerning the three exconjugant mutants, only 
the F5 fraction was active and the corresponding diameter of 
inhibition zone was comparable to that of F5 fraction of the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These 
microbiological results strongly suggest the presence of the Cyclo 
(L-Phe, L-Pro) active molecule in the crude extract (fraction F3) 
only for the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 wild-type strain. It 
should be noted that according to our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the 
active molecule Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) was purified from the culture 
supernatant of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain with a 
retention time of 25 minutes using the same HPLC conditions used 
in the present work. This retention time was included in the time 
interval of the fraction F3 (21&#x02013;26 minutes). The biological 
activity observed in the fraction F5 for the four crude extracts 
(that of the wild type and those of the three mutants) is due to 
the 3-indolethanol molecule. In fact, Mehdi-Ben Ameur 
et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have extracted purified and characterized two 
active molecules from the supernatant culture of the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain: the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) 
&#x0201c;M<sup>+</sup> = 244&#x0201d;, and the 3-indolethanol 
&#x0201c;M<sup>+</sup> = 161&#x0201d;. These 
results are in perfect concordance with those obtained by the 
determination of the extracted ion chromatograms (EIC), after 
acetonitrile removing of the four F3 fractions and LC/MS and 
LC/MS/MS studies. Indeed, for the three exconjugant mutants, 
we have obtained identical (EIC) which are completely different to 
that of the wild-type <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24. Only this 
later presents two overlapping important peaks between 4.5 and 5.2 
minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). LC/MS analysis of the different 
products of these two peaks reveals the presence of an ion 
corresponding to [M + H]<sup>+</sup> = 244.8 at 4.7 minutes. 
LC/MS/MS analysis of this ion gives three ion fragments at m/z 
216.8, m/z 119.9, and m/z 70.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). These 
expected fragments have been already obtained in EI/MS analysis 
during our previous works concerning the Cyclo(L-Phe, L-Pro) of 
the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain (data not shown). The 
ion fragments at m/z 120 and m/z 70 correspond to the immonium ion 
of Phe and Pro, respectively. Otherwise, LC/MS and LC/MS/MS 
analysis of the four active F5 fractions showed the presence of an 
ion of [M + H]<sup>+</sup> = 162 at 7 minutes for the wild type as 
well as for the three mutants (MI, MII, and MIII) crude extracts. 
Corresponding ion fragments were identical for all the four F5 
fractions [M + H]<sup>+</sup> = 162 &#x0201c;m/z 118.7 and m/z 118.7&#x0201d;. 
These results are in concordance with those obtained previously 
(data not shown) concerning the active molecule 3-indolethanol: 
&#x0201c;M<sup>+</sup> = 161&#x0201d;.</p><p>Together, all these data (microbiological, chemical, and 
spectroscopic studies) supported the presence of the active 
molecule Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) only in the crude extract of the 
wild-type <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24, and the active molecule 
3-indolethanol in all the four analysed crude extracts (that of 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 and those of MI, MII, and MIII 
exconjugant mutants). Consequently, the amplified DNA fragment of 
696 bp from the genomic DNA <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain 
is proven to be involved in its Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) biosynthetic 
pathway.</p><p>However, to our knowledge for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species, the 
only isolated and studied DKP biosynthetic gene 
cluster from this bacterium genus is that of albonoursin of the 
<italic>Streptomyces noursei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It has been reported by 
these authors that the biosynthesis of the albonoursin 
diketopiperazine is independent of nonribosomal peptide 
synthetases. Contrarily, in our case, the biosynthesis of the DKP 
derivative Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) by the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> US24 
seems to be a nonribosomal pathway. To this level of work, two 
hypotheses can be proposed. The first one is to consider the 
direct production by the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 strain of 
the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) via a nonribosomal pathway. The second 
hypothesis is the obtaining of this active molecule as a side 
product in the course of nonribosomal synthesis of a longer 
peptide by the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24. In fact, the 
Phe-Pro dipeptide can be released from the NRPSs by a 
nonenzyme-catalysed reaction to give the Cyclo (Phe-Pro). This is 
due to the high proportion of cis conformation in the Phe-Pro 
dipeptide, which is induced by N-alkylated amino acids such as 
Pro. Actually, our study is focused on the construction of a 
cosmid library from the genomic DNA of the 
<italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. US24 to identify the complete 
biosynthetic pathway of this DKP derivative.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Tunisian government (Contract
