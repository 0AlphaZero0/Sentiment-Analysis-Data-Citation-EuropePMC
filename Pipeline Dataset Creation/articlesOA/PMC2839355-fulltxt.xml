The mitochondrial genomes of most animal species are maternally inherited, encode the same set of genes, and mutate at rates &#x0223c;10 times higher than nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lightowlers et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baer et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gissi et al. 2008</xref>)&#x02014;these features have made mtDNA a favorite target for numerous phylogenetic studies of closely related species and within-species analyses at the population level. A segment of the <italic>cytochrome oxidase I</italic> mtDNA protein-coding gene was selected by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life to serve as the focal &#x0201c;barcode&#x0201d; DNA region for global species identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Savolainen et al. 2005</xref>). mtDNA mutations also underlie many mitochondrial myopathies in humans and have been associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howell et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wallace 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biskup and Moore 2006</xref>). Large heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions are observed to accumulate to high levels in aging somatic tissue from a variety of animal species from humans to <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holt et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melov et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arai et al. 2003</xref>) and are implicated as potential causative agents in the degenerative aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barazzoni et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei and Lee 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biskup and Moore 2006</xref>). These large deletion events are usually associated with flanking direct repeat sequences. In nematodes, repeat-associated deletions have been attributed to intragenomic recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunt and Hyman 1997</xref>). Electron transport chain dysfunction associated with deletions involving mtDNA protein-coding genes is thought to be a major underlying cause of the degenerative phenotypes associated with aging, mitochondrial myopathies, and other human disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conley et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Between- and within-species variation in the rate and spectrum of mitochondrial genome mutations has the potential to confound evolutionary analyses where the mitochondrial mutation process is presumed to be constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baer et al. 2007</xref>). Furthermore, extensive mtDNA mutational variation in humans has the potential to render some individuals or lineages more susceptible to mitochondrial disease and earlier onset of degenerative aging-related phenotypes than others. Our knowledge on mitochondrial mutational variation has increased over the last decade with the analysis of mtDNA from model organism mutation-accumulation (MA) line experiments. In MA line studies, organisms are bottlenecked to one (for self-fertile species) or two (for obligate outcrossing species) individuals across many generations to allow for the essentially neutral accumulation of mutations over time. Results from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> MA experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag-Liautard et al. 2008</xref>) revealed highly similar per-generation mtDNA mutation rate estimates but different base substitution mutation spectra. Furthermore, between-species mtDNA mutation pattern variation became evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montooth and Rand 2008</xref>) with results from a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> MA experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lynch et al. 2008</xref>) and an analysis of mtDNA mutator mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stewart et al. 2008</xref>). Although these combined studies have provided an important step in understanding between-species mtDNA mutational variation, the model organisms used in these studies are all very distantly related from one another. The extent to which mtDNA mutation processes vary between more closely related species and within species remains enigmatic.</p><p>The mtDNA mutation process is a complicated one in that many mitochondrial genomes are present inside an individual mitochondrion and many mitochondria are present inside an individual cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Upholt and Dawid 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rand 2001</xref>). Thus, a mitochondrial mutation originates on a single mtDNA molecule and then must traverse a complex path of heteroplasmy (condition where more than one nucleotide sequence is present at a given site in the pool of mitochondrial genomes within an individual) to become a fixed difference between species or between individuals within a species. mtDNA heteroplasmy has proven a difficult challenge in a variety of contexts, from diagnosing the conditions under which mitochondrial disorder symptoms are manifested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wong 2007</xref>) to its complicating effects on molecular evolutionary and ecological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">White et al. 2008</xref>). In mammals, mtDNA sequence variants are observed to turn over rapidly between generations despite the high mtDNA copy number in the oocyte, leading to the interpretation that there is a very narrow &#x0201c;mtDNA bottleneck&#x0201d; in the female germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenuth et al. 1996</xref>). The extent to which the mtDNA bottleneck width varies in different species, however, remains unclear.</p><p>Although most naturally occurring gene function&#x02013;disrupting mtDNA deletions that have been studied occur as nonheritable and sporadic somatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chinnery et al. 2004</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> natural populations are known to suffer varying levels of a large, heteroplasmic, and heritable deletion of the <italic>NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5</italic> (<italic>ND5</italic>) protein-coding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>)&#x02014;the deletion is associated with 21-bp direct repeats, one copy in the <italic>ND5</italic> gene itself and the second &#x0223c;880 bp upstream in a pseudogene region named &#x003a8;ND5-2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver (2008)</xref> showed that different <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates harbor varying levels of this &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> boundary deletion, ranging from 0% to &#x0223c;50% of the total mtDNA pool within an individual L1 larval-stage nematode, and that there was a significant negative correlation between isolate-specific <italic>ND5</italic> deletion level and lifetime fecundity, suggesting that the deletion has a negative impact on <italic>C. briggsae</italic> fitness. Furthermore, certain <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates were discovered to have fixed &#x003a8;ND5-2 direct repeat substitutions that result in imperfect matches to the downstream <italic>ND5</italic> repeat and are associated with reduced <italic>ND5</italic> deletion levels. The unusual <italic>ND5</italic> deletion dynamics observed in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> populations suggests that mtDNA mutation processes might differ between this species and its congener <italic>C. elegans</italic> in which no mtDNA pseudogenes or associated deletion events have been observed in mitogenomic analyses of natural isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denver et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterize the mtDNA mutational spectrum of two sets of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines&#x02014;one set derived from natural isolate HK104 from Okayama, Japan, and the second set derived from natural isolate PB800 from Ohio, United States&#x02014;that were previously shown to experience significantly higher per-generation rates of fitness decline and higher rates of mutation at nuclear microsatellite loci as compared with <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Phillips et al. 2009</xref>).

Six of the long PCR primers used were first described in a methods paper for long PCR of parasitic nematode mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al. 2002</xref>). Two <italic>C. briggsae</italic> sequence-specific primers were designed by D.K.H. for this and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>). The primer sequences and product sizes used for long PCRs are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). A total of 13,900 bp was analyzed in each HK104 MA line; 13,894 bp was analyzed in each PB800 MA line. Entire mitochondrial genomes were sequenced with the exception of the &#x0201c;AT&#x0201d; region (prohibitively difficult to sequence) for both sets. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels to ensure amplification success and screen for large heteroplasmic deletion events. Prior to DNA sequencing, all PCR products were purified using solid phase reversible immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elkin et al. 2001</xref>). PCR and internal primers were used in direct sequencing reactions. DNA sequencing was carried out on an ABI3730 capillary sequencer at the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing. All mutations were confirmed on both strands of DNA. MEGA 4.0 was used for DNA sequence alignments and to visually scrutinize chromatogram trace files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tamura et al. 2007</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> MA line mtDNA sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers (GU452324-GU452381).</p></sec><sec><title>Detection and Treatment of Heteroplasmy</title><p>To distinguish between fixed MA line mtDNA changes and those where sequence differences are in a heteroplasmic state (either in progenitor or in MA line), we carefully scrutinized chromatogram data (for base substitution polymorphisms and homopolymer mutations) and the results of PCR amplification on agarose gels (for large deletion events). Large deletions observed in the MA lines were marked as heteroplasmic if there was evidence of the original intact progenitor mtDNA on the agarose gel. We also used primers internal to the deleted regions in PCR reactions to probe for the presence of intact mitochondrial genome copies wherever possible&#x02014;in all cases analyzed, wild-type copies were detected. For the &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> deletion region, a previous analysis of this deletion in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates showed that a simple standard PCR band scoring method for estimating relative levels of deletion-bearing and intact mitochondrial genomes (applied here&#x02014;see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig. S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online) yielded values that were highly comparable with and correlated positively and significantly (Spearman rank correlation = 0.74, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>) with values derived from a more sensitive quantitative PCR approach to estimating deletion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>). For homopolymer loci changes at smaller (6&#x02013;10 bp) runs, mutations were defined as fixed if a clean chromatogram resulted from the sequencing reaction that clearly showed uniform evidence of the homopolymer mutation&#x02014;that is, no &#x0201c;stutter&#x0201d; sequence after the homopolymer in the chromatogram. Homopolymer changes were defined as heteroplasmic if there was strong evidence in the peaks associated with the homopolymer in the chromatogram data, with the presence of stutter sequence after the homopolymer sequence presumably reflecting the presence of other homopolymer length variants in the MA line mitochondrial genome pool. For the two longest homopolymer repeats analyzed here, (A:T)<sub>14</sub> in HK104 and (A:T)<sub>12</sub> in PB800, stutter peaks were present in all data analyzed, though the predominant repeat length present in each MA line and progenitor could be discerned from the data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig.

For heteroplasmic base substitution mutations, we estimated the frequencies of the mutant bases in the total mtDNA pool using the comparative peak height approach applied by a previous analysis of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> MA line mtDNA divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag-Liautard et al. 2008</xref>). We searched for sites within 20 bp of the heteroplasmic base substitution site that were the same nucleotide as the mutant base; likewise, we also searched for nearby sites that were the same nucleotide as the progenitor (wild type) site. The peak heights of those two sites were measured and compared with the corresponding heights of mutant and wild-type peaks present at the heteroplasmy site. We used equation 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag-Liautard et al. (2008)</xref> to then estimate the frequencies of the mutant bases. The correction approach was carried out using data from both strands of DNA in all cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation Rate Calculations</title><p>Mutation rates for large deletion events and at homopolymer loci were calculated with the equation &#x003bc; = <italic>m</italic>/(<italic>LT</italic>), where &#x003bc; is the mutation rate (per nucleotide site per generation), <italic>m</italic> is the number of observed mutations, <italic>L</italic> is the number of MA lines, and <italic>T</italic> is the time in generations, as previously described and applied to <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>). The probability of ultimate fixation of a neutral mutation is its current frequency in the population.

Approximate 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the quantiles approach applied to the standard error estimates. Tests of between-species and between-strain differences in mutational spectra were done by Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test. Although this method will be biased if base composition differs between groups, the slight differences in base composition between species (%A/T = 75.6% in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 75.1% in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>) and the even smaller difference between strains of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (&#x0003c;0.1%) mean that the test is essentially unbiased as applied to our data.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Deposition</title><p>DNA sequences generated for this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers GU452324-GU452381.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Experimental Overview</title><p>To investigate mtDNA mutational variation in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, we sequenced nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from a set of 250-generation <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines: 21 MA lines derived from natural isolate HK104 (Okayama, Japan) and 18 MA lines derived from natural isolate PB800 (Dayton, OH). Results were compared with a previous mtDNA analysis of 214-generation <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 (laboratory strain) MA lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>). In the HK104 MA lines, 13,900 bp of sequence was collected; in the PB800 MA lines, 13,894 bp was collected (entire mitochondrial genomes except the AT region for both sets). Although these two isolates have very different geographic origins, a previous analysis of natural mtDNA variation in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>) showed that they are closely related to one another at the mtDNA level (0.4% pairwise mtDNA sequence divergence). mtDNA was PCR amplified in each MA line (products ranging in size from &#x0223c;2,800 to &#x0223c;4,900 bp) and then directly sequenced using PCR and internal primers (see Materials and Methods)&#x02014;the same strategy employed for a previous analysis of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolate mtDNA variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>). This strategy was also highly similar to the previous analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line mtDNA mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>), though in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> study more overlapping individual PCR products of smaller size (19 amplicons, 821 bp average size) were generated for the analysis. When referring to specific mtDNA nucleotide pair sites in this paper, the coding strand nucleotide is first denoted, followed by a colon and then the nucleotide on the noncoding strand.</p><p>Sequence differences between progenitor and MA line mtDNA were identified in DNA sequence alignments and by evaluating DNA sequence chromatogram data. Heteroplasmy was found to be a significant variable in our analysis, requiring the establishment of careful criteria for subcategorizing different mutation types. mtDNA mutations originating along a specific MA line lineage might still be in a heteroplasmic state at the particular generation analyzed or be a fixed difference (no heteroplasmy). There is also the possibility that preexisting heteroplasmies in the progenitor strain, or their origination in the expansion phase leading up the establishment of MA lines, might differentially segregate in different MA lines. Our approaches to distinguishing fixed-difference mutations from heteroplasmic changes for different mutation types are described in the Materials and Methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Large Deletion Mutations</title><p>We identified large mtDNA deletion mutations in the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines through visual analysis of PCR amplicons on agarose gels and subsequent direct DNA sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons.

Although the two <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural genotypes used as the MA line progenitors showed only 0.4% pairwise sequence divergence across all mtDNA sequences, the MA line progenitors differed dramatically in terms of starting &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> boundary deletion levels: the inbred HK104 progenitor produced a PCR result suggesting high (&#x0223c;30&#x02013;50%) &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> deletion levels, whereas analysis of the inbred PB800 progenitor revealed much lower (&#x0223c;0&#x02013;5%) deletion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>)&#x02014;see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig.

PCR and DNA sequencing analysis of this region in the MA lines (see Materials and Methods) revealed that 16/21 HK104 MA lines continued to harbor high levels of the same specific &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> boundary deletion observed in the HK104 progenitor and other <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates.

The observation that the PB800 MA lines do not accumulate these &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> deletions across 250 generations of bottlenecking is consistent with the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>) that its &#x003a8;ND5-2 direct repeat genotype (imperfect repeat relative to downstream repeat in <italic>ND5</italic>) renders this locus more resistant to repeat-mediated deletion events as compared with &#x003a8;ND5-2 direct repeat sequences that are identical to downstream <italic>ND5</italic> repeats. Although none of the PB800 MA lines were found to harbor the particular &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> boundary deletion observed in the HK104 MA lines and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates, 5/18 PB800 MA lines analyzed accumulated high levels of a nearby direct repeat&#x02013;associated 864-bp deletion entirely within the <italic>ND5</italic> gene boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">fig. 1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

Only smaller (6&#x02013;10 bp) homopolymer loci analyzed for mutation here yielded clean chromatogram data where the presence of predominantly fixed changes (clean sequences data continue after homopolymer) could be discriminated from those still in a heteroplasmic state (stutter sequences clearly present after homopolymer). Although the two largest homopolymer loci analyzed&#x02014;(A:T)<sub>14</sub> in HK104 progenitor and (A:T)<sub>12</sub> in PB800 progenitor (same intergenic mtDNA locus)&#x02014;consistently yielded stutter peaks in all MA line chromatograms, progenitor&#x02013;MA line differences in the size of the predominant homopolymer run length present in the mtDNA pool could be discerned from the data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig.

Four HK104 MA lines were observed to have experienced a shift in the predominant homopolymer run length at the intergenic (A:T)<sub>14</sub> present in the progenitor. Aside from this locus, nine other HK104 mtDNA homopolymer mutations at smaller repeats showed clear signs of heteroplasmy (stutter peaks after repeat); for the remaining four HK104 homopolymer mutations, no evidence of heteroplasmy was detected in either the progenitor or the MA line. In PB800, mutations were detected at four homopolymer loci in the mitochondrial genome, three of which were in protein-coding gene sequence. The large intergenic (A:T)<sub>12</sub> run in the PB800 progenitor was observed to be predominantly (A:T)<sub>11</sub> in 8/18 PB800 MA lines, (A:T)<sub>13</sub> in 3/18 lines, and (A:T)<sub>14</sub> in 1/18 lines. Single&#x02013;base pair length change mutations were observed at each of three smaller homopolymer runs in coding sequence in the PB800 MA lines, two of which showed clear signs of heteroplasmy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>). In the HK104 MA lines, 11/17 homopolymer length changes were single&#x02013;base pair insertions and 6/17 were single&#x02013;base pair deletions. In the PB800 MA lines, 4/12 homopolymer length changes were single&#x02013;base pair insertions, 7/12 were single&#x02013;base pair deletions, and one 2-bp insertion was observed.

Although greater numbers of homopolymer loci changes were detected in the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines relative to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the results are not directly comparable as the largest homopolymer analyzed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was a (A:T)<sub>11</sub>, whereas a (A:T)<sub>14</sub> was available for analysis in the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> HK104 MA lines and a (A:T)<sub>12</sub> was present in the PB800 MA lines.

Thus, inherent size differences in the homopolymers analyzed in the different MA line sets, coupled with uncertainties regarding the heteroplasmy status of many homopolymer changes before and after MA, preclude meaningful quantitative between- and within-species comparative analyses of homopolymer mutation processes here.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Homopolymer Mutations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lines</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Position</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HK104 MA lines</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;254, 261</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">131</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(T:A)<sub>9</sub> &#x02192;

Fourteen of the base substitutions were observed in protein-coding gene sequence, and all but one resulted in a nonsynonymous change (including nonsense mutations), consistent with the expectation of neutral MA and previous observations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> MA line mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag-Liautard et al. 2008</xref>). In the HK104 MA lines, multiple different specific base substitution types were observed, 4/9 were in a heteroplasmic state, all substitutions were at different sites in the mitochondrial genome, and all occurred in different specific MA lines. Thus, each of these nine differences most likely constitutes de novo mutation events. The most prevalent base substitution type in the HK104 MA lines was G:C &#x02192; T:A transversions (3/9). By contrast, 10/10 base substitution polymorphisms observed in the PB800 MA lines were C:G &#x02192; T:A transitions. Furthermore, the 10 PB800 substitution differences were observed across only 5 nucleotide sites. At position 7549, two PB800 MA lines were observed to carry fixed substitutions and two other lines were observed to carry heteroplasmic substitutions. Although no clear evidence of a preexisting T:A heteroplasmic variant was discernable from the PB800 progenitor chromatogram data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig.

Position 10460 in PB800 was a similar case: 3/18 MA lines analyzed had a heteroplasmic T:A at the position, whereas the progenitor and all other PB800 MA lines only showed evidence of the progenitor C:G at that position. One conclusion is that there were five de novo base substitution events in the PB800 MA lines under the conservative assumption that those observed in &#x0003e;1 line resulted from single mutations in the MA line expansion phase. The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that positions 7549 and 10460 are mutational hot spots.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Base Substitution Mutations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lines</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Position</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Frequency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HK104 MA lines</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;206</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">834</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T:A &#x02192;

First, for the PB800 MA lines, we are unable to pinpoint the precise origins of certain base substitution events. For both sets of lines, many mutations were in a heteroplasmic state and detected using direct DNA sequencing alone; thus, we were unable to effectively identify and account for low-frequency variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hancock et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Theves et al. 2006</xref>). Our analyses were also based on bulk DNA prepared from many thousands of nematodes&#x02014;it is possible that there is variation among individual MA line nematodes and/or among somatic cells within an individual nematode for which we are unable to account. &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> Values can be estimated for the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA line mtDNA, with the preceding caveats in mind and under the assumption that all base substitution differences shared by more than one MA line of a common progenitor genotype resulted from a single mutational event in the expansion phase prior to MA line bottlenecking. Under these conditions, we estimate &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> = 1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> (standard error of mean [SEM] = 3.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) for HK104 mtDNA and &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> = 7.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> (SEM = 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) for PB800 mtDNA (see Materials and Methods). These values are very close to the &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> estimate for <italic>C. elegans</italic> mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>), 9.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> (SEM = 2.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). Approximate 95% confidence intervals overlap all three estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), and application of Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test revealed no significant &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.8 for both between- and within-species comparisons). We thus conclude that the rates of base substitution events are likely highly similar between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and between the two <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolate genotypes analyzed.</p><p>Despite the similarities in &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> estimates between species and between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> strains, marked differences were observed among all three sets of MA lines in terms of the spectrum of base substitution types. We tested for significance in the base substitution spectrum, under the same assumptions and caveats applied to the &#x003bc;<sub>bs</sub> analysis and including all heteroplasmic changes, in terms of the numbers of observed nonstrand-specific base substitution types (six categories). We found a significant difference between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (HK104 and PB800 data combined) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.012, Fisher's Exact test), though the difference between the two <italic>C. briggsae</italic> strains was just outside of the conventional cutoff for statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.082, Fisher's Exact test). We thus conclude that the spectrum of mtDNA base substitution types differs between <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species. The spectrum might also vary within <italic>C. briggsae</italic>; a larger scale of mtDNA mutational analysis will be required to effectively address this possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that the mitochondrial mutation process can vary in a variety of ways between animal species of the same genus. Both sets of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines were observed to accumulate large heteroplasmic deletions at &#x0003e;10-fold higher average rates than <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> region is prone to deletions in both the HK104 and the PB800 MA lines, and one deletion type (the &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> boundary deletion) persists in multiple genetically diverse <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates at varying levels in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>). The <italic>ND1</italic>/<italic>ATP6</italic>/<italic>ND2</italic> region, however, was only observed to accumulate large deletions in the PB800 MA lines. A previous analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>) revealed the presence of only one large heteroplasmic deletion out of 74 MA line mitochondrial genomes analyzed at 214 generations; the <italic>C. elegans</italic> deletion involved the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> region rather than the &#x003a8;ND5-2/<italic>ND5</italic> and <italic>ND1</italic>/<italic>ATP6</italic>/<italic>ND2</italic> regions observed here to be deletion hot spots in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. No large heteroplasmic deletions were observed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> MA line mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag-Liautard et al. 2008</xref>). The previous <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line mtDNA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>), however, used an approach whereby 19 small PCR products were used to probe for mutations around the mitochondrial genome rather than 4 large overlapping amplicons as applied here to <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Thus, it is possible that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> large deletion rate is an underestimate because some large deletion events, involving sequences outside the PCR primer boundaries, were missed. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, a very large deletion (416 bp) was detected in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> study and 5/10 large mtDNA deletion types observed here in the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines were smaller than the mean amplicon size in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. (2000)</xref>. These observations, combined with the fact that <italic>C. briggsae</italic> nematodes are known to experience large mtDNA deletions in natural populations (Howe and Denver 2008), suggest that <italic>C. briggsae</italic> mtDNA is inherently more susceptible to large deletion events than is <italic>C. elegans</italic> mtDNA. It is also noteworthy that the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> mitochondrial genomes analyzed here harbor two pseudogene regions (&#x003a8;ND5-1 and &#x003a8;ND5-2) that are not present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe and Denver 2008</xref>). These combined observations suggest that there are differences between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and its congener <italic>C. elegans</italic> in terms of their susceptibilities to large mtDNA insertion events, as well. Although we cannot pinpoint the underlying reasons why <italic>C. briggsae</italic> is much more prone to large mtDNA deletions than <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we speculate that between-species variation in the frequency of intra/intergenomic recombination processes, known to occur in nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunt and Hyman 1997</xref>), might be responsible for both the high deletion rate and the presence of <italic>ND5</italic>-derived mtDNA pseudogenes in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>.</p><p>The pattern of mtDNA base substitution also differed between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA lines. The previous study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line mtDNA mutation processes revealed 16 base substitution events, all of which were in a fixed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denver et al. 2000</xref>). The majority of base substitutions observed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA lines were T:A &#x02192; C:G transitions (8/16), which deviates from patterns observed in both <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA line sets analyzed here, though especially in the PB800 MA lines where C:G &#x02192; T:A transitions were the only type of base substitution observed. Although the small numbers of observed base substitution mutation events specific to a set of MA lines likely preclude a meaningful statistical analysis of within-species variation in mtDNA base substitution mutation processes, the observed pattern of variation between HK104 and PB800 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>) suggests that there might be large differences among different <italic>C. briggsae</italic> natural isolates. Multiple MA line base substitution polymorphisms were observed to be in a heteroplasmic state in both sets of 250-generation <italic>C. briggsae</italic> MA lines, whereas all base substitutions previously identified in 214-generation <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA lines were fixed differences, possibly reflecting a wider mtDNA bottleneck in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> relative to <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Although our analysis approach successfully revealed some aspects of the heteroplasmic nature of the mtDNA mutation process, many features of nematode mtDNA heteroplasmy remain mysterious&#x02014;in particular, the abundance and persistence patterns of low-frequency variants and the linkage relationships between different variants in the population of mitochondrial genomes within an individual. We are optimistic, however, that the application of new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to larger numbers of MA lines will provide an avenue for better understanding the enigma of heteroplasmy and natural variation in mitochondrial mutation processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">Supplementary tables S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">S2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">figures S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">S2</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">S3</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
