In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, high throughput screening is a central function in the drug discovery process <xref rid="pone.0038465-Janzen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To date, this strategy has only recently been applied to experimental radiotherapy <xref rid="pone.0038465-Lally1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038465-Katz1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The most common high-throughput screens are biochemical assays that screen for compounds that interact with an isolated protein on an assay plate <xref rid="pone.0038465-Janzen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In contrast, a cell-based approach provides insight into the permeability profile of active compounds and enables the identification of compounds with unique mechanisms of action <xref rid="pone.0038465-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Charged-coupled device (CCD) camera- based plate imaging systems allow for high throughput quantitation of cellular and subcellular fluorescence in whole cells <xref rid="pone.0038465-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These high content cell based assays allow for screening compounds that impact cellular functions, such as cell cycle, cell motility, apoptosis and DNA repair <xref rid="pone.0038465-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Current disadvantages of this approach include limited throughput related to incompatibility of some steps of a complex screening procedure with full automation, the relatively high cost of reagents and data-management issues. Despite these technical hurdles, there is significant interest in applying high content screening to primary drug screening <xref rid="pone.0038465-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Exposure to IR and many chemotherapy agents, including DNA synthesis inhibitors, DNA alkylators and topoisomerase I inhibitors, result in DNA double strand breaks (DSB) <xref rid="pone.0038465-Kao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038465-Banath1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038465-Furuta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A single unrepaired DSB may result in cell death demonstrating the critically important role of DNA damage repair in maintaining genomic integrity <xref rid="pone.0038465-Shiloh1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. An emerging concept is that the physiological target of IR is not DNA alone but rather DNA in the three-dimensional context of chromatin within a complex and highly regulated protein-DNA structure <xref rid="pone.0038465-Kao2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. ATM and related kinases phosphorylate Serine 139 on H2AX to form foci of &#x003b3;-H2AX immunoreactivity at DNA DSB sites that can be visualized by light microscopy <xref rid="pone.0038465-Burma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038465-Rogakou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Downstream signal transduction pathways may result in DNA damage repair (homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining), cell cycle arrest or apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0038465-Stucki1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. &#x003b3;-H2AX interacts with NuA4, INO80 and SWRC, proteins that play a key role in chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation. The cohesion complex, which joins sister chromatin allowing for efficient homologous recombination repair of DSB appear to localize to sites of DSB via interaction with the INO80 complex <xref rid="pone.0038465-Unal1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038465-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Based on these data, we performed a proof-of-concept screen to identify agents that increased persistence of &#x003b3;-H2AX at 4 hours after drug treatment and ionizing radiation by inhibiting DNA damage repair.

In this report, we demonstrated that both MS0019266 and MS0017509 have physiologically significant effects on DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Although we hypothesize that the radiosensitizing effects of MS0019266 and MS0017509 is due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase resulting in impaired DNA double strand break repair, an indirect effect related to redistribution of cells within the cell cycle cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Since MS0019266 was slightly more effective at inducing apoptosis and cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells than MS0017509, we further investigated its effect on gene expression.

However, in addition to reducing ribonucleotide reductase activity, MS0019266 significantly reduced expression of several genes related to cell cycle arrest and mitosis, including polo-like kinase 1, kinesin family member 20a, cyclin B1 and aurora kinase A. Treatment with either MS0019266 or MS0017509 dramatically reduced polo-like kinase-1 protein levels. It is not currently known whether MS0019266 or MS0017509 are direct inhibitors of polo-like kinase 1 or whether these compounds are non-specific inhibitors of mitotic proteins through effects on cell cycle.

In this screen, we identified 2 compounds that are effective ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, a well validated biological target for radiosensitization. Based on this preliminary experience, screening a larger chemical library may identify additional agents that specifically inhibit DNA damage repair. Other approaches to high-throughput screening for radiosensitizers have been recently described.

Similarly, a 96-well colony forming assay was developed with the goal of identifying radiosensitizers <xref rid="pone.0038465-Katz2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In addition to providing information on DNA damage repair, this 96-well &#x003b3;-H2AX assay could potentially be multiplexed for a high-content readout <xref rid="pone.0038465-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Our protocol utilized pooling of compounds, which is a commonly used approach to improve efficiency of resource intensive high-content screening protocols <xref rid="pone.0038465-Kainkaryam1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, this strategy has the potential risks of additivity, synergy and antagonism that could result in both false positives and false negatives. We eliminated the risk of false positives through subsequent interrogation of individual compounds. A further disadvantage of pooled compound experiments is that the DMSO concentration is higher to achieve adequate drug concentrations and this is another potential confounding variable. To address the risk of false negatives associated with pooling, we propose subsequent screening of individual compounds from a larger chemical library that can be justified by our success in this pilot screen. In conclusion, MS0019266 and MS0017509 are promising compounds that may be candidates for further development as radiosensitizing compounds as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and polo-like kinase 1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines and Cell Culture</title><p>We used one well characterized prostate cancer cell line (DU145) for screening and biological analysis and confirmed results in three human head and neck squamous carcinoma cancer (HNSCC) cell lines (SQ-20B, SCC61, SCC-25) and one prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) with known differences in radiosensitivity.

Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from DU145 prostate cancer cells at 8 hours after drug treatment. RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrating a 28S band that is 2 times more intense than 18S ribosomal RNA. Synthesis of cDNA from total RNA and hybridization/scanning of microarrays were performed with Affymetrix GeneST1.0 array as described in the GeneChip manual. The raw intensity data were extracted from the GeneChip using Gene Expression Console (Affymetrix Inc.) and normalized across the chips by log scale robust multi-array analysis (RMA) method and the quality control of each chip data was performed by investigating overall intensity values for all probes, negative and positive controls <xref rid="pone.0038465-Irizarry1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

One volume of low salt homogenization buffer (10 mM of HEPES, pH 7.2, with 2 mM of DTT) was added to the cell pellets. The cell suspension was homogenized by Pyrex tissue grinder (20 times up and down on ice). After homogenization, another 1x vol. of high salt buffer (1 M of HEPES, pH 7.2, with 2 mM of DTT) was added. The cell suspension was mixed by pipette (20 times up and down on ice). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0; for 20 min. The supernatant was passed through a Sephadex G25 spin column, pre-equilibrated with buffer (50 mM of HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mM of DTT) to remove endogenous nucleotides. Protein concentration was measured on NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (OD 280).

The incubation time for the reaction was 20 min. [<sup>3</sup>H]dCDP was dephosphorylated by phosphodiesterase. [<sup>3</sup>H]C and [<sup>3</sup>H]dC were separated with a C<sub>18</sub> ion exchange column by HPLC and detected by &#x000df;-RAM radioactive detector.

<bold>Chemical library screening algorithm.</bold> Based on extensive preliminary data, persistence of &#x003b3;-H2AX at 4 hours after treatment with drug therapy was identified as a robust phenotypic marker of unrepaired DNA damage and tumor cell sensitivity. The &#x003b3;-H2AX immunocytochemistry assay has been developed and validated on single glass coverslips. Subsequently, an automated &#x003b3;-H2AX immunocytochemistry assay was developed using 96-well glass bottom plates and robotic liquid handling. The initial chemical library screen was conducted with 30 compound mixtures from the 14,400 compound Chembridge library. Images from 96-well plates were captured using a CCD camera and analyzed off-line. The chemical compound resulting in significant persistence of &#x003b3;-H2AX was identified using mixtures of 6 compounds and subsequently single compounds. Highly effective single compounds were assessed by MTT cell viability and clonogenic assays as secondary screens.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0038465.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This research is supported by DOD grant W81XWH-05-1-0199, National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities Scholar, Katz Foundation Award, and William Harris Research Fellowship to J.K.
