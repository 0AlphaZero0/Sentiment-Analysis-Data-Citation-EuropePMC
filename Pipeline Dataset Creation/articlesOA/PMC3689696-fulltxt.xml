By far the most frequently used sequences are those of the repeats of the chromosomal rDNA array. It is generally accepted that the rDNA repeats of a genome have identical sequences due to the phenomenon of sequence homogenisation and can thus be used for identification and barcoding of species. Here we show that the rDNA arrays of the type strains of <italic>Metschnikowia andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> are not homogenised. Both have arrays consisting of diverse repeats that differ from each other in the D1/D2 domains by up to 18 and 25 substitutions. The variable sites are concentrated in two regions that correspond to back-folding stretches of hairpin loops in the predicted secondary structure of the RNA molecules. The substitutions do not alter significantly the overall hairpin-loop structure due to wobble base pairing at sites of C-T transitions and compensatory mutations in the complementary strand of the hairpin stem. The phylogenetic and network analyses of the cloned sequences revealed that the repeats had not evolved in a vertical tree-like way but reticulation might have shaped the rDNA arrays of both strains. The neighbour-net analysis of all cloned sequences of the type strains and the database sequences of different strains further showed that these species share a continuous pool of diverse repeats that appear to evolve by reticulate evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the grant OTKA-81792 provided by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund.

Therefore contemporary yeast taxonomy is mainly based on the comparative analysis of conserved parts of the genomes such as the nuclear rRNA operon, genes coding for components of the transcriptionary and translationary machineries, their combinations (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and references therein) and genes encoding cytoskeletal components <xref rid="pone.0067384-Daniel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Molnar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In phylogenetic analysis of higher taxonomic units, a multigenic approach is preferred (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). Conserved domains of transcription factors also seem to be suitable for the assessment of phylogenetic relationships <xref rid="pone.0067384-Balazs1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. By far the most frequently used sequences are those of the domains 1 and 2 (D1/D2) of the large subunit (LSU, 26S) rDNA and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of the rDNA repeats. Recently an international consortium proposed the ITS sequence for barcoding of fungi <xref rid="pone.0067384-Schoch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Time will show whether it can also be adopted as the major barcoding sequence for ascomycetous yeasts. However, for the time being, most yeast biologists consider it too variable and prefer the more conserved large subunit rRNA gene for species delimitation (for a review see <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). In phylogenetic analyses of these sequences the large and rapidly expanding group of <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> and related anamorphs usually formed a monophyletic but heterogeneous clade of Saccharomycotina (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). Within the clade a group of species related to the pulcherrimin-producing <italic>M. pulcherrima</italic> form a well-separated, compact subclade with high statistical support <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Naumov1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The phylogenetic trees of the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> clade inferred from D1/D2 domain sequences of the type strains of the species included <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> which, however, contain ambiguous nucleotides in their database sequences <xref rid="pone.0067384-Molnar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As the methods used for estimation of phylogenetic relations are based on differences between nucleotide sequences, ambiguous positions can lead to incorrect conclusions and preclude the correct taxonomic assignment of new isolates. In spite of this, the <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences were also used for the demonstration of phylogenetic separation and delineation of new <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> species (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). In a project aimed at the isolation of novel pulcherrimin-producing <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> strains suitable for bioprotection (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Sipiczki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>), we frequently encountered the problem that most isolates could not be assigned to any known species on the basis of their D1/D2 sequences although they were fairly similar to one or the other species of the subclade. They did not show sequence identity to any of the type strains of known species and did not form a compact group either, indicating that they did not represent novel, distinct species. In principle, ambiguous nucleotides in a sequence can be attributed to sequencing errors or to heterogeneity in the amplified DNA caused by the presence of two or more fragments of different sequences. Both reasons could account for the ambiguity of the database sequences of the type strains of <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> but the fact that their ambiguous nucleotides are not scattered randomly makes the latter possibility more likely.</p><p>In our quest to elucidate the reason of ambiguous nucleotides, we resequenced the D1/D2 domains of both strains but before sequencing we cloned fragments from the amplified DNA. In this paper we report on the results of the analysis that revealed an unexpectedly high level of heterogeneity and polymorphism in sequence and secondary structure of the LSU rRNA domains. We will use &#x0201c;heterogeneity&#x0201d; to designate the presence of different versions of paralogs (and their nucleotides) and &#x0201c;polymorphism&#x0201d; to refer to the presence of versions (alleles) of the same ortholog in different strains. When phylogenetic trees were constructed, the two sets of cloned sequences formed intermixed branches, indicating that reticulate evolution may have occurred in the history of the strains. In situations where reticulate processes can be suspected, bifurcating trees based on a model of evolution dominated by mutations and speciation events can be an inappropriate representation of the phylogenetic history. In such cases more general graphs such as phylogenetic networks can be more useful as they allow the visualization of horizontal events and competing evolutionary scenarios within a single structure (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0067384-Makarenkov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Huson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Therefore we reanalysed the sequences using the splits-based neighbour-net approach <xref rid="pone.0067384-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and concluded that intrastrain, interstrain and interspecies reticulation events must have shaped their rDNA arrays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Strains and Culture Conditions</title><p>The yeast type strains <italic>M. andauensis</italic> CBS 10809<sup>T</sup> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> CBS 8853<sup>T</sup> were obtained from the CBS (Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, the Netherlands) collection.

For distance calculation the distance estimation method K3ST (Kimura&#x02019;s three-substitution-types; <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>) was used. To construct cluster networks in form of rooted rectangular phylogrammes, the sequence AY452039 of <italic>Candida picachoensis</italic> CBS 9804<sup>T</sup> was used as outgroup. This species is close enough to the <italic>M. pulcherrima</italic> group <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> to have a D1/D2 sequence moderately related to the analysed sequences but far enough to be an uncontroversial outgroup. To generate neighbor-nets, Equal Angle setting was chosen and the sequence used as outgroup in cluster networks was excluded from the analysis, as its inclusion had little effect on the overall structure (the neighbor nets are unrooted networks) of the network and the layout of the network was improved by its exclusion.

Two <italic>M. andauensis</italic> fragments were cloned directly from the culture purchased from CBS, and five clones were obtained from two single-cell yeast clones of the species. The <italic>M. fructicola</italic> D1/D2 clones were obtained from four single-cell yeast clones. The cloned DNA fragments were sequenced from both ends and the sequences were deposited in the GenBank database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Pairwise Blast comparison revealed that the majority of the cloned fragments had unique sequences. There were only two pairs with identical sequences: one pair (aa20 and ab24) in the <italic>M. andauensis</italic> set and one pair (f39b and fb6) in the <italic>M. fructicola</italic> set. The number of substitutions ranged from 1 to 18 in <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and 2 to 25 in <italic>M. fructicola</italic>. The largest differences corresponding to 3.6% and 5.0%, respectively, exceeded 1%, the value generally considered as the limit of variability among conspecific strains of most ascomycetous yeasts <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. When the clones of the two strains were compared, no identical sequences were identified and differences were detected at 2 to 25 sites. Thus, the range of variability was practically identical at the intrastrain and interstrain levels. Interestingly, there were clones in both sets for which the most similar partner was found among the clones of the other strain (e.g. aa13a &#x02013; fb9, aa20&#x02013; fc21, a78&#x02013; fc15).</p><p>The multiple alignment of all cloned sequences identified variability (mostly dimorphism) at 35 sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t003">3</xref>). The variable positions were not distributed evenly along the entire length of the D1/D2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The majority of them grouped in two short regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) which we will call variable region 1 (VR1) and variable region 2 (VR2) throughout this paper. Nine variable sites of the D1 domain formed VR1 and 16 sites of the D2 domain comprised VR2. In these sites usually two nucleotides alternated; there were only two sites where more than two different nucleotides occurred when all cloned sequences were compared. The histogram and the Weblogos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g001">Fig. 1</xref> show the proportions of the alternating nucleotides. The nucleotides of the two sites (159 and 432) which differed only in single clones might be attributed to sequencing errors. The majority of variable sites varied in both strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t003">3</xref> and Weblogos in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Structural variability was observed only in the stem parts, apparently due to the variable sites that grouped in the back-folding strands of the helices. The only exception was site 103 which was in the complementary strand. Similar topological variability and grouping of variable sites in the back-folding strands were also observed in the hairpin loops that included the VR2 segments (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

This implies that each substitution at a variable site could alter the helical structure of its stem because it can disrupt the normal base pairing. Consistent with this, the hairpins of the clones showed variable patterns of paired and unpaired stretches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g002">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g003">3</xref>). However, not all nucleotide substitutions caused changes in the secondary structures (note that the figures show only examples). The structural neutrality of certain nucleotide changes could be attributed to non-canonical base pairing referred to as wobble base paring. Due to this peculiarity of RNA, guanine can pair not only with cytosine but also with uracil in the RNA helix <xref rid="pone.0067384-Varani1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, the substitution of cytosine by thymine in the DNA sequence does not necessarily affect the structure of the RNA helix. Many variable sites of VR1 and VR2 (e.g. sites 160, 161, 169, 435, 437, 441, 448, 449 and 452) paired with stable guanines in the hybridising segment of the hairpin stems. Most of them had either T(U) or C in the cloned sequences. Their transitions did not alter the stem structure, confirming that wobble pairing of nucleotides did neutralise many substitutions indeed. So the structural variability could be ascribed to substitutions in sites, where wobble pairing was not possible. However, even in their case, not all nucleotide changes had structural effects. We noticed 3 variable sites in the back-folding stretches of the hairpins that paired with variable sites in the complementary sequences of the stems: 103&#x02013;159, 389&#x02013;443 and 391&#x02013;441.

One possibility is gradual spread of a &#x0201c;master repeat&#x0201d; by serial duplications during which the new copies acquire novel mutations in their inherited sequences. If this is the case, then the evolutionary history can be reconstructed by a phylogenetic analysis producing a bifurcating phylogenetic tree. Therefore we aligned the cloned sequences and analysed the alignments with neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. First we performed the analysis separately with the clones of the strains. The trees obtained had very low statistical supports. Then the two sets of sequences were pooled and analysed together. The topologies of the trees obtained were congruent but the statistical support of the majority of the branches was very low again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The Bayesian analysis delivered very similar results: almost identical tree topology with nodes supported by very low posterior probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

The low bootstrap and posterior probability values as well as the intermixing of <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences suggested that the rDNA arrays of these strains did not evolve in a treelike way but rather in a reticulate way that cannot be represented by a bifurcating tree. It has been demonstrated by numerous studies that intraspecific and intragenomic evolutionary relationships are not hierarchical and the application of tree-constructing methods to their analysis can lead to poor resolution or inadequate representation of genealogical relationships (for a review see <xref rid="pone.0067384-Posada2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Visualisation of Reticulation in the Evolution of the Cloned D1/D2 Sequences</title><p>There exist several methods for verification and visualisation of reticulate events.

A phylogenetic network <xref rid="pone.0067384-Moret1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> is a rooted directed acyclic graph made up of so-called tree nodes, network nodes, tree edges and network edges. The tree nodes are nodes that are also seen in bifurcating phylogenetic trees (root, leaves and internal nodes at bifurcations). The network nodes (not seen in phylogenetic trees) are the nodes at which either edges converge or no bifurcation takes place. The tree edges are directed from tree nodes (root or internal nodes) towards tree nodes (internal nodes or leaves). The network edges are directed from tree nodes towards network nodes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> the network edges are shown as dotted lines and the tree edges are continuous lines. The high number and the directions of network edges clearly demonstrate that reticulate events have played a major role in the evolution of the LSU rRNA genes of both strains. The same clones that formed the two large branches of the phylogenetic trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) also grouped together in the phylogenetic network but their lineages were interconnected through network edges.

The neighbor-net method <xref rid="pone.0067384-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> based on the neighbor-joining algorithm <xref rid="pone.0067384-Saitou1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> produces circular splits and uses a circular network algorithm <xref rid="pone.0067384-Dress1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> to get planar networks. A split is a partition of the set of data (sequences) into two groups. The set can be partitioned by numerous splits, and then a network can be built from these splits. Each split will define an edge connecting the two partitions. The outcome is a splits graph. Splits can be compatible and incompatible. Compatible splits correspond to branches in a phylogenetic tree, so the splits graph for a compatible collection of splits is a tree. An incompatible split separates nodes that are not connected with a branch in a tree. To generate a network, incompatible collections of splits must be allowed. Neighbor-net uses so-called &#x0201c;weakly compatible&#x0201d; splits <xref rid="pone.0067384-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. When splits are incompatible (they define contradictory groupings), a box (cycle) is introduced to indicate that there are alternative splits. So, boxes in the splits graph can be used to locate reticulations. In a splits graph, a pair of nodes may be linked by a single edge (tree-like part) or a set of parallel edges depicting alternative evolutionary possibilities (reticulate part). The unrooted neighbor-net network we obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) was distinctly non-treelike. The networked relationships among the sequences with box-like structures instead of bifurcations confirmed the notion that reticulation has occurred in their evolution. Even though the network was highly netted, distinct clusters could be discerned. Then we repeated the analysis also involving the database sequences deposited under the taxonomic name <italic>M. fructicola</italic> and obtained from strains different from the type strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067384-t001">Table 1</xref>). None of these sequences had ambiguous sites. In contrast, the type strain and both <italic>M. andauensis</italic> database entries have such sites, so they were excluded from the analysis. The inclusion of the database sequences in the analysis slightly changed the overall topology of the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) because it merged clusters I and IV and moved a78 from cluster II into the merged cluster. Two edges marked with arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067384-g006">Fig. 6</xref> clearly separated the three clusters but not the two species because even the database <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences grouped into two clusters intermixed with sequences cloned from the <italic>M. andauensis</italic> type strain. Cluster II, containing both <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> clones had the highest number of conflicting splits. The presence of the boxes indicates reticulation but further analysis by other methods (e.g. PADRE: a package for analysing and displaying reticulate evolution <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lott1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, algorithms suitable for detection of recombination [30 and references therein], sequencing and structural analysis of the entire rDNA arrays) are needed to determine what processes are actually involved.

If two lineages diverge and never recombine, then adjacent polymorphisms (or heterogeneity) will most likely be &#x0201c;compatible&#x0201d;, that is both polymorphic (or heterogeneous) sites will support the same tree topology (will have the same phylogenetic signal). If they do not support the same topology, they are termed &#x0201e;incompatible&#x0201d;. Incompatible sites can have two possible histories, one in which there was recurrent mutation in different lineages and one in which there was recombination between lineages.

We assumed that if the sequence ambiguity was due to mixed cell populations in the collection cultures, then the single-cell cultures (yeast clones) should not have identical sequences and each of them should only have one type of D1/D2 sequence. We found that this was not the case because we could clone several different D1/D2 versions from the single-cell cultures.

However, the hybrids usually have only two parental alleles (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>), whereas the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains examined here have at least 6 (<italic>M. andauensis</italic>) and 10 (<italic>M. fructicola</italic>) different large subunit rRNA alleles. We consider it more likely that they have mosaic arrays of rDNA repeats containing (most probably) paralogous D1/D2 segments differing by as many as 18 and 25 substitutions.</p><p>Intragenomic diversity of large subunit rDNA sequences have already been noticed in other ascomycetous yeasts. Lachance et al. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> found mixtures of two D2 variants in certain <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> strains. In <italic>Geotrichum candidum</italic>, Alper et al. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Alper1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> identified ambiguous nucleotides in large subunit rDNA fragments amplified directly from 15 strains. However, in neither species was the phenomenon examined in greater detail. Since the genera <italic>Clavispora</italic> and <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> are members of the same family (Metschnikowiaceae) and phylogenetically related <xref rid="pone.0067384-Guzmn1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, the results obtained in this work can be considered an extension of the study of Lachance et. al <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Even the rDNA array of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> shows some intragenomic variability. Ganley and Kobayashi <xref rid="pone.0067384-Ganley2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> found two polymorphic (heterogeneous) sites in the entire large-subunit rRNA genes. James et al. <xref rid="pone.0067384-James1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> detected altogether 35 (only 3 in D1/D2) polymorphic (heterogeneous) sites, but the level of variation differed by nearly an order of magnitude between individual strains. Neither study reported on cloning and comparison of individual repeats of the rDNA arrays.</p><p>Remarkably, both highly variable D1/D2 regions of the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains are located in segments that fold back to form hairpin loops in the predicted secondary structure of the LSU rRNA. The more variable VR2 region corresponds to a short stretch of an expansion segment of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> D2 domain which is missing in the <italic>E. coli</italic> LSU rRNA molecule <xref rid="pone.0067384-Veldman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Similar expansions that increase the size of the domain at this position also occur in other fungi <xref rid="pone.0067384-Schnare1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> including <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For example the D2 domain of the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> large subunit rRNA is twice as large as the corresponding domain II of the <italic>E. coli</italic> large subunit rRNA <xref rid="pone.0067384-Veldman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> D1/D2 domains studied here are only slightly shorter than that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. While the core regions of the LSU rRNAs are highly conserved structurally across all domains of life, the expansion segments evolve more rapidly <xref rid="pone.0067384-Schnare1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, presumably due to reduced functional constraints. Consistently with this, the VR2 regions of the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> sequences are more variable than their VR1 regions which reside in the core of the large subunit rRNA molecules.</p><p>A common feature of the predicted hairpins was that they contained almost all variable sites in the back-folding stretches. As the cloned <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> sequences differed in the number and location of the nucleotide substitutions in these regions, the secondary structures of their hairpins showed variable patterns of alternating helical and non-helical stretches. However, despite the internal variability, the size and the overall shape of the hairpins were alike in all clones. This structural stability can most probably be attributed to non-canonical base pairings and compensatory mutations taking place in the complementary stretches of the hairpin helices. We found that the non-canonical wobble base pair G:U was frequent in both variable regions. Since the thermodynamic stability of the wobble base pair G:U is comparable to that of the canonic G:C pair <xref rid="pone.0067384-Varani1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the transitions between C and T in the coding DNA have less severe effect on the helical structure of the RNA stems than the A-G transitions or the transversions that either disrupt base pairings or create new pairs. This difference can explain why the majority of the variable sites alternate between C and T. The other factor that can stabilise the stem structure is the occurrence of compensatory mutations in sites that pair with the variable nucleotides of the back-folding stretch. We found three pairs of variable sites in which substitutions can take place in a concerted way to maintain base pairing. It is tempting to speculate that because of the little effect on rRNA structure, the alternative versions of variable sites of VR1 and VR2 are not selected out by the evolution and can persist simultaneously in the same genome. Nucleotides in other parts of the rRNA molecules may not enjoy a similar protection.</p><p>How can the cell cope with the presence of a mixed population of different 26S rRNA molecules without severe consequences in fitness? The most obvious answer is that due to the attenuating effect of wobble pairing and compensatory mutations, the RNA molecules encoded by the different genes of the array have quite similar secondary structures and may not significantly differ in functional activity either. However, there might also be other factors to be taken in consideration. A number of studies have shown that not all repeats of the rDNA array are used in the cell. For example, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> only half of the repeats are actively transcribed <xref rid="pone.0067384-Dammann1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-French1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It was hypothesized that those that are not transcribed reside in regions silenced by the chromatin structure <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. If this is the case in the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> strains as well, then certain large subunit rDNA gene variants may remain silent and the RNA molecules produced may consequently be less diverse than the genes of the rDNA array.</p><p>The question arises as to whether the persistence of different large subunit rRNA genes within one genome is a peculiarity of a few yeast strains or can be a more wide-spread, albeit overlooked phenomenon. To address this question one should test a large number of other yeasts species for D1/D2 homogeneity. Here we only examined the database sequences deposited by other authors as D1/D2 domains of <italic>M. andauensis</italic> or <italic>M. fructicola</italic>. The sequence of the only non-type <italic>M. andauensis</italic> strain had even more ambiguous sites than the type strain. In contrast, the 6 <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences were free of ambiguous nucleotides. This difference might be interpreted as indicating that the latter species has both heterogeneous and non-heterogeneous strains. However, even a heterogeneous strain may produce an &#x0201c;error-free&#x0201d; sequence if one of the repeat versions predominates over the other versions.</p><p>The extent of the intragenomic divergence of the D1/D2 domains further suggests that the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains fail to operate the mechanism of concerted evolution of rDNA which functions efficiently in the vast majority of organisms. Concerted evolution of the rDNA repeats ensures that a mutation that arises in one copy is eliminated or spreads by inter-copy interactions through the array until fixation <xref rid="pone.0067384-Dover1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. For example, in <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> the rDNA repeats undergo rapid homogenization: the new mutations are either deleted or multiplied during continual unequal recombination until one variant finally becomes dominant <xref rid="pone.0067384-Ganley2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The large number of different D1/D2 sequences in the genomes of the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> strains indicates that in these organisms concerted evolution must be very inefficient and the ribosomal genes may not evolve in a strictly concerted manner. Few other organisms are known in which concerted evolution of rDNA seems to operate with low efficiency. Besides the two yeasts mentioned above, the grasshopper <italic>Podisma pedestris</italic>, the flatworm family Dugesiidae and certain aphid species were found to have heterogeneity in their rDNA arrays (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0067384-Eickbush1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>). It was proposed that the rDNA units of these organisms simply escaped the process of concerted evolution or were under selective pressure to evolve variable rDNA genes.</p><p>The intragenomic D1/D2 sequence diversity of the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains exceeds considerably the intraspecies diversity observed by Kurtzman and Robnett <xref rid="pone.0067384-Kurtzman4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in ascomycetous yeasts. These authors found that conspecific yeast strains rarely differed by more than three substitutions and a difference higher than 1% between two strains indicated that the strains might have belonged to different species. On that basis one could conclude that the rDNA arrays of the two <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains are polyphyletic and consist of genes brought together by interspecies hybridisation events. However, other authors revealed much larger differences between conspecific strains and in heterozygous or heterogeneous strains. For example the D2 sequences of <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> strains were found to differ by as many as 32 substitutions <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, more than the highest number of substitutions (25) detected in this study between the least similar <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> clones. In view of these observations, it seems to be more plausible that reticulate evolution involving intraspecies hybridisation and intragenomic events such as recombination, gene conversion, deletion, duplication, etc. might have shaped the rDNA arrays of both strains.</p><p>Although the intragenomic processes leading to homogenisation seem to be rather inefficient in the <italic>Metschnikowia</italic> type strains, reticulation does take place in their genomes as demonstrated by the poor statistical support of the neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees and the topologies of the phylogenetic networks and the neighbour-net splits graphs. In addition, when the cloned sequences of the two strains were pooled before the analyses, the phylogenetic trees and the networks did not group them into separate clusters. Presumably, the strains could have exchanged parts of their rDNA arrays by hybridisation and recombination and their rRNA arrays did not evolve separately but in interaction. The pair-wise homoplasy (Phi) test confirmed that recombination did play a role in their evolution. The presence of D1/D2 domains of identical sequences in the type strains also hints towards interspecies hybridisation events. Of course, this conclusion can only be correct under the premise that the autogamy proposed for the <italic>M. pulcherrima</italic> subclade <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> does not pose an impenetrable barrier to sexual interactions. Addition of database <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences to the analysed set of sequences did not change significantly the topology of the neighbour-net splits graphs: the <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> sequences remained intermixed and did not form separate clusters. Thus, even the repeats of the non-type strains fit into the hypothesized common pool of rDNA repeats. The lack of a sharp discontinuity between their sequences implies that <italic>M. andauensis</italic> and <italic>M. fructicola</italic> are not reproductively isolated and their distinct taxonomic status should be revised. It has to be noted here that Lachance et al. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Lachance3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> already expressed doubts regarding the taxonomic division of the <italic>M. pulcherrima</italic> clade to which these species belong because unambiguous assignment of its strains to species on the basis of their D1/D2 was not always possible (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0067384-Molnar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067384-Sipiczki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) and the species of the clade were virtually indistinguishable from each other by physiological tests <xref rid="pone.0067384-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. If the phenomenon described in this study also characterizes other yeast species, it should be taken into consideration in the taxonomic division of yeasts, their barcoding and in biodiversity research using barcodes such as metagenomics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Anita Olah-Csabai for expert technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0067384-Kurtzman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
