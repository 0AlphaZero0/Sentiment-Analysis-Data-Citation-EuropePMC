Using microarray analysis, we found that the <italic>CTHRC1</italic> gene is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The level of <italic>CTHRC1</italic> mRNA was measured in 201 surgically resected HCCs using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overexpression of CTHRC1 in HCC was associated with large tumor size and advanced tumor stage. Furthermore, expression of CTHRC1 as was identified as an independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Suppression of CTHRC1 expression inhibited tumor migration and invasion whereas overexpression of CTHRC1 promoted tumor invasion. Activation of RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, was found to play a crucial role in CTHRC1-induced cell migration. CTHRC1 promoted adhesion of cancer cells to extracellular matrix through induction of integrin &#x003b2;1 expression and activation of focal adhesion kinase. These results suggest CTHRC1 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by enhancing the adhesion and migratory abilities of tumor cells. It is also a promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with HCC.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China.

Its incidence is increasing in Western countries, mainly due to the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C infection <xref rid="pone.0070324-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The major risk factors are hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, cirrhosis of any etiology, and aflatoxin exposure <xref rid="pone.0070324-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Molecular approaches have revealed the involvement of <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;-catenin</italic> mutations in hepatocarcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0070324-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070324-Hsu2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The mutations account for approximately 50% of all HCC cases. Somatic mutations of other known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in HCC are rare. Hence, the molecular mechanisms of HCC, particularly in the early stage, remain largely unclear.</p><p>Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1) is a 25-kDa secreted glycoprotein containing an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal peptide for extracellular secretion, a short collagen triple helix repeat of 36 amino acids, and a COOH-terminal globular domain <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It was initially found in a screen for differentially expressed genes in balloon-injured versus normal rat arteries <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Expression of Cthrc1 was induced abundantly in adventitial fibroblasts and neointimal smooth muscle cells of balloon-injured vessels <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Forced expression of Cthrc1 in rat fibroblasts promoted cell migration and inhibited collagen I synthesis in these cells, indicating Cthrc1 may contribute to tissue repair in vascular remodeling in response to injury by limiting collagen matrix deposition and promoting cell migration <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Likewise, Cthrc1 transgenic mice showed reduced neointimal lesion formation and adventitial collagen deposition in response to carotid artery ligation <xref rid="pone.0070324-LeClair1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms of Cthrc1 are yet to be discovered. In smooth muscle of arteries, Cthrc1 inhibits the signaling of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0070324-LeClair1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recently, Cthrc1 was found to selectively activate the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling by stabilizing the Wnt-receptor complex <xref rid="pone.0070324-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The human homolog of CTHRC1 shares 92% sequence identity with the rat protein. CTHRC1 was found to be expressed in 16 out of 19 types of human solid tumors including invasive melanoma but not in benign nevus and non-invasive melanoma <xref rid="pone.0070324-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the functional role of CTHRC1 in HCC and other cancers is still uncharacterized. In the present report, we show that CTHRC1 plays an important role in migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma and that overexpression of CTHRC1 predicts poor prognosis in patients with HCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experimental procedures were undertaken at the National Taiwan University Hospital.

Since CTHRC1 overexpression in HCC is associated with advanced stage, we speculated that CTHRC1 may play a role in tumor growth and invasion. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of CTHRC1 in HCC cell lines and found that HA22T and Huh7 cells had the highest and lowest CTHRC1 expression, respectively. So we selected them for further study. Five different lentiviral constructs carrying CTHRC1 shRNAs were used to transduce HCC cell line HA22T. Cells transduced with shRNAs #1and #5 resulted in a dramatic reduction of CTHRC1 mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and the amount of CTHRC1 in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and were selected for subsequent studies.</p><fig id="pone-0070324-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070324.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CTHRC1 promotes tumor migration and invasion.</title><p>(A) shRNA#1 and #5 markedly reduced CTHRC1 mRNA and protein in HA22T cells.

When injected into NOD/SCID mice, HA22T cells with or without CTHRC1 knockdown cannot form tumor up to 8 weeks after injection (data not shown). Overexpression of CTHRC1 in Huh7 cells did not enhance tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070324.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, a transwell migration assay was performed and showed similar reduction in the number of migrating cells, indicating the reduction in invasive capacity is mainly due to reduced cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Scratch wound assay also showed that closure of the wound was delayed in CTHRC1-knocked down HA22T cells, further confirming the effect of CTHRC1 on tumor cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). On the other hand, when CTHRC1 was overexpressed in Huh7 cells by retroviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), invasiveness of the tumor cells was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070324-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). To confirm the role of CTHRC1 in tumor invasion, cells were grown in a 3-D gel consisting of a thick matrix of native collagen type I fibers.

Many mechanisms regulate these processes. One way to identify the genes involved in these processes is to compare the gene expression profile between tumor and nontumorous tissue <xref rid="pone.0070324-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070324-Jeng1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the present study, we used genome-wide microarray analysis and identified <italic>CTHRC1</italic> as another gene overexpressed in HCC. Overexpression of CTHRC1 was seen more frequently in larger and more advanced stage tumors. Besides, expression of CTHRC1 was an indicator of poor prognosis. These results suggest a functional role of CTHRC1 in tumor progression. Previous studies also found overexpression of CTHRC1 in melanoma and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, ovary, and many other organs <xref rid="pone.0070324-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). These observations indicate that CTHRC1 is commonly overexpressed in cancer.</p><p>
<italic>Cthrc1</italic> was initially found in a screening for differentially expressed genes in balloon injured versus normal rat vessels <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Forced expression of Cthrc1 was found to promote migration of rat fibroblasts. So we speculated that cancer cells secrete CTHRC1 to promote their migration. Indeed, knockdown of CTHRC1 inhibited invasiveness of HCC cells in a transwell invasion assay. On the other hand, overexpression of CTHRC1 promoted tumor invasion. The enhanced invasiveness is mostly attributed to the increase in cell migration as demonstrated in the transwell migration assay and scratch wound assay. A similar promigratory role has been reported for melanoma <xref rid="pone.0070324-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>It is still not clear how CTHRC1 regulates cancer cell migration. Pyagay et al. reported overexpression of Cthrc1 caused a dramatic reduction in the synthesis of collagen type I in rat fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0070324-Pyagay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but we found no change in collagen synthesis in HA22T cells with knockdown of CTHRC1 (data not shown). So we decided to test the important signaling pathways involved in cell migration. The Rho family of small GTPase, including RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, are key regulators of cell migration based on their effects on the cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion activities <xref rid="pone.0070324-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore. we tested the activity of the Rho family proteins and found CTHRC1 specifically inhibits the activation of RhoA. Interestingly, CTHRC1 was reported to be an activator of the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling in mouse embryogenesis <xref rid="pone.0070324-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Planar cell polarity signaling regulates the establishment of polarity within the plane of the epithelium and allows cells to obtain directional information during embryogenesis <xref rid="pone.0070324-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. One of the major components of the planar cell polarity pathway is the activation of small GTPases, including RhoA and Rac1, and their downstream protein kinases, ROCK and JNK, respectively, to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization <xref rid="pone.0070324-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Hence, by secreting CTHRC1 into its microenviroment, cancer cells stimulate their own motility and that of adjacent cancer cells by activating RhoA signaling.</p><p>Activation of RhoA mediates the formation of stress fibers and the integrin adhesion complex to anchor cells to their substrata <xref rid="pone.0070324-Hotchin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070324-Ridley1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Adhesion to stroma is essential for cell viability and migration. Our study found that CTHRC1 enhanced the ability of HCC cells to adhere to fibronectin-coated slides. Induction of integrin &#x003b2;1 expression and activation of FAK phosphorylation to promote focal adhesion formation may account for this effect.</p><p>During preparation of this manuscript, Park <italic>et al.</italic> reported that CTHRC1 is overexpression in pancreatic cancer <xref rid="pone.0070324-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. CTHRC1 promoted growth of pancreatic tumor and metastatic spread of cancer cells to distant organs. Besides, they also found overexpression of CTHRC1 in pancreatic cancer cells resulted in increased motility and adhesiveness. The similar effects of CTHRC1 in HCC and pancreatic cancer suggest that CTHRC1 is an important effector for tumor invasion. There are subtle differences between our results and theirs. We did not found CTHRC1 promotes growth of HCC cells. We found RhoA is the most important small GTPase for CTHRC1-mediated HCC invasion and they found Rac1 accounts for the invasiveness in pancreatic cancer. These observations indicate CTHRC1 may use similar but different mechanisms in different cells to promote tumor invasion.</p><p>Since CTHRC1 is a secretory protein highly expressed in cancers, it is likely to be aberrantly expressed in the serum of cancer patients and may be considered a promising tumor marker. Besides, the functional role of CTHRC1 in cancer cell migration and adhesion suggests that blocking CTHRC1, such with neutralizing antibody, may inhibit tumor metastasis and therefore be therapeutically beneficial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0070324.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
