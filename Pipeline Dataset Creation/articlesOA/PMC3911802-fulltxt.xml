The final disease phenotype results from complex interactions between environment and multiple genes of small-to-modest effects. We investigated whether the polymorphism in genes encoding inflammatory mediators and cytokines is important for solving the onset and progression of asthma. We investigated whether 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding cytokines or monokines (interleukin [IL]-5R, matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] 8, beta2 adrenergic receptor, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte&#x02013;associated antigen 4, IL-3, C-reactive protein, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, CYP3A4, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase [ADAM] 33, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor [CysLTR] 1, CysLTR2, eosinophilic cationic protein, glucocorticoid receptor, and leukotriene A 4 hydrolase) are related to asthma development in 206 Japanese bronchial asthma patients and 127 healthy controls. Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), we identified rs17099451 in MMP8, using a single locus model, with a mean cross-validation of 87.0%. Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%. Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 &#x000d7; 2 dominant model analysis. The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Japanese population</kwd><kwd>multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR)</kwd><kwd>rs17099451 in MMP8</kwd><kwd>rs44707 in ADAM33</kwd><kwd>rs40401 in IL-3</kwd><kwd>single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The main pathogenic mechanism of bronchial asthma involves a particular form of chronic inflammation, in which the increase in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the respiratory tract membrane and exfoliation of the respiratory epithelium cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, followed by airway remodeling.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These pathological changes result from the interactions between the inflammatory mediators and the various cytokines produced by the infiltrated cells or the structural cells.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Asthma has a strong genetic component and complex interactions between the environment and multiple genes.

To analyze interactions between SNPs and between SNPs and asthma development risk, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approach was used.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> MDR was implemented with a cross-validation framework (typically, 10-fold, although any number of intervals, including 1-fold, can be used). In step 1 of the process, the data were divided into a training set (nine-tenths of the data) and a testing set (one-tenth of the data). Next, a set of &#x0201c;<italic>n</italic>&#x0201d; genetic and/or environmental factors was selected from the set of all possible factors (<italic>i.e.</italic>, in the study <italic>n</italic> was 1, 2, 3, and 4 for SNPs); each of <italic>n</italic> individuals in the training set was grouped according to its state at each of the <italic>n</italic> factors (<italic>i.e.</italic>, for two loci with three possible genotypes, there were 9 possible combinations; for three loci, there were 27, etc.). Then, each genotype combination was classified as high or low risk depending on the ratio of cases to controls with that genotype combination. If the ratio was &#x0003c;1 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, there were less cases than controls), the genotype combination was classified as low risk. If the ratio was &#x0003e;1, the genotype combination was classified as high risk. This collection of high and low risk groups formed the MDR model for that combination of factors, and the fitness of that model was determined by classification error (the number of individuals incorrectly labeled by the model). To evaluate the predictive ability of a model, its prediction error was calculated based on the proportion of individuals in the testing set that were labeled incorrectly by that model. Each combination of variables specified by the user was evaluated in this fashion, and the entire procedure was performed 10 times, using one-tenth of the data as a testing set and nine-tenths as a training set. To evaluate MDR analysis, we evaluated balanced accuracy ([sensitivity + specificity])/2).<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The analysis was repeated 10 times after reordering individuals, and the averages of cross-validation consistency (CVC), training, and test accuracies are presented. To decrease random effects due to the arranging of data sets, the 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 10 times using different random numbers. To avoid the effect of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs in the same gene, the SNPs of which the pairwise LD coefficient <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> exceeded 0.8 were omitted from the analysis. For the SNPs that had been selected by MDR methods, we compared differences in the allele frequencies and genotype distribution of each polymorphism between the case and control subjects by using a 2 &#x000d7; 2 (allele) or 2 &#x000d7; 3 (encompassing dominant, codominant, and recessive genotype models) contingency &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test, with 1 or 2&#x000b0; of freedom.

Conversely, in a person carrying the major C allele of this SNP, the promoter activity and the ensuing gene expression may be altered, so that suppression of inflammation is lost, resulting in an increase in airway inflammation and remodeling and the development of asthma.</p><p>MMP8 forms part of a cluster of MMP genes, MMP1, -3, -7, -10, -12, -13, -20, <italic>etc.</italic>, located on chromosome 11q22.3.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In this study, we found that rs17099451 in MMP8 was in LD with another MMP8 SNP, rs11225395; it is also possible that this SNP is in LD with other SNPs that may contribute to asthma development.</p><p>Furthermore, IL-3 is a cytokine produced by active T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, which stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Moreover, IL-3 mRNA-expressing cells and IL-3 production are increased in asthma patients; this increase in IL-3 is independent of eosinophil number.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Park <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reported that one exonic SNP (in exon 1), IL3 + 79T &#x0003e; C (Ser27Pro) showed significant association with the risk of asthma and atopy.

However, these proteins do not appear to be involved in the respiratory epithelium, which is related to asthmatic immunologic or inflammatory components.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Although a previous genomewide association study in a Japanese population did not implicate ADAM33 among the three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma,<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> another study suggested the involvement of ADAM33 in the development of childhood asthma among the Japanese.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>Our finding that the MDR-based two-locus model analysis implicated rs44707 in ADAM33 as a significant factor also supports the relation of this gene to asthma development. Moreover, our finding that the combination of MMP8 and IL-3 polymorphisms and MMP8 and ADAM33 polymorphisms were also selected by two-locus model analysis may suggest that several gene polymorphisms may be involved in the onset of asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly associated with asthma indicates that metalloproteinase function is very important for the airflow limitation process of the disease. Gene variation may be important to the differences in protein expression that allow the shedding of cytokines or cytokine receptors in this disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare pertaining to this article</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Miss Kojima and Miss Oda for their technical assistance in doing this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)</collab>
