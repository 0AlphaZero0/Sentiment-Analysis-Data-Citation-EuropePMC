However, its characteristic and function in SCC is not very known. In this present study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of S100A7 in 452 SCC specimens, including the lung, esophagus, oral cavity, skin, cervix, bladder, and three SCC cell lines. We found that S100A7-positive staining showed significant heterogeneity in six types of SCC specimen and three SCC cell lines. Further examination found that S100A7-positive cells and its expression at mRNA and protein levels could be induced in HCC94, FaDu, and A-431 cells both in vitro and in vivo using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Notably, the upregulation of squamous differentiation markers, including keratin-4, keratin-13, TG-1, and involucrin, also accompanied S100A7 induction, and a similar staining pattern of S100A7 and keratin-13 was found in HCC94 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further study revealed that the overexpression of S100A7 significantly increased proliferation and inhibited squamous differentiation in A-431 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, silencing S100A7 inhibited cell growth and survival and increased the expression of keratin-4, keratin-13, TG-1, and involucrin in HCC94 cells. Therefore, these results demonstrate that S100A7 displays heterogeneous and inducible characteristic in SCC and also provide novel evidence that S100A7 acts as a dual regulator in promoting proliferation and suppressing squamous differentiation of SCC.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2011CB915504), of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81172216, 81272604).

SCC shows deregulation and defects in cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and these defects are hypothesized to help squamous cells survive and escape terminal differentiation. Despite operation, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, SCC lesions often recur and spread to other body sites, such as the lungs. Therefore, it is important to identify the molecules that inhibit the aberrant proliferation of SCC and simultaneously reinstate a normal differentiation program. This strategy may be an additional useful strategy for the clinical treatment of SCCs.</p><p>S100A7 (psoriasin) belongs to the S100 multigenic family of calcium-modulated proteins of the EF-hand type and was originally identified in psoriatic keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition to its antibacterial effects [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], S100A7 expression is up-regulated in breast cancer and many types of squamous cell carcinomas, including lung, oral cavity, bladder, and skin, and also plays an important role in carcinogenesis and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Several studies report that the high level of S100A7 expression is always observed in highly differentiated SCCs, and weak or loss of expression is observed in moderately or poorly-differentiated SCCs [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting a specific association of S100A7 expression with SCC proliferation and differentiation. The involvement of S100A7 in the differentiation process is also suggested by the fact that S100A7 is located within a gene cluster in chromosome 1q21, the epidermal differentiation complex. This cluster also contains epidermal differentiation markers, such as several cytokeratins and involucrin [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Intriguingly, the level of S100A7 expression in SCC tissues is inconsistent with that in SCC cell line cultured in vitro. Because S100A7 expression is relatively low or undetected in SCC cells in vitro; however, it has been reported that S100A7 is induced in keratinocytes by certain stimuli, such as suspension and confluent culture [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thinking along the connection between S100A7 expression in vivo, in vitro, and induction, we asked: can S100A7 be induced in SCC cell lines similar as keratinocytes? If so, what is the function of S100A7 in SCC cells? In the present study, we found that S100A7-positive staining showed significant heterogeneity in six types of SCC specimen and three SCC cell lines. Further examination found that S100A7-positive cells could be induced in HCC94, FaDu, and A-431 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the upregulation of squamous differentiation markers, including keratin-4, keratin-13, TG-1, and involucrin, also accompanied S100A7 induction, and a similar staining pattern of S100A7 and keratin-13 was found in HCC94 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further study revealed that the overexpression of S100A7 significantly increased proliferation and inhibited squamous differentiation in A-431 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, knockdown S100A7 inhibited cell growth and survival and increased the expression of keratin-4, keratin-13, TG-1, and involucrin in HCC94 cells. Overall, our findings provide novel evidence that S100A7 acts as a dual regulator in promoting proliferation and suppressing squamous differentiation of SCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The human carcinoma cell lines A-431, HCC94, and FaDu were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee Type Culture Collection Cell Bank and the cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis at HK Gene Science Technology Co (Beijing, China).

To determine whether a similar expression of S100A7 is present in the other SCCs, six types of SCCs tissue arrays with 452 cases of SCCs were examined for S100A7 expressions using immunohistochemistry. The results showed that 41% of lung SCCs, 76.6% of esophageal SCCs, 50.6% of cervical SCCs, 80.4% of oral SCCs, 84.8% of skin SCCs and 66.7% of bladder SCCs were positive for S100A7 (<xref rid="pone.0128887.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, we found that S100A7 expression was heterogeneous and displayed a patchy or a scattered distribution in all positively stained tissues, and the staining intensity of S100A7 was inversely associated with degree of differentiation in all tested SCC tissues Representative immunoreactivity results are shown in <xref rid="pone.0128887.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A&#x02013;1F</xref>). In addition, S100A7 expression was also found in the normal tissues including cervix and oral cavity, but was absent from normal lung, bladder, esophagus tissues, and skin (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1M&#x02013;1R</xref>). Tissue section using nonspecific IgG as negative control showed no positive staining (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G&#x02013;1L</xref>). Based on the characteristics of S100A7 expression in SCC tissues, we hypothesized that S100A7 heterogeneity may exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, three squamous carcinoma cell lines, including HCC94, FaDu, and A-431 cells, were selected and the S100A7 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. Unlike with HCC94 cells, less than 1% S100A7-positive cells were detected in FaDu and A-431 cells in the normal culture conditions (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>). Cultured cells using nonspecific IgG as negative control showed no positive staining (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D&#x02013;2F</xref>).

cells in vitro and in vivo in SCCs suggest that there is a factor that triggers this difference. It has been reported that S100A7 expression could be induced in HEKn cells under confluent culture [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To investigate whether confluent culture also induces S100A7 expression in SCC cells, HCC94, A-431, and FaDu cells were cultured under confluent conditions. Unfortunately, A-431 and FaDu cells were easily detached in confluent culture, only HCC94 cells were successfully to culture under the confluence for 6 days. Notably, the percentage of S100A7-positive cells was increased from about 10% under the normal culture condition to above 80% under confluence conditions, and then significantly decreased after the confluent cells were reseeded at the pre-confluent density and returned to the original ratio after three cell passages. Although the percentage of S100A7-positive cells was significantly different before and after the confluent culture, the subcellular localization and intensity of the S100A7 immunostaining were the same (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, 3C and 3E</xref>). In contrast, cultured cells using nonspecific IgG as negative control showed no positive staining (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B, 3D and 3F</xref>).

Collectively, these results indicate that S100A7-positive cells could be inducible in HCC94 in the confluent culture and S100A7-negative and&#x02013;positive cells bi-directionally convert to each other, depending on the cell density.</p><fig id="pone.0128887.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0128887.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>The induction of S100A7 expression in HCC94 cells in confluent culture.</title><p>S100A7 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry (A, C, E), real-time PCR (G) and Western blotting (H).

Given that S100A7 and differentiation-specific markers were induced in vitro by same stimuli in the above mentioned SCC cell lines, we wished to know the expression pattern of these proteins in vitro and in vivo. Based on the aforementioned results, we selected keratin-13 to as representative differentiation markers among others. For one reason, keratin-13 could be detected in both HCC94 cells and FaDu cells, whereas, keratin-1 only in A-431 cells but not in HCC94 and FaDu cells. The other reason is that HCC94 xenografts display a distinct squamous differentiation phenotype due to its being a well-differentiated cervical squamous carcinoma cell line. The results revealed that some S100A7-positive cells displayed co-localization with keratin-13-positive cells, but others were not (<xref rid="pone.0128887.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). In HCC94 xenograft, a distinct squamous differentiation phenotype, with clear stratum basale, stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum was found because HCC94 is a well-differentiated cervical squamous carcinoma cell line and becomes well-differentiated in vivo. Notably, S100A7-positive staining in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum was distributed in the both cytoplasm and/or nucleus, but in the stratum basale, staining occurred only in the nucleus. Keratin-13 demonstrated a similar staining pattern in the suprabasal layer where S100A7-positive staining was found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas keratin-13 was only detected in the cytoplasm.

To explore the roles of S100A7 in SCCs, S100A7 knockdown or overexpression was performed in HCC94, FaDu, and A-431 cells, depending on the endogenous levels of S100A7.

The results demonstrated that S100A7 expression occurred in the majority of SCC tissues, with stronger staining in well-differentiated tissues or well-differentiated areas within one section. In addition, this is the first report that S100A7 is also expressed in SCCs of the esophagus and cervix. These results strongly suggest that S100A7 may be a common marker of SCCs. Further examination found that the heterogeneity of S100A7 existed in all S100A7-positive specimens, and S100A7 appeared in a patchy or scattered distribution. Similarly, the heterogeneity of S100A7 was also detected in cultured A-431, FaDu, and HCC94 cells and in their corresponding xenografts. The heterogeneity of the S100A7 in the SCC cells and SCC tissues may be because of the origin of the SCCs, which arise from multilayered epithelia that undergo continuous self-renewal in a basal layer and differentiate to a superficial direction under normal conditions [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the heterogeneity of S100A7 may be caused by the cellular heterogeneity within SCC tissues or cultured cells.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the expression of S100A7 was dramatically induced in all tested SCC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. We suggest two reasons for this difference. First, is the proliferation of S100A7-positive cells in vivo, and second, is S100A7 induction in vivo. In support of this hypothesis are our results showing that S100A7-positive cells are significantly induced by confluent and suspension cultures. Furthermore, S100A7-positive cells also become negative cells when the inducer is removed. These results indicate that S100A7-negative and&#x02013;positive cells might directionally convert to each other depending on the microenvironment, such as cell density or suspension. In addition, we also found that S100A7-positive cells could generate the same positive cells only for limited cell passages in vitro (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that S100A7-positive cells are induced both in vitro and in vivo, either by proliferation or induction or both.</p><p>Although S100A7 and differentiation-specific markers both were inducible expression by confluent and suspension cultures, even in vivo, we found that cell proliferation, survival rate, and/or tumor growth were significantly increased in S100A7 overexpressing cells, whereas the expression differentiation-specific markers was markedly decreased. Conversely, inhibition of cell proliferation and upregulation of differentiation markers were detected by silencing of S100A7. These results indicate that both endogenous and ectopic expression of S100A7 plays the similar role in promoting the growth and inhibiting the differentiation of squamous cancer cells, at least for our tested SCC cells. In addition, overexpressing S100A7 in A-431 cells could dramatically inhibit the induction of differentiation markers by suspension (data not shown). Our unpublished results demonstrated that S100A7 acts as a dual regulator in promoting proliferation and suppressing squamous differentiation through the GATA-3/caspase-14 pathway in A-431 cells. On the other hand, S100A8 and S100A9, two members of the S100 family, display the similar expression and function in SCC. It has been reported that the expression of S100A8/A9 was positively correlated with differentiation in clinical SCC tissues. However, in SCC12 cells, overexpressing S100A8 and/or S100A9 had increased proliferation and cell migration capacity in vitro and also showed increased tumor growth in vivo in SCID mice [<xref rid="pone.0128887.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we conclude that the expression and function of S100A7 are highly cell-type-specific and its functions range from regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>In the present study, we have demonstrated that S100A7 is a common marker of squamous cell carcinomas and displays the cellular heterogeneity in SCC tissues and cells. In addition, S100A7-positive cells could be inducible in SCC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo depending on the microenvironments. S100A7 acts as a dual regulator in promoting cell growth and inhibiting cell differentiation. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of S100A7 induction and its exact role in cell differentiation are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128887.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The expression of keratin-4 and keratin-13 in A-431 cells.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128887.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128887.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers used for each of the genes.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128887.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0128887.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
