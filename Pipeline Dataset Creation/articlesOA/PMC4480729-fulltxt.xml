Here, we assessed the role of CD9 in adhesion, migration and invasiveness of BCCs. We used co-cultures of BCCs and bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and analyzed their behavior and morphology by dynamic total internal reflection fluorescence, confocal and scanning electron microscopy. 83, 16 and 10% of contacts between MDA-MB-231 (MDA), MA-11 or MCF-7 cells and MSCs, respectively, resulted in MSC invasion. MDA cells developed long magnupodia, lamellipodia and dorsal microvilli, whereas long microvilli emerged from MA-11 cells. MCF-7 cells displayed large dorsal ruffles. CD9 knockdown and antibody blockage in MDA cells inhibited MSC invasion by 95 and 70%, respectively, suggesting that CD9 is required for this process. Remarkably, CD9-deficient MDA cells displayed significant alteration of their plasma membrane, harboring numerous peripheral and dorsal membrane ruffles instead of intact magnupodium/lamellipodium and microvillus, respectively. Such modification might explain the delayed adhesion, and hence MSC invasion. In agreement with this hypothesis, CD9-knockdown suppressed the metastatic capacity of MDA cells in mouse xenografts. Our data indicate that CD9 is implicated in BCC invasiveness and metastases by cellular mechanisms that involve specific CD9<sup>+</sup> plasma membrane protrusions of BCCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>CD9</kwd><kwd>cell invasion</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane protrusions</kwd><kwd>tetraspanin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The formation of breast cancer metastases requires an interaction in the tumor microenvironment between malignant epithelia and local stroma [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to adhere to, communicate with, and transfer materials to/from stromal cells, breast cancer cells (BCCs) often employ different types of plasma membrane protrusions (PMPs), including filopodia and lamellipodia [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some of these PMPs are also instrumental for BCCs to spread and reach distant sites, helping them to move between, and invade, stromal cells. In addition to passing through intercellular gap junctions, BCCs can use a transcellular route for intra/extra-vasation, essential steps of the metastatic process [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cancer cell invasion is also at the basis of <italic>entosis</italic>, cell-in-cell structures observed in a variety of tumors [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and of the formation of hybrid cancer cells by cell-cell fusion, which contributes to aneuploidy and aberrant gene expression patterns [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tetraspanin-29 (CD9, motility-related protein-1) is involved in the metastatic process and depending on the context as a metastasis suppressor or promoter [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Physiologically, it is involved in cell fusion, adhesion, motility, proliferation, and signaling [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and is required for egg-sperm fusion leading to fertilization [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CD9 has also an important role in muscle cell fusion [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in canine distemper virus and HIV-1-induced cell-cell fusion [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on its physiological importance and its putative involvement in cancer metastasis, we sought to investigate whether CD9 has a role in the cellular interaction between human BCCs and bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We found that CD9 is expressed on diverse types of PMPs of BCCs, and is required for MSC invasion. CD9 disruption resulted in profound alterations of plasma membrane of BCCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, including the impaired formation of magnupodium, lamellipodium and microvillus. Upon transplantation of CD9-deficient cells in a murine model, an inhibition of tumor growth was observed after one week as well as a partial loss of metastatic capacity. These novel CD9 functions could be exploited to develop innovative breast cancer therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Differential expression of CD9 among BCC lines</title><p>In this study, we used three distinct cell lines to investigate the implication of CD9 in BCC invasiveness and tumorigenicity. Its cell surface expression was monitored by flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BCCs displayed a heterogeneous expression of CD9 which comprised 74, 19 and 59% of total cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, blue). The differential CD9 expression among cell lines is also observed at mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Although the underlying cause of such heterogeneous expression is unknown, we observed conversion in culture of CD9<sup>+</sup> into CD9<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells and vice versa. Indeed, upon sorting of CD9<sup>+</sup> and CD9<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MDA cell fraction (&#x0003e;99.8 % pure) from an exponential culture growth and their subsequent culture for 6 or 12 days, both cell fractions reformed mixed population with a ratio similar to parental MDA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Expression and functions of CD9 in BCCs</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Flow cytometric analysis of MDA, MA-11, MCF-7 (blue) and CD9shRNA (red) cells labeled with PE-conjugated anti-CD9 mAb.

MSCs were derived from pooled bone marrow samples of healthy adult donors, and cultured on poly-L-lysine as a substratum [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To visualize them, BCCs and MSCs were transduced with DsRed- and GFP-based retroviral vectors, respectively. In 1:1 ratio co-cultures of DsRed-expressing MDA, MA-11 or MCF-7 cells with MSCs-GFP, we observed that 83% of direct contacts between MDA-MSC resulted in MSC invasion, whereas only 16 and 10% of MA-11-MSC and MCF-7-MSC contacts lead to an invasion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, D, F, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video S1</xref>). Since the evanescent TIRF wave penetrates only 100-150 nm into the sample [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], overlapping fluorescence (green and red) signal did not derive from cell stacking, but from cell-cell invasion. Under same conditions, no invasion of human mammary epithelial cells (HuMECs) into MSCs was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we targeted the expression of CD9 by lentiviral-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) transduction using a pool of three distinct anti-CD9 shRNAs. Its expression was abrogated in MDA, MA-11 and MCF-7 cell lines as observed by flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Upon CD9 knockdown, we found a 10-fold increase in the expression of CD81, a tetraspanin protein-interacting partner of CD9, in MDA CD9shRNA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CD81 could potentially compensate for the lack of CD9 as reported in other cellular systems including knockout models, and consequently attempt to rescue the CD9 deficient phenotype [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 5- and 3-fold decreases in the expression of tetraspanin CD63 and ADAM10, respectively, were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). ADAM10 is a sheddase that cleaves Her2 (CD340), of which the latter oncogene plays a role in the development and progression of aggressive breast cancers [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The abrogation of CD9 expression neither affects the growth rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) nor the clonogenic ability of MDA cells (clonogenicity of 41.5 +/&#x02212; 1.3% and 42.1 +/&#x02212; 2.2% for MDA and MDA CD9 shRNA cells, respectively). Remarkably, MSC invasion rates of CD9-deficient MDA cells were significantly inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video S2</xref>). Such phenomenon was not a consequence of the reduction of BCC-MSC contacts, since CD9-deficient cells showed more contacts with MSCs than parental cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). Finally, the invasiveness of MDA or MA-11 cells was evaluated using anti-CD9 blocking antibody (Ab). Again, MDA and MA-11 invasiveness were significantly inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, E, H</xref>), although the interactions of BCCs and MSCs were unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CD9-dependent invasion of MDA or MA-11 cells into MSCs</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Representative TIRF time-lapse images showing the partial/complete invasion, egress and trans-cell migration of MDA-DsRed cells into GFP-transduced MSCs over 12 h period.

The characteristics of different types of PMPs generated by MDA, MDA CD9 shRNA, MCF-7 and MA-11 cells are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. while parental MDA cells were spread and created lamellipodia and filopodia close to the poly-L-lysine substratum, or interestingly, above the neighboring cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-C</xref>, white asterisks and black arrows, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), CD9-deficient cells displayed a certain impairment in adhesion, particularly at their cell border where numerous membrane ruffles were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F</xref>, arcs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, arcs). As a consequence, the knockdown of CD9 resulted in delayed adhesion of MDA cells as well as MA-11 and MCF-7 to poly-L-lysine (not shown) or tissue culture-treated plastic substratum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In addition, the knockdown of CD9 caused severe modifications of the plasmalemma of MDA cells. While microvillus-like structures covered the apex of parental MDA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, black arrowheads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), they were rarely observed in an intact form in MDA CD9 shRNA cells, suggesting the implication of CD9 in their proper morphogenesis. In contrast, many dorsal ruffles were present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, green asterisks; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, MDA cells developed very long, and often thick (0.5-1.2 &#x003bc;m) PMPs (referred to as magnupodia), which extended for up to 100 micrometers away from the cell body and adhered either to the substratum or to another cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>, dashed arrows). Frequently, a lamellipodium was found at their tip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>, white asterisks). Sometimes, the magnupodium seemed not to interact directly with the substratum with the exception of its ending lamellipodium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Generally, the MDA cells harboring a magnupodium had fibroblast-like structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Magnupodia were detected less often in MDA CD9 shRNA cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that CD9 is somehow involved in their formation and/or stabilization (see below for the localization of CD9 in these PMPs). Finally, both parental and CD9-deficient MDA cells exhibited numerous small and thin processes emerging from their dorsal part, which were able to link two neighboring cells or to establish a contact with the substratum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, white arrows; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>A similar analysis was performed on MCF-7 and MA-11 cells. MCF-7 cells were spread and created lamellipodia/filopodia as observed for MDA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>, white asterisks and black arrows, respectively). No magnupodium was observed in MCF-7 cells or very rarely with MA-11 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F, G</xref>, dashed arrows). Likewise, no or rare thin processes emerging from their dorsal part could be detected. In contrast, MCF-7 cells harbored large dorsal ruffles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B-E</xref>, black asterisks). MA-11 cells also produced lamellipodia/filopodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F-H</xref>, white asterisks and black arrows, respectively) and developed peripheral ruffles similar to CD9-deficient MDA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F-H</xref>, arcs). Remarkably, MA-11 cells were often covered with numerous long microvillus-like structures (3.013 &#x000b1; 0.948 &#x003bc;m by comparison to 1.069 &#x000b1; 0.146 in MDA cells, n &#x0003e; 100; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F-J</xref>, black arrowheads). The latter structures are particularly interesting since they seem to link adjacent cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Distinctive morphological traits and common features of different breast cancer cell lines</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MDA</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD9shRNA<break/>(MDA)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MA-11</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MCF-7</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shape and growing profile</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spindle, and sometimes growing above each other</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Polygonal, cell cluster</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Polygonal, cell cluster</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Polygonal, cell cluster</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Morphology at the cell border</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lamellipodia and filopodia</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lamellipodia and filopodia</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lamellipodia and filopodia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peripheral ruffles</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peripheral ruffles</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">magnupodium<break/>(length 73 &#x000b1;

CD9 was observed either by immunolabeling or upon the ectopic expression of CD9-GFP fusion protein. Both approaches gave similar data indicating that fusion protein is properly targeted to PMPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-E</xref>). CD9 is detected in (i) microvilli; (ii) branched web-like filopodia, which are morphologically similar to the described nanopodia that play a role in cell adhesion [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; (iii) unbranched filopodia bundles, associated with directional movement (see below); (iv) short filopodia; (v) magnupodia; and (vi) lamellipodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, arrow). The different CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs were present either when MDA cells were cultured alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, C</xref>) or with DiD-labeled MSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, H</xref>). As observed by SEM, MDA cells deployed a long magnupodium away from the cell body towards a neighboring one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, white asterisk). Magnupodia tended to float in the medium and, with fluid motion, to extend downstream, whereas the cell remained adherent to the substratum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The morphology of magnupodia suggests that they may play sensory and mechanical roles during cell migration. During retraction, the extended materials often pooled into a bulb located on the pod (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Both MDA and MDA-CD9-GFP cells contained CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs between them that could play a role in cell-cell adhesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, I, J</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p>We then evaluated the number of CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs emerging from MDA, MA-11 and MCF-7 cells transfected with CD9-GFP fusion plasmid by confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In both MA-11 and MCF-7 cells, shorter and less frequent CD9-GFP<sup>+</sup> PMPs than MDA cells were observed as suggested by SEM analyses. The calculated area of PMPs for MDA cells was 4200.0 +/&#x02212; 732.1 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, 1583.3 +/&#x02212; 215.0 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> for MA-11 cells, and 716.7 +/&#x02212; 269.7 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> for MCF-7 cells (for technical details see Methods). The numbers of CD9-GFP<sup>+</sup> PMPs is significantly higher in MDA cells by comparison to MA-11 (p = 0.02) and MCF-7 (p = 0.01) cells. MA-11 cells did have a greater frequency of CD9-GFP<sup>+</sup> PMPs than MCF-7 cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047).</p><p>Interestingly, CD9<sup>+</sup> filopodia and thin PMPs were negative (or below the detectable level) for &#x003b1;-tubulin (acetylated and non-acetylated) and &#x003b2;1 integrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I-K</xref>). IgSF8, a binding partner of CD9, was located along CD9<sup>+</sup> filopodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L</xref>). CD44, which is known to associate with CD9, was observed in CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs including microvilli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). CD9 and CD44 showed a strong co-localization with a Pearson's co-localization coefficient of 0.87 +/&#x02212; 0.02. Similarly, CD9 co-localized with CD81 on the plasma membrane and PMPs thereof (Pearson's R value 0.82 +/&#x02212; 0.04) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>). A co-localization of CD9 and CD81 was also observed in filopodia and cell footprints (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>, respectively), the latter being fragments of PMPs that remain attached to the substratum when cells are migrating further [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These footprints were degraded over time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, white arrows). CD81 was also detected at the apex of parental MDA/MDA control shRNA and MDA-CD9 shRNA cells where microvillus-like structures and small dorsal ruffles are found, respectively, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Likewise, numerous thin membrane processes with small membranous bulges that establish a contact with the substratum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D, G</xref>) or with either neighboring MDA cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>, arrowheads) or MSCs-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) were positive for CD81. Given the localization of CD81 and CD9 in various types of PMPs this alternative marker allows us to quantify the number of PMPs in CD9-deficient MDA cells. Fluorescence measurements of CD81<sup>+</sup> PMPs were not significantly different between MDA (272.3 +/&#x02212; 41.9), MDA CD9shRNA (372.6 +/&#x02212; 41.9) and MDA control shRNA (354.1 +/&#x02212; 26.5) cells, suggesting that the knockdown of CD9 did not reduce them with the notable exception of magnupodia (see above; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Although the total expression level of CD81 was increased upon CD9 knockdown as observed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), the lack of intensified immunofluorescence signal in MDA CD9shRNA cells might be explained by its oligomerization or other protein-protein interactions where certain CD81 epitopes will be masked. Neither the morphology of MDA cells nor the number of CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs derived therefrom were affected when they were transduced with control shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>MDA-CD9-GFP cells were transfected with a &#x003b2;-actin-mCherry fusion plasmid to determine the relationship between the dynamics of filopodia and cell movement, and the presence of actin in CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs. When MDA-CD9-GFP-&#x003b2;-actin-mCherry cells were co-cultured with DiD-labeled MSCs, unbranched filopodia bundles containing CD9 appeared at a 163<sup>o</sup> +/&#x02212; 14<sup>o</sup> (s.d.) angle from the direction of MDA cell movement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I</xref>, top panel). The average ratio of unbranched filopodia expansion/distance traveled by the cell was 0.82 +/&#x02212; 0.089 (s.d.). This indicated that as a MDA cell migrated, the distance traveled was almost equal to the length of the growing filopodia. The actin was located solely at the base of the filopodia bundles during cell migration, and consequently did not extend through the length of the CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I</xref>, bottom panel). Together, these observations suggest that trailing filopodia could influence the speed and direction of the cancer cell migration. Thus, they might guide the invasion cells in a 3-dimensional (3D) microenvironment.</p><p>Magnupodia with lamellipodia at their leading edge containing both CD9 and CD81 were observed in MDA cells as well as MDA-CD9-GFP cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2D</xref>). These lamellipodia were involved in MDA cell invasion into MSCs, as shown in co-cultures of MDA/MDA-CD9-GFP cells with MSC-GFP/MSCs, the latter ones being either labeled with DiI or transiently transfected with &#x003b2;-actin-mCherry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video S3</xref>). Live-cell TIRF imaging of co-cultures of MDA-CD9-GFP with MSC-&#x003b2;-actin-mCherry cells showed the formation of a CD9<sup>+</sup> magnupodium extending from an MDA cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), similar to those observed by SEM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Upon its initial contact with the MSC, a cell invasion occurred. Given that the CD9 deficiency dramatically reduced the number of MSC invasions and no magnupodia was observed in MDA CD9shRNA cells, these observations suggest that CD9-dependent magnupodia is the main PMPs of MDA cells involved in the invasion of MSCs.</p><p>Interestingly, TIRF imaging revealed a progressive transfer of materials from MSCs-&#x003b2;-actin-mCherry to MDA-CD9-GFP cells. Thus we could observe a large portion of an MSC being taken up by an MDA-CD9-GFP cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video S4</xref>). Although such phenomenon is rare (~1-2 events/50,000 cells) under our experimental setting, it is nonetheless observable.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs on BCCs</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Confocal images were taken every 25 min of live CD9-GFP-transfected MDA cells cultured with DiD-labeled MSCs.

Interestingly, cellular invasion was associated with spontaneous fusion of MDA or MA-11 cells with MSCs, which amounted to 0.68 and 0.12% according to initial number of plated BCCs, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The pre-incubation with two different CD9 blocking Abs caused a decrease of fusion between MDA cells and MSCs. The knockdown of CD9 in both cell lines totally abrogated the heterologous fusion. No fusion events were observed between the less aggressive MCF-7 cells or HuMECs with MSCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, most invasion events did not result in heterologous fusion. To investigate the relationship between invasion and cell fusion, we sorted and re-plated dual (red-green) fluorescent cells originated from mixed BCC/MSC co-cultures. When analyzed within 60 min from sorting, cells showed different morphological stages of invasion and presence of dual fluorescent cells (about 30%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A, B</xref>). However, 24 hours later, about 1% of the double-positive cells were present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>, the latter fraction of cells included viable hybrids, i.e. able to divide and form dual fluorescent progeny with mesenchymal morphology, as previously described [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Disappearance of dual fluorescent cells could not be attributed to selective cell death of the hybrids, since trypan blue dye exclusion revealed that was over 99% of cell viability. Indeed, the majority of sorted dual-color cells was confirmed not to be stable hybrids, four days after sorting, by a single broad DNA peak with a DNA index of 1.2 including both diploid MSCs (DNA index 1.0) and MDA cells (1.25). These data suggest that the double-fluorescent cells observed by flow cytometry represented for the most part transient stages of invasion. We observed occasional occurrence of entosis, with presence of Ds-Red in the cytoplasm of MSCs, evidenced by yellow fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, mix of red and green).</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Effect of anti-CD9 antibodies and CD9 knockdown on formation of breast cancer/MSC hybrids</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MDA/MSC</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% hybrids &#x000b1; S.D.<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn_001"><sup>1</sup></xref></th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.68 &#x000b1; 0.16</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-CD9 (MEM-61)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.15 &#x000b1; 0.10</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.007</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-CD9 (M-L 13)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.184 &#x000b1; 0.16</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.016</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anti-CD9 (P1/33/2)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5 &#x000b1; 0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD9 knockdown</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0018</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>MA-11/MSC</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.12 &#x000b1; 0.05</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD9 knockdown</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.022</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>MCF-7/MSC</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD9 knockdown</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>HuMEC/MSC</bold></td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn_001"><label>1</label><p>2000 BCCs and 8000 MSCs were plated together (24-well plate) and dual fluorescence of heterotypic hybrids was counted after 6 days of co-cultures.

In the present study, we characterized CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs of BCCs as pro-invasive and fusogenic, found a direct correlation between the extent of CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs and BCC invasiveness and established CD9 as a molecule required for the correct formation of certain types of PMPs, notably the long magnupodium.</p><p>In MDA cells, migration, invasiveness and subsequent heterologous fusion were achieved by CD9-dependent lamellipodia including those found at the tip of magnupodia (see Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), which in <italic>in vivo</italic> 3D-microenvironment could appear as invadopodia. The absence of CD9 impaired their formation and/or destabilized them, which resulted in numerous membrane ruffles at the edge of MDA CD9shRNA cells, and hence the lack of firm adhesion therein. Interestingly, while CD9 knockdown and blocking Abs severely hindered invasion and cell fusion, the overall adhesion properties of MDA CD9shRNA cells to MSCs were nonetheless preserved or seemingly increased. These data are in agreement with earlier results showing that the lack of fusion in <italic>Cd9</italic> null eggs was not accompanied by loss of sperm&#x02013;egg adhesion [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but rather by an increase in sperm binding sites [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Such observation suggests that CD9 deficiency lead to a compensatory mechanism responsible for the maintenance of cellular adhesion. The increased expression of CD9-interacting partner CD81 observed in CD9-deficient cells might explain it. CD81 was constantly associated with CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs. We are currently using atomic force microscopy-based single-cell force spectroscopy to quantify the adhesive BCC-MSC interaction(s) and decipher further these issues. Nonetheless, the up regulation of CD81 did not compensate the MSC invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> or cancer progression and metastasis capacity of CD9-deficient MDA cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in agreement with previous studies (see below; reviewed in Ref [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p><p>It is worth to mention that thin CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs, which often interact with those emerging from neighboring cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, white arrows), are reminiscent to long and thin nanopodia recently described in endothelial cells [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Like those described here, they contain a tetraspanin protein, namely transmembrane-4-L-six-family (TM4SF1). The function of such TM4SF1/CD9<sup>+</sup> membrane projections is not yet clear but they might play a role in intercellular communication or sensing the microenvironment. In addition, the implication of CD9<sup>+</sup> filopodia in keratinocyte wound healing migration or lymphocyte trans-endothelial migration has been previously reported [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Obviously, further efforts are urged to determine their implication in cancer progression.</p><p>Magnupodia and thin PMPs are rarely observed in MA-11 cells, and their invasiveness and fusogenicity might be related to the long microvillus-like structures (~3 &#x003bc;m in length) that originate from the cell border, and collectively form a &#x0201c;microvilli zipper&#x0201d; between adjacent BCCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The formation of CD9-dependent microvilli zippers is not unique to cancer cells since similar structures have been demonstrated to regulate virus-induced cell fusion [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, CD9<sup>+</sup> microvillus-like structures could act as a platform to concentrate adhesion and/or fusion proteins such as CD44. Is CD9 directly involved in the microvillar architecture? A hint of its direct structural role was already provided in <italic>Cd9</italic> null oocytes, where numerous alterations (length, thickness and density) in microvillus-like structures were noted [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Similarly, we observed that CD9 knockdown causes alterations of microvillus-like structures at the dorsal part of MDA cells, which resulted in the appearance of tiny dorsal ruffles. CD9 proteins together with the tetraspanin web could provide the appropriate shape of PMPs including a low radius of curvature necessary for membrane fusion [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, we could not exclude that dorsal microvillus-like structures of MDA cells participate as well in cellular interaction/fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> given that they might be in direct contact with adjacent cells in a native microenvironment in contrast to 2D cell cultures. Besides the components of PMPs (i.e. lamellipodia/magnupodia in MDA cells and microvillus-like structures in MA-11 cells), other actors may be involved in bridging adjacent membranous structures <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as soluble factors and/or microvesicles [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, CD9 is a major constituent of exosomes released by MDA cells (Green et al., unpublished data). Since inflammation is often associated with tumor microenvironment, adhesion-promoting factors released by hematopoietic cells could also play a role [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The impairment of BCCs invasion into MSCs, caused either by CD9 deficiency or Ab interference, led to decrease of heterotypic cell-cell fusion &#x02013; potential source of genomic instability, aneuploidy and cancer heterogeneity &#x02013; hallmarks of cancer progression. A direct relation between invasiveness and fusogenicity is nonetheless not surprising, in view of previous findings showing that in high-density homotypic cultures, MDA cells were 11- and 7.2-fold more fusogenic and capable of invading Matrigel matrix, respectively, than MA-11 cells [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although only a minority of invasion events resulted in formation of hybrid cells (e.g., MDA/MA-11&#x02013;MSC), our previous study demonstrated that after 5 days of drug selection 80% of cells in mixed cultures were hybrids, capable of forming metastatic tumors in immune-deficient hosts, suggesting that the current phenomenon is biologically pertinent [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, we occasionally observed in our co-cultures a phenomenon entosis, which is implicated in cancer aneuploidy and progression [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], our adherent BCCs and MSCs were not favorable to its occurrence since the entosis mainly happens in suspension cultures [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>It might not be more a coincidence that MCF-7 a much less aggressive and poorly metastatic BCC line [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], displays less CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs than MDA cells and has poor invasive and fusogenic capacities. These observations strongly suggest that local cellular interactions in the microenvironment, presumably mediated by CD9<sup>+</sup> PMPs, play an important role in the breast cancer metastatic phenotype. While MDA cells are triple negative (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Her-2), and belong to Basal-like subtype of breast carcinomas, MCF-7 cells are ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup>/Her-2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and fell within Luminal-A subtype [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Tumors of Basal-like subtype are aggressive, poorly differentiated and often occur on younger patients with a poor prognosis by comparison to those of Luminal-A subtype, which are more differentiated and observed in older patients with the best prognosis contrasted to other subtypes [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, the presence and/or absence of certain types of PMPs (e.g., magnupodium, long microvilli, membrane ruffles) can contribute, in addition to the molecular signature, to the classification of breast carcinomas.</p><p>The requirement of CD9 for orthotopic tumor growth suggests that membrane extension-driven cell communication and/or reduced cell adhesiveness to stromal components are responsible for the absence of local tumor growth. We should also keep in mind that CD9-deficiency leads to decreased expression of ADAM10, a metalloproteinase that could play a role in breast cancer progression [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Nonetheless, the formation of metastases, although reduced, was not fully abrogated by CD9 knockdown. This may reflect the capacity of BCCs of intra/extravasating <italic>in vivo</italic> through tight endothelial junctions rather than trans-cellular route and/or to decreased adhesiveness caused by CD9 deficiency that could facilitate metastatic dissemination. Recent findings that the CD9/CD81 tetraspanin complex regulates &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 integrin-dependent tumor cell behavior [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and that integrin &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 promotes breast carcinoma metastases [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] suggests that the anti-metastatic effect observed upon CD9 knockdown could depend on the CD9 regulation of &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1-integrin. However, we did not detect association between CD9 and &#x003b2;1-integrin in MDA cells.</p><p>Our findings are intriguing in the context of the &#x0201c;push and pull&#x0201d; role of tetraspanins in metastases [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]: while an inverse correlation between CD9 expression and metastatic potential was observed in some studies [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], a pro-metastatic role of CD9 was observed in others [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>-<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Interestingly, while melanoma cells had reduced CD9 expression relative to normal melanocytes, forced increase in CD9 expression stimulated their invasiveness [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, CD9 was down regulated in primary sites of cervical cancers, but re-expressed at sites of trans-endothelial invasion to promote malignant expansion at metastatic sites [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Collectively, our data indicate that CD9 is implicated in BCC invasiveness and tumor growth by mechanisms that involve specific and dynamics protruding structures of BCC plasma membrane. Investigation of CD9-targeted breast cancer therapeutic strategies is warranted.</p><fig id="F10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Two distinct potential mechanisms involved in cancer cell invasion and fusion</title><p><bold>A</bold>-<bold>F.</bold> MDA (A-C) and MA-11 (D-F) cells grown on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips were analyzed by SEM.

Cells stained with Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab alone were employed as a control. The cells were washed with PBS prior to viewing on a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope. The Coloc 2 plugin of Fiji was used to determine Pearson's coefficients of ROIs within background-subtracted images. Averages are reported +/&#x02212; s.e.m.</p></sec><sec id="s4_14"><title>Cell Fluorescence and Membrane Protrusion Analysis</title><p>Images of MDA lines were acquired under the same microscope settings for calculations of mean protrusion fluorescence. All analysis was performed using Fiji. Maximum intensity projections of CD9 or CD81 z-stacks were thresholded until all cells were visible, and ROI outlines of cells created using the &#x0201c;analyze particles&#x0201d; function. Mean fluorescence and integrated density were measured within cell outlines that were overlayed onto original z-stacks. Mean protrusion fluorescence was calculated by subtracting the integrated density (mean fluorescence x area) of the cell body from the entire cell (which included protrusions), then dividing by the area difference: Mean protrusion fluorescence = (Int Dens total - Int Dens cell body)/(Area total &#x02013; Area cell body). The z-slice containing the maximum fluorescence and its two surrounding z-slices were averaged for at least 4 XY positions to calculate mean protrusion and total fluorescence. ROI outlines of MDA-CD9-GFP, MA-11-CD9-GFP, and MCF-7-CD9-GFP lines were created as described above. Areas of protrusions were quantified by subtracting the area of the cell body from the total cell area for at least 3 XY positions. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis were used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between BCC lines in terms of protrusion area and fluorescence. A minimum of 100 cells was evaluated for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4_15"><title>Scanning Electron Microscopy</title><p>BCCs and MDA CD9shRNA cells were plated and grown on coverslips coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (#P4707, Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany). After 2 days, they were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following 2-h post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4&#x000b0;C, they were subjected to dehydration in an acetone gradient (25&#x02013;100%) and critical point-dried in a CO<sub>2</sub> system (Critical Point Dryer, Leica Microsystems, EM CPD 300, Wetzlar, Germany). Samples were then sputter-coated with gold (sputter coating device SCD 050; BAL-TEC GmbH, Witten, Germany) and examined at 5-kV accelerating voltage in field emission scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM 7500F, Japan). The dimension (length and thickness) of various PMPs was quantified using ImageJ [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_16"><title><italic>In Vivo</italic> Studies</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> studies were performed by AntiCancer, Inc. upon approval by the AntiCancer Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals under Assurance No. A3873-01. NU/NU nude mice from Charles River (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.criver.com/products-services/basic-research/find-a-model/nu-nu-nude-mouse">http://www.criver.com/products-services/basic-research/find-a-model/nu-nu-nude-mouse</ext-link>) were kept within a barrier under HEPA filtration. and fed autoclaved laboratory rodent diet (Tecklad LM-485, Western Research Products, Orange, CA, USA). Viable MDA-DsRed and MDA-DsRed-CD9shRNA cells (6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l 50% growth factor-reduced Matrigel and injected orthotopically into the second thoracic gland of 5-6 weeks old female <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice (10 animals/group). Mice were randomized based on age and weight. No blinding was done. Tumor size was measured by live-animal fluorescence imaging (FluorVivo) once per week and at study termination. Open imaging was performed to check metastases using the Olympus OV-100 imaging system (Olympus) at study termination. Mice were euthanized when the tumor burden exceeded 10 mm. in greater diameter. Euthanasia was achieved by 100% carbon dioxide inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL, FIGURES, TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="avi" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-7970-s001.avi" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1663" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="avi" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-7970-s002.avi" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1665" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="avi" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-7970-s003.avi" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1667" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="avi" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-7970-s004.avi" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1669" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-06-7970-s005.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1671" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Harry Rosenberg and Renee Coffman for their constant support; Fabio Anzanello for invaluable technical assistance; Giuseppe Pizzorno for critical reading of the manuscript; and Darwin Prockop for human MSCs through grant # P40RR017447 from NCRR of the NIH.
