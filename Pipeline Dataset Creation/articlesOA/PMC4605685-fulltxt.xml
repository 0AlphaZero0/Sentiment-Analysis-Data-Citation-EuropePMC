Engineering C<sub>4</sub> traits into C<sub>3</sub> crops has been proposed as one of the most promising ways to repeal the biomass yield ceiling. To better understand the function of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, and to identify candidate genes that are associated with the C<sub>4</sub> pathways, a comparative transcription network analysis was conducted on leaf developmental gradients of three C<sub>4</sub> species including maize, green foxtail and sorghum and one C<sub>3</sub> species, rice. By combining the methods of gene co-expression and differentially co-expression networks, we identified a total of 128 C<sub>4</sub> specific genes. Besides the classic C<sub>4</sub> shuttle genes, a new set of genes associated with light reaction, starch and sucrose metabolism, metabolites transportation, as well as transcription regulation, were identified as involved in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. These findings will provide important insights into the differential gene regulation between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, and a good genetic resource for establishing C<sub>4</sub> pathways in C<sub>3</sub> crops.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>) grant 31271393 to PL the National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</ext-link>) grant IOS-1127017 to TPB and QS.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>With growing population and increasing urbanization, humanity faces a looming food crisis, which to prevent, will require yields to be increased by at least 50% over the next 40 years [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, extreme climate changes, decreasing availability of water and energy resources, and competitions between grains for bio-fuels and food could worsen the situation. One of the most promising solutions is to introduce the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathways into C<sub>3</sub> crops such as rice and soybeans, to improve their water, radiation, and nitrogen use efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], resulting in higher yields than present day C<sub>3</sub> crops [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made to introduce C<sub>4</sub> traits into C<sub>3</sub> plants, for example the work carried out by the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://irri.org/c4rice">http://irri.org/c4rice</ext-link>). Although none of them have so far demonstrated significantly enhanced photosynthetic properties in transgenic plants, the expression patterns and activities of many known C<sub>4</sub> associated genes and proteins were thoroughly studied, and can be used as the basis for future engineering attempts [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several features of studied C<sub>4</sub> genes are: (1) The C<sub>4</sub> pathway independently evolved more than 60 times from C<sub>3</sub> plants [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Orthologues of genes encoding classic C<sub>4</sub> enzymes preexisted in their C<sub>3</sub> ancestors but are usually lowly expressed in C<sub>3</sub> plants, while in C<sub>4</sub> plants these genes are highly expressed and co-regulated by multiple stimuli, e.g., light [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; (2) Many proteins, encoded by multi-gene families and thought to fulfill housekeeping functions in C<sub>3</sub> species [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], are recruited into the C<sub>4</sub> pathway after a neo-function is acquired for the C<sub>4</sub> paralog [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which may change its gene expression pattern [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; (3) C<sub>4</sub> genes are often expressed in a cell-type specific manner, i.e. bundle sheath (BS) or mesophyll (ME) cells. These characteristics could be exploited to identify novel C<sub>4</sub> genes as well as their regulatory networks, which in practice could provide guidance for strategies of establishing the C<sub>4</sub> cycle in C<sub>3</sub> plants, e.g., by transferring a group of genes instead of a single gene into C<sub>3</sub> crops [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>With recent advances in sequencing technologies, genome assemblies of multiple C<sub>4</sub> species including maize [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], sorghum [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and new C<sub>4</sub> model species, foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria Italica</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], are currently available, providing a good opportunity to dissect the C<sub>4</sub> pathway using system biology approaches. To date, several transcriptomics and proteomics studies have provided insight into C<sub>4</sub> gene expression and protein accumulation by comparative analysis of BS and ME cells in maize [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], green foxtail (<italic>Setaria viridis</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and rice [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], transcriptional profiling along a leaf development gradient in maize [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and between maize and rice [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and between both distantly and closely related C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hundreds of differentially accumulated genes and proteins were identified and functionally characterized.

Recently, novel cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements and candidate transcription factors of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have been identified, by comparing sets of leaf gradient transcriptome data from maize and rice [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In that study, transcriptome data from anatomically and developmentally different leaf sections of maize and rice were projected to a unified gradient to facilitate cross-species clustering analysis on orthologue gene sets. The limitation of this approach is that when studying tissues from two species that are very divergent, it is not always feasible to project a unified gradient.</p><p>Gene co-expression network analysis, which uses transcriptomic data (either microarray or RNA-seq data) to group genes according to the similarity of their expression profiles [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], is one of the most powerful methods to explore genes relationships and to predict their function. It is presumed that genes that exhibit similar expression profiles across various tissues/samples are often functionally related [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The identified groups are referred to as modules, while the gene relationships within groups are referred to as networks, where nodes represent genes, and edges represent the correlations between pairs of genes [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

When multiple species data are available, this process can be refined by extracting the gene co-expression networks found independently in each species, as biologically irrelevant associations caused by noise are not likely to be repeatedly observed in the co-expression networks in different species [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two different strategies can be used for multi-species comparisons: (1) To find conserved modules across species with common gene orthologues [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and then compare their expression patterns and expression levels, (2) to detect differentially co-expressed modules in which gene orthologues show different network structures between species.</p><p>In the present study, expression profiles of segments along a leaf developmental gradient [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], was used to conduct gene co-expression analysis in one C<sub>3</sub> and three C<sub>4</sub> species. The goal of our study was to identify C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes, which are light-regulated and functionally different between C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> species (e.g., different expression levels, different expression patterns, present in C<sub>4</sub> species but absent in C<sub>3</sub> species), through genome-wide transcriptome data comparisons. Such C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes may be used in the future as a useful source for engineering C<sub>4</sub> traits into C<sub>3</sub> crops for production improvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material</title><p>In total, leaf gradient transcription data from four species, including one C<sub>3</sub> (rice) and three C<sub>4</sub> (maize, green foxtail and sorghum), were used in this study.

We believed the data from green foxtail is reliable based on following reasons: (1) the samples of green foxtail showed very similar clustering patterns as maize and sorghum throughout all the sections (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>); (2) the expression patterns of classical C<sub>4</sub> genes (e.g., PPDK, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME), which were used as case control in our study, were the same as maize and sorghum; (3) additional two C<sub>4</sub> species (maize and sorghum) were also used, the cross species validation designed in the study can minimize the false-positive results due to lack of replication in green foxtail.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, CA) following the manufacturer's suggestion from four species and subsequent RNA-seq libraries were constructed according to Wang et al.

After sequence quality examination, reads were mapped to the reference genomes (B73_AGPv2 for maize via MaizeSequence.org, rice_v6 for rice via rice.plantbiology.msu.edu, and JGIv2.0.21 for green foxtail and Sorbi1.22 for sorghum via plants.ensembl.org) using Tophat v2.0.10 [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with most default settings (e.g., mismatches = 2, threads = 6) but without novel junctions detection (&#x02014;no-novel-juncs).

In order to render the network scale free, different soft thresholding powers (e.g., 10 for maize, 12 for green foxtail, 18 for sorghum and 16 for rice) were chosen to transform Pearson similarity matrix into an adjacency matrix. Modules were determined by the dynamic tree cut method, and modules with high correlated genes (e.g., Pearson correlation &#x0003e; = 0.9) were merged.

DiffCoEx was originally designed to cluster genes using a novel dissimilarity measurement computed from the topological overlap of the correlation changes between biological conditions. In this study, this method was adapted to detect gene correlation changes between species. Intuitively, it would detect genes that are significantly co-expressed in one species but not the other. The original code did not separate the positive and negative correlations. It was modified in this study to separate the two types of correlations by an extra step of clustering. The threshold of differentially co-expression module detection was increased, so that only genes with high contrast of connectivity between species were included. More specifically, the cutoff was set as difference of correlation greater than 0.7 in more than 10% gene pairs, and the modules with gene number less than 30 were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Identification of C4 candidates</title><p>C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes were defined as those found in C<sub>4</sub> modules (defined by co-expression modules which showed similar gene expression patterns as classic C<sub>4</sub> genes, see below) of at least two C<sub>4</sub> species in consideration of species specification/divergence, and then categorized into three sub-types by comparing with rice: (I) genes showed similar expression pattern as C<sub>4</sub> modules but were lowly expressed in rice, e.g., the expression levels (mean of one third of all sections from the tip) were &#x0003e; = 1.5-fold lower in rice compared to C<sub>4</sub> species; (II) genes showed different expression patterns in rice comparing with C<sub>4</sub> species; and (III) genes whose syntenic orthologues were present in all three C<sub>4</sub> species but absent in rice.

In addition, in sorghum, four of them were found in S.floralwhite, and two (NADP-MDH and NADP-ME) in S.grey. The separation of NADP-MDH and NADP-ME from S.floralwhite to grey (genes that are not clustered into modules) may be due to the fact that both of them have tandem duplicated paralogs in the genome (e.g., Sb07g023910 vs. Sb07g023920 and Sb03g003220 vs. Sb03g003230). Based on these observations, we assumed that genes in PS modules, e.g. M.black and M.pink in maize, G.black and G.brown4 in green foxtail, S.floralwhite in sorghum, which contained and showed similar expression patterns of classical C<sub>4</sub> genes, contained C<sub>4</sub>-related candidate genes, and will thus be referred to as &#x0201c;C<sub>4</sub> modules&#x0201d; hereafter. In rice, orthologues of CA, PEPC and PPDK showed an expression pattern in R.darkgrey that was similar to the C<sub>4</sub> modules. Although CA showed a similar expression level in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, the expression of PEPC and PPDK was much lower in rice than in the other three C<sub>4</sub> species (<xref rid="pone.0140629.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The remaining three rice orthologues of classical C<sub>4</sub> genes (NADP-MDH, NADP-ME and PPDK-RP), which were grouped in the R.grey module, had a much lower expression level, and showed different expression pattern compared with their C<sub>4</sub> orthologues. These results suggest that classical C<sub>4</sub> genes either decreased in their expression level or changed their expression pattern in rice. Thus, the characteristics of classical C<sub>4</sub> genes can be used as a criterion to define other C<sub>4</sub>-related candidate genes (see <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Three major categories of C<sub>4</sub> genes were characterized: similar expression pattern with higher expression in C<sub>4</sub> than in C<sub>3</sub> species (type I); different expression patterns in rice compared to C<sub>4</sub> species (type II), and syntenic orthologues present in all three C<sub>4</sub> species but absent in rice (type III). Based on these criteria and the expression pattern examination of syntenic orthologues in overlapping modules between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, 478 genes, including 25 type I, 417 type II and 36 type III were identified as C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes.

In summary, the majority (63%) of C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes had different expression patterns between C<sub>4</sub> and rice, while a smaller proportion had either an elevated (20%) or a novel (18%) expression pattern or in C<sub>4</sub> plants, possibly to accommodate the evolutionary transition from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in these species.</p><p>Based on the MapMan category annotation, 70% (90/128) of the genes were assigned to known biological processes or pathways. The three most abundant functional groups, excluding genes classified as &#x0201c;not assigned&#x0201d;, were photosynthesis (PS) (18 genes), protein metabolism (10 genes) and transport (9 genes), followed by major carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism (7 genes) and RNA regulation (6 genes) (<xref rid="pone.0140629.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Among these 128 C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes: 45% (57/128) were differentially expressed between BS and ME cells in both maize and green foxtail [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and another 49% (63/128) were identified as enriched in one cell type [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). The fact that the majority (94%, 120/128) of our C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes were either BS- or ME-enriched, highly suggests that these C<sub>4</sub> genes may play an important roles in C<sub>4</sub> metabolism. In addition, by comparing with Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], 50% (64/128) of these C<sub>4</sub> candidates were differentially expressed between maize foliar leaf blade (Kranz) and husk leaf sheath (non-Kranz), and 89% (57/64) of them were significant highly expressed in foliar expanded (FE) leaf, not the leaf primodia (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>), indicated these candidates were mainly involved in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in leaves. Moreover, 81% (104/128) of these C<sub>4</sub> candidates homologous were found to be differentially expressed in leaf gradients of Cleome gynandra [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a NAD-ME type C<sub>4</sub> dicot in an independent C<sub>4</sub> lineages, and 45% (57/128) of them were found to show similar expression patterns between C. gynandra and maize (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). These may indicate the conservation role of these genes in C<sub>4</sub> evolution. In addition to the well-known classic C<sub>4</sub> genes, we also identified a set of genes, involved in carbohydrate metabolism, that seem to play a role in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. For example, GRMZM2G070605 and GRMZM2G066413, two triosephosphate phosphate translocators that transport Calvin cycle derived triosephosphates from the stroma to the cytosol for use in sucrose synthesis and other biosynthetic processes [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and FBA, FBP and SBP, important enzymes controlling the metabolite flux in the Calvin cycle. Interestingly, six genes related to starch degradation were identified as C<sub>4</sub> candidates, e.g. phosphoglucan phosphatase (SEX4, GRMZM2G052546), whose mutation partially blocked the starch degradation process and then influence the plant growth in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and beta-amylases (GRMZM2G082034, GRMZM2G007939, GRMZM2G035749 and GRMZM2G347708), which play a central role in the complete degradation of starch to maltose [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

However, only one PEPCK gene was identified in sorghum, green foxtail and rice, and the expression level of PEPCK in these species (max RPKM 158 in sorghum, 28 in green foxtail and 34 in rice) was much lower than that in maize, although the peak of their expression was at the leaf tip, as expected from C<sub>4</sub> genes. Moreover, the expression patterns of PEPCK in green foxtail (G.floralwhite) and rice (R.darkred) were quite similar, and very different from maize (M.black) and sorghum (S.floralwhite, <xref rid="pone.0140629.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140629.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Figs). These results suggest that green foxtail, like rice, may not have a PEPCK regulated decarboxylation reaction as maize or sorghum. Another possibility is the function of PEPCK was limited in the NADP-ME type C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis species examined in this study, consistent with Zhu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] that hypothesized that only the NAD-ME type and NADP-ME type should be considered as distinct C<sub>4</sub> subtypes, with the PEPCK pathway serving only as a supplement.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Identification of additional C<sub>4</sub> genes</title><p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops requires a deep understanding of the essential components in the C<sub>4</sub> pathways. Despite the progresses that have been made in recent years, with the functional characterization of many important C<sub>4</sub> genes, the number of genes that are essential for establishing C<sub>4</sub> metabolism in C<sub>3</sub> crops is still unknown [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Comparative transcriptomics has extensively proved to be a useful approach to identify novel C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By comparing the gene expression pattern among C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, we identified 38 novel C<sub>4</sub> candidates, which were previously classified as functional unknown or not-assigned by the MapMan annotation. The vast majority of these newly identified genes (94.7%) were differentially expressed between the BS and ME cells (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). These candidate genes were highly co-expressed with classical C<sub>4</sub> genes, and may thus require further characterization to discover their exact function during C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Twenty six of these genes were annotated by GO, as involved in biological processes such as photosynthesis (GO:0015979), chlorophyll biosynthetic process (GO:0015995), maltose metabolic process (GO:0000023), and molecular functions such as catalytic activity (GO:0003824), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), phosphotransferase activity (GO:0016776), and many cellular component ontology associated with chloroplasts (GO:0009507, GO:0009570, GO:0009534, GO:0009535) and membranes (GO:0016020, GO:0005886, GO:0042651) (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s025" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a set of carbon metabolism related genes, including FBA, FBP and SBP that control the carbon flux during the Calvin cycle; TPT that transport triosephosphate out of the chloroplast, as well as starch synthase that control starch biosynthesis, were identified as essential for C<sub>4</sub> metabolism, and should thus be considered when engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops.</p><p>Very little is known about genes that are associated with Kranz anatomy and metabolite transportation in C<sub>4</sub> leaves [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our method identified two sucrose transporters (SUT1 and SUT2) and two triosephosphate phosphate translocators (TPT1 and TPT2), that were shown to have important roles in the C<sub>4</sub> carbon shuttle [<xref rid="pone.0140629.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140629.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as well as several transporters associated with K<sup>+</sup> efflux, transmembrane transporter activity and others (<xref rid="pone.0140629.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Due to the low number of developmental stages in our dataset, however, we could not identify any Kranz anatomy associated genes. With the growing availability of high resolution tissue/cell specific data, our method will be very useful in identifying and characterizing additional C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes, and assist in our efforts to engineer C<sub>4</sub> traits into C<sub>3</sub> crops, to improve yield and feed the growing population of the world.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Clustering of samples used in this study.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140629.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene expression patterns of modules for maize, green foxtail, sorghum and rice, respectively.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140629.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene expression patterns of modules for maize, green foxtail, sorghum and rice, respectively.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140629.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene expression patterns of modules for maize, green foxtail, sorghum and rice, respectively.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140629.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene expression patterns of modules for maize, green foxtail, sorghum and rice, respectively.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140629.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140629.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Pairwise overlaps of modules among rice and three C<sub>4</sub> species, respectively.</title><p>Each row and column of the table corresponds to one module (labeled by color as well as text) from two species, respectively.
