The implementation of predictive testing and targeted preventative surveillance is hindered by the frequent finding of sequence variants of uncertain significance in these genes. We aimed to determine the pathogenicity of previously reported variants (c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T) within the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;untranslated region (UTR) in two individuals from unrelated suspected Lynch syndrome families. We investigated whether these variants were associated with other pathogenic alterations using targeted high-throughput sequencing of the <italic>MLH1</italic> locus. We also determined their relationship to gene expression and epigenetic alterations at the promoter. Sequencing revealed that the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants were the only potentially pathogenic alterations within the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene. In both individuals, the levels of transcription from the variant allele were reduced to 50% compared with the wild-type allele. Partial loss of expression occurred in the absence of constitutional epigenetic alterations within the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter. We propose that these variants may be pathogenic due to constitutional partial loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression, and that this may be associated with intermediate penetrance of a Lynch syndrome phenotype. Our findings provide further evidence of the potential importance of noncoding variants in the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR in the pathogenesis of Lynch syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lynch syndrome</kwd><kwd>MLH1</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>promoter variants</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Lynch syndrome (MIM #120435) predisposes to the development of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers [Lynch and de la Chapelle, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>]. It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually <italic>MLH1</italic> (MIM #120436) or <italic>MSH2</italic> (MIM #609309) [Lynch et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>]. The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>] splice site mutations, [Thompson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>]. In many cases, the functional and hence clinical significance of the sequence alterations, in particular single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) outside coding regions, is uncertain. For these families, predictive testing and targeted preventative surveillance of family members cannot be offered. A recent study reported the classification of 2,360 constitutional MMR gene variants into class 1 (not pathogenic), class 2 (likely not pathogenic), class 3 (uncertain), class 4 (likely pathogenic), or class 5 (pathogenic) [Thompson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. The finding that a large proportion (32%) of variants belonged to class 3 demonstrates the importance of collecting further evidence about these variants.</p><p>Several class 3 variants within the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter have been found in cases of suspected Lynch syndrome, namely, c.-411_-413del, c.-432_-435del, c.-64G&#x0003e;T, c.-53G&#x0003e;T, c.-42C&#x0003e;T, c.-28A&#x0003e;G, c.-28A&#x0003e;T, c.-27C&#x0003e;A, c.-11C&#x0003e;T, and c.-7C&#x0003e;T [Green et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hitchins et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ward et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kwok et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Thompson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. However, for most of these variants, it is unclear whether they abrogate <italic>MLH1</italic> function directly or whether they are linked to another genetic defect within <italic>MLH1</italic>. Studies of the c.-27C&#x0003e;A variant provide the most compelling evidence that <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter variants can directly affect the regulation of <italic>MLH1</italic>. This variant segregates with colorectal cancer in multiple cancer-affected families [Raevaara et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Hitchins et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ward et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kwok et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>] and has been associated with reduced transcriptional activity and the dominant inheritance of a mosaic constitutional <italic>MLH1</italic> epimutation [Hitchins et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>]. These studies suggest that <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter variants may cause unbalanced constitutional expression of <italic>MLH1</italic>. In support of this, the c.-411_-413del, c.-42C&#x0003e;T, c.-27C&#x0003e;A, and c.-11C&#x0003e;T variants also significantly reduce the activity of the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter in driving the expression of a reporter gene [Green et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hitchins et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ward et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. To date, however, no analysis of the potential pathogenicity of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G or c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants has been undertaken, despite the fact that these variants have been described in at least two unrelated individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome [Lee et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Muller-Koch et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the pathogenicity of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants within the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) in two individuals from suspected Lynch syndrome families. We investigated whether these variants were linked to other constitutional pathogenic alterations within or around the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene and whether they were associated with epigenetic alterations at the gene promoter or changes in gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and Tissue Samples</title><p>Two probands (Proband 32 and Proband N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) with the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants (all nucleotide numbering used throughout the manuscript is based on cDNA sequence) were enrolled in this study in Australia (HREC/09/SVH/63 and HREC 14/169) and Norway (HREC 2014/493/REK midt).

At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type <italic>BRAF</italic> (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). No copy-number alterations were identified in any exons of the <italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>PMS2</italic> (MIM #600259), <italic>MSH2</italic>, and <italic>MSH6</italic> (MIM #600678) genes in either proband. Sequence alterations across the <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>PMS2</italic> genes were further assessed using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing. No sequence alterations were detected in the <italic>MLH1</italic> or <italic>PMS2</italic> genes except for the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T heterozygous variants in the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR. The following samples were available from Proband 32; fresh frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), DNA from PBMCs, buccal, saliva, normal colon, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and RNA from PBMCs. DNA from saliva was also available from a first-degree relative of Proband 32. The following samples were available from Proband N: DNA from PBMCs and buccal, and RNA from PBMCs. DNA from paraffin tissue was available from a colonic adenoma resected from the father of Proband N and used to obtain the <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype of this individual.

Briefly, 200 ng of genomic DNA was digested with 16 different restriction enzymes at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Digested DNA was then hybridized with specific biotinylated nucleotide adapters using an initial denaturing step of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by hybridization at 54&#x000b0;C for 16 hr. DNA-adaptor hybrids were captured using streptavidin beads and circularized using DNA ligase. Herculase II Fusing DNA polymerase was used to amplify the captured target library using the following conditions: denaturing at 98&#x000b0;C for 2 min followed by 25 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and a final extension of 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The amplified target library was purified using AMPure XP Kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 1500 using paired-end 2 &#x000d7; 100 bp TruSeq chemistry. A total of 20,709,684 sequence reads were obtained. Alignment of reads was performed using Bowtie2 [Langmead and Salzberg, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>] against the human reference genome (hg19) using default parameters. This provided an average depth of 140, with &#x0003e;10x coverage across 89% of the target region. Coverage across the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene was &#x0003e;10x across 91.8% and 82.4% of exonic and intronic DNA, respectively. Variant calling was performed using GATK [McKenna et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>] and Pindel [Ye et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>]. Variants identified by Pindel that had variable allele ratios &#x0003e;0.2 and &#x0003c;0.8 were considered as heterozygous. Only variants predicted by reads with phred quality scores &#x0003e;30, which have a 1 in 1,000 chance that the base is incorrectly called [Ewing and Green, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>], were considered as variants.

Nested PCR was performed using a second antisense primer specific to <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 in combination with a polyT-anchor primer. Duplicate samples in which reverse transcriptase was omitted were assayed to control for DNA contamination.

We excluded RNA samples with a RIN &#x0003c;8.0 and generated all cDNA libraries simultaneously in a single batch. This approach eliminated variables such as RNA quality and differences in the efficiency of cDNA synthesis associated with batch effects. Allelic representation (i.e., the proportion of <italic>MLH1</italic> transcripts that originate from either allele) was determined using PCR amplification of cDNA using primers complimentary to exons 1a and 9 followed by pyrosequencing across the c.655G&#x0003e;A site [Kwok et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing</title><p>We designed a nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-Seq) assay encompassing the transcription initiation sites identified by 5&#x02032;RACE, as well as the annotated initiation sites of the <italic>EPM2AIP1</italic> [NM_041805.3] and <italic>MLH1</italic> [NM_000249.3] genes. This 393 bp product was located c.-335 to c.58 relative to <italic>MLH1</italic> allowing the detection of multiple nucleosomes across this promoter. NOMe-Seq was performed as described previously [Kelly et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Taberlay et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; You et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>]. This involved harvesting intact nuclei and treating with 200 U GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C followed by termination of the reaction with an equal volume of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9, 600 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 10 mM EDTA and overnight digestion with 200 &#x003bc;g/ml Proteinase K (Ambion, Austin, TX). DNA was subsequently isolated and bisulfite converted using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). PCR amplicons were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and individual molecules isolated by colony PCR for sequencing as described previously [Hesson and Ward, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. The promoter of the <italic>HSPA5</italic> (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region &#x02265;150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI. At the extreme ends of each molecule, nucleosome-occupied DNA was identified as M.CviPI inaccessibility &#x0003e;75 bp (half the size of a nucleosome occupied region of DNA), as described previously [Hesson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. Duplicate molecules (those containing identical patterns of GpC methylation) were removed from further analysis to prevent data misinterpretation due to cloning or PCR bias. Molecules containing non-CpG methylation (except in the context of GpC sites) were also discarded to eliminate amplicons derived from incompletely converted DNA. The term occupancy refers to the proportion of molecules bearing a nucleosome at a specific location, as described previously [Hesson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Differences in allelic balance were assessed using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two MLH1 5&#x02032;UTR Variants Associated with Early-Onset CRC</title><p>To confirm the presence of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants, we performed sequencing of a 1,067-bp region across the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter (c.-960 to c.107 relative to NM_000249.3) in constitutional DNA from both probands and identified three heterozygous variants, namely, c.-93G&#x0003e;A, c.-28A&#x0003e;G, and c.-7C&#x0003e;T (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S1A</xref>).

Sequencing of long-range amplicons generated using cDNA derived from PBMCs showed that in both probands the c.-93A/-28G/-7T haplotype also contained the expressed c.655G variant in exon 8 of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene, whereas the c.-93G/-28A/-7C haplotype contained the c.655A variant.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted Sequencing and Microsatellite Analysis Across the MLH1 Locus Confirms the Lack of Deleterious Sequence or Structural Alterations in MLH1</title><p>To determine whether the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants were in <italic>cis</italic> with another pathogenic sequence alteration within <italic>MLH1</italic>, we employed targeted, high-throughput sequencing of constitutional DNA from Proband 32.

These markers encompassed &#x0223c;20.2 Mb of DNA across the 3p22.3-p14.3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). All but one microsatellite marker showed heterozygosity in constitutional DNA. Identical results were obtained from tumor DNA. We extended this assessment of zygosity using the variants identified across the <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>EPM2AIP1</italic> genes by targeted sequencing. A total of 52 sequence variants across these genes were heterozygous, whereas only one was homozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results confirmed the presence of two intact alleles of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene, and therefore the absence of <italic>MLH1</italic> deletion, in constitutional and tumor DNA.</p><p>Next, we examined variants in other genes and intergenic sites across the 1.7-Mb region that was sequenced. We identified a total of 1,452 sequence variants, comprising 1,374 SNVs and indels previously described in the 1000 genomes or SNP 137 databases and 78 novel sequence variants (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">Table S3</xref>). Only one of these 78 novel variants was associated with an amino acid alteration within the coding region of a gene. This frameshift variant was a single-nucleotide deletion (c.1164del1) within exon 10 of the <italic>VILL</italic> (villin-like) gene that was predicted to cause the truncation of VILL protein to p.Asp388Glu.fs.*64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2E</xref>). The presence of this variant in constitutional DNA from Proband 32 was confirmed by single molecule sequencing across exon 10 (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S3</xref>). Analysis of DNA from a saliva sample obtained from a first-degree relative of Proband 32 revealed the c.1164del1 variant in <italic>VILL</italic>, and the c.-93A/-28G/-7T variants in <italic>MLH1</italic> were also present confirming they cosegregation on the same chromosome (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S4</xref>). Data from control exomes [Fu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] showed that the c.1164del1 variant was present in 1/12,520 chromosomes (MAF = 0.00008). Given the predicted pathogenicity of this variant, we determined whether it was also present in Proband N. Pyrosequencing across the c.1164del1 site showed this variant was not present in constitutional DNA from this individual (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S5A</xref>). To further define the variant <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype, we determined whether the novel intronic variants described in Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Figure S2</xref> cosegregated with the c.-93G&#x0003e;A, c.-28A&#x0003e;G, c.-7C&#x0003e;T, and <italic>VILL</italic> c.1164del variants in the first-degree relative of Proband 32. Neither variant was found in this individual showing that they were located on the wild-type <italic>MLH1</italic> allele. Both intronic variants were also absent in Proband N. This shows that the two probands in our study share the same ancestral variant <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype, and that the <italic>VILL</italic> variant in Proband 32 most likely arose as a later event within this haplotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced Constitutional MLH1 Expression from the Variant Allele</title><p>The absence of potentially pathogenic sequence alterations within or flanking the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene other than the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants prompted us to investigate their role in regulating <italic>MLH1</italic>. Given the location of these variants within the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR, we investigated their influence on gene expression.

This showed there was a &#x0223c;50% reduction in expression from the variant allele relative to the wild-type allele. Similar levels of allelic imbalance were observed in the PBMCs of Proband N with the proportion of transcripts from each allele detected at 33.7%:66.3% (G:A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">D</xref>), again indicating a reduction in expression from the variant allele to &#x0223c;50% of the levels of the wild-type allele.

We performed 5&#x02032;RACE to map the positions of transcription initiation sites within the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter in PBMCs from Proband 32. Because transcription may be initiated downstream of the informative c.-93, c.-28 or c.-7 sites, we sequenced across the c.655A&#x0003e;G variant to determine the allele of transcript origin. A total of 20 wild-type and 15 variant transcript molecules were sequenced, which collectively identified 10 separate sites of transcription initiation within exon 1a. Interestingly, 8/10 clustered within the region c.-27 to c.-3. These initiation sites overlapped with those identified in 975 human primary cells, tissues, and cancer cell lines (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Fig. S6</xref>) [Consortium et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. Therefore, the predominant transcription initiation sites within the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter were located in the immediate vicinity of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants. However, comparison of the initiation sites between the variant and wild-type alleles showed that the presence of these variants did not alter the precise sites of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4E</xref>). Next, we examined nucleosome occupancy across these initiation sites using the informative c.-7C&#x0003e;T site to distinguish between the wild-type and variant alleles. One or more of the initiation sites were accessible on 59% (22/37) of wild-type promoter molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4F</xref>). By comparison, 50% (12/24) of variant promoter molecules were accessible across the same sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4F</xref>) suggesting a slight increase in nucleosome occupancy. However, in PBMCs from three healthy donors and a carcinoma cell line, all of which express high levels of <italic>MLH1</italic>, 50%&#x02013;69% of molecules were accessible across the same sites showing that the slight increase in nucleosome occupancy observed in the variant allele was within the normal range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4G</xref>). These data showed there were no marked differences in nucleosome occupancy across transcription initiation sites between the wild-type and variant alleles or with the same sites in normal control cells. Therefore, despite reduced expression of the variant allele, the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter is epigenetically unaltered.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show that two SNVs in the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter are associated with partial loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression in two individuals from suspected Lynch syndrome families. Specifically, the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants were associated with &#x0223c;50% reduction in the abundance of transcripts initiated from the variant allele when compared with the wild-type allele. This loss of expression occurred in the context of an intact <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter and in the absence of any other potentially pathogenic sequence alterations in or around the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene. Though these variants are located in the immediate vicinity of transcription initiation sites, we show that they do not alter the precise location of these initiation sites. Finally, despite partial loss of expression from the variant allele, we show that the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants are not associated with promoter hypermethylation or alterations in nucleosome occupancy. These findings suggest that the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants may be pathogenic due to allelic imbalance of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression.</p><p>There are now several reports of Lynch syndrome associated with partial loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression [Curia et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Green et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hinrichsen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. Curia et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) described Lynch syndrome associated with a silent variant within exon 9 of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene and 50% reduction in constitutional levels of expression compared with the wild-type allele. Green et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) described a c.-42C&#x0003e;T variant within the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene associated with the reduction of promoter activity to &#x0223c;37% that of wild-type promoter sequence. Furthermore, several constitutional <italic>MLH1</italic> missense mutations that lead to &#x0223c;50% or more reduction in protein levels were recently reclassified as pathogenic [Hinrichsen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>]. In each case, loss of the wild-type allele in tumor cells would likely lead to impaired MMR activity due to insufficient <italic>MLH1</italic> expression from the variant allele. According to a recently described standardized classification system, [Thompson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>] MMR gene variants that abrogate gene function include those that cause-defective transcription. Our observation that the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants are associated with partial constitutional loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression provides strong evidence that they may be pathogenic. It is possible that reduced but not abolished MMR functionality caused by the partial loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression may give rise to an intermediate mutation rate and the onset of cancer due to increased occurrence of somatic mutations. A potential limitation of our study is that we assessed <italic>MLH1</italic> expression in PBMCs, which may not necessarily reflect the levels of expression in colorectal mucosa. Should samples become available, further studies could aim to determine the transcriptional activity associated with the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants in other tissues, including colorectal mucosa. Our findings show that these variants are associated with abrogated <italic>MLH1</italic> function (partial loss of expression) but this alone is insufficient to reclassify as Class 4 variants (likely pathogenic) and both remain Class 3 variants (uncertain). Additional evidence, such as the presence of one or both of these variants on a different background <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype, &#x02265;2 tumors with a Lynch syndrome molecular phenotype in a carrier or the cosegregation of these variants with Lynch syndrome will be required to reclassify these variants as Class 4. If however, these variants are indeed associated with intermediate penetrance, segregation with Lynch syndrome is unlikely to be observed.</p><p>The variable age of onset of cancer associated with the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants was evident from the two families we investigated. While Proband 32 presented with CRC aged 38 years, Proband N was asymptomatic at 54 years. However, the father and grandfather of Proband N presented with colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer at ages 50 and 40 years, respectively, though we were unable to ascertain whether the grandfather had the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants. This variable penetrance may be explained by incomplete inactivation of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression, as described previously for the c.-42C&#x0003e;T variant, which was associated with drastically different ages of cancer onset between 35 and 76 years (average 62 years) in a single Lynch syndrome family [Green et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>]. Interestingly, in this study, loss of heterozygosity analyses of the tumor from an individual with the c.-42C&#x0003e;T variant revealed deletion of the <italic>MLH1</italic> allele with the variant and not of the wild-type allele, as one would expect. In our analyses, both <italic>MLH1</italic> alleles were retained in the tumor of Proband 32. These results are most likely explained by the presence of somatic <italic>MLH1</italic> mutations in the tumor.</p><p>Further evidence that the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants are the most likely cause of cancer predisposition was provided by our detailed genetic analysis of the <italic>MLH1</italic> locus. We combined targeted high-throughput sequencing of the wider <italic>MLH1</italic> locus with microsatellite marker analysis to provide high-resolution sequence and zygosity information across the 3p14.3-p22.3 region. Collectively, this data confirmed the lack of potentially pathogenic sequence alterations within or flanking the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene, other than the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants. This approach identified a frameshift variant within the neighboring <italic>VILL</italic> gene. The cosegregation of the c.1164del1, c.-28A&#x0003e;G, and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants in a first-degree relative of Proband 32 showed that they were located on the same chromosome. Furthermore, their precise frequencies in control exomes provided clues to the genetic history of this haplotype. For example, the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants have an identical MAF of 0.0003, showing that they represent part of an ancestral haplotype. Moreover, the absence of any identifiable sequence differences on the variant <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype between the two probands investigated in our study supports the conclusion that this <italic>MLH1</italic> haplotype originates from a common ancestor. The <italic>VILL</italic> c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. The function of <italic>VILL</italic> is unknown but its homology with the <italic>VIL1</italic> (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in <italic>VILL</italic> in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants cosegregated. Therefore, the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants are the most likely cause of predisposition to CRC with MMR deficiency and loss of MLH1.</p><p>The InSiGHT database [Thompson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>] describes two suspected individuals with this haplotype in addition to two cases described previously [Muller-Koch et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Lee et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>]. One was diagnosed with CRC aged 46 years and had a sibling who was diagnosed with CRC aged 28 years. The proband&#x02019;s tumor was MLH1 and PMS2 negative and <italic>BRAF</italic> wild-type. Separate from the c.-7C&#x0003e;T and c.-28A&#x0003e;G variants, no constitutional mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>EPCAM</italic>, or <italic>MSH2</italic> were found by MLPA and no expression analyses were undertaken. The other individual with this haplotype was also diagnosed with MLH1 negative CRC; however, no further information is provided. Therefore, the rarity of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T haplotype at the population level, but its presence in several suspected Lynch syndrome individuals to date suggests it is associated with a Lynch syndrome phenotype.</p><p>The cosegregation of these two variants makes it difficult to ascertain whether both or only one are pathogenic. The c.-7C&#x0003e;T variant was found in a member of a hereditary prostate cancer family who met revised Bethesda guidelines [Fredriksson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>]. However, the description of a case of CRC that was associated with a c.-28A&#x0003e;T variant in a 29-year-old individual from a family with multiple cancer-affected members [Isidro et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>] suggests that loss of the c.-28A nucleotide may be pathogenic. Whether the c.-28A&#x0003e;T variant in this family was associated with reduced <italic>MLH1</italic> expression or cosegregation with disease was not determined. Furthermore, a variant of the adjacent nucleotide (c.-27C&#x0003e;A) also segregates with Lynch syndrome in several unrelated families [Hitchins et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kwok et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. Collectively, this suggests that c.-27 and c.-28 sites are located within an important regulatory motif within the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR. Further work to identify the DNA-binding protein that binds to this site will help to elucidate the mechanistic basis of how variants within the <italic>MLH1</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR affect expression.</p><p>The presence of the c.-93G&#x0003e;A, c.-28A&#x0003e;G, c.-7C&#x0003e;T, and c.655A&#x0003e;G variants in both probands allowed us to distinguish between wild-type and variant alleles and transcripts and to investigate the mechanisms of reduced <italic>MLH1</italic> expression. We conclusively demonstrate that the variant <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter remains unmethylated despite partial loss of expression. This contradicted the pathology report from Proband 32, which reported methylation in tumor DNA. Using several approaches, we demonstrate that the apparent hypermethylation was an artifact caused by the c.-7C&#x0003e;T variant, which lies within a recognition site of the HhaI restriction enzyme utilized as part of the MS-MLPA assay. However, reductions in gene expression can correlate with other chromatin changes at transcription initiation sites, such as increased nucleosome occupancy, which can physically occlude an initiation site from the transcriptional machinery [Jiang and Pugh, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>]. To determine whether the variant allele was associated with increased nucleosome occupancy, we precisely defined sites of <italic>MLH1</italic> transcription initiation and compared nucleosome occupancy between the variant and wild-type alleles using an allele-specific NOMe-Seq assay. Our finding that the variant allele showed no increase in nucleosome occupancy when compared with the wild-type allele, or the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter in other cells expressing high levels of <italic>MLH1</italic>, confirmed that it remained epigenetically unaltered. The continued recruitment of DNA-binding factors is thought to protect CpG island promoters from nucleosome occupancy [Struhl and Segal, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>] and de novo methylation [Lienert et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Krebs et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. This suggests that the variant allele may be protected from epigenetic silencing because it retains the ability to recruit DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors. Due to the proximity of the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants to transcription initiation sites, we hypothesize that diminished expression may be a result of impaired ability to initiate transcription.</p><p>In summary, our study describes further cases of suspected Lynch syndrome associated with the c.-28A&#x0003e;G and c.-7C&#x0003e;T variants. Our analysis shows that these variants may be pathogenic due to partial loss of <italic>MLH1</italic> expression. These findings reinforce the potential importance of sequence variants in the <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter in Lynch syndrome and the need for future studies to sequence the entire 5&#x02032;UTR when searching for pathogenic sequence alterations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><italic>Disclosure statement</italic>: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Curia</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmirotta</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Aceto</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Messerini</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Veri</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Crognale</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Valanzano</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ficari</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Fracasso</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Stigliano</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Tonelli</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Casale</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Unbalanced germ-line expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2 alleles in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</article-title><source>Cancer Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>3570</fpage><lpage>3575</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10446963</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Chae</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Methylation of CpG in a small region of the hMLH1 promoter invariably correlates with the absence of gene expression</article-title><source>Cancer Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>2029</fpage><lpage>2033</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10232580</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ewing</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Base-calling of automated sequencer traces using phred.
