Age is a significant factor in both the risk of and the incidence of acquired brain injury. TBI-induced inflammatory response is associated with activation of brain resident microglia and accumulation of infiltrating monocytes, which plays a pivotal role in chronic neurodegeneration and loss of neurological function after TBI. Despite the extensive clinical evidence implicating neuroinflammation with the TBI-related sequelae, the specific role of these different myeloid cells and the influence of age on TBI-initiated innate immune response remain unknown and poorly studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used gene profiling and pathway analysis to define the effect of age on inflammatory response at the time of injury. The recruitment of peripheral CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages was delineated using the <italic>CX3CR1</italic><sup><italic>GFP/+</italic></sup><italic>CCR2</italic><sup><italic>RFP/+</italic></sup> reporter mouse.

Using a unique reporter animal model able to discriminate resident versus peripherally derived myeloid cells, we demonstrate that in the aged brain, there is an increased accumulation of peripherally derived CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages after TBI compared to young animals. Exaggerated recruitment of this population of cells was associated with an augmented inflammatory response in the aged TBI animals. Targeting this cellular response with cenicriviroc, a dual CCR2/5 antagonist, significantly ameliorated injury-induced sequelae in the aged TBI animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Importantly, these findings demonstrate that peripheral monocytes play a non-redundant and contributing role to the etiology of trauma-induced inflammatory sequelae in the aged brain.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>CCR2</kwd><kwd>Chemokine</kwd><kwd>Antagonist</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Neurotrauma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32NS090805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morganti</surname><given-names>Josh M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>R21NS087458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosi</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute on Aging (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>R21AG042016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosi</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for the development of many neurological disorders including degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s and early onset dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Age significantly increases both the risk and incidence of acquired brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to TBI and have clinically worse outcomes after TBI with increased morbidity and mortality, and reduced functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While age as a prognostic factor after TBI has long been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], limited attention has been devoted to understanding and modulating the pathologic processes that contribute to poor outcomes seen in aged individuals.</p><p>Brain injury initiates an immediate response involving multiple cellular effectors of the innate immune response, notably the brain&#x02019;s resident tissue macrophage and microglia, as well as the recruitment of peripherally derived monocytes/macrophages presumably through the disruption of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Aging in humans and rodents has been shown to alter this response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the current study, we used unsupervised gene clustering and pathway analysis to define the effect of age on injury-induced inflammatory sequelae. Our data show that age predisposes the injured brain to an exaggerated inflammatory response involving the enrichment of chemotactic mediators associated with the recruitment and activation of the peripheral monocytes. Specifically, our data show that aged TBI animals have an exacerbated response in the production of ligands that bind to both CCR2 and CCR5 at a critical time point associated with migration of peripheral monocytes/macrophages to the injured brain parenchyma. This molecular response was paralleled by an increased recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages to the injured brain of aged mice. Given the exacerbated CCR2/5 cellular and molecular signatures, we used a novel small molecule antagonist for CCR2/5 to abrogate this phenotype. Using a clinically relevant pharmacological approach, our data show that the age-related phenotype in response to injury is significantly mitigated in treated animals. These data implicate a new important role for the accumulation of monocyte/macrophages in the maintenance of neuroinflammatory sequelae following neurotrauma in the aged brain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California (San Francisco, CA).

Animals were anesthetized and maintained with 2.5&#x000a0;% isoflurane with a non-rebreathing nose cone and passive exhaust system connected to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). Once animals were secured with non-traumatic ear bars, eye ointment was applied and their heads were cleared of any hair around the scalp. Following betadine application, a midline incision was made through the scalp. TBI was reproduced using the controlled cortical impact model in the parietal lobe as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A craniectomy was created using an electric microdrill with center point to the coordinates: 2.0&#x000a0;mm; mediolateral, 2.0&#x000a0;mm, with respect to the bregma. Explicit attention was paid to prevent damage to the dura during craniectomy; any animal in which the dura was disrupted, as assessed by excessive bleeding, was omitted from the study and replaced by another littermate. After craniectomy, contusion was achieved using a 3.0-mm convex tip attached to an electromagnetic impactor (Leica) mounted to the digitally calibrated manipulator arm. To impact flush with the natural curvature of the head/tissue, the manipulator arm was rotated 20&#x000b0; on the vertical axis. The parameters for impact were for a contusion depth of 0.95&#x000a0;mm (from dura), velocity was constant at 4.0&#x000a0;m/s, and the impact was sustained for of 300&#x000a0;ms. After CCI injury, the scalp was sutured and each animal received 0.5&#x000a0;ml of physiologic saline (i.p.) before being placed in a water-heated incubation chamber (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) until they fully recovered as exhibited by resumption of movement and grooming. Sham animals were treated to the above parameters, except that the CCI injury was omitted. All animals fully recovered from surgical procedures and exhibited normal weight gain for the duration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Tissue collection</title><p>All mice were euthanized using a mixture of ketamine (150&#x000a0;mg/kg)/xylazine (15&#x000a0;mg/kg) in accordance with standard animal protocols.

Immediately after perfusion, mice were decapitated and the ipsilateral brain hemisphere was placed into ice-cold RPMI-1640 medium without phenol (RPMI; Gibco). For qRT-PCR endpoints, animals were rapidly killed via cervical dislocation.

Aged TBI animals were randomly divided between two treatment groups; vehicle and CVC. Two hours following surgery, animals were dosed at 100&#x000a0;mg/kg BID via oral gavage at 2 and 10&#x000a0;h post-surgery intervals.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) revealed unique arrangements of both enriched and downregulated responses as a result of injury and/or age. Of these expression clusters, we examined three that visually represented alignment of genes that were downregulated in the aged TBI group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; green), upregulated in the aged TBI group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; red), and upregulated as a result of injury (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; aquamarine). In general, the downregulated genes of the green cluster represented a repressed inflammatory function as a combination of age and injury. By contrast, the red cluster linked a group of genes related to recruitment and activation of pro-inflammatory monocytes. Notably, within this expression cluster, our data show increased responses of several CCR2 and CCR5 cognate ligands (e.g., CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL5). While the aquamarine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) cluster was distinct from the changes found within the red cluster, there was a similar activation profile found between both TBI groups hierarchically. There was a heterogeneous mix of chemokines, cytokines, and signal transducers, and metabolic mediators found throughout this gene cluster, which seem to be indicative of a general inflammatory response to brain injury, as there was little to no activation of these mediators in the aged sham group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Inflammatory profiling of the TBI brain.

Of principle concern is the activation of the myeloid constituents, microglia, and monocytes, due to their involvement and propagation of a variety of acute and chronic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The approaches taken in this study define the brain&#x02019;s inflammatory milieu in response to TBI and how these molecular patterns are altered as a function of age. The altered shift in expression patterns of chemotactic mediators in aged TBI brain created a permissive environment for the exaggerated influx of peripheral monocytes/macrophages to the brain. This, in part, may be due to redundant increases in chemokines associated with CCR2/5 signaling. While the role of these monocyte populations is diverse across various neurological diseases, we have shown that these cells augment a pro-inflammatory and potentially neurotoxic bias in the aged brain. We also used an available CCR2/5 inhibitor to reduce the accumulation of pro-inflammatory myeloid cells in the brain. Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate that the CCR2-mediated recruitment of monocytes into the injured brain is a rational therapeutic target that may abrogate TBI-induced neuroinflammatory-mediated sequelae.</p><p>We recently described the leukocyte-mediated neuroinflammatory sequelae associated with this TBI model in young animals over a detailed time course spanning acute through chronic time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our previous findings suggest that resident microglia are responsible for the initiation of specific inflammatory mediators and infiltrated CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages significantly augment this response. However, in the context of aging, recent work has shown that the aged brain has an altered inflammatory profile relative to basal levels of adult mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], potentially priming these systems for maladaptive responses to insult or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the context of neurotrauma, our current data suggest that age dysregulates multiple signaling networks associated with the activation, chemotaxis, and inflammatory response of innate immune effectors. We have recently shown that these responses do not fall within the dichotomous constraints of &#x0201c;M1/M2&#x0201d; polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In agreement with or previous work, our current data indicate that as a result of age, there is dysregulation across both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. While we highlighted several instances of exaggerated pro-inflammatory and chemotactic gene profiles using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we also observed pro-inflammatory mediators such as CD40, CXCL11, CCL17, CCL19, and IL16 that were downregulated in the aged TBI group, relative to young TBI. Given these opposing inflammatory responses, it is difficult to conclude that TBI in the aged predisposes a purely pro-inflammatory bias, as there are both inductions of anti-inflammatory response with concomitant downregulation of pro-inflammatory responses, relative to young injured animals. However, our current data attribute, in part, that cumulatively, these maladaptive responses create an overly permissive environment for the exaggerated recruitment and accumulation of CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages.</p><p>Although CCR2 is expressed on a variety of immune cells, circulating &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; monocytes are the main population that expresses this cytokine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CCR2 is currently known to have five cognate ligands; CCL2, CCL8, CCL7, CCL13 (human only), and CCL12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, there is a degree of promiscuity of the CCR2 receptor and its ligands as they are known to bind other C-C receptors; notably CCR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Expression of CCR5, like CCR2, is found on a variety of circulating immune effectors, but most relevant to our study, is co-expressed on CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Overall, in the context of our current findings, the cross-talk and co-expression of CCR2/5 on monocytes, and enhanced expression of their cognate ligands may potentiate the increased recruitment we observed in aged TBI animals. Therefore, our current data are consistent with the formation of a pro-chemotactic milieu created, in part, by increased signaling through CCR2/5 expressing cells.</p><p>NOX2 activation possesses a neurotoxic nature from the production of ROS intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] as well as maintaining redox pro-inflammatory signaling cascades of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Recent work has detailed an increase in some subunits of the ROS-producing NOX2 complex of aged TBI animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our treatment paradigm with CVC significantly downregulated the expression of the multiple subunits that comprise the NOX2 complex, suggesting a decreased propensity for ROS intermediate formation relative to the vehicle-treated animals. These data align with our previous work implicating CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages as the predominant source for NOX2 gene expression following TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Importantly, in rodent models of TBI, inhibiting this complex decreased neuronal damage and improved recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our current study demonstrates that the aged brain&#x02019;s response to neurotrauma involves the exacerbated expression of multiple mediators involved in the recruitment of peripheral macrophages to the injured parenchyma. Blocking of these innate immune mediators via CCR2/5 antagonism significantly blunted their ingress, while concomitantly reducing inflammatory and potentially neurotoxic signatures. Intentionally, we limited the scope of this study to examine the period following injury where the maximum inflection of recruited CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages was previously known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], in an effort to define this time point within the context of age at the time of TBI. Therefore, the conclusions garnered in this study should not be expanded beyond the presented injury paradigm. Future work is needed to define how neurotrauma in the context of age affects inflammatory response in subacute and chronic periods and whether the responses and treatment currently examined may produce tangible outcome measures in those periods.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JMM and SR designed research studies.
