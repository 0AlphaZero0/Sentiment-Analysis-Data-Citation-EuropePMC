Introduction</title><p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) in gram-negative pathogens, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiellap neumoniae</italic>, has become a major concern in public health [<xref rid="B1-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The resistant mechanism of MDR gram-negative strains is closely related to efflux pumps of the resistance nodulation division (RND) family [<xref rid="B2-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The major RND efflux system in <italic>E. coli</italic> is AcrAB-TolC, which consists of a cell membrane transporter (AcrB), an inner membrane channel (TolC) and an adaptor protein (AcrA) [<xref rid="B3-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Substrates of AcrAB-TolC get into the periplasmic space through porin or by diffusion through the lipid bilayer, where they are captured by AcrB. The AcrB transporter extrudes the compounds into the TolC channel and to the exterior using the proton motive force [<xref rid="B4-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the inhibition of AcrB function can inhibit the functions of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Recently, efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs)/AcrB inhibitors have emerged as a hot topic and have attracted the interest of many researchers.</p><p>Biochemical studies have verified that EPIs can be used as synergism therapies with antibiotics to improve the antibacterial potency at low antibiotic concentrations to reduce the emergence of resistance [<xref rid="B5-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. So far, several potent AcrB inhibitors including phenylalanylarginine-&#x003b2;-Naphthylamide (PA&#x003b2;N), 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), D13-9001, and pyranopyridines (MBX2319) have been described in the literature [<xref rid="B8-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, none of them is being used clinically.</p><p>Previously, it was found that artesunate (AS), an antimalarial agent, had no direct antibacterial activity itself, but it could significantly enhance the antibacterial effects of &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics against <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218 in vitro, which might be associated with the efflux pump AcrB [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on the results of molecular docking experiments, a new antibiotic enhancer named as dihydroartemisinine 7 (DHA7) was developed by removing the carbonyl group and replacing the carboxyl group with imidazole in the succinate tail of AS. DHA7 has better antibacterial enhancement activity of &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics than AS does [<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This experiment proved that the strategy of changing the chemical structure of the succinate tail of AS to obtain a better active compound targeting AcrB was feasible. However, AS and DHA7 were effective only against standard strains. Most of <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical strains were not susceptible to them. Additionally, the aqueous solubility of these compounds was so poor that they could not be developed for clinical application. This study reported the whole process from design, synthesis, to evaluation of a new antibacterial enhancer DHA27 with better activity than those of AS and DHA7, and its possible molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-17-01934"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.1. Eighty-Six New Compounds Are Designed Based on Structure&#x02013;Activity Relationship Analysis of 18 Artemisinin Derivatives from a Previous Work</title><p>Eighteen artemisinin (ART) derivatives have been derived from a previous work so far [<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DHA7 was selected as the molecular template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). This compound was chosen as it was the most potent enhancer among 18 compounds. Within the best fit conformation for alignment, the left part of the figure shows the nucleus structure of ART and the right part shows the side chains of derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>The statistical parameters of CoMFA met the requirement and are summarized in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Table S1</xref>. The results showed that (1) if steric hindrance increased in yellow part, bioactivity would decrease (yellow part); (2) if there were big steric hindrance groups on C-3 in side chains (green part), antibacterial enhancement activity would increase; (3) if there were electron-withdrawing groups at C-5 and C-7 (red part) and the electron-donating groups at O-1 (blue part), antibacterial enhancement activity would increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Therefore, 86 new compounds were designed by computer according to the aforementioned findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.2. Twenty-Two Compounds Combined with the Active Binding Pocket from AcrB Are Selected Based on Molecular Docking</title><p>Previous works verified that AS and DHA7 had antibacterial enhancement activity while ART and DHA did not have such activity [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, molecular docking was first performed on ART and three ART derivatives including DHA, AS, and DHA7 to identify a possible binding pocket for their potency. Following this, 86 compounds designed by computer were bound to this pocket to screen the compounds that could bind to this pocket well and might be supposed to have antibacterial enhancement activity. The results showed that AS and DHA7 (with bioactivity) bound at different positions with ART and DHA (without bioactivity) and that the binding position of AS and DHA7 might be important for their bioactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>The binding pocket of AS and DHA7 was lined by hydrophobic (Phe136, Phe178, and Phe615) and polar (Gln176, Ser46, and Tyr327) residues, which were partially overlapped with those of substrates such as minocycline and doxorubicin [<xref rid="B11-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and inhibitors such as MBX2319 [<xref rid="B12-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] bound to AcrB. AS and DHA7 interacted with a similar site of amino acid residue that was located at the distal binding pocket. The oxygen atom of the peroxide bridge of the nucleus structure and the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of the side chain of AS interacted with Gln176 and Tyr327 via hydrogen bonding at a distance of 2.1 and 2.0 &#x000c5;, respectively; and the oxygen atom of carbonyl of the side chain interacted with Phe178 via the electron cloud-stacking effect. The distance between oxygen atom and six carbon atoms on phenyl of Phe178 was 4.4 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). The oxygen atom of the six-membered ring of the nucleus structure and nitrogen atom of imidazole of DHA7 interacted with Gln176 and Phe136 via hydrogen bonding at a distance of 2.2 and 3.1 &#x000c5;, respectively. The oxygen atom of the side chain interacted with Phe178 via the electron cloud-stacking effect. The distance between oxygen atom and six carbon atoms on phenyl of Phe178 was 4.1 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f002">Figure 2</xref>D,E). The results demonstrated that Phe136, Gln176, Phe178, and Tyr327 might be the important binding sites in the distal pocket (DP) of AcrB for AS and its analogues which might have antibacterial enhancement activity.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned analysis, 86 compounds were docked in the position to which AS and DHA7 bound to get better binding compounds with better antibacterial enhancement activity. The results showed that only 22 compounds bound well to that position (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.3. DHA27 from Four Representative Compounds Has the Best Antibacterial Enhancement Activity</title><p>Based on the results of 3D-SAR and molecular docking, four compounds, named as DHA25-DHA28, with a higher total score (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Table S3</xref>) and simple synthetic routes from 22 compounds were selected and synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The activities of these compounds were investigated using standard strain <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218. Because <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218 is a &#x003b2;-lactamase-producing strain, a &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor TZB was added during the MIC test to exclude the disturbing effects of &#x003b2;-lactamase. The results showed that MICs of DHA25-DHA28 alone were higher than 512 mg/L (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-17-01934-t001">Table 1</xref>A), which meant they had no direct antibacterial activities. When DHA27, DHA7, and AS were combined with AMP, FICI values were 0.31, 0.38, and 0.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-17-01934-t001">Table 1</xref>B), indicating they all had antibacterial enhancement activity. Among three compounds, DHA27 had the smallest FICI, demonstrating that DHA27 had the best antibacterial enhancement activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.4. DHA27 Potentiates Antibacterial Effects of AMP against Not Only E. coli Standard Strain But Also Clinical Strains</title><p>DHA27 had the best antibacterial enhancement activity among four compounds, but its aqueous solubility was very poor (maximum solubility was 512 mg/L in 5% DMSO and 128 mg/L in water at room temperature). To carry out subsequent experiments, its aqueous solubility should be improved. The results showed that if DHA27 was converted into corresponding hydrochloride salt, its aqueous solubility markedly improved; the solubility of DHA27 hydrochloride was better than that of DHA27 (&#x0003c;2048 mg/L in water at room temperature).</p><p>For the bacterial dynamic growth curve assay, AS and DHA7 were used as controls. DHA27 hydrochloride (DHA27 for short, 64 mg/L) only slightly delayed the growth of ATCC 35218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). However, DHA27 in combination with AMP could significantly inhibit the bacterial growth from 4 to 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). This result was also supported by the colony counting method (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>Then, 40 <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical strains were used to evaluate the activity of DHA27. The results showed that these clinical strains were highly resistant to AMP and MIC<sub>50</sub> was 128 mg/L. When 256, 128, and 64 mg/L of DHA27 was used in combination with AMP, the average FICI was 0.36, 0.31 and 0.27, respectively; the effective rate was 47%, 78%, and 66%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-17-01934-t002">Table 2</xref>). The aforementioned results indicated that DHA27 had the antibacterial enhancement activity of AMP against not only <italic>E. coli</italic> standard strain ATCC 35218 but also most clinical strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.5. DHA27 Only Potentiates Antibacterial Effects of &#x003b2;-Lactam Antibiotics Not Non-&#x003b2;-Lactam Antibiotics against Clinical E. coli Strains</title><p>Previous studies found that AS had a better antibacterial enhancement effect when combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics than with other kinds of antibiotics. Herein, the antibacterial enhancement activity of DHA27 combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics and non-&#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, was also detected. PA&#x003b2;N, as a known AcrB inhibitor, was used as a control the agent.</p><p>The results showed that the average FICIs of six strains were almost lower than 0.5 when DHA27 was combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics including AMP, CPA, OXA, and PIP in a concentration-dependent manner, while FICIs were higher than 0.5 when DHA27 was combined with non-&#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics such as GAT and AZI. Interestingly, PA&#x003b2;N did not work when it was combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics at every concentration. It only worked when it was combined with GAT and AZI at the highest concentration (128 mg/L); the FICIs were 0.38 and 0.32, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-17-01934-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned results suggested that DHA27 potentiated the antibacterial effects of &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, not non-&#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics, against clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, and DHA27 had better antibacterial enhancement activity when combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics compared with PA&#x003b2;N.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.6. DHA27 Increases the Accumulation of Daunorubicin and Nile Red within E. coli ATCC 35218 But Does Not Change the Bacterial Membrane Permeability</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms of DHA27 was tightly related to AcrB just like AS, two methods were used to observe the effect ofDHA27 on daunorubicin and nile red accumulation.</p><p>Daunorubicin is not a &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotic, and it can emit red autofluorescence [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; therefore, it can be traced and observed easily and hence used as a tracer agent. The results showed both AS and DHA27 could increase the daunorubicin accumulation within <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218 in dose- and time-dependent manners, but the effective concentration of DHA27 was much lower than that of AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Nile red is only a weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but undergoes a significant increase in fluorescent quantum yield when in nonpolar environment such as the cell membrane. Cells were preloaded with nile red in the absence or presence of DHA27. Once the cells were energized by the addition of glucose, the efflux of nile red could be observed as a drop in fluorescence. The result was similar to that from daunorubicin accumulation assay. DHA27 could inhibit the efflux of nile red just like AcrB inhibitor PA&#x003b2;N (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>As well-known, decreased drug accumulation might be the result of damaged permeability of bacterial membrane. To rule out this possibility of changed permeability of bacterial membrane, the effect of DHA27 on bacterial membrane permeability was observed via examining the hydrolysis rate of a chromogenic &#x003b2;-lactam, nitrocefin by <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin by the &#x003b2;-lactamase releases a colored compound that can be measured at 490 nm. The rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis is limited by the rate of diffusion across the inner membrane, hence an increased rate of hydrolysis of nitrocefin would be the indicator of decreased membrane permeability. The result showed each concentration of DHA27 (32, 64, and 128 mg/L) did not increase nitrocefin hydrolysis but PA&#x003b2;N (256 mg/L, the effective work concentration) did, demonstrating DHA27 did not change the permeability of bacterial membrane (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, DHA27 had stronger antibacterial enhancement activity and its bioactivity was closely related to the inhibition of efflux pump and did not affect the bacterial membrane permeability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.7.

DHA27 Can Bind to Polypeptides from AcrB Obtained by Molecular Docking</title><p>Biological experiments demonstrated DHA27 had good antibacterial enhancement activity, which was tightly related to AcrB. Herein, molecular docking was performed to further identify the possible binding sites of DHA27 to AcrB.</p><p>The results showed Gln176, Ser46 and Ser134 were probably involved inthe binding sites of AcrB to DHA27. One of the oxygen atoms of peroxide bridge on the nucleus structure interacted with Gln176. The oxygen atom of the side chain interacted with Ser46 at a distance of 2.1 &#x000c5;. When PDB ID 2DRD were used, the sulfur atom of the side chain interacted with Ser134 at a distance of 3.1 &#x000c5;. These interactions were all via the hydrogen binding effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B).When PDB ID 28JS and PDB ID 4DX5 were used, similar results were obtained, too (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-17-01934">Figure S7</xref>). And DHA27 were also surrounded by Phe178, Phe610, Phe615, Phe628 which were in hydrophobic trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f007">Figure 7</xref>B), but there were no formation of chemical bond between DHA27 and these residues. Maybe there was no conjugated structure like benzene ring or carbonyl in DHA27 unlike AS and DHA7; it couldn&#x02019;t interact with hydrophobic trap through &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions.</p><p>To verify the binding sites of DHA27 to AcrB, four polypeptides from AcrB (named as P1, P2, P1a and P2a) were synthesized. P1 and P2 were peptides from the active sites Phe134 and Ser46, respectively. P1a and P2a were respective mutated peptides at Ser134 and Ser46. P3 was an irrelevant peptide from cells. DHA27 was pre-incubated with P1, P2, P1a, P2a and P3, respectively for 30 min, and then pre-incubated DHA27 was added into <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218. Theoretically, if DHA27 bound the peptides from AcrB, pre-incubated DHA27 would lose its ability to increase the daunorubicin accumulation within ATCC 35218.</p><p>The result demonstrated that DHA27 could increase the daunorubicin accumulation within ATCC 35218 as previously mentioned (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 vs. broth), and P1, P2, and P3 alone couldn&#x02019;t influence daunorubicin accumulation. DHA27 incubated with P3 didn&#x02019;t decrease daunorubicin accumulation, demonstrating that DHA27 couldn&#x02019;t bind to the irrelevant peptide in vitro. However, DHA27 pre-incubated with P1 and P2 lost the activity to increase daunorubicin accumulation, while it pre-incubated with P1a and P2a which were mutant peptides of P1 and P2 regained its activity to increase daunorubicin accumulation, suggesting that DHA27 could bind to P1 and P2 while it could not bind to their mutant peptides, demonstrating Ser134 and Ser46 might be involved in the binding sites of DHA27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-17-01934-f007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot10-ijms-17-01934"><title>2.10.

Discussion</title><p>This study was the first to demonstrate that a new derivative from AS, named as DHA27, had good antibacterial enhancement activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> with low cytotoxicity; it was obtained based on the 3D-SAR and molecular docking experiments. It exerted its antibacterial enhancement activity via binding to the DP of AcrB and then inhibiting the function of AcrB.</p><p>AcrB plays a key role in the AcrAB-TolC efflux system, inhibition of AcrB can affect the function of AcrAB-TolC, leading to the reverse of bacterial resistance. Till now, the main known AcrB inhibitors are PA&#x003b2;N, NMP, D13-9001, and MBX2319 reported by others, and AS and DHA7 reported by the present study [<xref rid="B8-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, these inhibitors such as PA&#x003b2;N had much more serious toxicity or lower activities; so new antibacterial enhancers should be developed.</p><p>3D-SAR studies have been found to be of great importance to designing and developing potent drugs. CoMFA used for the 3D-SAR methodology is based on the assumption that the changes in antibacterial enhancement activities are related to their 3D shape and changes in molecular properties represented by electrostatic and steric characteristics [<xref rid="B13-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The crystal structure of AcrB is clear [<xref rid="B11-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is possible to develop new antibacterial enhancers based on the structure of AcrB. In this study, 86 new compounds having potential antibacterial enhancement activity were designed using 3D-SAR studies. To narrow down the potential active compounds, molecular docking, which could figure out the probable binding pocket of known active compounds, was used. At last, four compounds named as DHA 25-DHA 28 with a higher total score and simple synthetic routes from 22 compounds were selected and synthesized based on the results of 3D-SAR and molecular docking. Among them, DHA 27 had the best antibacterial enhancement activity.</p><p>Our previous studies reported the antibacterial enhancement activity of AS and its derivative DHA7 for the first time [<xref rid="B9-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although DHA7 had better activity than AS, it was still only effective against standard <italic>E. coli</italic> strains rather than clinical strains and had poor aqueous solubility as AS. Hence, they could not be developed for clinical application. Herein, DHA27 was selected from 86 compounds. Our results demonstrated it could increase the accumulation of daunorubicin and nile red within ATCC 35218 and it didn't increase nitrocefin hydrolysis, demonstrating it played its antibacterial enhancement role via increasing drug accumulation but not changing the bacterial membrane permeability.</p><p>It is well known that increased drug accumulation was related to decreased efflux and increased membrane permeability. Nitrocefin is a chromogenic &#x003b2;-lactam which could be hydrolyzed by the&#x003b2;-lactamase and then released a colored compound that can be measured at 490 nm. The rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis is limited by the rate of diffusion across the inner membrane, hence an increased rate of hydrolysis of nitrocefin would be indicative of inner membrane permeabilization.</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> AG100A lacking AcrA and AcrB and AG100A/pET28a-AcrB re-expressing AcrB, the recombinant AG100A harboring pET28a-AcrB, were used. The results showed that both DHA27 and PA&#x003b2;N lost the enhancement of AMP against <italic>E. coli</italic> AG100A and regained it against <italic>E. coli</italic> AG100A/pET28a-AcrB, which demonstrated that DHA27 should be an AcrB inhibitor. Moreover, DHA27 alone markedly reduces <italic>acrB&#x02019;s</italic> mRNA expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218 in a dose-dependent manner and its antibacterial enhancement activity is related to the degree of <italic>acrB</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical strains, which further indicated that DHA27 was an AcrB inhibitor.</p><p>DHA27 had the following advantages. (1) The activity exhibited by DHA27 in vitro assays was superior to that of AS and DHA7 at the same concentrations against ATCC 35218; (2) DHA27 was effective against not only <italic>E. coli</italic> standard strains but also clinical strains when it was combined with AMP, which indicated its good potential for clinical application; (3) The activity of DHA27 was much better than that of known AcrB inhibitor PA&#x003b2;N when it was combined with &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics. &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics are extensively used worldwide because of their safety. So, DHA27 is more valuable to be developed for clinical use than PA&#x003b2;N; (4) DHA27 could be converted into its hydrochloride so that it had good aqueous solubility for the possibility of its clinical use; (5) DHA27 had lower toxicity than PA&#x003b2;N because it derived from ART [<xref rid="B15-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present data demonstrated that DHA27 had no cytotoxicity at concentrations that had antibacterial enhancement activity. Therefore, above results indicated that DHA27 exhibits the following characteristics of an AcrB inhibitor, as described by Lomovskaya et al. [<xref rid="B16-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: (i) it inhibits the extrusion or accumulation of AcrAB-TolC substrates; (ii) it potentiates the antibacterial activity of diverse agents that are substrates of AcrAB-TolC; and (iii) it does not exhibit activity against mutants lacking functional AcrAB-TolC pumps.</p><p>The crystal structure of AcrB is a homo-trimeric protein, and each protomer is in any of these three conformations: Access (loose or A), Binding (tight or B), and Extrusion (open or C) [<xref rid="B11-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The substrates are transported through dual multidrug-binding pockets via the peristaltic motion of the substrate translocation pathway [<xref rid="B3-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different substrates bind to different sites of the binding pocket of AcrB.

AP and DP are separated by a loop rich in glycine called as G-loop.</p><p>Several AcrB inhibitors (PA&#x003b2;N, NMP, D13-9001, and MBX2319) and some of its substrates (MIN and DOX) have been found by molecular docking experiments. It has been demonstrated that (1) the binding positions of all inhibitors are partially overlapped [<xref rid="B25-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The important binding sites are Phe136, Gln176, Tyr327, Phe178, Phe615, and Phe628, which are also partial sites of binding of AS, DHA7, and DHA27 to AcrB; (2) All inhibitors have higher affinities for the DP of protomer B compared with the substrate MIN. Thus, competitive binding of the inhibitors might alter the properties of substrate-binding sites, reducing the affinity of substrates to the DP of AcrB.</p><p>The most likely mechanism of inhibition of DHA27 was through competitive inhibition and/or blockage of access to the substrate-binding site of AcrB. This was in contrast to PA&#x003b2;N, which also increases the permeability of the inner membrane [<xref rid="B16-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The binding positions of AS, DHA7, and DHA27 were partially overlapped and a little bit deeper (close to the gate) than those of reported other inhibitors (PA&#x003b2;N, NMP, D13-9001, and MBX2319) [<xref rid="B26-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These ART derivatives are apt to interact with polar residues, while other reported inhibitors have a predilection for hydrophobic residues. The reason of this can be the difference in their structure. The structures of ART derivatives have no or only one aromatic nucleus that interacts with polar residues via hydrogen bonding, while the structures of reported inhibitors include more than one aromatic nuclei that can interact with hydrophobic residues via the ring-stacking effect.</p><p>The binding sites of DHA27 were partially overlapped with those of AS and DHA7, and previously reported AcrB inhibitors other than MBX2319 and D13-9001 [<xref rid="B25-ijms-17-01934" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The binding sites of DHA27 were verified by the competitive inhibition experiments. However, it was not directly confirmed that DHA27 had higher affinity compared with other substrates of AcrB (MIN and DOX). It is proposed that important binding sites for DHA27 were Gln176, Ser46, and Ser134 to influence the morphology of the substrate extrusion channel, alter the properties of substrate-binding sites, and reduce the affinity of substrates to the DP of AcrB. This prediction was supported by the polypeptide-binding assays in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-17-01934"><title>4. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4dot1-ijms-17-01934"><title>4.1.

Different concentrations of DHA27 (32, 64, and 128 mg/L) and PA&#x003b2;N (256 mg/L) were added, respectively. Nitrocefin was then added to give a final concentration of 32 mg/L. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 490 nm with a plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot13-ijms-17-01934"><title>4.13.

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, DHA27 showed better antibacterial enhancement activity compared with previously reported AcrB inhibitors, and its molecular mechanism might be related to its binding to AcrB in binding conformation. Gln176, Ser46, and Ser134 were probably involved in the binding sites of AcrB. Its favorable physical and pharmacological properties and lack of cytotoxicity at effective concentrations make it a potential efflux pump inhibitor worthy of further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the basic and frontier research projects of Chongqing, China, cstc2015jcyjA10097, and grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81173103).</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-17-01934"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/11/1934/s1">www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/11/1934/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-17-01934-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-17-01934-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Hong Zhou has full access to all of the experimental design and data in the study.
