The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors varies from individuals, and factors determining responses to DPP-4 inhibitors have not been fully established.

Fisher's exact test was used if expected cell frequencies were &#x0003c;5. For an additive model, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means, followed by post hoc analysis. Proportions in additive model were analyzed in the chi-square test. Genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg equilibrium using the chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess independent associations between patient's responses to DPP-4 inhibitors (dependent variable) and rs3765467 (independent variable), including covariates. Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Given that triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values were not normally distributed, statistical analyses of these values were conducted on log-transformed data.

For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467.</p><p>Previously, we reported no significant association between genetic variations in <italic>DPP4</italic> itself, and patient responses to DPP-4 inhibitors.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> On the other hand, an association between interleukin-6 polymorphism and DPP-4 inhibitor response has been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Recent preclinical studies have shown association between DPP-4 inhibitors and incretin receptors.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Since administration of DPP-4 inhibitor to incretin receptor knockout mice did not improve glycemic parameters, these findings suggest the importance of incretin receptor in glucoregulatory actions of DPP-4 inhibitors.</p><p>Two possible functional mechanisms of genetic effects have been suggested:<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> (1) GLP-1 receptor enhances cAMP signaling, and (2) GLP-1 receptor alters pancreatic &#x003b2; cell apoptosis or proliferation. Several papers reported that variation in <italic>GLP1R</italic> could regulate intracellular postreceptor signaling.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Moreover, <italic>GLP1R</italic> variant is reported to be able to alter receptor binding affinity.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Rs3765467 is a nonsynonymous mutation in which amino acid arginine is replaced by glutamine at Exon 5 position 131 (R131Q) of the GLP-1 receptor, and it was also reported to be linked with cAMP signaling in oxynotomodulin.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> A recent human study showed that rs3765467 had a very profound insulinotropic effect in response to infused GLP-1 agonist.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Given this point, a <italic>GLP1R</italic> variation, especially rs3765467, could be a candidate for determining the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors. Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations.</p><p>A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by <italic>GLP1R</italic> variation.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. Patients with rs3765467 minor allele genotype showed a significant reduction in the plasma glucose level before adjustment. The small sample size might account for the statistical insignificance after adjustment. In contrast, our study showed response rates for GA and GG/GA genotypes of 52.7% and 68.8%, which were comparable to our estimation. In addition, the statistical power reached 83%, which slightly exceeded the 80% we had predicted.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are some limitations to our study. First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study. Nevertheless, our data suggest for the first time that <italic>GLP1R</italic> variation can affect patient response to DPP-4 inhibitors. Finally, since the current study was an exploratory and observation study, we could not confirm the actual or specific mechanism of <italic>GLP1R</italic> and DPP-4 inhibitor response.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that DPP-4 inhibitor treatment reduces blood glucose levels during a 24-week period, and that a greater number of DPP-4 inhibitor responders carry either the GA/AA genotype or an A allele. In multivariate regression analysis, both GA/AA genotype and an A allele for <italic>GLP1R</italic> were consistently associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response. This suggests that variation in <italic>GLP1R</italic> (rs3765467) can influence DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy. Further studies in a large population are warranted to determine the mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibitor response in <italic>GLP1R</italic>. Moreover, it would be interesting to identify the genetic differences related to DPP-4 inhibitor response among other ethnic groups. This finding could be clinically relevant in that one could potentially anticipate DPP-4 inhibitor responses before administering thereof.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank to all participants in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-95-e5155-s001.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e864" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ANOVA = analysis of variance, BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, DPP-4 = dipepdityl peptidase-4, GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide, <italic>GLP1R</italic> = GLP-1 receptor gene, HbA1c = glycated hemoglobin, HDL = high-density lipoprotein, LDL = low-density lipoprotein, OR = odds ratio, T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>CSK and ESK contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: This study is financially supported by the Bio &#x00026; Medical Technology Development Program of the NRF funded by the Korean government, MSIP (2016R1A2B4013029 and 2015M3A9B6029138) and the Korean Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare (HI14C0060) and the Faculty Fund from Yonsei University College of Medicine (No. 6-2011-0085).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><italic>Authorship</italic>: Study concept and design&#x02014;EH, SHK, and ESK; analysis and interpretation of data&#x02014;EH, HSP, CSK, and ESK,</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Drafting of the manuscript&#x02014;EH and ESK; critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: OK, EYC, HJW, Y-hL, S-HL, CHK, L-KK, SHK, and KSP; statistical analysis&#x02014;EH and HSP; administrative, technical, or material support&#x02014;Y-hL, S-HL, CHK, L-KK, SHK, CSK, and KSP.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Drucker</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group>
