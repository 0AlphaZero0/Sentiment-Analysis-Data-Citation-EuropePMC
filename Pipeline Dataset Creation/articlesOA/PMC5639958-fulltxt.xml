To accomplish this, we implemented large-scale interventions with the potential to affect outcomes at a community level. All study interventions were selected to be focused, adaptable, and feasible in clinical settings without substantial additional resources for their implementation or the assessment of their outcomes. We were able to successfully implement all of the study components and achieve valid outcomes, demonstrating feasibility of this multilayered, pragmatic approach.</p><p>In general, we found it feasible to conduct study interventions within the usual structures and procedures at participating sites. This was achieved by taking into account their normal processes and largely depending on their programmatic staff. The study included a wide variety of sites, which were allowed substantial flexibility to adapt study implementation for their individual context. This approach was intended to enhance generalizability of our study findings to disparate settings; however, it also had implications for study outcomes. As one example, some test sites were co-located with HIV care sites, while others were geographically distinct. These differences likely influenced the process of linkage and the way the financial incentive intervention could be implemented at different sites. As another, there was a change in the US HIV treatment guidelines during the conduct of the study, from a recommendation to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with CD4&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;500<sup><xref rid="bibr60-1740774517711682" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> to one of treatment for all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of CD4 cell count.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-1740774517711682" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> However, while the study provided information regarding such a change to all HIV care sites, it did not require specific treatment approaches or monitor provider practices; thus, there may have been variability in treatment strategies by provider and site.</p><p>In keeping with the desire to work within the existing healthcare system and without additional staff and patient burden, the study aimed to use data that were already being collected, rather than collecting data separately via usual research methods for the study. However, this resulted in some challenges. For example, routinely collected HIV testing data were used to assess the expanded HIV testing efforts in the hospital settings; unfortunately, these data were often incomplete or were not collected uniformly at all hospitals. Another example was our novel use of HIV confirmatory test results, CD4 counts, and viral load values reported by laboratories to the US National HIV Surveillance System to assess the primary outcomes of the financial incentive interventions on linkage to care and viral suppression. However, surveillance data did not allow us to ascertain whether patients were on antiretroviral therapy, and our use of it was complicated by the fact that some laboratory data were reported to surveillance in the jurisdiction of the patient&#x02019;s place of residence, rather than to the one in which they received care. In addition, the robustness of the surveillance data varied by jurisdiction in terms of data completeness and timeliness. Resolving these issues required intense investments of effort to improve data quality to an acceptable level.</p><p>The use of cluster randomization of the HIV test sites and HIV care sites for the financial incentive interventions presented both advantages and challenges for implementation. This site-randomized design avoided the logistical difficulties that might occur if incentives were offered to some, but not all, individuals who qualified for incentives at a given HIV test or care site. However, participating sites initially raised concerns that patients at sites randomized to the standard of care arm might attempt to migrate to financial incentive sites, potentially overwhelming some sites with new patients or depleting the patient population of other sites. Several study procedures were put in place to minimize such migration. For example, patients had to be established in care for at least 3&#x02009;months before they were eligible to receive financial incentives for viral suppression. Thus, patients who switched providers just to receive financial incentives would have had to wait a substantial amount of time before they qualified for the incentive. Similarly, testing sites were instructed not to give more than one coupon to any individual, care sites were instructed not to redeem more than one coupon for any individual, and the coupons were created using uniquely colored and embossed paper to make them difficult to reproduce.</p><p>The use of multiple randomization schemes within the study could have potentially interfered with study outcomes. The individual randomization for the prevention of positives component occurred at sites that were also part of the site-randomization for financial incentives for viral suppression. However, while both cluster and individual randomization were used in different components of the study, each component was completely independent. Sites for linkage to care and viral suppression, while both involved in cluster randomizations, did not involve the same locations. Moreover, the outcomes of the financial incentive interventions were at different, distinct stages of the treatment continuum so could not have involved the same individuals at the same time. Finally, enrollment of individuals into the prevention for positives component began as the financial incentive intervention for viral suppression was ending; thus, explicit interactions between the two interventions were not possible.</p><p>In summary, HPTN 065 was an ambitious 4-year multi-component study that aimed to assess the feasibility of a &#x0201c;test and treat&#x0201d; approach for HIV prevention in the United States at a community level. The two study intervention communities, the Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, allowed for the results to be generalizable to other urban communities with substantial rates of HIV. The study&#x02019;s design was successful in using approaches that fit within established structures and that could be layered on the ongoing standard of care without disrupting health services. This study demonstrated the possibility of implementing and evaluating &#x0201c;test and treat&#x0201d; strategies if pragmatic and community-focused approaches are used.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors recognize and thank the members of the HPTN 065 study team, including those at the departments of health in the participating communities (Washington, DC; Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HPTN leadership and operations center, the HPTN statistical and data management center, the HPTN 065 community advisory committee, the site investigators and staff, and all participants in the HPTN 065 study.
