These epigenetic modifications can extend outside the boundaries of TE insertions and lead to silencing of nearby genes, resulting in a trade-off between TE silencing and interference with nearby gene regulation. Therefore, purifying selection is expected to remove silenced TE insertions near genes more efficiently and prevent their accumulation within a population. To explore how effects of TE silencing on gene regulation shapes purifying selection on TEs, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 166 individuals of a large population of the outcrossing species <italic>Capsella grandiflora.</italic> We found that most TEs are rare, and in chromosome arms, silenced TEs are exposed to stronger purifying selection than those that are not silenced by 24-nucleotide small RNAs, especially with increasing proximity to genes. An age-of-allele test of neutrality on a subset of TEs supports our inference of purifying selection on silenced TEs, suggesting that our results are robust to varying transposition rates. Our results provide new insights into the processes affecting the accumulation of TEs in an outcrossing species and support the view that epigenetic silencing of TEs results in a trade-off between preventing TE proliferation and interference with nearby gene regulation. We also suggest that in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions, the negative aspects of epigenetic TE silencing are missing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>purifying selection</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>epigenetic silencing</kwd><kwd><italic>Capsella</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since Barbara McClintock first described mobile elements in the maize genome in 1950 (<xref rid="evx206-B33" ref-type="bibr">McClintock 1950</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B35" ref-type="bibr">Nanjundiah 1996</xref>), transposable elements (TEs) have been found to be very frequent in the genomes of higher plants (<xref rid="evx206-B16" ref-type="bibr">Hollister et al. 2011</xref>). Despite being common, the movement and accumulation of TEs are viewed as disadvantageous for the host. This is mainly because new TE insertions can disrupt genes or other functional DNA sequences, increase the risk of ectopic recombination, and because TEs are linked to a metabolic cost for the host (<xref rid="evx206-B21" ref-type="bibr">Langley et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B10" ref-type="bibr">Finnegan 1992</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B1" ref-type="bibr">Badge and Brookfield 1997</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B22" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2015</xref>). However, other factors, like the epigenetic modification of a TE insertion, can also potentially be harmful for the host (<xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lisch 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B22" ref-type="bibr">Lee 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch and Springer 2017</xref>).</p><p>The methylation of TEs is the result of the defense mechanisms of the host plant, which can downregulate the activity of TEs, thus preventing further proliferation (<xref rid="evx206-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lisch 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B30" ref-type="bibr">Mar&#x000ed;-Ord&#x000f3;&#x000f1;ez et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B12" ref-type="bibr">Fultz et al. 2015</xref>). In plants, epigenetic silencing of TEs is achieved mainly via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway which includes the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) and 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (<xref rid="evx206-B30" ref-type="bibr">Mar&#x000ed;-Ord&#x000f3;&#x000f1;ez et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B31" ref-type="bibr">Matzke et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B12" ref-type="bibr">Fultz et al. 2015</xref>). The Pol IV RdDM pathway primarily initiates, maintains, and reinforces the methylation of TEs, which are targeted by 24-nt siRNAs (<xref rid="evx206-B12" ref-type="bibr">Fultz et al. 2015</xref>). The 24-nt siRNAs are usually derived from the TE mRNA of the targeted insertion, but these 24-nt siRNAs are also known to be able to <italic>trans</italic>-silence other highly similar TEs (<xref rid="evx206-B41" ref-type="bibr">Slotkin et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B30" ref-type="bibr">Mar&#x000ed;-Ord&#x000f3;&#x000f1;ez et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B12" ref-type="bibr">Fultz et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>
<xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut (2009)</xref> showed that the regulation of TE activities through epigenetic silencing could cause a conflict between reducing transposition and interfering with the expression of neighboring genes. Since epigenetically silenced TEs have a distinct chromatin state from active functional DNA sequences, the spreading of chromatin modifications, which were initially intended to silence a TE insertion, into neighboring genes and their <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory regions can silence these genes (<xref rid="evx206-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch and Springer 2017</xref>). In the selfer <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, where most TE variants are rare and associated with altered gene expression and methylation (<xref rid="evx206-B48" ref-type="bibr">Stuart et al. 2016</xref>), the genomic distribution of TEs is thought to be mainly governed by purifying selection acting against insertions in and close to genes (<xref rid="evx206-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>). However, the effect of purifying selection on TE insertions close to genes, especially on epigenetically silenced TEs, is less well studied in outcrossing plants (but see, e.g., <xref rid="evx206-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lockton et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B28" ref-type="bibr">Lockton and Gaut 2010</xref>).</p><p>If purifying selection affects TEs differently depending on their epigenetics, then this should result in a deficit of silenced TEs within genomic regions where silencing TEs is linked to disadvantages. In addition, purifying selection is expected to skew the insertion frequency spectrum (IFS) of silenced TEs toward an increased proportion of rare insertions (<xref rid="evx206-B36" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Slatkin 2014</xref>). However, nonequilibrium demography, TE insertion biases or nonconstant transposition rates caused by recent TE bursts can also result in similar signatures (<xref rid="evx206-B2" ref-type="bibr">Barr&#x000f3;n et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B3" ref-type="bibr">Blumenstiel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B32" ref-type="bibr">Maumus and Quesneville 2014</xref>). For example, recent TE bursts are expected to increase the proportion of rare TEs through a rapid accumulation of young insertions (<xref rid="evx206-B2" ref-type="bibr">Barr&#x000f3;n et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B3" ref-type="bibr">Blumenstiel et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B32" ref-type="bibr">Maumus and Quesneville 2014</xref>). Therefore, controlling for demographic effects and transposition rate variation is crucial for assessing the influence of purifying selection on TEs.</p><p>The outcrossing crucifer <italic>Capsella grandiflora</italic>, which is closely related to the self-fertilizing model plants <italic>Capsella rubella</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, is a well-suited model system to quantify selection on TEs. The main benefits of studying <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> are its large and relatively constant effective population size without strong population structure (<xref rid="evx206-B11" ref-type="bibr">Foxe et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B42" ref-type="bibr">Slotte et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B9" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al. 2015</xref>), in contrast to the outcrosser <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, where strong population structure and historical bottlenecks need to be accounted for when inferring selection on TEs (<xref rid="evx206-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lockton et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B28" ref-type="bibr">Lockton and Gaut 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, natural selection on both protein-coding and conserved noncoding genomic regions is efficient (<xref rid="evx206-B42" ref-type="bibr">Slotte et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B51" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B46" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2017</xref>) and, in contrast to highly selfing species where TEs could be affected by linked selection, the outcrossing nature and rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium of <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> enables the study of local selection effects acting on TEs. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing data are available from large <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> populations (<xref rid="evx206-B18" ref-type="bibr">Josephs et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B46" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>A previous study on <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> showed that the presence/absence of TEs in proximity of genes was associated with <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory gene expression variation (<xref rid="evx206-B46" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2017</xref>). Additionally, analyses of allele-specific gene expression have shown that silencing of TEs near genes is associated with reduced expression of the allele on the same haplotype as the TE insertion in <italic>Capsella</italic> (<xref rid="evx206-B47" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2015</xref>). Hence, there is accumulating evidence that TE silencing affects gene expression in <italic>Capsella</italic>, but how this shapes selection against TEs has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, we used whole genome resequencing data from 166 individuals of a large <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population to investigate how interference between TE silencing and gene regulation affects selection on TE insertions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Population Genomic Data Processing</title><p>We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population, generated by <xref rid="evx206-B18" ref-type="bibr">Josephs et al.

After removing 34 samples with poor mapping coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online), we generated a pooled <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population data set by merging the mapped reads for all remaining 166 individuals with SAMtools 1.3 (<xref rid="evx206-B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B23" ref-type="bibr">Li 2011</xref>).</p><p>In order to compare TE insertion frequencies with site frequency spectra at 4-fold degenerate synonymous sites and 0-fold degenerate nonsynonymous sites, we mapped the trimmed and subsampled reads from the 166 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> individuals included in the TE analyses to the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference genome using bwa mem 0.7.13 (<xref rid="evx206-B24" ref-type="bibr">Li 2013</xref>).

We called variants using Unified Genotyper (<xref rid="evx206-B7" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B49" ref-type="bibr">Van der Auwera et al. 2013</xref>), and applied default hard filtering on the identified SNPs in order to remove poorly called sites. In addition, we removed all sites found in repeats detected in the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference genome by RepeatMasker 4.0.7, using BEDTools 2.26.0 (<xref rid="evx206-B38" ref-type="bibr">Quinlan and Hall 2010</xref>). We further filtered the coverage depth of each site on an individual level to remove all allele calls with coverage &#x0003c;10 or &#x0003e;200 with VCFtools 0.1.15 (<xref rid="evx206-B6" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al. 2011</xref>). To polarize alleles as ancestral or derived, we followed the procedure outlined in <xref rid="evx206-B20" ref-type="bibr">Laenen et al.

All 4-fold degenerate sites, where at least 300 of the 332 alleles were successfully assessed, were used to compute the polarized SFS in R 3.3.0 (<xref rid="evx206-B39" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team 2008</xref>). The expected SFS of neutrally evolving sites in a constant population was calculated by using the Watterson estimator for genetic diversity for 4-fold sites (<xref rid="evx206-B50" ref-type="bibr">Watterson 1975</xref>).

Because a high-quality <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> reference genome assembly was lacking, we circumvented this issue by identifying insertions targeted by siRNAs in the closely related species <italic>C. rubella. C. rubella</italic> was derived from a <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>-like outcrossing ancestor fairly recently, most likely &#x0003c;200,000&#x02009;years ago (<xref rid="evx206-B11" ref-type="bibr">Foxe et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brandvain et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx206-B43" ref-type="bibr">Slotte et al. 2013</xref>), and it is the best available model for inferring such information. Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (<xref rid="evx206-B47" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2015</xref>), hence, we expect silenced TEs in <italic>C. rubella</italic> to be also silenced in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the <italic>C. rubella</italic> reference accession generated by <xref rid="evx206-B45" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. (2015)</xref> (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (<xref rid="evx206-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al. 2014</xref>) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (<xref rid="evx206-B8" ref-type="bibr">Dobin et al. 2013</xref>), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5&#x02032; end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs. We considered all TEs with a minimum of 10 mapped siRNAs to be effectively targeted by siRNAs and silenced, and labeled them as siRNA+ TEs. The remaining TEs were labeled siRNA&#x02212; TEs. Within the <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population, all copies of a siRNA+ and siRNA&#x02212; TEs were considered as siRNA+ and siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions, respectively. Differentiating between uniquely and multi-mapping siRNAs to assess siRNA+ and siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions yielded concordant results with the approach described earlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig.

This method does not rely on the annotated TEs present in the reference genome and is therefore able to identify both novel and annotated TEs, as well as estimate their population frequencies. We analyzed our pooled population data set, following recommendations for PoPoolationTE2 analyses (<xref rid="evx206-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kofler et al. 2016</xref>) with slight modifications. Specifically, we conducted hard filtering of the TE insertions based on a minimum average physical coverage of 10, minimum average coverage of 10, maximum allowed frequency of other TEs of 0.2, and maximum allowed frequency of structural variants of 0.2. We used the results from PopoolationTE2 to generate insertion frequency spectra (IFS) of the TE insertions detected in the pooled <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population data set. Distinguishing between retrotransposons (class I TEs) and DNA transposons (class II TEs) resulted in similar patterns for the IFS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary figs.

We therefore distinguished between TEs inserted in centromeric and pericentromeric regions, which are likely highly heterochromatic, and those inserted in the chromosome arms, which are expected to have a higher proportion of open chromatin, and where insertion of a silenced TE might be more likely to interfere with gene regulation. If siRNA+ TEs in chromosome arms are subject to stronger purifying selection than those in centromeric/pericentromeric regions, we expect the proportion of siRNA+ TEs to be lower in chromosome arms than in centromeric/pericentromeric regions. Genomic regions were assigned as likely centromeric/pericentromeric or representing chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online) as in <xref rid="evx206-B47" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al.

Additionally, the distribution of siRNA+ TE insertions revealed a significant underrepresentation of siRNA+ TEs in genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evx206-T1">table 1</xref>), like in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>). Finally, the median distance to the next gene was significantly higher for siRNA+ than for siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions, which was also the case in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>). Although we did not directly assess local methylation status, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> it has been shown that small RNA targeting is a good proxy for methylation status (<xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut 2009</xref>).</p><p>We found no strong support for major deviations from demographic equilibrium based on comparisons of expected and observed 4-fold synonymous site frequency spectra under a standard neutral model, suggesting that demographic changes should have a limited effect on our TE insertion frequency spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). We also investigated the possibility of purifying selection affecting our IFS under a relaxed transposition rate assumption by a detailed analysis using a method that accounts for TE age. Although these results should be seen as tentative, as they are based on a low number of TE insertions, they suggest that negative selection is more important than variation in TE transposition rates in explaining TE insertion frequencies in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx206-F3">fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the impact of our bioinformatic procedure to classify TEs as siRNA+ or siRNA&#x02212;, we increased the mapped siRNA cutoff, but the results remained similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary figs. S2 and S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). In particular, one unexpected result remained regardless of the cutoff used, namely the excess of rare siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions flanking genes compared with the other three siRNA&#x02212; TE insertion groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx206-F1">fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). This would suggest that for siRNA&#x02212; chromosome arm TE insertions, purifying selection has a similar impact on insertions in genes, 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;kb from genes and &#x0003e;2&#x02009;kb from genes but that siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions flanking genes are under stronger purifying selection. Although it is possible that gene flanking insertions are more likely to disrupt functional DNA sequences like <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions than insertions further away from genes, this does not explain the observed difference in IFS between insertions flanking genes and those in genes. It is however possible that we missed or falsely assigned some silenced TE insertions, because we used small RNA data from <italic>C. rubella</italic> to discriminate siRNA+ and siRNA&#x02212; TE insertions in <italic>C. grandiflora.</italic> Additionally, false positive/negative TE identifications and inaccurate insertion frequency estimations are possible as a result of challenges resulting from identifying nonreference TE insertions (<xref rid="evx206-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kofler et al. 2016</xref>). Although simulations have shown that PoPoolationTE2 can have an error rate of up to 4.8% for TE identification, the accuracy of estimates of TE frequencies was in general higher for TEs with population frequencies &#x0223c;0.1 or 0.9 (mean estimation deviation &#x0223c;0.01) (<xref rid="evx206-B19" ref-type="bibr">Kofler et al. 2016</xref>). However, we do not expect such errors to depend on the epigenetic state of TEs, and our results were further robust to different siRNA+/siRNA&#x02212; assessments and to reanalyses using subsampled data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary figs. S1&#x02013;S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Thus, errors in TE identification likely have a minor effect on our results. Future studies should generate small RNA data directly from the studied <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> individuals and improvement of TE identification software should mitigate such effects.</p><p>The TE age assessment in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> based on <italic>C. rubella</italic> could also be a source of error, because losses or gains of TE copies in in <italic>C. rubella</italic> would lead to over- or underestimation of the age of TE copies (<xref rid="evx206-B3" ref-type="bibr">Blumenstiel et al. 2014</xref>). Additionally, not all copies of the <italic>Gypsy 2395</italic> and <italic>Gypsy 2500</italic> retrotransposons could be properly aligned to their respective references, which could also lead to incorrect age estimates. However, all TE insertions which were used for the neutrality test were relatively old, with age estimates ranging from circa 240,000 to 6,800,000&#x02009;years. This was expected since we only used TE insertions which were present in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic>, therefore, we expect the last common ancestor of these two species to have harbored these insertions. We argue that determining the age of the TE insertions found in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> by estimating their age in <italic>C. rubella</italic> yielded, despite some alignment issues, reliable results for these particular TEs. Additionally, because we excluded all insertions found in <italic>C. rubella</italic> but absent in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, we probably failed to include some TE insertions which were completely removed by selection from the <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population. However, we decided not to include these insertions in our analyses because we could not distinguish between insertions which are effectively absent in the <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> population and insertions that we failed to detect. As higher quality <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> assemblies based on long-read technology become available, permitting detailed analyses of a broader range of TEs (as in, e.g., <xref rid="evx206-B17" ref-type="bibr">Jiao et al. 2017</xref>), it will be important to revisit these results and assess how generally they apply to other TE families.</p><p>In this study, we first showed that in centromeric and pericentromeric regions, TE silencing is not affecting purifying selection against TEs. Second, silenced TEs are under significantly stronger purifying selection than other TEs in the chromosome arms, and silenced TEs close to genes are under significantly stronger purifying selection than those further away from genes, and are also on an average found farther away from genes than TEs that are not silenced. Previously, <xref rid="evx206-B46" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. (2017)</xref> showed that the presence/absence of TEs in the proximity of genes was associated with <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory gene expression variation in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> and silenced TEs were associated with lower allele-specific gene expression in <italic>Capsella</italic> F1 hybrids (<xref rid="evx206-B47" ref-type="bibr">Steige et al. 2015</xref>). Based on these results and our findings, we conclude that gene expression variation caused by silenced TEs results in decreased fitness leading to stronger purifying selection against silenced TEs near genes. These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary process governing TE accumulation in outcrossing plants and suggest that increased selection against silenced TEs in chromosome arms results from a tradeoff between reduced TE activity and nearby gene expression silencing, as hypothesized by <xref rid="evx206-B15" ref-type="bibr">Hollister and Gaut (2009)</xref>. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
