The primary epithelial cells are expanded as 3D organoids, dissociated, and cultured on a porous membrane within a microfluidic device with human intestinal microvascular endothelium cultured in a parallel microchannel under flow and cyclic deformation. In the Intestine Chip, the epithelium forms villi-like projections lined by polarized epithelial cells that undergo multi-lineage differentiation similar to that of intestinal organoids, however, these cells expose their apical surfaces to an open lumen and interface with endothelium. Transcriptomic analysis also indicates that the Intestine Chip more closely mimics whole human duodenum <italic>in vivo</italic> when compared to the duodenal organoids used to create the chips. Because fluids flowing through the lumen of the Intestine Chip can be collected continuously, sequential analysis of fluid samples can be used to quantify nutrient digestion, mucus secretion and establishment of intestinal barrier function over a period of multiple days <italic>in vitro</italic>. The Intestine Chip therefore may be useful as a research tool for applications where normal intestinal function is crucial, including studies of metabolism, nutrition, infection, and drug pharmacokinetics, as well as personalized medicine.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The small intestine is the major site for digestion, drug and nutrient absorption, interaction with commensal microbiome, and development of mucosal immunity, as well as a primary site for many diseases, such as bacterial, viral and parasitic infections and inflammatory bowel disease. Because the lack of human-relevant responses has rendered many animal models unsuitable to study causal factors and treatment strategies for human intestinal infections and disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, three-dimensional (3D) human tissue surrogates, such as intestinal organoids (also known as enteroids) have emerged as promising alternatives. These spheroidal <italic>ex vivo</italic> tissue cultures include Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and are grown embedded within a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) gel (Matrigel) with Wnt3a, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Noggin and R-spondin 1 (collectively, WENR) to support their indefinite propagation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Organoids faithfully recapitulate the cellular diversity of the intestinal epithelium and are ideally suited for <italic>in situ</italic> visualization and continuous monitoring of epithelial development and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the presence of an enclosed lumen is non-physiological, as secreted material from goblet, enteroendocrine and Paneth cells, as well as shed apoptotic cells, accumulate within this central space instead of being removed through peristalsis and luminal flow. In addition, the inaccessibility of apical cell surface renders the use of organoids experimentally challenging for transport studies as well as exposure to living commensal microbiome or pathogenic bacteria for more than approximately one day in culture. Finally, organoid cultures lack a tissue-tissue interface, mechanical forces (fluid flow and peristalsis-like motions), immune cells, and a vascular compartment, which are all key contributors to normal intestinal physiology and disease development. Thus, there still remains a compelling need for more complex and physiologically relevant intestinal organ culture systems.</p><p id="Par3">One alternative approach involves the use of 2-channel Organs-on-Chips (Organ Chips), which are microfluidic cell culture devices that contain two parallel hollow culture chambers lined by living human cells and separated by a porous ECM-coated membrane. These chips recapitulate normal tissue-tissue interfaces and mimic the complex physical and biochemical microenvironment of living human organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This technology has been previously applied to develop human Gut Chips that emulate many features of human intestinal structure and function, however, these studies utilized established human intestinal cell lines, such as Caco-2 or HT-29 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which were originally isolated from tumor samples and they harbor multiple gene mutations. In these studies, the intestinal cells also were either cultured alone or in the presence of a non-specialized endothelium (e.g., human umbilical vein endothelial cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, these human Gut Chips may not fully recapitulate normal human intestinal functions, and they would be inappropriate to use to study human conditions where genome fidelity is important (e.g., intestinal cancer, drug development, etc.). Other investigators have engineered <italic>in vitro</italic> intestine models using fetal intestinal tissue explants, but these progressively deteriorate after 24&#x02009;h of culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, in the present study, we set out to develop a primary human Small Intestine Chip (Intestine Chip) using an approach that combines two of the most advanced tissue engineering technologies: intestinal organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and Organ Chips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The Intestine Chip contains normal human intestinal epithelial cells derived from organoids established from endoscopic biopsies or tissue resections of living human intestine, and intestinal tissue-specific microvascular endothelial cells. This microengineered environment recapitulates many key anatomical and functional features of its <italic>in vivo</italic> small intestine counterpart including 3D intestinal villi-like structures, multi-lineage differentiation, epithelial barrier function, enzymatic activity of brush border enzyme and mucus production. Importantly, the transcriptome of the primary Intestine Chip more closely resembles that of adult human duodenum <italic>in vivo</italic> than the organoids that were used to plate the chips or other currently available intestinal cell culture models, including our previous Caco-2 Gut Chip, especially with regard to expression of genes relating to digestion, response to nutrients, cell proliferation, and host defense response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary human Intestine Chip developed using biopsy-derived organoids</title><p id="Par5">We set out to create an Organ Chip-based surrogate of the human small intestine that incorporates biopsy-derived epithelium, intestinal endothelial cells, physiological fluid flow and peristalsis-like mechanical motions that would allow analysis of human intestinal physiology and pathophysiology in a more <italic>in vivo</italic>-relevant culture microenvironment. To accomplish this, we first established organoid cultures using intestinal crypts derived from macroscopically normal regions of human intestinal endoscopic biopsies. Once the organoids matured (after 5 to 25 passages in culture), we then released organoid fragments through enzymatic treatment and finally seeded these fragments on the upper surface of the ECM-coated porous membrane of a microfluidic Organ Chip (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip devices we used contain two parallel, cell culture microchannels: an upper &#x02018;epithelial&#x02019; channel (1&#x02009;mm high&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;mm wide) and a lower &#x02018;vascular&#x02019; channel (0.2&#x02009;mm high x 1&#x02009;mm wide) separated by a thin (50&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) flexible PDMS membrane containing multiple pores (7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m diameter, 40&#x02009;&#x003bc;m spacing) coated with ECM (type I collagen and Matrigel) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Each microchannel has a dedicated inlet and outlet for the inoculation of human cells, molecules or microbes as well as for the precise control of physicochemical parameters through the perfusion of laminar flow of appropriate culture medium. Dedicated outlets provide means to collect effluents from the individual chambers for downstream characterization. The upper epithelial channel and lower vascular channel are surrounded on either side by two hollow (1&#x02009;mm high&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;300&#x02009;&#x000b5;m wide) chambers that permit application of cyclic suction to mechanically stretch and relax the sidewalls, as well as the attached flexible PDMS membrane and adherent tissues in the central channel, thereby emulating peristaltic motions of a living human small intestine.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fabrication of the primary human Intestine Chip.

The membrane is elastic and can be extended and retracted by the application of cyclic vacuum to the hollow side chambers. This actuation causes outward deflection of the vertical side walls and lateral extension of the attached horizontal, porous elastic membrane, which induces mechanical deformation of the adherent tissue layers cultured in the central channels.

Duodenal organoids cultured for 3&#x02013;5 days after passaging in expansion medium (EM) were dissociated into fragments and plated in the epithelial channel of the microfluidic devices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Organoids from the duodenal region of the small intestine were used in this study because they display higher culture efficiency than those formed from ileum or jejunum, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We first cultured the organoid fragment-derived intestinal epithelial cells alone (without endothelium) in the upper channel, while perfusing both channels with epithelial expansion medium (EM). The large majority of cells initially appeared spread individually across the surface of the porous membrane at the start of the experiment and progressively grew to form a continuous epithelium that underwent villus morphogenesis over 8&#x02013;12 days (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). This resulted in formation of a well-developed intestinal epithelium with a high density of finger-shaped, villus-like protrusions (~30/cm<sup>2</sup>) along the entire length of the upper channel by 12 days of culture, as detected by phase contrast (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>), differential interference contrast (DIC) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and 3D confocal microscopy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of the intestinal epithelium for Ki67 and mucin 5AC (Muc5AC) confirmed the presence of proliferative Ki67-positive cells, which were limited to basal regions of the villi-like structures in close proximity to the PDMS membrane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), whereas mucin-producing cells were present primarily along the apical regions of the villi-like structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), as is observed in living intestine. Computerized image analysis revealed that these villus-like structures were significantly more elongated than the more spherical organoids from which they were derived, with the villi-like structures exhibiting average major and minor axes of 232&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17 and 122&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM) compared to 256&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13 and 220&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11&#x02009;&#x003bc;m for the organoids. In the course of these studies, we also found that more effective epithelial cell seeding and efficient monolayer formation can be achieved if organoid fragments are used, as single cell suspensions (produced using longer enzymatic dissociation times) do not expand as efficiently to develop a functional intestinal epithelial barrier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and whole organoids remain in their cystic spherical form and thus, never form a continuous monolayer (data not shown).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Morphological analysis of Organ Chips lined by primary duodenal organoid-derived epithelial cells in the absence of endothelial cells.

The presence of HIMECs also did not compromise barrier function and possibly enhanced it to a slight degree: with or without HIMEC, the P<sub>app</sub> was sustained at 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> cm s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for up to 12 days of culture (with 8 days of perfusion of EM, followed by 4 days of differentiation (DM) through the upper channel, while EGM2-MV was flowed through the lower channel) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). After that time, we detected cells that were shed and removed by the fluid flow, as expected from the fast turnover of human intestinal epithelium in which mature enterocytes are shed from the gut lining every 3&#x02013;5 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The presence of HIMECs in the lower channel also appeared increase the efficiency of monolayer formation when organoids were fully dissociated into single cells prior to culturing them in the microchannel, and formation of putative villi-like structures was also observed in some of these cultures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, the reproducibility of seeding protocol was much higher using organoid fragments versus isolated cells (~90% versus 40% success rate), and thus, we used the fragment method in all subsequent experiments.</p><p id="Par9">Once confluent epithelial and endothelial monolayers were formed in the presence of physiological fluid flow (60&#x02009;&#x000b5;l&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the Intestine Chip was exposed to peristalsis-like motions (10% strain, 0.2&#x02009;Hz) generated by applying cyclic suction to the flexible hollow side chambers. Use of these dynamic co-culture conditions, in combination with a shift from use of the EM to a DM in the upper channel on day 8, led to formation of well-defined intestinal folds throughout the entire length of the epithelial channel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,c,d</xref>). Interestingly, culture of these same cells in the absence of flow did not result in changes of epithelial tissue architecture despite continued application of 10% cyclic strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies using Caco-2 intestinal cells in a Gut Chip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Importantly, phase contrast and confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis of this dynamic tissue-tissue interface confirmed the presence of a continuous, polarized, epithelial cell monolayer with an apical F-actin-containing brush border and basal nuclei aligned along the boundary of each villus-like extension into the lumen of the epithelial microchannel of the chip (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

The Intestine Chip recapitulates important structural features and functions of the native duodenum, including formation of elongated villi-like structures lined by a polarized epithelium expressing markers of enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells and Paneth cells, as well as basal proliferative cells, strong barrier function, brush border digestive enzyme activity, and continuous accessibility to fluids flowing through the apical lumen. This Organ Chip technology differs substantially from past <italic>in vitro</italic> microfluidic models of human intestine, including a microfluidic human Gut Chip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, as it incorporates the use of primary intestinal epithelium isolated from individual patient biopsy-derived organoids as well as gut-specific microvascular endothelial cells; it also support formation of villus-like structures without requiring use of a micropatterned villus-shaped scaffold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Importantly, the villi-like projections formed in the Intestine Chip do not exhibit the strict villus/crypt compartmentalization present in native human intestine; however, further improvement could be induced through application of chemical gradients of growth factors (e.g., Wnt-3A, R-spondin and noggin) to the basal-luminal axis or by incorporation of pericryptal mesenchymal cells that secrete factors which are essential for maintenance of intestinal stem cells (e.g., Wnt2b, R-spondin1, and Gremlin1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The mechanism by which these villi-like structures form under flow conditions remains unclear; however, recent findings with the human Gut Chip lined by Caco2 cells suggests that intestinal epithelial cells can establish their own a transepithelial gradient of a Wnt antagonist when cultured under flow, which contributes to this response (Kim <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data).</p><p id="Par16">The vascularized Organ Chip design we utilized enables application of physiologically relevant mechanical cues, including luminal fluid flow within both the epithelial and vascular channels that is critical for formation of villus-like structures, as well as peristalsis-like cyclic deformations, in addition to providing precise independent control over the chemical composition of culture medium in each channel. The ability to collect effluents of the two separate channels independently also enables dynamic sampling and analysis of biochemical compounds that are produced or secreted by the intestinal epithelial cells or endothelial cells, such as inflammatory cytokines or metabolic products, which is not possible with conventional organoid cultures. Additionally,&#x000a0;intestinal epithelial cells&#x000a0;grown within Organ Chips could be exposed from the apical side to pathogens, or co-cultured with commensal microbes to model enteric infection or&#x000a0;the natural microbiome, as previously demonstrated with the Caco-2 Gut Chip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The presence of the endothelium-lined microchannel (which is absent in organoid cultures) also can enable analysis of absorption of nutrients or oral drug absorption and their bioavailability, as well as characterization of physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic parameters because they are significantly influenced by the passage of drug compounds back and forth across the endothelial-parenchymal tissue-tissue interface. In addition, the presence of the endothelium permits analysis of the contributions of circulating immune cells that may be recruited under physiological flow conditions within microfluidic Organ Chips, as demonstrated in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Most importantly, our head-to-head transcriptomic comparison of the Intestine Chip organoids used to supply the cells for the chips revealed that the Intestine Chip more closely mimics living duodenum, and that it better recapitulates many key functions of the living small intestine, including host defense response to infection, cell proliferation, digestion, and response to nutrients, than do the duodenal organoids. Thus, these findings suggest that while organoids may be an outstanding tool to study and probe intestinal stem cell differentiation and histogenesis, they are limited in comparison to the Organ Chip technology when it comes to studying organ-level functions and pathophysiology, particularly in relation to mechanobiology, immunology, infectious disease and drug development.</p><p id="Par17">This primary human Intestine Chip can be adapted for a wide range of applications, including basic research studies on the intestinal development, stem cell maturation and intestinal epithelial cell differentiation; assessment of nutrient transport, sensing, and absorption; intestinal barrier function and tissue-tissue (e.g., epithelial-endothelial) interactions; evaluation of drug delivery; therapeutic efficacy or toxicity; characterization of host-pathogen responses at the mucosal interface; and regenerative medicine studies. In addition, the ability to create Chips from individual donors as demonstrated in this study opens the possibility of creating Intestine Chips lined by cells from individuals with specific genotypic and disease-related phenotypic characteristics. These chips could be used to investigate patient-specific disease mechanisms as well as response to therapies, and thereby help to advance personalized medicine in the future. A recent report suggests that this approach also may be extended to be used with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids, which could further enhance personalized medicine approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Although future directions include integrating the remaining important components of the living intestine into the Chip, including intestinal fibroblasts, immune cells (e.g., macrophages, intraepithelial lymphocytes and dendritic cells) and the enteric nervous system, previous studies have demonstrated that the power of the Organ Chip technology approach specifically lies in its ability to mimic organ-level complexity by progressively integrating different cell types one-at-a-time and studying the system at varying levels of system complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, this organ-level synthetic biology approach permits one to gain insight into mechanisms of biological regulation by manipulating potential contributing physical factors (e.g., flow, peristalsis) and cellular components separately while simultaneously providing a window on molecular-scale biochemical, genetic and cellular responses in real-time. The microengineered nature of this technology also allows users to reconstitute and control molecular gradients (e.g., Wnt, growth factors, etc.), which play a key role in intestinal development and regeneration.
