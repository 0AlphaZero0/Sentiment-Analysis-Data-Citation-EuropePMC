However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients&#x02019; treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data (RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation) weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model. The CoGAPS unsupervised algorithm was used to determine the dynamics of the molecular changes associated with resistance during the time course of resistance development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">CoGAPS was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Genes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize&#x000a0;the resistant phenotype. These genes include <italic>FGFR1</italic>, which was associated with EGFR inhibitors resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. This understanding of the time course progression of molecular changes in acquired resistance is important for the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce appropriate selection of new drugs to treat cancer before the resistant phenotype develops.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13073-018-0545-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acquired resistance</kwd><kwd>Precision medicine</kwd><kwd>Data integration</kwd><kwd>Time course analysis</kwd><kwd>Genomics</kwd><kwd>Epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA177669</award-id><award-id>R21DE025398</award-id><award-id>P30CA006973</award-id><award-id>R01DE017982</award-id><award-id>P50DE019032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaykalova</surname><given-names>Daria A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Christine H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fertig</surname><given-names>Elana J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par33">Recent advances to identification of gene regulation in cancer have enabled the selection of targeted therapies to inhibit specific regulators of oncogenic signaling pathways essential for tumor development and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These therapies prolong survival but are not curative, since most patients develop acquired resistance within the first few years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although a wide variety of molecular alterations that confer resistance to the treatment have been described, the mechanisms and timing of their evolution are still poorly characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As serial biopsies along the treatment period are impractical due to the invasiveness and high costs of the procedure, the molecular alterations associated with acquired resistance are only known when resistance has already developed and little is known about what changes occur at earlier or later time points during the targeted therapy. The lack of adequate in vitro and in vivo time course datasets makes it challenging to delineate the two predominant hypotheses for how therapeutic resistance develops: (1) the presence of small populations of resistant cells that will survive the treatment and repopulate the tumor; or (2) the development of de novo resistance mechanisms by the tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Characterization of the dynamics of genomic alterations induced during acquired resistance can identify targetable oncogenic drivers and determine the best time point to introduce alternative therapeutic strategies to avoid resistance establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors represent a common class of targeted therapeutics. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As with other targeted therapies, stable response is not observed for a long period and virtually all patients invariably develop acquired resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recent advances in the establishment of in vitro models of acquired cetuximab resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] provide a unique opportunity to study the time course of genetic events resulting in acquired resistance. Cell lines chronically exposed to the targeted agent develop resistance and can be sequentially collected during the course of treatment to evaluate the progressive molecular changes. Previous studies to assess the mechanisms of acquired cetuximab resistance have been limited to comparing the genomic profile of the parental intrinsic sensitive cell line to stable clones with acquired resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, these studies fail to capture the dynamics of acquired molecular alterations during the evolution of therapeutic resistance. The development of in vitro time course data to determine the molecular drivers of therapeutic resistance is crucial. These experimental systems have the further advantage that time course data can also be generated for untreated controls, enabling the distinction of the molecular mechanisms associated with acquired resistance from those that would occur due to the long-term culturing over the time period that resistance develops.</p><p id="Par35">Along with novel time course datasets, inferring the specific and targetable signaling changes that drive therapeutic resistance also requires new bioinformatics pipelines to analyze and visualize these data. The bioinformatics pipelines must integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes from multiple-high throughput platforms to infer the complex gene regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for acquired resistance. Current supervised bioinformatics algorithms that find time course patterns in genomic data adjust linear models to correlate molecular profiles with known temporal patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Many unknown variables such as culture conditions, immediate response to cetuximab, and adaptive changes may have confounding effects on known covariates of therapeutic response such as growth rates, colony size, or apoptosis rates. Unsupervised bioinformatics algorithms learn the dynamics directly from the high-throughput data, and therefore do not require a priori knowledge of the complex dynamics associated with therapeutic response. Some unsupervised algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] seek breaking points of coherent, regulatory relationships to infer the dynamics along pathways. Many of these algorithms trace individual phenotypes or individual genomics platforms. Their ability to determine drivers of gene expression associated with acquired resistance from time course data in multiple experimental conditions and multiple genomics data modalities is emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Further extensions are needed to contrast the dynamics of signaling response to therapy to the dynamics of control conditions to distinguish the specific molecular processes that are unique to resistance. Matrix factorization algorithms are unsupervised and can distinguish the relative molecular changes in each experimental condition over time without requiring prior knowledge of gene regulation. We have found that Bayesian, non-negative matrix factorization algorithms such as Coordinate Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] can extend beyond clustering to robustly quantify the dynamics and infer the gene regulatory networks directly from the input time course data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The CoGAPS error model can also be modified to enable data-driven inference in distinct molecular platforms for inference of epigenetic regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In this study, we developed a new bioinformatics analysis pipeline for integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation changes that occur during the time course progression of resistance to targeted therapies using CoGAPS. Genes uniquely associated with these changes were selected using a PatternMarker statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to enable novel visualization of molecular alterations dynamics inferred with CoGAPS. In order to benchmark our new bioinformatics pipeline, we used an in vitro HNSCC cell line model to induce resistance and measure the molecular changes using high-throughput assays while the resistant phenotype developed. Gene expression and DNA methylation changes were screened weekly while acquired cetuximab resistance was induced in SCC25 cell line (intrinsic sensitive to cetuximab) and compared to the status of the untreated controls at the same culturing time point. CoGAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] inferred specific patterns of expression and DNA methylation that are associated with the gradual establishment of acquired cetuximab resistance. The onset of methylation changes associated with resistance is temporally delayed relative to expression changes suggesting that epigenetic alterations stabilize the transcriptional changes relevant to the resistant phenotype. This analysis found anti-correlated changes between DNA methylation and gene expression in <italic>FGFR1</italic> during acquired therapeutic resistance. Upregulation of <italic>FGFR1</italic> has previously been associated as a mechanism of acquired cetuximab resistance in HNSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The identification of a canonical marker of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in this present study corroborates the efficacy of our experimental model and analytical algorithm to identify mechanisms of resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the anti-correlation between <italic>FGFR1</italic> methylation and expression suggestive of its epigenetic regulation in acquired resistance to cetuximab. Thus, this pipeline can identify mechanisms of gene regulation in acquired resistance from high-throughput, multi-platform time course data. The resulting bioinformatics pipeline is poised to infer the dynamics of acquired resistance from emerging time course data with other cancer types and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines and materials</title><p id="Par37">SCC25 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Finally, 12 &#x003bc;L of each sample were hybridized to the array chip followed by primer-extension and staining steps. Chips were image-processed in the Illumina iScan system.

CoGAPS decomposes the input data into two matrices: a pattern matrix with relative sample weights along rows and an amplitude matrix with relative gene weights along columns. Each row of the pattern matrix quantifies the extent of transcriptional changes within the genes in the corresponding column of the amplitude matrix and provides a low dimensional representation of the biological process in that data.

The PatternMarker statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] enable further selection of the genes that are uniquely associated with each pattern. Creating a heatmap of the genomics profiles for these genes enabled novel, heatmap-based visualization of the temporal dynamics in the omics data. CoGAPS analysis of gene expression data contains a flat pattern (EP5), which includes all highly expressed genes. These genes may also change in association with the experimental conditions, albeit to a lesser degree than lowly expressed genes. Because the PatternMarker statistics includes genes that are uniquely associated with each inferred biological process, these highly expressed genes would be filtered from associations with the dynamic conditions. To include these genes in the signatures defined in this study, EP5 was filtered from the calculation of the PatternMarker statistic. Such filtering process is not required for heatmap-based visualization and filtering of flat patterns is recommend when defining gene signatures containing sets of genes that are most strongly associated with dynamic changes. Patterns that reflect technical artifacts in the data, such as EP4, should be retained in the PatternMarker analysis to limit the signatures associated with inferred processes to retain only biologically relevant genes. We note that these PatternMarker statistic are similar to the D-scores proposed in Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and that application of this statistic may require similar filtering to retain highly expressed genes. In the case of DNA methylation, these PatternMarker genes also include genes representing driver alterations in resistance. The DNA methylation data did not require filtering when applying the PatternMarker statistic since no flat pattern was detected. However, transcriptional regulation by epigenetic alterations or in pathways involves simultaneous co-regulation of multiple genes. This co-regulation is reflected in the reuse of genes in CoGAPS gene weights associated with each pattern. Therefore, estimates of pathway dynamics from transcriptional data require accounting for all genes with gene set enrichment statistics instead of the PatternMarker statistic. Thus, we hypothesize that the PatternMarker statistic is robust for visualization and biomarker identification. On the other hand, gene set enrichment of the CoGAPS gene weights corresponding to each pattern and stored in the amplitude matrix are essential for characterization of functional alterations in pathways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Integrated genomics analysis of time course data demonstrates that DNA methylation changes follow transcriptional changes, leading to the model where methylation stabilizes the resistance phenotype</title><p id="Par80">Collecting treated and untreated cells to obtain paired measurements of methylation and gene expression enabled us to evaluate whether changes in DNA methylation impact gene expression. Including a PBS control at every time point also enabled the discrimination of the changes that result from an adaptive response to therapy from changes that result from maintaining cells in culture. CoGAPS analysis of DNA methylation data denotes only changes associated with acquired resistance, in contrast to the immediate expression changes observed with cetuximab treatment. Thus, while therapeutic response can drive massive changes in gene expression, only the subset of expression changes associated with the development of resistance have corresponding epigenetic signatures, suggesting that the methylation landscape is important for the development of acquired resistance. The CoGAPS patterns in gene expression that are associated with acquired cetuximab resistance gradually change over the time course (EP1 and EP2). On the other hand, the CoGAPS patterns for DNA methylation changes have a sharp transition at the generation at which resistance is acquired (CTX-G4). These patterns (MP2 and MP3) reflect a delayed but more rapid change in DNA methylation. The time delays between alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression pose a further computational challenge for integrated, time course genomics analyses. The vast majority of integrated analysis algorithms assume one-to-one mapping of genes in different data platforms or seek common patterns or latent variables across them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Such approaches would fail to capture the early changes from cetuximab treatment that impact only gene expression; time delays between DNA methylation and gene expression patterns and different gene usage in each pattern. It is essential to develop new integrated algorithms to simultaneously distinguish both patterns that are shared across data types and that are unique to each platform. For time course data analysis, these algorithms must also model regulatory relationships that may give rise to timing delays, such as epigenetic silencing of gene expression. However, as we observed with the unanticipated changes in DNA methylation following and not preceding gene expression, they must also consider delays resulting from larger phenotypic changes such as the stability of the therapeutic resistant phenotype.</p><p id="Par81">The relative timing of change in DNA methylation and gene expression is consistent with previous observations that gene expression changes precede DNA methylation alterations in genes critical for cancer progression. <italic>P16</italic><sup><italic>INK4A</italic></sup> and <italic>GSTP1</italic> are tumor suppressor genes for which transcription silencing was found to occur prior to DNA hypermethylation and chromatin changes. The temporal delay observed between expression and methylation patterns in our time course provides transcriptome-wide evidence of this phenomenon. Specifically, that epigenetic changes are necessary to stabilize gene expression aberrant profile and will be followed by modification into a silenced methylation state, resulting in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Our integrated RNA-seq and DNA methylation analysis corroborates the fact that gene expression changes occur earlier to epigenetic alterations and suggests that DNA methylation is essential to maintain the changes in gene expression in this acquired cetuximab resistance model. Additional time course data tracing other in vitro and in vivo models of HNSCC are essential to generalize the relative timing of molecular changes, and thus mechanisms of gene regulation, associated with acquired therapeutic resistance. Future investigation into the chromatin remodeling mechanisms will also test whether chromatin alterations follow the changes in expression and occur in combination with altered methylation patterns to drive epigenetic regulation of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Time course data are essential to distinguish clonal outgrowth from transcriptional rewiring that give rise to stable acquired resistance to therapy</title><p id="Par82">Besides the immediate changes in gene expression followed by the gradual methylation switch, it is also interesting to note these effects in the proliferation rates during the 11&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. Initially, the proliferation of the population of cetuximab-sensitive cells is slower when compared to the untreated controls, reflecting therapy effectiveness. Early and progressively, the cells develop molecular changes to overcome the EGFR blockade. However, this process starts in just a small number of clones and the increase in proliferation is still not enough to surpass the growth rate of the untreated cells. As soon as the population of resistant cells is larger than the number of sensitive cells, the proliferation rate is now higher than in the untreated controls. At some point, we observe the stabilization of the proliferation rates in the cetuximab-treated cells, probably due to the fact the culture is now dominated by the population of resistant clones. Although stable, the proliferation rate of these resistant clones is significantly higher than that of the untreated cells. This increased proliferation rate is consistent with the rapid increase in tumor volume observed clinically once patients develop resistance to therapy. Tracing the increase in the population of resistant cells and their proliferation rates in vivo requires novel techniques to biopsy or image tumors at intermediate time points of treatment.</p><p id="Par83">In a recent study, gene expression changes were associated with a transient resistant phenotype present in melanoma cell lines before vemurafenib administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Once the melanoma cells were exposed to the drug, additional changes in gene expression are detected and are later accompanied by changes in chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These findings, together with our time course observations, suggest that in the heterogeneous tumor environment the existence of some cells expressing specific marker genes can trigger cellular reprogramming as soon as the targeted therapy is initiated. Upon drug administration, the number of genes with aberrant expression increases and is followed by other epigenetic and genetic changes that will shift the transient resistant state into a stable phenotype. This finding on acquired resistance development could dramatically change the course of treatment with targeted therapeutic agents. The precise characterization of resistant gene signatures and their timing are crucial to determine the correct point during the patients&#x02019; clinical evolution to introduce alternative therapeutic strategies. This way, secondary interventions would start before the stable resistant phenotype is spread among the tumor cells resulting in prolonged disease control and substantial increase in overall survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>DNA methylation changes in <italic>FGFR1</italic> are associated with changes in FGFR signaling</title><p id="Par84">Among the genes we identified with the canonical relationship between expression and methylation, <italic>FGFR1</italic> present with increased gene expression accompanied by loss of CpG methylation. FGFR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates downstream pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, and RAS/MAPK, which are also regulated by EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Its overexpression has been previously associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in other cancer types including HNSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To our knowledge this is the first study showing that epigenetic alterations are associated with changes in <italic>FGFR1</italic> expression in HNSCC during the development acquired cetuximab resistance. <italic>FGFR1</italic> upregulation combined with promoter hypomethylation was previously described in rhabdomyosarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Other studies described that <italic>FGFR1</italic> increased levels is a common feature in different tumor types, such as glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and cancers of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], colorectal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and HNSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. <italic>FGFR1</italic> is involved in resistance mechanisms against EGFR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], such as cetuximab and gefitinib. Together, the TCGA and Bossi et al. dataset analyses corroborate our findings that <italic>FGFR1</italic> gene expression is regulated by epigenetic changes in HNSCC. Altogether, the epigenetic alteration of <italic>FGFR1</italic> represents a candidate biomarker of resistance to cetuximab and further studies are critical to identify combination therapies for HNSCC patients that develop acquired cetuximab resistance.</p><p id="Par85">The increased levels of FGFRs and FGFs are believed to play a role in an autocrine mechanism in HNSCC and NSCLC cell lines with intrinsic resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib. Using publicly available gene expression microarray datasets, Marshall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and Marek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] verified concomitant increased levels of FGFRs and their specific FGFs ligands. Particularly, <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> upregulation was observed in the same resistant cell lines and hypothesized to be the mechanism behind resistance. This was corroborated by functional experiments showing that cells treated with pan-FGFR inhibitor were less prone to anchorage-independent growth. Also, <italic>FGF2</italic> silencing or <italic>FGFR</italic>1 inhibition resulted in phospho-ERK decreased expression that was restored when FGF2 was added to the culture, suggesting that an autocrine FGF-FGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms of resistance to gefitinib. However, the cell lines evaluated in both studies were intrinsically resistant to gefitinib. In our model, we induced resistance to cetuximab and observed <italic>FGFR1</italic> gain of expression and significant anti-correlation with the DNA methylation. We additionally evaluated the expression of other FGFRs and FGFs that were identified by the PatternMarker statistic. Although it is not found as a PatternMarker in our analysis pipeline, <italic>FGF2</italic> is upregulated in the cetuximab generations when compared to the PBS generations as observed with <italic>FGFR1</italic> (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S14). Thus, our data corroborates and extends this previous evidence from intrinsically resistant lines that one of the mechanisms driving resistance to EGFR inhibition is the FGF-FGFR autocrine pathway. This observation adds another evidence that the computational approach used in this study is robust once it is capable of identifying mechanisms previously described in other models resistant to EGFR blockade.</p><p id="Par86">Our previously developed bioinformatics algorithms for the identification of gene expression and epigenetic patterns progression over time proved to be consistent, since they also detected canonical changes found to be driving this mechanism among innumerous new potential candidates for acquired resistance. The integrated computational analysis was possible due to an experimental approach developed to account for molecular changes due to adaptive responses to the culturing system and the immediate addition of cetuximab. Here, we present a novel integrated analysis protocol to evaluate molecular changes measured by different high throughput techniques over a prolonged time of treatment with an FDA-approved targeted therapeutic agent. The lack of in vivo experimentation to validate our findings was compensated by the analysis of two public datasets of HNSCC, showing that our in vitro findings were also present in patients&#x02019; samples. Our findings, together with Marshall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and Marek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], are a strong evidence that FGFR1 plays a crucial role in a significant proportion of cases that are resistant to cetuximab or gefitinib. The translational implications are notable since FGFR1 inhibition can be used in combination with EGFR blockade to retard acquired resistance or overcome intrinsic resistance. It is important to mention that FGFR inhibitors are being currently evaluated by clinical trials and could soon become a potential new therapeutic option for many cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Future work evaluating how these combinations impact the timing of acquired resistance are essential to determine the molecular mechanisms that shift dominant signaling pathways in cancer and thereby drive resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>CoGAPS gene signatures from the SCC25 time course model are associated with molecular changes in additional in vitro models and human tumor data</title><p id="Par87">The main limitation of the current study was the use of a single cell line model. SCC25 is intrinsically sensitive to cetuximab and from this single cell line model, we generated two groups of samples (CTX and PBS generations) over the course of 11&#x000a0;weeks. High-throughput measurements and analysis were performed for a total of 22 samples. The collection of multiple data points in the analysis had to be accounted for when determining the number of cell lines to be included in the study. We nonetheless compared our data to gene signatures from the other isogenic HNSCC resistant model 1CC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], an independent resistant model to an EGFR inhibitor in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and human tumor data from HNSCC patients before cetuximab treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Besides the number of samples, we also had to take into consideration the potential batch and technical effects of broad cross-platform profiling. Nevertheless, the analysis of pretreatment HNSCC patient samples from TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] confirmed that our finding that <italic>FGFR1</italic> is upregulated and demethylated in HNSCC and associated with acquired resistance to cetuximab is also a mechanism involved in intrinsic resistance to the targeted therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Transcriptional heterogeneity is critical in acquired therapeutic resistance, and future time course single cell data will pinpoint precise molecular predictors of therapeutic resistance</title><p id="Par88">The in vitro protocol for time course sampling developed in this study has the additional advantage of aggregating potentially heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance increasing the signal of changes in any cetuximab-resistant sub-clone. For example, we observed demethylation and overexpression of <italic>FGFR1</italic> in the pooled cells, but only a single stable clone generated from the same SCC25 cell line in a previous study (CTXR10) had upregulation of <italic>FGFR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This finding suggests that tumor heterogeneity also plays a role in acquired resistance to targeted therapies and enables different pathways to be used to bypass the silenced target within the same tumor. Heterogeneity of SCC25 cetuximab-resistant clones has been observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Recent single cell RNA-seq data of SCC25 has shown that there is considerable transcriptional heterogeneity in this cell line before treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Other cancer therapies are influenced by heterogeneity and outgrowth of resistant clones, as was observed in single cell clones isolated from the HNSCC cell line FaDu when treated with cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. These data and the intrinsic sensitivity of SCC25 to EGFR inhibition suggests that therapeutic resistance results from random selection of a pre-existing resistant clone. The heterogeneity in methylation profiles reflected the complexity of the resistance mechanisms that can arise from combination therapies in heterogeneous tumors. Future work extending these protocols to in vivo models is essential to determine the role of the microenvironment in inducing therapeutic resistance. Developing in vivo models with acquired therapeutic resistance presents numerous technical challenges that must first be addressed before such time course sampling is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pinpointing precise molecular predictors of therapeutic resistance will facilitate the identification of unprecedented biomarkers and reveal the mechanisms by which to overcome acquired therapeutic resistance to most therapies used to treat cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par89">By developing a novel bioinformatics pipeline for integrated time course analysis, we measured the changes in gene expression and DNA methylation during the progression from an intrinsic cetuximab responsive state to the acquired resistant phenotype using an in vitro HNSCC cell line model. Specifically, this pipeline includes: (1) CoGAPS analysis of each platform independently; (2) gene selection with the PatternMarker statistic for visualization and CoGAPS gene set analysis of the CoGAPS gene profiles for pathway analysis; (3) comparisons of patterns to known phenotypes infer their relative timing; (4) anti-correlation between DNA methylation patterns and gene expression to infer epigenetically regulated genes; and (5) evaluation of PatternMarker genes and projection of the CoGAPS gene profiles to learn relevance of inferred gene signatures in new datasets. This pipeline revealed massive changes in gene expression and identified and discriminated the different patterns associated with resistance or cell culturing conditions. This analysis demonstrates that compressed sensing matrix factorization algorithms can identify gene signatures associated with the dynamics of phenotypic changes from genomics data collected over the time course. In this case, the gene expression patterns relevant to resistance were later followed by epigenetic alterations. Our main conclusion is that using our bioinformatics approach we are able to determine that the resistant phenotype is driven by gene expression changes that would confer the cancer cells adaptive advantages to the treatment with cetuximab. Finally, the integrated analysis show that the stability of the resistant state is dependent on epigenetic changes that will make these new gene signatures heritable to expand the phenotype to the daughter cells. The bioinformatics pipeline we developed is also significant to clinical practice, since it pointed the time course of molecular changes associated with acquired cetuximab resistance and suggests that the resistant phenotype can be reversed if alternative interventions are introduced before epigenetic alterations to the genes driving acquired resistance. Moreover, the computational approach we describe here can be applied to time course studies using other tumor type models and targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
