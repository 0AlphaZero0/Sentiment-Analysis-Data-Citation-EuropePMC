However, the role of Dicer in cisplatin-mediated apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells is poorly understood. In the present study, Dicer was expressed at low levels in cisplatin-resistant A2780 cells when compared with parental cells. In addition, knocking down Dicer using short hairpin RNA decreased the sensitivity of A2780 and CAOV3 cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, downregulating Dicer significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, and decreased the levels of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, including P73, P63, P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings indicated that Dicer may be a promising target for overcoming drug resistance in ovarian cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dicer</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd><kwd>chemoresistance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignant gynecologic cancer (<xref rid="b1-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Numerous recent studies have revealed the importance of Dicer in cancer development, chemoresistance and progression, but its expression levels are not consistent in different types of tumors. There are tissue-specific effects associated with the aberrant expression of Dicer (<xref rid="b5-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

Our results indicate that Dicer knockdown could protect ovarian cancer cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, including P73, P63, P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanism of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.</p><p>In our study, we found a dramatic decrease in Dicer protein level 1 h after cisplatin treatment. Previous study reported that cisplatin-induced proteasome degradation cause rapid down-regulation of hCTR1 (human copper transporter 1) expression in human ovarian carcinoma cells (<xref rid="b14-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition, another research indicated that cisplatin could induce EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation in head and neck cancer (<xref rid="b15-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Whether the instant downregulation of Dicer after exposure to cisplatin is caused by cisplatin-induced protein degradation or not need to be further explored.</p><p>A previous study revealed that reduced expression levels of Dicer in ovarian cancer were associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, enhanced migration ability and increased cisplatin resistance (<xref rid="b11-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In our previous study, we found that downregulation of Dicer could promote proliferation, colony formation, and migration ability of A2780, CAOV3, and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Besides, proteomic profiling assay showed that Dicer knockdown promoted ovarian cancer progression by elevating PDIA3 expression (<xref rid="b9-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Our study further revealed that the downregulation of Dicer could increase cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells through inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis and decreasing the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9. Similarly, several recent reports have proven that decreased Dicer levels play an important role in drug resistance in different cancer types. In cervical cancer, a study showed that EZH2 inhibition could effectively increase the cisplatin sensitivity of HeLa/DDP cells by upregulating Dicer expression (<xref rid="b16-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, the knockdown of Dicer resulted in resistance to 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy and a poor prognosis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (<xref rid="b17-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, the upregulation of miR-18a decreased Dicer expression levels and conferred paclitaxel resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (<xref rid="b7-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These findings are consistent with our results. However, some studies have obtained the opposite results regarding the relationship between Dicer expression and drug resistance. In breast cancer, Bu <italic>et al</italic> reported that the suppression of Dicer could result in G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells and increase their sensitivity to cisplatin (<xref rid="b18-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It has also been reported that downregulating Dicer could increase gefitinib sensitivity in human lung cancer cells (<xref rid="b8-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These opposite results may be attributed to the complicated structure and function of Dicer.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Dicer might promote cell apoptosis through regulating apoptosis-related genes (<xref rid="b19-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is well-known that P53 superfamily proteins including P53, P63 and P73 function in mediating apoptosis in the presence of many stress stimuli, including activation of oncogenes and DNA damage (<xref rid="b21-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As is known, p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression, while which is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and over half of human cancers contain p53 mutations. Although the critical role of wild-type p53 in tumor suppression has been firmly established, mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins not only lose the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type p53 but also gain new activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild-type p53, termed gain-of-function. Mutant p53 protein often accumulates to very high levels in tumors, contributing to malignant progression (<xref rid="b21-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, caspase-9 and caspase-3 can be activated in response to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="b23-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Our findings indicate that the expression levels of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, including P73, P63, P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3, were decreased in ovarian cancer cells after Dicer knockdown. Therefore, our results indicate that Dicer might play a specific role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Besides, we found that the p21 protein expression was not affected by Dicer down-regulation in A2780 and CAOV3 cells, while it was decreased under cisplatin treatment. The cisplatin induced reduction of P21 was similar in the A2780 cells with or without Dicer depletion, but more intensive in the CAOV3 cells with Dicer depletion compared with control, which may be due to the presence of P53 mutations in CAOV3, but not in A2780 (<xref rid="b24-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that tumor-associated mutant p53 promoted cancer cell survival upon glutamine deprivation through p21 induction (<xref rid="b25-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which is consistent with our results. As is known, Dicer plays an important role in the maturation of miRNAs. Emerging evidence has indicated that low levels of some miRNAs are associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. For example, low miRNA-107 and low miRNA-204 were linked to chemo-resistance in non-small cell lung cancers and prostate cancers, respectively, because they target the mRNAs of antiapoptotic factors Bcl-w and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) (<xref rid="b26-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-mmr-18-05-4381" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These findings suggest the potential roles of microRNAs in regulating Dicer-mediated chemotherapy responses in tumor cells. However, whether the role of Dicer in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer is mediated by corresponding microRNAs needs to be further studied.</p><p>In summary, we found that low expression levels of Dicer can inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, which in turn resulted in resistance to cisplatin. However, the present study also has several limitations. First, Dicer upregulation in the cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells was not performed because of technical difficulty. Second, only one cisplatin-resistant cell line was used. Third, the mechanisms through which Dicer regulates cell apoptosis remain unclear. Given that Dicer functions as an enzyme that catalyzes miRNA maturation and that several miRNAs have been identified as regulators of cell apoptosis, multiple miRNAs might be involved in Dicer-mediated cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. Moreover, our results suggest that the upregulation of Dicer might be a promising strategy for treating recurrent, cisplatin-resistant EOC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (grant no. 2014CFB996) and the Health and Family Planning Commission of Wuhan Municipality (grant no.
