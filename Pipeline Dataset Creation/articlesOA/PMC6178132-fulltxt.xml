However, the miRNA function in shrimp antiviral response is not clearly understood. This research aims to uncover the function of pmo-miR-315, a white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-responsive miRNAs identified from <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic> hemocytes during WSSV infection. The expression of the predicted pmo-miR-315 target mRNA, a novel <italic>PmPPAE</italic> gene called <italic>PmPPAE3</italic>, was negatively correlated with that of the pmo-miR-315. Furthermore, the luciferase assay indicated that the pmo-miR-315 directly interacted with the target site in <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> suggesting the regulatory role of pmo-miR-315 on <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> gene expression. Introducing the pmo-miR-315 into the WSSV-infected shrimp caused the reduction of the <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> transcript level and, hence, the PO activity activated by the <italic>Pm</italic>PPAE3 whereas the WSSV copy number in the shrimp hemocytes was increased. Taken together, our findings state a crucial role of pmo-miR-315 in attenuating proPO activation via <italic>PPAE3</italic> gene suppression and facilitating the WSSV propagation in shrimp WSSV infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>viral infection</kwd><kwd>invertebrates</kwd><kwd><italic>Penaeus monodon</italic></kwd><kwd>prophenoloxidase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Thailand Research Fund<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004396</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">RSA5980055</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Chulalongkorn University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002873</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">CU-56-462-FW</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6519"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules transcribed from the genome and subsequently processed by Drosha and Dicer nucleases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Generally, when miRNA complementary binds to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (3&#x02032;-UTRs) of mRNAs, it can cleave the target mRNAs or inhibits the mRNA translation, thus, down-regulating the corresponding gene expression. In addition, it has been reported that the miRNAs can also bind to the 5&#x02032;-untranslated regions (5&#x02032;-UTR) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) or even within the coding sequence of mRNAs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Accordingly, miRNA's function involves the regulation of various biological processes including the host-virus interaction upon viral infection. During virus infection, viral miRNAs downregulate specific viral and cellular mRNAs to establish a host environment conducive to the completion of viral life cycle. At the same time, the host miRNAs modulate both cellular and viral transcripts exerting influence over immune responses (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In crustaceans, there are many reports showing that the host miRNAs can regulate the expression of the host and viral genes and vice versa. In 2012, the first large-scale miRNA characterization in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicas</italic> lymphoid organ has been reported (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Several cellular WSSV-responsive miRNAs play important roles in shrimp immunity including apoptosis pathway (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), phagocytosis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), NF-kB pathway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and JAK/STAT pathway (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, the WSSV miRNAs were also identified and probably could target either the host or viral genes. In the WSSV-infected <italic>M. japonicas</italic>, the viral miRNAs could target virus transcripts and further promote virus infection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the meantime, a viral miRNA, WSSV-miR-N24, could target the shrimp apoptotic gene, caspase 8, and further represses the apoptosis of shrimp hemocytes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Despite this, the study on the host miRNAs-virus relationship in shrimp is still very limited.</p><p>In <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic>, the 60 known miRNA homologs that are expressed in the hemocytes of WSSV-challenged shrimp at the early and late phases of infection have been identified (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Their immune-related gene targets in apoptosis pathway, antimicrobial peptide, prophenoloxidase system, signal transduction, proteinase and proteinase inhibitor, blood clotting system, and heat shock protein have also been predicted. Among them, the pmo-miR-315 was found to be a highly up-regulated miRNA in response to WSSV challenge and its target gene was predicted to be a novel prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme, called <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). According to the previous reports, the miR-315 was also up-regulated after WSSV infection in lymphoid organ of <italic>M. japonicas</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and hepatopancreas of <italic>F. chinensis</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the function of miR-315 in shrimp immunity against WSSV infection is still unknown. In this research, the cellular mRNA target of pmo-miR-315 was confirmed. Moreover, the role of pmo-miR-315 in WSSV-infected shrimp was investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Shrimp and WSSV</title><p>Healthy black tiger shrimp, <italic>P. monodon</italic>, of about 3&#x02013;5 and 15&#x02013;20 g in size were purchased from a farm in Surat Thani Province, Thailand.

Upon pathogen invasion, the binding of Pattern Recognition Proteins (PRPs) to the microbial cell wall components activates the serine proteinase cascade that finally activates the final proteinases, called proPO-activating enzymes (PPAEs). The PPAEs, then, cleave the inactive proPOs to active POs leading to the initiation of melanin formation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

The function of <italic>Pm</italic>PPAE3 in proPO system was confirmed using the RNA interference technique. Therefore, the <italic>Pm</italic>PPAE3 was considered as a novel clips serine proteinase that function in the proPO system.</p><p>As mentioned above, the melanization reaction is activated through the proPO cascade after pathogen infection and unavoidably generates highly toxic molecules. These toxic intermediates are not only involved in pathogen killing but also cause the damage of the host cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, the activation cascade is needed to be tightly regulated.

Furthermore, the small RNAs can also regulate the proPO system.

In our research, the role of pmo-miR-315 and <italic>Pm</italic>PPAE3 in proPO system during WSSV infection in shrimp was explored. Injection of pmo-miR-315 mimic into the shrimp resulted in a reduction of <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> gene expression and the PO activity as expected. On the other hand, inhibition of pmo-miR-315 by AMO-miR-315 increased the <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> gene expression leading to the increase in PO activity in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes. Therefore, we can conclude that the pmo-miR-315 regulates the proPO system via <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> post-transcriptional repression.</p><p>Upon WSSV infection, the shrimp proPO system takes part in shrimp antiviral immunity by producing melanin and cytotoxic intermediate for viral sequestration. However, the WSSV can overcome shrimp antiviral immunity partly by proPO system suppression. Several crustacean miRNAs have been reported to promote WSSV propagation. In <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic>, the host miR-s9041 and miR-9850 play positive roles in WSSV replication by targeting the <italic>STAT</italic> gene (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In crabs, <italic>E. sinensis</italic>, the miR-217 leads to a decrease in the transcript level of <italic>Tube</italic> gene resulting in the enhancement of WSSV copies (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Meanwhile, the survival rate of miR-100 silenced shrimp after WSSV infection is increased as the PO activity (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). According to our research, an increase in the viral copy number in WSSV-infected shrimp after pmo-miR-315 mimic injection indicated that the pmo-miR-315 functioned in enhancing viral replication by regulating the proPO system through the inhibition of <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> gene expression. On the other hand, the viral copy number of AMO-miR-315 challenged shrimp was lower than that of WSSV-infected shrimp challenged with exogenous pmo-miR-315 but was not lower than the control groups as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This might be because the pmo-miR-315 was not totally silenced. Since the whole genome sequence of <italic>P. monodon</italic> has not been reported yet, it was possible that the AMO-miR-315 could also target other unknown genes that might affect the WSSV propagation.</p><p>Taken together, our research offer a new mechanism on how WSSV inhibits proPO system by triggering host miRNA, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. The WSSV infection causes the pmo-miR-315 over-expression and subsequently inhibits the <italic>PmPPAE3</italic> expression leading to a decrease in PO activity and increase in WSSV copy number in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes. Therefore, the pmo-miR-315 regulates the proPO system through the suppression of <italic>PPAE3</italic> gene expression which leads to the promotion of viral propagation in shrimp hemocytes during WSSV infection.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>A schematic representation of the pmo-miR-315 role in modulating proPO activity by <italic>PmPPE3</italic> suppression during WSSV infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-09-02184-g0006"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>KS participated in funding acquisition and supervision of this works.
