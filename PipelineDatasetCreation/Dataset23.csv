PMC3509713	EDO31964	Discussion	ENA	FAUX	Background	A genetic exchange from viruses to their metazoan hosts was demonstrated among short proteins [34]. 	However, for a number of sequences the apparent relatedness to metagenomic sequences is clearly spurious (e.g., EDO31964.1, 130 amino acids). 	
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Title	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2].

PMC4748402	3R5N	Article	PDBe	FAUX	Use	A pharmacophore model is a 3D arrangement of physicochemical features (e.g., hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, hydrophobic area, aromatic ring) that represents the key interactions between a ligand molecule and its target protein. 	As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	3D-multiconformational compound libraries can be screened against a pharmacophore model to retrieve molecules that map the pharmacophore features and consequently have a high likelihood of being active on the target. Depending on the target, this method can achieve success rates between 2 and 30% (Hein et al., 2010).

PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Background	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18].

PMC5070816	AFW98990	Discussion	ENA	FAUX	Background	A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. 	The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. 	Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].

PMC5766183	4pxg	Discussion	PDBe	FAUX	Background	According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). 	Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

PMC6406689	rs9669948	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	Although statistical interactions do not always guarantee biological interaction, evidence about the biological function of SPRY2 [21,29,30] and the signals in the single haplotype analysis might together support a biological interaction. 	Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P.

PMC3794799	M73321	Introduction	ENA	FAUX	Use	Among the thermophilic actinomycetes, Thermobifida fusca is a major degrader of plant cell walls owing to its abundant extracellular cellulases and xylanases [23]. 	In this study, one gene cel6A (GenBank accession No. M73321) encoding an endoglucanase was selected to study the capacity of the novel expression vector we constructed in this paper. 	The reason for selecting endoglucanase Cel6A lies in the potential industrial application because of its thermostability, utility through a broad pH range and high activity [24]. Although an expression vector for production of endoglucanase Cel6A from T. fusca YX in Streptomyces has been reported recently, its maximum expression level was relatively low (about 64 mg/L) [25].

Our CSIDOP method predicted that it is also involved in ATP binding (GO:0005524), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), nucleotide binding (GO:0000166), and nucleoside_triphosphatase activity (GO:0017111), all of which can be verified in InterPro [34]. 	Other assigned terms for PRS7 by CSIDOP included endopeptidase activity (GO:0004175) and ATPase activity (GO:0016887), which were observed in the orthologous proteins of PRS7. An orthologous protein in D. melanogaster, RPT1 [Fly-Base: FBgn0028687], is annotated with endopeptidase activity inferred from direct assay [35]. 
PMC5589870	GCA_000973045.2	Methods	GCA	FAUX	Use	As an additional screening test, all potential virus assemblies were screened against the Conserved Doman Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) with an expected value threshold of 1 × 10−3 to identify viral gene segments. 	To exclude possible endogenous viruses, all virus assemblies were blasted against the I. ricinus reference genome (GCA_000973045.2). 	Finally, to assess mean sequence depth and relative frequency, the quality trimmed libraries were mapped back against all viral assemblies and the COX11 mitochondrial gene of I. ricinus (KF197136.1) using Bowtie2 v.2.2.831. Following previous studies1 we assume that a higher relative frequency suggests that the virus is more likely to be associated with ticks (rather than being a component of diet or environment). 
PMC5045647	KJ162957	Methods	ENA	FAUX	Use	As described previously [32], primers Bc1 Culic Fm and JerR2m were used to PCR amplify a 692 bp segment of the COI gene from 76 C. brevitarsis individuals with accession numbers [GenBank: KX247448-KX247523]. 	A total of four previously identified and published haplotypes was added with the following accession numbers: [GenBank: KJ162968, KJ162967, KJ162975 and KJ162957]. 	These sequences included one of C. asiatica, the most closely related species to C. brevitarsis [7]. The PCR amplicons were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and 20 μl was sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method (Macrogen, Geumchun-gu, Seoul).

"A distance of one means that the two terms have a direct parent-child relationship; for instance, protein binding (GO:0005515) is a known function of Furin precursor protein [Swiss-Prot: P09958], and our method predicted it to be involved in protein domain specific binding (GO:0019904), which is a direct child term of protein binding in GO. "	If we consider such cases to also be successful prediction, then the accuracy improves from 95.42% to 97.71%. A distance of two indicates that the two terms share a parent.

The amino acid sequence of the protein with UniProt accession number E3EEN8 (NCBI protein ID WP_013370345.1) was consistent with a PL family 10 pectate lyase. 	The PL10 enzyme showed the highest intensity in LC-MS/MS analysis (Table 1), which suggested that the enzyme may be a major component of the pectin-degrading enzymes of P. polymyxa KF-1. Only five pectate lyases belonging to PL family 10 have been characterized, including PelA from B. alcalophillus NTT33 [20], Pel-15E from Bacillus spp. strain KSM-P15 [21], PelA from Azospirillum irakense [22], rPelA from Treponema pectinovorum ATCC 33768 [23], and r-PL_D from Xanthomonas campestris ACCC 10048 [24].

AetMYB7D had the same nucleotide sequences in ‘As77’ (Genebank accession: MG495090) and ‘As60’ (Genebank accession: MG495089), and encoded the same protein as TaMYB7D (Genebank accession: KP136432), which is located on chromosome 7D of common wheat. 	The coding sequence of AetMYC1p (Genebank accession: MG495087) from ‘As60’ was 1704 bp long, and the 567 amino acid primary structure of the protein encoded contained the integrated bHLH-MYC_N domain of 178 amino acids, which is essential for protein-protein interaction, the HLH domain of 32 amino acids, which could facilitate protein-DNA binding, and the ACT-like domain of 78 amino acids, which initiates transcription (Figure 2). 	The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method, using the amino acid sequences of bHLH transcription factors (Figure 3). bHLH proteins from the same species were clustered together. 
PMC3292029	2OH4	Methods	PDBe	FAUX	Use	Because the crystal structure of KDR in complex with pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine was not available in the Brookheaven Protein Databank (PDB), the bioactive conformation was simulated by docking using Surflex-dock program. 	The crystallographic coordinates of KDR in complex with its inhibitor, which was reported to be in the inactive DFG-out conformation of KDR, were obtained from the PDB as entries 2OH4 [23]. 	Surflex-Dock program [25,26] has been widely used to calculate the protein–ligand interactions, and to efficiently predict the active conformations [27–35]. Surflex-Dock uses a Protomol-based method and an empirical scoring function to dock a ligand into the binding site of a receptor. 
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Background	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. 	As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs). Predicted RA Response Elements (RAREs) in the promoter regions of both genes where evaluated to be recognized by RARs, using C57BL/6J (B6) mice, in two developmental stages.

The sequence matched ORF spr1875 of the S. pneumoniae R6 strain genome (GenBank accession no. AE007317), encoding a 380 amino acid-long protein with an N-terminal peptidoglycan interaction lysine motif (LysM) domain, which is found in cell wall degrading enzymes and in virulence factors (Fig. 1). 	The predicted protein sequence of Spr1875 contains a leader peptide with a leader sequence and a cleavage site present in variety of streptococcal surface proteins. We next produced a recombinant R4-GST fusion protein and assessed its ability to bind to serum antibodies from patients recovering from pneumococcal infection.

"	Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs.

PMC3884852	1LM0	Article	PDBe	FAUX	Background	CcmE is a heme-binding protein, discovered as an essential System I component as early as the late 1990's [63]. 	"CcmE is a monotopic membrane protein, anchored to the membrane via its N-terminal TM segment and exposing its active site to the periplasm; it is the only Ccm component of the heme trafficking and delivery module of System I for which a three-dimensional structure is available ([21] PDB: 1SR3; [64] PDB: 1LM0). "	"The 3D structure of the apo-state (without bound heme) consists of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, reminiscent of the classical OB-fold [65] with N- and C-terminal extensions. CcmE can be considered a “heme chaperone,” as it protects the cell from a potentially dangerous compound by sequestering free heme in the periplasm [66]; it is thought to act as an intermediate in the heme delivery pathway of Cytc maturation.

PMC3884852	3KH9	Article	PDBe	FAUX	Background	CcmG is a membrane-anchored protein, linked to the membrane via an N-terminal TM helix and exposing its soluble TRX-like domain in the periplasm. 	"The 3D structure of the TRX-like domain of CcmG from different bacteria has been solved by X-ray crystallography (E. coli: PDB 1Z5Y [85]; PDB 2B1 K [86]; B. japonicum: PDB 1KNG [87]; P. aeruginosa: PDB 3KH7, 3KH9 [22]) and is generally well conserved, as proved by the low RMSD (0.8 Å between Pa-CcmG and Ec-CcmG; 1.35 Å between Pa-CcmG and Bj-CcmG). "	"Although all these proteins adopt a TRX-like fold and contain the redox-active motif CXXC in the first α-helix, they are inactive in the classic insulin reduction assay [75, 88]; CcmG proteins are therefore considered specific thiol-oxidoreductase, able to recognize and selectively interact only with their upstream and downstream binding partners in the thioreduction process leading to reduced apoCytc. Looking at the 3D structure of the periplasmic domain of the prototypical Pa-CcmG, it is possible to identify the βαβ and ββα structural motifs of the TRX fold linked by a short α-helix and forming a four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three helices; the protein contains an additional N-terminal extension (residues 26–62) and a central insert (residues 102–123).

"Comparison of the MaHV-1 UL27 and UL30 ORFs with those of the recently sequenced fruit bat herpesvirus 1 (FbHV-1) [GenBank:BAP00706 and GenBank:YP_009042092; UL27 and UL30, respectively] showed that these ORFs shared 71 and 67 % pairwise aa identity, respectively (83 and 78 % aa similarity). "	This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials.

To build the sidechain of the residue at position j, the amino acid type i adopting a rotameric structure k from the penultimate rotamer library [44] was locally optimized with the “Clear Geometry” function in Discovery Studio (version 2.5, Accelrys) while the rest of the antibody-antigen complex remained fixed. The sidechain conformations clashing with the rest of the protein complex structure were removed from further consideration.

PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	Considering the higher statistical power of haplotype analysis compared to individual SNP analysis when LD was exploited to explore genes associated with diseases, we conducted the haplotype analysis and haplotype—environment interaction analysis to further investigate the roles of SPRY genes in Chinese NSCL/P. 	The results of haplotype analysis altogether indicated that one genetic segment (rs541731- rs9669948, from 80345577 to 80372188) located at 4.5 kb—31.1 kb downstream of SPRY2 was associated with NSCL/P, indicating that the neighborhood region of this segment might contain causal variants. 	"Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies. "

Another example is the PRS7 [Swiss-Prot: P35998] gene in human, which is currently annotated in GO to participate in protein binding (GO:0005515), with no other listed terms. 	Our CSIDOP method predicted that it is also involved in ATP binding (GO:0005524), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), nucleotide binding (GO:0000166), and nucleoside_triphosphatase activity (GO:0017111), all of which can be verified in InterPro [34]. Other assigned terms for PRS7 by CSIDOP included endopeptidase activity (GO:0004175) and ATPase activity (GO:0016887), which were observed in the orthologous proteins of PRS7.

"	Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. 	Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage.90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB. 
PMC5393379	NC_007782	Methods	RefSeq	FAUX	Background	Conversely, Gastropoda were constrained as a monophylum, so that at least some possible artifacts, due to long-branch attraction (LBA) with the 5 outgroup taxa, are avoided. 	Moreover, the mtDNA of Lottia digitalis (GenBank Accession Number NC_007782) turned out to be very fast-evolving and very prone to create LBA artifacts, therefore this taxon was excluded from the study, thus lowering the number of ingroups to 109. 	Being Lottia the only known representative of the clade with a published complete mtDNA, unfortunately this also led to the exclusion of the whole Patellogastropoda from our analysis. The ML analysis was extensively described elsewhere (see, in particular, see supplementary Additional file S4, Supplementary Material online of Plazzi et al. 2016).

Of the twenty-nine residues implicated in FAD binding in mxPPOX (pdb code 2IVD), thirteen are invariant in CRTI with a further six residues being of similar type (45% identity, 66% similarity). 	Of the nine residues that make hydrophilic contacts with FAD only E39 (E31, CRTI) makes side-chain only contacts (with the ribose moiety) and is one of only six residues that are invariant in all six proteins (the others being G8, G10, G38, G53 and V244 in CrtI). Two others form main-chain and side-chain contacts, S20 and N441, but both are replaced by G12 and G466 in CRTI, allowing only the main-chain contacts to be preserved.

M(NLS-88R)-neutral occurs as physiological monomers similar to wt-M1 structure 1EA3 (also crystallized at neutral pH),12 and are arranged loosely in a so-called ‘face-to-back’ orientation with each other in the cell (Figure 1A). 	The residues Lys104 (part of the NLS motif), Arg134, Tyr100 and Asp94 on the ‘face’ of one molecule (Monomer A) interact with several complementary residues on the ‘back’ of a second molecule (Monomer B), including Glu29, Asp30, Lys21 and Ser17 (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite also crystallizing at a neutral pH, the two monomers (A and B) of M(NLS-88E)-neutral unexpectedly associate to form a physiological face-to-face dimer with the NLS basic residues adjacent to each other similar to wt-M1 dimer 1AA7 (crystallized at acidic pH).13 The two monomers of M(NLS-88E)-neutral are similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ~0.4 Å, but are different from those in wt-M1 1AA7.13

All structures in the top100H database have low RDCC values, barring three proteins (PDBids: 2ER7, 1XSO and 4PTP), which had multiple conformations for some residues, and were excluded from the processing. 	This validates our hypothesis that RDCC is minimized in native structures. Hence, structures that have a RDCC value more than a user specified threshold can be pruned out as structures with low quality or non-native structures. 
PMC4551926	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	FAUX	Use	Figure 3 illustrates that TAD can undergo block split when comparing human cell lines GM12878-I with IMR90-I. 	Intuitively, the statistically significant chromatin interactions in cell line GM12878-I are more dispersedly distributed compared with those in cell line IMR90-I, which is accurately captured by interaction blocks and the parameter AP. 	Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90. Consistently, the increase of active epigenomic and transcription signals (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36mes, RNAPII and RNASeq) validates the increased transcription activity in cell line IMR90-I (Figure 3). 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. 	However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. 	Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study.

"Additionally, two IL23R polymorphisms were analyzed; rs7517847, strongly associated with Crohn’s disease and whose association seems to be independent on rs11209026 [16], and, rs1495965, previously associated with BD by GWASs [21,22]. "	On the other hand, two STAT4 genetic variants, rs7574070 and rs897200, recently associated with BD, were included in the study [26,27]. Both polymorphisms seem to have functional consequences and are located in a different linkage disequilibrium block from the SNPs rs3821236 and rs7574865.

"In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). "	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010).

PMC6155776	3PL1	Introduction	PDBe	FAUX	Background	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. 	The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24]. 	Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA. The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA.

Although the functional properties of KCC2a-S25 remain to be determined, the fact that mKCC4 cloned from several sources (GenBank accessions: AK166215, AK149750, BC059242, AK143535, AK131129, BC141107, AF087436) lacks exon 27 (homologous to exon 25 in Slc12a5), adds an extra layer of complexity to our current understanding of the molecular physiology of KCC2, particularly when considering that KCC2a-S25 accounts for ~55–60% of total KCC2 transcripts in β-cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). 	KCC2a-S25 lacks five C-terminal residues located immediately after the so-called “ISO-domain”, which is responsible for the high basal activity of the transporter35 whereas KCC4, which lack ISO domains, is an inactive cotransporter under normal isotonic conditions35, 63, 64. However, unlike KCC2, KCC4 is robustly activated by hypotonicity64.

The complex of POA bound to the ribosomal protein S1 (involved in trans-translation process) was resolved (pdb: 4NNI). 	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24].

PMC5471064	rs1401492	Article	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	In 2011, based on the HyperGen study, a GWAS including 1,040 African Americans explored the association between insulin resistance and genetic variation. 	The results showed SNPs linked with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin near ATP10A (rs6576507 and rs8026527) and CACNA1D (rs1401492) [54]. 	Obesity is related with insulin resistance, and also a strong risk factor for T2DM. Thus, we can assume reasonably that some loci of obesity would also be insulin resistance loci, or possibly T2DM susceptibility loci. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19]. 	Considering the well-established relationship between increasing levels of hs-CRP and adverse cardiovascular outcome [20], it may be surprising that the CAD risk allele of rs2075650 was associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in our sample. 	However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies. In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21]. 
PMC3902798	GG699410	Results	ENA	FAUX	Use	In addition to surveying SNPs, we also searched for loss or gain of genes. 	By aligning sequence reads against the previously published NCPPB4381 genome assembly and systematically comparing gene-coverage in each of the alignments, we were able to identify a genomic region (GenBank: GG699410.1) that showed differential coverage among different isolates of Xcm (Figure 4). 	This region shows significant similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels to two previously sequenced phage: Xanthomonas phage Cfc1 (RefSeq: NC_001396.1) [26] and Stenotrophomonas phage phiSHP2 (GenBank: HM150760.1). Specifically, two Tanzanian isolates (NCPPB4392 and NCPPB4395) appear to have completely lost at least 17 genes from this region, while Ethiopian isolate NCPPB2005 has lost 11 of the same genes.

PMC5520553	rs10052999	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	In conclusion, patients with OLT for HCC require different therapeutic regimens compared with patients with etiologically distinct liver disease. 	Specifically, this study found that recipient C6 rs9200 allele G was associated with rapid tacrolimus metabolism during the first 3 weeks after transplantation, and donor C6 rs10052999 homozygote represented a marker for rapid tacrolimus metabolism at weeks 2, 3, and 4 after OLT. 	Further, this study confirmed the association of CYP3A5 rs776746 SNPs with tacrolimus C/D ratios. The combination of C6 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms exerted a greater effect on tacrolimus metabolism than individual SNPs and developed better equations that described the association between genotype and tacrolimus metabolism.

In three Chinese studies on ulcerative colitis (UC) patients [31, 32] and on CD patients, no difference [32] or an association of the Bb genotype of the BsmI variant with UC [31] was reported; whereas no association was found for ApaI, TaqI, and BsmI with CD [33].

PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	FAUX	Use	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search.

"The main findings were; 1) for SNP rs2075650 in the TOMM40, APOE locus, the established CAD-risk allele was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP levels, 2) No other CAD-related SNPs were associated with the inflammatory marker levels, either measured as individual SNPs or when combined into a GRS. "	Previous GWASs have demonstrated a robust association between the rs2075650 G-allele and an increased risk of CAD [11]. In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19]. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. 	None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3. Our findings may suggest that the effect of these CAD-loci on CAD development does not act through pathways significantly affecting these commonly used inflammatory biomarkers.

The resulting 9-SNP model included rs2200733 for PITX2 and the other 8 SNPs from the other genes. 	"The risk of AF with this modified AF GRS, as in the 12-SNP model, was greater for the highest AF GRS quintile than for the lowest AF GRS quintile (OR 5.07; 95% CI 2.04–12.60; p < 0.001), and this model appeared to better differentiate risk of AF throughout the distribution of genetic risk (S3 Table).

PMC5346138	2MNA	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Background	Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). 	We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). 	The NMR data suggest that this base-stacking mechanism is conserved between ssDNA and RNA. An in-silico model (Fig. 4f–g), calculated based on the NMR structure of the DNA-bound SsoSSB (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015) (assuming that replacing the ssDNA by RNA does not lead to a major change in the conformation of the nucleotide), provides further strong support for this notion.

PMC2928273	rs1801275	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	Joint Analysis of Pneumonitis Risk Alleles 	In combined analysis, the significant SNPs together with an additional borderline significant variant – IL4R: rs1801275 (P = 0.053) – showed an increase in pneumonitis risk as the number of unfavorable genotypes increased ( Table 3 ). The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013). 	This risk was dramatically increased for the group of patients with four or more unfavorable genotypes (P<0.0001). These high risk individuals also had a shorter duration between start of treatment and development of pneumonitis of only 5.33 months compared to over 12 months for those with 0 to 2 unfavorable genotypes ( Figure 1B ).

"	"To identify particular somata as motoneurons associated with a given extraocular muscle, we used two criteria: first, the projection patterns of extraocular motoneurons (Fig. 1C, D), which are highly conserved across vertebrates (Evinger, 1988); and second, the known lack of GFP expression in IO motoneurons in the Tg(isl1:GFP) background (Higashijima et al., 2000). Somata filled contralaterally to the right eye (left side of the brain) were defined as SO motoneurons if found in nIV, or SR motoneurons if found in nIII (Fig. 2A). "

The data of LexiRumah is published under the Open-Access CC-BY-4.0 license and available online under http://model-ling.eu/LexiRumah/, while supporting software (in the shape of the pylexirumah Python package, https://pypi.org/project/pylexirumah/) and the CLDF conform dataset ([19], http://cldf.clld.org) is available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1164782. 	LexiRumah is designed as a tool to investigate the linguistic history of the Lesser Sunda Islands and contains the lexicon of 101 varieties from two language families spoken in the region: Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) and Timor-Alor-Pantar. The database contains words for 596 concepts covering both basic and non-basic concepts, including culture-specific notions (e.g. ‘betel nut’), concepts for words that have been reconstructed to proto-Malayo-Polynesian (e.g. ‘canoe’) and concepts known to be highly borrowable (e.g. ‘to worship’) [20].

PMC4682451	609309	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Background	Lynch syndrome (MIM #120435) predisposes to the development of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers [Lynch and de la Chapelle, 2003]. 	It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually MLH1 (MIM #120436) or MSH2 (MIM #609309) [Lynch et al., 2009]. 	The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003]. In many cases, the functional and hence clinical significance of the sequence alterations, in particular single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) outside coding regions, is uncertain.

"	Both amplified DNAs were 437 bp in length and were 100% homologous with 99.5% identity to previously reported BPV-2 sequences (accession number AB823004). 	On the other hand, bovine herpesvirus-specific DNA could not be detected in any of the myofibroblastoma lesions. For further verification of the presence of BPV-2 in myofibroblastomas, similar analyses were performed on two previously diagnosed myofibroblastoma samples from the neck and vulva [1, 13].

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	Many investigators have found the concepts of genetic variation and antidiabetic medication efficacy to be quite attractive. 	For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.[6–8,20,21] Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.[22] Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467.

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 	In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue.

The template structure was found with the help of the HOMCOS server30 by the condition that the 292-nd site of RTN4R became an interface for other proteins. The sequence of the SLITRK1 protein is similar to that of RTN4R, with 33.5% sequence identity, and both the LINGO1 and PTPRD proteins have an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain with weak sequence similarity (sequence identity=19.5%).

AetMYB7D had the same nucleotide sequences in ‘As77’ (Genebank accession: MG495090) and ‘As60’ (Genebank accession: MG495089), and encoded the same protein as TaMYB7D (Genebank accession: KP136432), which is located on chromosome 7D of common wheat. 	The coding sequence of AetMYC1p (Genebank accession: MG495087) from ‘As60’ was 1704 bp long, and the 567 amino acid primary structure of the protein encoded contained the integrated bHLH-MYC_N domain of 178 amino acids, which is essential for protein-protein interaction, the HLH domain of 32 amino acids, which could facilitate protein-DNA binding, and the ACT-like domain of 78 amino acids, which initiates transcription (Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method, using the amino acid sequences of bHLH transcription factors (Figure 3).

The crystal structure files of fully Ca2+-saturated avian fast skeletal troponin molecule (1YTZ.pdb) [20] and Ca2+-depleted TnC subunit (5TnC.pdb) [33] were obtained from the Protein Data Bank [34]. 	Our choice of PDB system was driven by the considerations that while both Ca2+- and apo-form crystal structures are available for the core domain of the skeletal troponin complex, 1YTZ.pdb is the only available structure in the Ca2+ form. The 5TnC.pdb crystal structure of Herzberg and James is the first crystal structure of EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins, is determined at 2 Å resolution, and is widely considered to be the gold standard for skeletal TnC structural description.

PMC2216687	P01023	Results	UniProt	FAUX	Use	Moreover, the CSIDOP may provide additional functional terms to existing proteins. 	For example, the Alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor [Swiss-Prot: P01023], was predicted by CSIDOP to be involved in protease inhibitor activity (GO:0030414), which is not among the current list of functions annotated in GO. 	Consistent with this prediction, alpha-2-macroglobulin is found to be a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested [33]. Another example is the PRS7 [Swiss-Prot: P35998] gene in human, which is currently annotated in GO to participate in protein binding (GO:0005515), with no other listed terms.

A putative NAC gene from maize, identified with the accession number CA095885, which is similar to the rice OsNAC5 gene, was induced in the roots of maize plants exposed to 283 μM Al, but not in those exposed to 75 μM Al [18]. 	In the presence of 200 μM Al, this gene was induced in the roots of all four cultivars evaluated (Fig 2A) and in the shoots of three cultivars, with the exception of Temporalero (Fig 2B). Under our experimental conditions, the Cotaxtla and Temporalero cultivars showed a similar expression profile in the roots, while Tres Ríos and Huimanguillo formed another group with similar expression profiles between them.

PMC5737465	PRJNA275635	Methods	BioProject	FAUX	Use	Population Genomic Data Processing 	We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single C. grandiflora population, generated by Josephs et al. (2015) (NCBI accession number PRJNA275635, ID: 275635). 	We trimmed the paired-end 100-bp raw reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014), and randomly subsampled reads of each individual to a total of 54 million reads per sample (average coverage 25×) to avoid an overrepresentation of individual samples with high coverage. We mapped the trimmed reads to a TE-merged reference with bwa bwasw 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin 2009), as recommended before analyses with PoPoolationTE2 (Kofler et al. 2016).

PMC4624855	1BJ1	Introduction	PDBe	FAUX	Background	Ranibizumab has been developed for intravitreal injection and shows improved ocular pharmacokinetics (Xu et al., 2013) compared to bevacizumab. 	X-ray structures of VEGFA bound to ranibizumab (PDB: 1CZ8) (Chen et al., 1999) or Fab-bevacizumab (PDB: 1BJ1) (Muller et al., 1998) have been solved. 	The three dimensional structure of aflibercept is not available, albeit widely investigated. Aflibercept, also known as VEGF-trap, is a decoy receptor where two binding domains, the domain 2 (d2) of VEGFR1 and the domain 3 (d3) of VEGFR2 (from N-terminus to C-terminus of primary sequence) are connected to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin (Ig) (Holash et al., 2002). 
PMC3884852	2KCT	Article	PDBe	FAUX	Background	Recently, it was shown that CcmE proteins from the proteobacteria D. desulfuricans and D. vulgaris contain the unusual CXXXY heme-binding motif, where the Cys residue replaces the canonical His binding residue. 	NMR solution structure of D. vulgaris CcmE (PDB: 2KCT) revealed that the proteins adopt the same OB-fold characteristic of the CcmE superfamily. 	Contrary to what reported for the D. desulfuricans CcmE [69], the homologous protein from D. vulgaris binds ferric heme noncovalently through the conserved C127 residue [70]. An additional conserved residue in CcmE proteins is Tyr134, which was shown to provide a coordination bond to the heme iron of holoCcmE [71, 72] once it is released from CcmABCD complex [36], as discussed below. 
PMC4564166	615113	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Background	Recently, retinoic acid (RA) pathways mediated by Retinoid Orphan Receptor Alpha (RORA) have been implicated in ASD [17].

PMC3310866	3AUV	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	Since the phage display systems in Figure 1 are based on the scFv and the sc-dsFv scaffolds, it is important to verify that both the scFv and the sc-dsFv structures are similar to the variable domain structure in G6-Fab even in the absence of the two Fab constant domains in the scFv or the sc-dsFv structures. 	"High-resolution sc-dsFv structure with the sequence identical to the parent G6-Fab variable domains (except for the two interface cysteines in the sc-dsFv shown in Figure 2) has been elucidated with x-ray crystallography as shown in Figure 2 (PDB code 3AUV); the refinement data are shown in Table S3. "	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details.

While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

PMC5346417	rs3754777	Article	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	So, it remains unclear whether the association of BP with STK39 alleles is a false positive one or is population specific. 	The latter is suggested by a study in Northeastern Chinese Han people indicating that the association in the Han is regionally distinct and involve the interplay of several STK39 alleles (rs6749447, rs35929607 and rs3754777) [56]. 	While the influence of STK39 genetic variation on blood pressure is not clear, genetic variation in its phosphorylation target, NCC, is important. Over 100 mutations in the SCL21A3 gene, which encodes for NCC, have been documented in patients with Gitelman syndrome.

PMC5501546	rs4845625	Discussion	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	Some previous GWASs have explored the association between CAD-associated risk variants and common inflammatory markers, of which the IL6R locus has been associated with several. 	In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. 	Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response.

PMC3310866	2FJG	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. 	The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details. 	The structural differences of the engineered interface disulfide bond unique to the sc-dsFv structure are also highlighted in Figure 2. Although the G6-derived scFv structure has not been determined with experimental method, the consistency of the sc-dsFv structure with the G6-Fab structure as shown in Figure 2 and the consistency of the sequence patterns for the scFv and sc-dsFv variants binding to VEGF (comparison of Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) indicate that the scFv-VEGF interactions can be modeled based on the G6 Fab-VEGF complex structure as well. 
PMC3598806	1YTZ	Methods	PDBe	FAUX	Use	The crystal structure files of fully Ca2+-saturated avian fast skeletal troponin molecule (1YTZ.pdb) [20] and Ca2+-depleted TnC subunit (5TnC.pdb) [33] were obtained from the Protein Data Bank [34]. 	Our choice of PDB system was driven by the considerations that while both Ca2+- and apo-form crystal structures are available for the core domain of the skeletal troponin complex, 1YTZ.pdb is the only available structure in the Ca2+ form. 	The 5TnC.pdb crystal structure of Herzberg and James is the first crystal structure of EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins, is determined at 2 Å resolution, and is widely considered to be the gold standard for skeletal TnC structural description. The closeness of the two source species: Gallus gallus (1YTZ.pdb) and Meleagris gallopavo (5TnC.pdb) provided an additional level of complementarity.

"The structures of the site I synaptic intermediates [1ZR2, 1ZR4, 2GM4; (16,17)] and of an activated variant catalytic domain without DNA [2GM5; (17)] contain a tetrameric arrangement of the catalytic domains which is not found in any of the structures of wild-type resolvase [2RSL, 1GDR, 1GDT; (6,8,9,11)] (Figure 2B). "	However, the structures do not provide an obvious explanation of how the mutations stabilize the tetramer, or why it is not formed by wild-type resolvase. Li et al. (16) make two hypotheses.

PMC5751318	107730	Discussion	OMIM	FAUX	Background	The molecular defect was identified in the absence of activity of MTTP, a factor critical to lipidation of APOB. 	In familial hypo-beta-lipoproteinemia (FHBL) (OMIM# 107730), a genetic heterogeneous autosomal codominant disorder [21], defects of APOB genes are involved in most cases, leading to the formation of prematurely truncated APOB species. 	However, a number of defects affecting the rate of synthesis or the rate of removal of APOB is also emerging [21]. The second point to bring into discussion is the colocalization of the two proteins (the abnormal fibrinogen and the normal APOB) in the same ER inclusions.

Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well.

PMC5471064	rs12137855	Article	RefSNP	FAUX	Background	The second GWAS about NAFLD was performed in 236 women with NAFLD and identified an association between SNP rs2645424 in FDFT1 (an enzyme with a role in cholesterol synthesis) and NAFLD activity score [60]. 	In 2011, Speliotes et al. conducted the third NAFLD GWAS [58], and identified five SNPs associated with NAFLD in or near PNPLA3 (rs738408), NCAN (rs2228603), PPP1R3B (rs4240624), GCKR (rs780094) and LYPLAL1 (rs12137855). 	There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between PNPLA3 rs738408 and the previously identified rs738409 [56]. Another recently GWAS in adolescents with NAFLD identified SNPs relevant to two neuron-specific genes (SLC38A8 and LPPR4) and two liver-specific genes (LCP1and GC).

IL13 polymorphisms had a similar effect on pneumonitis risk. 	Patients with two variant alleles or either rs20541 or rs180925 were approximately 3-times more likely to develop pneumonitis compared to those with wild-type or heterozygous genotypes (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14–7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03–10.18). 	The signaling molecule IkappaB-alpha (NFKBIA) inhibits the inflammatory response by blocking NFkappaB-mediated transcription of proinflammatory genes.

PMC4941682	AB274813	Conclusion	ENA	FAUX	Background	The type species of Arthroxylaria, A. elegans, is herein placed in Xylaria. 	Although Stadler et al. (2013) connected Geniculisynnema with Nemania, a BLAST search with the ITS sequence of G. termiticola (AB274813), type species of Geniculisynnema, showed top matches with Xylaria species associated with termite nests.. 	These four generic names are now considered synonyms of Xylaria. Given its widespread use, the number of species, and priority, Xylaria is recommended for use.

PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	OMIM	FAUX	Background	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated. 
PMC4208647	A23187	Results	ENA	FAUX	Use	Then, we investigated whether VNUT gene expression is linked with the secretion of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells. 	"Nucleotide secretion was triggered by the addition of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, since it causes entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell interior; the resultant rapid increase in Ca2+ facilitates exocytosis of secretory vesicles. "	As shown in Figure 4A, appreciable amounts of ATP and ADP were released from the cells in a time‐dependent fashion. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in the medium, no A23187‐dependent release of nucleotides was observed.

PMC4551926	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	FAUX	Use	There exist different kinds of structural changes across cell lines, which can be captured by interaction blocks and corresponding AP values. 	Figure 3 illustrates that TAD can undergo block split when comparing human cell lines GM12878-I with IMR90-I. 	Intuitively, the statistically significant chromatin interactions in cell line GM12878-I are more dispersedly distributed compared with those in cell line IMR90-I, which is accurately captured by interaction blocks and the parameter AP. Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90.

The B. platyphylla Actin gene (GenBank accession number: EU588981) [51] was used as an internal control (reference gene) to normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, which has been improved by Chao Dai et al. in 2011 [30]. 	The validity of the Bplactin gene as a control gene has been tested and proved by pre-experiment before the real-time RT-PCR (Figure S2).

PMC2928273	rs1800872	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	Therefore, we determined if any of the variants identified as toxicity risk factors were also associated with survival over three years. 	We found that patients with at least one variant allele of IL10:rs1800872 had a 1.74-fold increased risk of esophagitis, but a 40% decreased risk of dying when compared to patients with wild-type genotypes (HR:0.62, 95% CI:0.40–0.97).  Figure 2A  illustrates the time to esophagitis for patients with IL10:rs1800872 genotypes. 	Although not significant, patients with wild-type genotypes had median time to event of greater than 12 months contrasted with only 1.8 months for those with at least one variant of rs1800872. For survival ( Figure 2B ), there was a non-significant survival advantage of nearly four months for carriers with a median survival time of 16.1 months compared to only 12.4 months for patients with wild-type genotypes.

Previously published MaHV-1 genome sequence data [GenBank:AY048539, GenBank:AF188480] was used to aid scaffold construction. 	Medium and high sensitivity default settings with a minimum of 90–95 % overlap identity in Geneious version 6.1.7 were used in these assemblies. Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) using Glimmer3 was restricted to those larger than 240 bp, and ORF annotations were determined by Blastx and Blastn searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases, respectively [38, 39]. 
PMC5035930	rs76726265	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	These data demonstrate that compound heterozygosity for the mutations led to a significant loss of IFT81, more than could be accounted for by presence of one null allele, suggesting that the missense mutation destabilized IFT81. 	"In addition to the IFT81 mutations, the exome sequence analysis in R98-443A identified heterozygosity for a known TTC21B variant (c.2600G > A; p.Arg867His; rs76726265). "	Because TTC21B mutations have shown to cause ATD, and this variant was predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen with Bayes probability of 0.999 by the MutationTaster algorithm), mRNA and protein levels were characterized by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis respectively. 
PMC5346138	1O7I	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	These data suggest that the interaction surface is conserved between ssDNA and RNA. 	Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). 	We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). The NMR data suggest that this base-stacking mechanism is conserved between ssDNA and RNA.

Number of biospecimens collected The GTEx pilot biospecimen collection included up to 41 different PAXgene preserved postmortem target tissue types (Fig. 4). 
PMC5750462	1EA3	Methods	PDBe	FAUX	Use	This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. 	The G88R mutation also results in two additional inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds (Lys104-NZ to Glu29-OE2 and Arg134-NE to Glu29-OE1) in M(NLS-88R)-neutral (see Supplementary Table S3) that make the subunit rotation slightly difficult than similarly face-to-back-oriented wt-M1 neutral structure 1EA3. 	This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles. Nevertheless, M(NLS-88R) M1 retains pH-dependent conformational transition like WSN.

PMC4742844	IPR001451	Discussion	InterPro	FAUX	Use	This classification is based on the presence or absence of imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide sequence. 	While MetA from E. coli and a homoserine acetyltransferase from H. influenzae belong to the non-hexapeptide acyltransferases, SATs generally possess this structural motif that can be found using InterProScan (IPR001451). 	We searched for these hexapeptide sequences in the L. casei SAT protein but did not detect this structural motif (data not shown). Therefore, the L. casei SAT is, to our knowledge, the first SAT to be described as a non-hexapeptide acyltransferase.

PMC5346417	KFX50394	Article	ENA	FAUX	Background	This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. 	It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). 	The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure.

PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	ENA	FAUX	Use	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1). 
PMC4293902	2F5Z	Discussion	PDBe	FAUX	Use	This limitation notwithstanding, the AUC and SAXS data are all consistent with a dimeric structure for PfaE3 and are not inconsistent with the augmented homology model. 	In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. 	The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3). 
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Background	This overexpression has also been reported in ASD children [32]. 	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs).

Recently [30], the crystallographic structure of VDAC2 has been solved for zebra fish (PDB code 4BUM) at high resolution (2.8 Å), showing a very high degree of similarity with both the human and mouse VDAC1 3D structure. 	The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between zebra fish VDAC2 and the mVDAC reference structure used in this work is only 0.98 Å. The zebra fish VDAC2 amino acid sequence has 84% identity and 98% similarity with the human VDAC2, with the main differences located in the external loops. In agreement with the solved 3D structures, the N-terminal fragment crosses the lumen with a helical folding from the residue 6 to 20 in all the isoforms, and is horizontally located close to the lumen center.

PMC4146382	4BUM	Introduction	PDBe	FAUX	Background	Thus, the 3D structure of the VDAC2 and VDAC3 isoforms have been predicted on the basis of secondary structure prediction servers [5]. 	"It was only during revision of the present work that a crystallographic structure of VDAC2 was published [30] (zebra fish VDAC2; PDB code 4BUM at 2.8 Å resolution) confirming the very high degree of structural similarity with the VDAC1. "	The most striking difference between the three human isoforms is certainly the longer N-terminal fragment of hVDAC2, which has 11 residues more than the other two isoforms (figure 1). The N-terminal fragment of VDAC, comprising the first 25 amino acid residues (36 in the case of hVDAC2), is located inside the channel in the 3D structures, partially closing the wide pore [20]–[22].

Following previous studies1 we assume that a higher relative frequency suggests that the virus is more likely to be associated with ticks (rather than being a component of diet or environment). In the case of potentially multiple and/or overlapping open reading frames, FSFinder2 (http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsfinder2/) was used to identify possible ribosomal frameshifts. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Background	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17).

"	The possible effect of the synonymous variant on mRNA stability was analyzed using SilVA [47], as in O’Roak, B.J. et al., 2012 another synonymous variant was reported in this gene [10], and ESEfinder for possible de novo splicing regions [48,49], but no effects on mRNA stability or possible new splice sites were found (Table 2). The insertion in GAS8-AS1 (Table 1) was analyzed using ESEfinder to determine if it might alter GAS8 gene (MIM:605178) splice since it is located in intron 2. 
PMC3791179	rs3775073	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	We analyzed 14 candidate polymorphisms, 5 in TLR1, 3 in TLR2, and 6 in TLR6 in 98 cases and 268 controls. 	Two TLR6 SNPs (rs3821985 and rs3775073) had HWE p values ≤ 0.001 and were not analyzed further. 	Since TLR1 and TLR6 are contiguous genes on chromosome 4p14, we evaluated the linkage disequilibrium pattern for the 5 TLR1 and 4 TLR6 SNPs in the control population (Fig. 2). The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage.

Two missense novel SNVs were found in the same child: ALDH1A3 (RefSeq NM_000693: c.1514T>C (p.I505T)) and FOXN1 (RefSeq NM_003593: c.146C>T (p.S49L)). 	"Gene expression studies reveal that Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 are expressed in ~E13.5 mouse embryonic brain, as well as in adult piriform cortex (PC; ~P30). Conserved Retinoic Acid Response Elements (RAREs) upstream of human ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 and in mouse Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 genes were revealed using bioinformatic approximation. "
PMC3791179	rs3821985	Methods	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	We examined Hardy Weinberg Equilibirum p values and SNP genotypic frequencies in the cases and controls using Stata 11.1 software (StataCorp) and the user-written package “GENASS.”48 All SNPs analyzed for association with LD were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium using a cutoff p value of ≥ 0.001 (χ2 goodness-of-fit test) in the control group to ensure that there were no genotyping errors or major effects of population heterogeneity. 	Two SNPs in TLR6 (rs3821985 and rs3775073) showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among control subjects (p<0.001) and were not further evaluated. 	"The remaining twelve SNPs passed the HWE p value test (p≥0.001) and were assessed for association with LD, using a genotypic model in the first-pass analysis; those that had a significant association (p<0.05) were then investigated under dominant and recessive genetic models. In the dominant model, carriers of the less common allele (01 and 11 genotypes) were compared with homozygous subjects for the major allele (00 genotype). "
PMC2216687	P07900	Results	UniProt	FAUX	Background	We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. 	For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. 	Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively. 
PMC3791179	rs5743808	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	We found no associations with LD for any of the TLR1 variants, including rs5743618, a non-synonymous SNP at base pair 1805 in the transmembrane domain of TLR1 that regulates signaling (Table 2).26, 27 Similarly, no TLR2 variant was associated with LD. 	The frequency of a single TLR6 SNP, rs5743808 (359T>C), a nonsynonymous variant in the extracellular leucine rich repeat domain of the protein (encoding an isoleucine-to-threonine transition at amino acid residue 120), was greater in cases compared to controls (genotypic analysis: p= 7.9 ×10−5) (Table 2). 	This association remained significant after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons (p=9.5 ×10−4). The association best fit a dominant model (comparing TT genotypes to TC/CC) with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 5.83 for LD (p= 7.9×10−5) in cases compared to controls (Table 3). 
PMC2928273	rs1800872	Results	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	We found that patients with at least one variant allele of IL10:rs1800872 had a 1.74-fold increased risk of esophagitis, but a 40% decreased risk of dying when compared to patients with wild-type genotypes (HR:0.62, 95% CI:0.40–0.97).  Figure 2A  illustrates the time to esophagitis for patients with IL10:rs1800872 genotypes. 	Although not significant, patients with wild-type genotypes had median time to event of greater than 12 months contrasted with only 1.8 months for those with at least one variant of rs1800872. 	For survival ( Figure 2B ), there was a non-significant survival advantage of nearly four months for carriers with a median survival time of 16.1 months compared to only 12.4 months for patients with wild-type genotypes.

PMC3509713	3ZXC	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	We now focus on a predicted TOLIP that represents a short, secreted protein with a modulatory function. Figure 5A compares a statistical model (HMM, Hidden Markov Model) that was based on the sequence XP_002164320.1 (105 amino acids) with a library of HMM models from all 3D solved structures that are archived in the PDB. 	The resulting model was based on PDB accession 3ZXC from the Central America hunting spider Cupiennius salei. 	This sequence is a single insulin-like growth factor binding domain protein (SIBD-1). SIBD-1 was proposed to act in the spider’s immune system. 
PMC3598806	5TnC	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	"The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). "	"Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied. "
PMC2928273	rs689470	Abstract	RefSNP	FAUX	Use	We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. 	For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10–3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09–2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09–10.49). 	Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31–0.96).

PMC5766183	3hqf	Discussion	PDBe	FAUX	Use	We show here that Type IIE enzymes UbaLAI and EcoRII use similar N-terminal effector domains specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ sequence. 	Despite the fact that UbaLAI-N and EcoRII-N domains share only 18% sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1C), their overall structures are very similar (Figure 4B): 134 of 173 residues of the EcoRII N-terminal domain (3hqf) could be aligned with UbaLAI-N with r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (DALI server (22)). 	"The loops of the N-arms adopt slightly different conformations in both domains; the C-arms overlay better, but the loop between the strands in the C-arm of UbaLAI-N is shorter (Supplementary Figure S6). Both domains make identical contacts with the central T0:A0 base pairs employing overlaying residues (Figure 4D and E, Supplementary Figure S6). "
PMC5519329	PF00096	Methods	Pfam	FAUX	Use	We then assessed significance empirically by comparing the value of this statistic to other C2H2 ZF genes from the same species (where possible). 	To this end, for each species with a PRDM9 ortholog, we downloaded the nucleotide and protein sequences for all available RefSeq genes with a C2H2 ZF motif annotated in Conserved Domain Database (pfam id# PF00096). 	To simplify alignment generation, we only used tandem ZF arrays with four or more ZFs matching the 28 amino acid long C2H2 motif (X2-CXXC-X12-HXXXH-X5 where X is any amino acid). In all of our analyses, if a gene had multiple tandem ZF arrays that were spatially separated, only the first array of four or more adjacent ZFs was used for the following analysis (Supplementary file 3B).

"	LbpB crosslinks were mapped onto an in silico homology based model of LbpB using Swiss-Model that was modelled against N. meningitidis TbpB [4] (PDB entry 3V8U) as a template. 	The LbpB model should be quite reliable for the core beta-barrel and handle structures but will be least reliable in the loop regions that harbour the clusters rich in aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues. TbpB crosslinks were mapped onto the crystal structure of TbpB from N. meningitidis strain B16B6 [17] as a control. 
PMC4564166	600838	Introduction	OMIM	FAUX	Use	WES was applied in search of de novo variants that might be causative of ASD in four family trios from Colombia. 	Two de novo non-synonymous mutations affecting ALDH1A3 (RefSeq NM_000693, MIM:600463) and FOXN1 (RefSeq NM_003593.2, MIM:600838) genes were uncovered in the same child (FAM07). 	"Recently, retinoic acid (RA) pathways mediated by Retinoid Orphan Receptor Alpha (RORA) have been implicated in ASD [17]. Furthermore, homozygous ALDH1A3 missense and nonsense mutations in humans have been linked to anophthalmia and microphthalmia (MIM: 615113; A/M) with some affected individuals also exhibiting autistic traits [18–23].

PMC5750462	1EA3	Discussion	PDBe	FAUX	Use	When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (Figures 1F and 2). 	When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. 
PMC4624855	3V2A	Results	PDBe	FAUX	Use	When compared to the starting model, MD simulation gave a better docking score for VEGFR1d2_R2d3 (Table 1). 	"The complex VEGFR1d2_R2d3/VEGFA was compared to X-ray structures of VEGFR2 bound to VEGFC and VEGFA (PDB: 2X1W and PDB: 3V2A, respectively; Supplementary Material, Figure S2). "	Rough energetic evaluation of predicted complexes, obtained with PyDock, is shown in Table 1. Notice that VEGFR1d2_R2d3/VEGFA was stabilized by electrostatic interaction energy compared to Fab-bevacizumab/VEGFA and ranibizumab/VEGFA complexes, which were rather characterized by stabilizing desolvation and VdW energy terms. 
PMC5393452	AY129241	Article	ENA	FAUX	Background	When mapped onto the medaka genome, 22 of these sex-specific RAD-tags were found to be on the Y chromosome (LG1) and 30 on unordered scaffolds, probably due to an incomplete assembly of the medaka Y chromosome. 	Among these sex-specific RAD-tag sequences, nine mapped to the Y non-recombinant sex-specific region (Gen-Bank ID: AP006153) including two sequences that were less than 1 kb downstream of the 5′ end of the dmrt1bY medaka sex-determining gene (GenBank ID: AY129241) [10]. 	These results clearly demonstrate that the RAD-Sex approach is highly efficient because it enabled the identification of sex-specific sequences located very close to the previously known SD gene even in a GWAS that does not allow a simultaneous genetic mapping of the RAD-tags. It should be noted, that our analysis, although conducted on a species with a sequenced genome, did not use the genome sequence for the analysis of sex-associated RAD-tags: the genome sequence only provided validation of the proof of principle. 
PMC5509858	2A79	Methods	PDBe	FAUX	Use	While this model provides a new template for understanding the effects of mutations in this region, it contains a pore domain in the closed state, and the molecular volume available for binding inside the pore is far too small to accommodate any of the common blockers. 	"Therefore, to study the potential interactions between the channel and hERG blockers, we used a previously developed and experimentally validated model of the hERG pore in the open state (Durdagi et al. 2012; Anwar‐Mohamed et al. 2014) based on the Kv1.2 X‐ray crystal structure (PDB ID 2A79), determined at 2.9 Å resolution (Model 2). "	It is important to stress that this previously published model of the hERG pore displays remarkable structural conservation with the published Eag1 structure for residues critical for drug binding (T623, S624, Y652 and F656), with major differences in the pore loop region far away from the common intra‐cavity binding site (Wang et al. 2016). To further refine both Model 1 and Model 2 of the hERG channel, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a protocol described below.

"	"Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. "
PMC5751318	1LSH	Discussion	PDBe	FAUX	Use	With regard to the presence of lipid droplets within the fibrinogen inclusions, we can assume that the overexposed hydrophobic patches of particular γ chain mutations can bind APOB molecules, since the latter protein is characterized by large hydrophobic regions that are normally used for the transport of lipids. 	These hydrophobic features are highlighted in Figure 2, showing the arrangement of fibrinogen α, β, and γ chains and the D–D interface of two gamma chains in the fragment D from the PDB structure 1FZB [22], and in Figure 3 showing a fibrinogen gamma monomer from the previous structure, the homology model of APOB [13], and the crystal structure of the lamprey lipovitellin (PDB 1LSH) [23] that is the closest homologue of APOB with known folding. 	γ chain mutants anomalously bound to APOB may serve as nucleation centers for the formation of hydrophobic clusters. Above a critical concentration, the latter coalesce into a lipid phase that becomes visible in the form of lipid droplets at both light and ultrastructural levels.

Advanced maternal age is the only well-documented risk factor for nondisjunction of chromosome 21.[1] In spite of high prevalence, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic nondisjunction are not yet understood, and much research have been done on factors that influence the rate of chromosome nondisjunction. The relationship between chromosomal nondisjunction and folate metabolism has drawn attention in the past decade.

Several rare causative genes (2–11) and 28 common risk alleles (12–16) have been confirmed for PD. The known genes and risk factors account for ∼5% of the heritability (17), hence much of the genetic component of PD is still missing.

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	FAUX	Use		In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3.

The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003].

PMC2173265	266900	Discussion	OMIM	False	Indeed, the Tg737 mutant mouse is defective in assembly of the primary cilia in the kidney, leading to polycystic kidney disease (Pazour et al., 2000). 	Thus, it is of interest that there is a longstanding connection in the literature between RP and polycystic kidney disease (see “266900 renal dysplasia and retinal aplasia” at the online Mendelian inheritance in man website, www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?266900). 	For example, both Senior-Loken and Jeune syndrome, which appear to be separate diseases, are characterized by retinal degeneration and cystic kidneys (Traboulsi et al., 1998). Tg737/IFT88 and other IFT components are likely candidates for causing these hereditary systemic disorders involving RP.

CG8479 (GenBank [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank], protein accession number: AAF58275) was identified as a Drosophila ortholog of hOPA1 (E = 0.0). 	To further characterize dOpa1, we used multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE) algorithm to perform amino acid sequence alignments of human OPA1 (hOPA1), mouse Opa1 (mOpa1), CG8479 (dOPA1), and Yeast Mgm1 (Figure S1). In all four organisms, the GTPase domain was the most conserved region and the basic domain was the least conserved region.

In order to further demonstrate that the glossy eye phenotype of dOPA1 mutant large clones arises as a result of excessive ROS generation by the mitochondria, we genetically tested if overexpression of human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1, GenBank Accession Number NM_000454) is able to reverse the glossy eye phenotype of dOPA1 mutant large clones. 	As shown in Figure S6, the overexpression of hSOD1 in the Drosophila eye was achieved using a UAS/Gal4 system as previously described [39]. Figure 8A shows that expression of hSOD1 in the Drosophila eye resulted in a significant reduction of glossy eye phenotypes of dOPA1 mutant large clones (Right) in comparison to dOPA1 mutant large clone controls without the UAS-hSOD1 transgene (Left). The reversal of the rough eye phenotype of dOPA1 mutant large clones was not observed.

PMC2585009	P55957	Results	UniProt	False	In contrast to lymphocytes, macrophages exposed to HIV-1 are relatively resistant to apoptosis [39], [40], which led us to expect that macrophages would display an anti-apoptotic transcriptome and proteome response to virus. 	Surprisingly, within 2 days, when the greatest response to virus occurred, multiple pro-apoptotic factors, including BID (Swiss-Prot ID: P55957), PAK2 (Entrez Gene ID: 5062), and ASK1 (Entrez Gene ID: 4217), displayed increased expression, while anti-apoptotic factors, such as BCL2 (Entrez Gene ID: 596), were decreased in expression (Fig. 3B). 	Although relative levels of NF-κB and NEMO (Entrez Gene ID: 8517) increased in response to virus, both are molecular hubs that serve as signaling partners in other pathways, including MAPK and TLRs. Over the course of viral replication, relative expression of pro-apoptotic genes declined and anti-apoptotic genes increased (Fig. 3C). 
PMC2585009	Q92934	Results	UniProt	False	Over the course of viral replication, relative expression of pro-apoptotic genes declined and anti-apoptotic genes increased (Fig. 3C). 	The transcriptome response was extended by analysis of the intracellular proteome compartment that also displayed increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAD (Swiss-Prot ID: Q92934), APAF-1 (Swiss-Prot ID: O14727), and Caspase-7 (Swiss-Prot ID: P55210), within 2 days of viral treatment, while anti-apoptotic proteins, such as CDC42GAP (Swiss-Prot ID: Q07960), showed lower expression levels on day 2 compared to mock (Fig. 3D). 	Results indicate the dynamic temporal response by macrophages to HIV-1. 
PMC2585009	P45983	Results	UniProt	False	Virus alters macrophage molecular program independent of cell proliferation 	Calcium, apoptosis, and MAPK pathways interface through molecular hubs, such as NF-κB, NEMO, PRKCG, JNK (Swiss-Prot ID: P45983), and YWHAE (Swiss-Prot ID: P62258), with multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and TLR. 	Yet, in contrast to calcium, apoptosis, and MAPK pathways, neither cell proliferation nor TLR pathways was identified as significantly altered by Pathway-Express analysis. Although HIV-1 is capable of crossing the nuclear envelope of terminally differentiated cells without a requirement for proliferation [44], [45], some groups report a portion of macrophages proliferating in vitro and have an enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [46], [47]. 
PMC2585009	P38936	Results	UniProt	False	Although HIV-1 is capable of crossing the nuclear envelope of terminally differentiated cells without a requirement for proliferation [44], [45], some groups report a portion of macrophages proliferating in vitro and have an enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [46], [47]. 	In contrast, other groups find that HIV-1 treatment increases the expression of CDK inhibitors, specifically CDKN1A (also known as p21Cip1/WAF1, Swiss-Prot ID: P38936), and other targets in the cell cycle important for efficient viral replication [13], [48]. 	To determine if HIV-1 interactions with macrophages are accompanied by macrophage proliferation in our studies, two approaches were used. HIV-1- or mock-treated macrophages labeled with propidium iodide showed no differences in DNA content over 10 days (data not shown). 
PMC2585009	Q13163	Results	UniProt	False	Only five displayed increased expression. 	Increased expression of IRF-3 (Enrez Gene ID: 3661) was detected in only one of three macrophage donors, while NF-κB, NEMO, MAP2K5 (Swiss-Prot ID: Q13163), and p38 (Swiss-Prot ID: Q16539) function as molecular hubs in multiple signaling pathways and are not restricted to TLR pathways. 	
PMC2585009	P01375	Results	UniProt	False	TLR signaling is transmitted through a MyD88-dependent and/or, depending on the TLR, a MyD88-independent pathway (Fig. 7). 	Both pathways result in production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as type I interferons and TNF (Swiss-Prot ID: P01375) [50]. 	To determine if proximal signaling molecules respond to virus, we evaluated phosphorylation of TLR signaling members, IRAK-1 (specific for the MyD88-dependent pathway, Swiss-Prot ID: P51617) and IRF-3 (member of both pathways). Treatment of macrophages with TLR agonists LPS (primarily TLR4 agonist) or Poly(I:C) (primarily TLR3 agonist) produced phosphorylated forms of IRAK-1 within 30 minutes or IRF-3 within one hour (Fig. 8A–F).

PMC2585009	P20591	Results	UniProt	False	The relatively limited proportion of macrophages infected by HIV-1 within the first 24 hours could limit detection by western blot of phosphorylated/activated IRAK-1 or IRF3. 	To address this issue, levels of Mx1 protein (Swiss-Prot ID: P20591) were measured. 	Mx1 (Swiss-Prot ID: P20591), an antiviral interferon-stimulated gene, is a relatively stable, sensitive marker for low levels of interferon and innate immune activation [51]. Although treatment of macrophages through multiple TLRs 4, 3, or 8 for 24 hours stimulated increased intracellular levels of the Mx1 protein, treatment by HIV-1 induced no expression of Mx1 protein (Fig. 9). 
PMC2585009	P20591	Results	UniProt	False	To address this issue, levels of Mx1 protein (Swiss-Prot ID: P20591) were measured.

Although treatment of macrophages through multiple TLRs 4, 3, or 8 for 24 hours stimulated increased intracellular levels of the Mx1 protein, treatment by HIV-1 induced no expression of Mx1 protein (Fig. 9). Although macrophages recognize and respond to TLR agonists via MyD88-dependent or independent pathways, HIV-1 has no apparent impact on targets downstream in TLR signaling through either pathway. 
PMC2585009	P01584	Results	UniProt	False	Macrophages were treated for 24 hours with any one of a variety of TLR ligands, including LPS, Poly(I:C), and CL097 (TLR7/8 agonist), as well as CL075 (TLR8 agonist) or R837 (TLR7 agonist) to distinguish differences that might result from selective activation through individual TLRs. 	Overall, each agonist stimulated production of TNF, IL-1β (Swiss-Prot ID: P01584), and IL-6 (Swiss Prot ID: P05231) (Fig. 11A–C, gray bars). 	In contrast, no proinflammatory cytokines were detected with HIV-1 treatment alone. Yet, when HIV-1 infected macrophage cultures were treated with TLR agonists, increased levels of cytokines were produced (Fig. 11A–C, black bars). 
PMC2585009	GSE13395	Methods	GEO	False	Signal intensity values from microarrays were normalized and converted to fold-change values as previously described [13]. 	GeneChip information was submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus at the NCBI (GEO: GSE13395). 	
PMC2631639	1ubq	Article	PDBe	False	No correlation was detected between higher solvent content and ease of phasing (Fig. 2 ▶ a). 	For example, the benchmark includes four diffraction data sets for ubiquitin, in which the same pool of Rosetta models was tested for phasing, and the data set with the lowest solvent content (PDB code 1ubq) was the only one for which a de novo model gave a successful Phaser solution. 	Further, there was no correlation of ease of phasing with the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2 ▶ b); as noted above, use of the next-generation Phaser may in fact soon further ease the confident and rapid phasing of crystals with multi-copy asymmetric units. Of the other parameters tested (Table 2 ▶), only one, the molecular weight of the monomer, gave a statistically significant correlation (P < 10−1) with minimal F 1 Å values (Fig. 2 ▶ c). 
PMC2637985	GSE12502	Results	GEO	False	After eliminating probe sets that represented unannotated genes and correcting for multiple probe sets that represented the same gene, 262 genes were differentially expressed due to age, whereas 22 genes were differentially expressed due to diet. 	All microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository at the National Center for Biotechnology Information archives (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession #GSE12502. 	The heat map in Figure 1 clearly demonstrates the strong and consistent effect of age, but also highlights some inconsistencies, particularly in geriatric dogs fed the APB diet. Although age was the primary factor by which dogs were clustered, dogs also clustered according to diet within age groups.

PMC2652109	1pg1	Methods	PDBe	False		The initial structure of PG-1 was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (pdb ids: 1pg1). 	These experimental structures were originally acquired from multiple samples analyzed using two-dimensional homonuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at a peptide molar concentration of 2.0–4.0 mM dissolved in water or 10 mM sodium phosphate solution [36]. The ultimate structure investigated in the current study was extracted from the last snapshot of our previous 24 ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation [15].

We utilized vertebrate-specific profiles of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the TRANSFAC Professional database 11.3 (10 September 2007). We searched for putative TFBSs in the promoter sequences of five TRCSMs in mouse, rat, and human using the MATCH program (version 10.4) [22], with the option of minimizing the number of the error rates of false positives and false negatives.

PMC2777427	309550	Introduction	OMIM	False		The fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (1,2) [OMIM + 309550] codes for an RNA-binding protein (FMRP) that plays an important role in neurodevelopment through its regulatory functions in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. 	The 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of the FMR1 gene harbors a variable-length trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element that, when expanded into the premutation range (55–200 CGG repeats), is known to both up-regulate transcription and inhibit translation (3–10). For larger expansions (> 200 CGG repeats; full mutation range), the promoter region of the gene generally becomes hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced, with loss of FMRP resulting in the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (11,12), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment and the leading known disorder associated with autism. 
PMC2788617	NM_016931.2	Results	RefSeq	False	PCR reactions containing cDNAs prepared from cultures of stromal cells produced the appropriate products from primers for NOX1, NOX4, and NOX5 (Figure 3A-C). 	RT PCR using NOX4 primers amplified a region of the NOX4 coding sequence, including bp 1686 to 1855, which was 98.0% identical to that originally discovered in cells from the kidney, NM_016931.2 [14]. 	The NOX5 RT PCR product was 99.0% identical to a region encoding a portion of the EF hand /Ca binding region of the NOX5 from human testes NM_024505 [29]. Western blots using antibodies to NOX1, NOX4, and NOX5 confirmed that these NOX proteins were expressed in HCS fibroblasts (Figure 4A-C).

NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) accession numbers are AE008683-AE008686 for the mouse V region and M64239 for the J region. 	Positions of each V and J genes were calculated based on these data as previously described [6]. 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Introduction	PDBe	False	Pak2 has 93% homology in the catalytic domain. 	Both the inactive (1F3M.PDB) and active conformations (1YHV.PDB) of Pak1 were utilized for analysis of Pak2 [14], [21]. 	The inactive conformation (1F3M.PDB) illustrates a catalytic domain with a disordered activation loop, hydrogen bonding between the Lys138 (Lys141 for Pak1) to the catalytic residue Asp368 (Asp389 for Pak1), and hydrophobic interactions between the AID and the catalytic domain [14]. The active conformation of Pak1, containing only the catalytic domain, shows a conformational change in the activation loop as compared to the inactive conformation [21]. 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Methods	PDBe	False	The structural overlay and graphs were generated by the Swiss-Pdb Viewer [32]. 	The protein structures used to calculate the distances between residues included 1YHV.PDB (Active Pak1) [21], 1F3M.PDB (Inactive Pak1) [14], 1ATP.PDB (PKA) [24] and 2SRC.PDB (Src) [26]. 	
PMC2830475	1YHV	Results	PDBe	True	Residue numbers are those for Pak2. 	(b) The evolutionary conservation values were normalized to percentage and mapped on the tertiary structure of Pak1 (1YHV.PDB), which is highly homologous to Pak2. 	The levels of ΔE are shown in the color index. The secondary structures, α-helices A-J and β-sheets 1–9, are identified in (b). 
PMC2830475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	True	(b) The histogram represents the statistical coupling energy (ΔΔE) of the catalytic subunit domain of PKA (residues 43 to 297) perturbed by Thr197 in the activation loop. 	The results are superimposed on the x-ray crystal structure of PKA (1ATP.PDB). 	The color chart is the same as Figure 2. The phosphorylation site Thr197 (blue), the major coupled residues Cys199 and Trp222 (ΔΔE>3.0, red), and the secondary coupled residues (ΔΔE between 3.0 and 2.6, orange) are identified. 
PMC2830475	2SRC	Results	PDBe	True	(c) The histogram represents the statistical coupling energy (ΔΔE) of the Src catalytic domain (residues 267 to 515) perturbed by Tyr416 in the activation loop. 	The statistical coupling residues of Src are shown on the tertiary structure (2SRC.PDB). 	The phosphorylation site Tyr416 (blue), the center of the coupled residues Trp428 (ΔΔE = 12.06, red), and the secondary coupled residues (ΔΔE between 12.0 and 7.6, green) are identified. 
PMC2830475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	False	The average of ΔΔEi,197T for all residues of PKA was 0.83, and the average of ΔΔEi,416Y for Src was 2.31. 	The results with Thr197(PKA) in PKA showed a similar pattern of affected residues as Pak2, as visualized in the structure of PKA (1ATP.PDB) (Figure 3b). 	Cys199(PKA) (ΔΔE199C,197T = 4.45) of PKA was two residues away from the phosphorylation site Thr197, which is the same as Val404 and Thr402 in Pak2. Tyr416 (Src) in the activation loop of Src resulted in similar coupling residues in Pak2. 
PMC2830475	2SRC	Results	PDBe	False	Tyr416 (Src) in the activation loop of Src resulted in similar coupling residues in Pak2. 	These residues were superimposed to the structure of Src (2SRC.PDB) (Figure 3c). 	Trp428(Src) (Trp409 in Pak2) in the peptide positioning loop was the most impacted residue by Tyr416(Src) perturbation (ΔΔE428W,416Y = 12.06), different from Pak2 and PKA. Reciprocal Coupling Analysis of Pak2 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Results	PDBe	False	The generated map of the reciprocal coupling pairs was symmetrical along the diagonal. 	The nine reciprocal coupling pairs of Pak2 were positioned on the structure for Pak1 (1YHV.PDB) (Figure 5a,b). 	Among the nine pairs, three had residues that interacted with each other or were within the contact distance. Asn373- Asp386 (Pair 2), Glu413- Arg488 (Pair 4) and Glu324- Lys383 (Pair 8) were within 3.6 Å (Table 2). 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Results	PDBe	True	Visualization of the reciprocal coupling pairs for Pak2, PKA and Src. 	(a) Four common reciprocal coupling pairs for Pak2 were superimposed on the Pak1 structure (1YHV.PDB) (see Table 1). 	(b) Five specific reciprocal coupling pairs were superimposed on the same structure. (c) Four specific reciprocal coupling pairs for PKA were identified on the PKA structure (1ATP.PDB). 
PMC2830475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	True	(b) Five specific reciprocal coupling pairs were superimposed on the same structure. 	(c) Four specific reciprocal coupling pairs for PKA were identified on the PKA structure (1ATP.PDB). 	(d) Two specific reciprocal coupling pairs in Src were shown on 2SRC.PDB. The same color was used when two residues were reciprocally coupled. 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Results	PDBe	False	The peptide positioning loop is anchored by the coupling of Glu413-Arg488 to the H-helix. 	The specific coupling pairs for Pak2, PKA and Src are shown in the crystal structures (1YHV.PDB, 1ATP.PDB and 2SRC.PDB respectively) (Figure 5b, c, d). 	The specific reciprocal coupling pairs included both distant pairs and proximal pairs. The distances between the specific evolutionary coupling pairs in Pak2 were from 3.2 Å to 25.3 Å and with the average of 11.8 Å. The average distances of the specific coupling pairs are 13.1 Å for PKA and 5.6 Å for Src (Table 2). 
PMC2830475	1YHV	Results	PDBe	True	Two fragments (light gray bars), m/z 1476 and 1579, containing Thr402 disappeared after phosphorylation. 	(b) The differences in solvent accessibility are shown on crystal structure of Pak1 (1YHV.PDB). 	Residues, Trp427 (red) and Gly439 (orange), were statistically coupled to Thr402 (blue). Trp427 and Gly439 were in the fragments m/z 1532 and 1828 that had increased solvent accessibility after autophosphorylation. 
PMC2830475	1F3M	Discussion	PDBe	True	(b) The structure turned 120 degrees counterclockwise from (a) shows the reciprocal coupled ion pair in the hinge region. 	(c) The catalytic domain of Pak (green) binding to the AID (yellow) modified from 1F3M.PDB. 	(d) PKA (green) bound to PKI (yellow) modified from 1ATP.PDB. 
PMC2830475	1ATP	Results	PDBe	False	In the inactive Pak1 conformation (1F3M.PDB), Asn373 and Asp386 (Pair 2) are solvent exposed. 	These two residues are coordinated with manganese ions in the PKA structure (1ATP.PDB). 	In our previous H/D exchange experiments, we found that AID binding to Pak2 does not block coordination of the magnesium ions to Pair 2 [23]. A comparison of Figure 7c to Figure 7a indicates the AID blocks Pair 1, while Pairs 2, 3, 6 and 9 are still solvent exposed. 
PMC2830475	1F3M	Discussion	PDBe	False	This solvent exposed pair connects the linker region of the bi-lobal structure with the magnesium positioning loop [14], [21], [26]. 	The two lobes of the active conformation (1YHV.PDB) are closer than the inactive conformation (1F3M.PDB) of Pak1. 	The active conformation has a 15 degree rotation of the bilobal structure, compared to the inactive conformation [21]. When we examined Pair 8 in both structures, the hydrogen bonds between Glu324 and Lys383 were twisted in the inactive conformation.

Upon release of the genomic sequence of the C. crescentus laboratory strain CB15N (also known as NA1000; GeneBank accession CP001340, RefSeq NC_011916), which includes an updated ORF prediction and gene annotation [75], all results were mapped to this new annotation. 	Supplementary tables include gene IDs corresponding to both genomes nomenclatures. To generate and process diverse gene lists from the microarrays and proteomics results, a Pathways and Genome Database (PGDB) was built using the PathoLogic and Pathway/Genomes Editor software, in the Pathway Tools platform [76]. 
PMC3073932	GSE25996	Methods	GEO	False	The RMA statistical algorithm [77], available under the Bioconductor software package of R, was used for background noise removal, normalization and summarization of microarray data corresponding to two independent experiments for each condition (cells starved for carbon for 30 and 60 min, and the respective controls). 	All data are MIAME compliant, and raw and normalized data files were submitted to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE25996). 	A Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [78] was applied to the dataset, with the following parameters: unpaired, logged, median centered, T statistic. A 2-fold minimum change was selected as cutoff, and a delta value yielding a false discovery rate lower than 1%. 
PMC3073932	GSE25997	Methods	GEO	False	Microarray data were normalized and summarized as described in the previous section. 	All data are MIAME compliant and raw and normalized data has been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, with accession number GSE25997). 	For each one of the 3767 genes analyzed, we created a profile vector composed of two values: i) log-ratio between expression values measured for swarmer cells after 15 minutes of carbon starvation and the non-starved control, ii) log-ratio between expression values for stalked cells after 15 minutes of carbon starvation and non-starved control. The non-starved controls values were obtained by linearly interpolating the data from [25], at the corresponding time-points (15 minutes into the cell cycle, as a control for swarmer cells, and 75 minutes for stalked cells). 
PMC3073932	GSE25998	Methods	GEO	False	The RMA statistical algorithm [77], available under the Bioconductor software package of R, was used for background noise removal, normalization and summarization of the microarray data. 	All data are MIAME compliant, and raw and normalized data files were submitted to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE25998). 	For each gene i, we calculated the difference between sample means and a two-sample t statistic. For each gene and each condition (ΔsigT, ΔsigU and wild-type strains starved for glucose for 15 minutes), we then calculated a p-value derived from the gene-specific t-statistic, as well as the empirical distribution derived from the t-statistics of all genes. 
PMC3097082	FN594698	Methods	ENA	False	Sequences from the chloroplast intergenic spacers trnL-trnF and trnS-trnG, were truncated in conserved regions of the 5' and 3' ends of the sequences and concatenated into a single matrix. 	Parts of the aligned matrix (corresponding to position 599-671 in sequence FN594698 from P. thuringiaca) around the internal primers were excluded due to sequencing problems of this region. 	The nuclear markers ITS and ETS were concatenated into a single matrix and truncated in both ends of the respective regions.

PMC3098484	E-TABM-1141	Methods	ArrayExpress	False	Products were applied to Nimblegen tiling arrays (ArrayExpress accession: A-MEXP-1949) according to the manufacturer's specifications except for the data shown in Figures 1C and 4 where Affymetrix PN 520055 arrays were used and processed according to Badis et al (2008). 	Data from hybridisations used in this study has been submitted to ArrayExpress; Accession numbers: E-TABM-1141, E-MEXP-3163. 	For the nucleosome analysis, the raw data from Affymetrix GCOS software (.CEL format) were analysed with Affymetrix Tiling Analysis Software v1.1. A tiling analysis group (.TAG file) for a two-sample analysis containing the three nucleosomal experiments as the ‘treatment' and the three whole-genome samples as the ‘control' was created in the Tiling Analysis Software. 
PMC3111233	GO:0043198	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	The all terms in GO Biological process section is related to developmental process. 	One term of Cellular components (GO:0014704) mediate mechanical and electrochemical integration between cardiomyocytes and the rest of the five (GO:0043198, GO:0030425, GO:0043025, GO:0015629, and GO:0043005) have an association with the neuron. 	In the molecular function category, three terms (GO:0004843, GO:0031625, and GO:0004221) are related to the ubiquitin system, two (GO:00042054 and GO:00003682) are associated with chromatin. Ubiquitins are known to be involved not only with protein degeneration but also with signal transduction, chromatin modification, and cell cycle.

Tow KEGG pathways (hsa04340 and hsa04310) in Table 3 are developmental signalling pathways, hsa04120 is related to the ubiquitin system, and hsa04360 is involved in axon guidance, which well corresponds with the GO and Interpro terms. Table 4 shows the terms that are significantly scarce in SCCS genes. 
PMC3125170	JN086998	Methods	ENA	False	Following electrophoresis, products were imaged on a 1.5% agarose gel, isolated, and sequenced from both ends. 	The complete HBoV3-Episome (HBoV3-E1) genome was submitted to Genbank under accession number JN086998. 	A detailed protocol of the techniques used to detect the HBoV host chromosome-integrated form (HBoV-INT) can be found in our recent publication on the discovery of mammalian endogenous parvoviruses [37]. Briefly, to detect the genome-integrated form, we used the same nested PCR assays described above, except that the template for the first round of inverse PCR used restriction enzyme digested- and re-circularized host genomic DNA. 
PMC3125170	EU262978	Methods	ENA	False	To determine the sequence relationship of HBoV3-E1 and HBoV3-IB1 with other known HBoV species, at least one representative virus, including the one with the best-characterized genome, was used to generate the nucleotide sequence alignments of the entire coding region (NS, NP and VP gene). 	We used the following Genbank sequences in the analysis: EU262978, FJ858259, AB481085, EF450727, AB481077, FJ560720 for HBoV1; FJ170279, EU082213, GQ200737, GU048664, GU048662, EU082214, GU048663, FJ170280, FJ170278 for HBoV2; EU918736, HM132056, FJ948861, GU048665, FJ973562, GQ867667, GQ867666, FJ973563 for HBoV3; and FJ973561 for HBoV4. 	The model test implemented in the phylogenetic program MEGA 5 [38] showed that the nucleotide substitution pattern among variable sites of different HBoV sequences can be best analyzed using a General Time Reversible (GTR) model with a discrete Gamma distribution (+G) of 5 rate categories. We constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and then performed bootstrap re-sampling to demonstrate robustness of phylogenetic groupings [38]. 
PMC3125170	FJ214110	Methods	ENA	False	We constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and then performed bootstrap re-sampling to demonstrate robustness of phylogenetic groupings [38]. 	Modeling of the secondary structure of the non-coding DNA sequence region (NCR) between the VP and NS genes in HBoV3-E1 and MVC (FJ214110) was done using a standard minimum energy folding algorithm for single-stranded nucleic acids implemented in the “mfold” web server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/DNA-Folding-Form) [39]. 	For better comparison with the HBoV3-E1 NCR, the secondary structure of the complete MVC NCR was determined after circularizing the linear MVC genome in 5′ to 3′ orientation. Comparative secondary structure analysis of the right-hand termini of different HBoV species was done using HBoV3-E1 and the most complete genomic terminal sequences available in Genbank for HBoV1 (GQ925675) and HBoV2 (GQ200737) [40]. 
PMC3125170	GQ925675	Methods	ENA	False	For better comparison with the HBoV3-E1 NCR, the secondary structure of the complete MVC NCR was determined after circularizing the linear MVC genome in 5′ to 3′ orientation. 	Comparative secondary structure analysis of the right-hand termini of different HBoV species was done using HBoV3-E1 and the most complete genomic terminal sequences available in Genbank for HBoV1 (GQ925675) and HBoV2 (GQ200737) [40]. 	
PMC3125170	GU048662	Results	ENA	False	These results were confirmed using PCR targeting other regions of the viral genome (NS and NP) [4]. 	The complete genome of the HBoV2 variant found in one child's biopsy tissues showed >97% nucleotide identity to HBoV2 viruses recently identified in China and Thailand (Genbank accession no. GU048662-3 and GU301644, respectively) (Fig. 1). 	Similarly, the HBoV3 found in these tissues showed <1–2% nucleotide divergence from published HBoV3 genomes found in Australia, Nigeria and Thailand (Fig. 1). Sequence comparison of HBoV3 viruses found in other children also showed <1% nucleotide divergence over the entire genomic coding region (NS, NP and VP gene). 
PMC3125170	JN086998	Results	ENA	False	Because we detected the HBoV-EPI form in only 1 sample, we re-extended and re-sequenced the complete HBoV3-E1 genome using the inverse PCR fragment as a starting point for genomic analysis. 	Every base of the complete HBoV3-E1 genome was sequenced at least 3 times (Genbank accession no. JN086998). 	The PCR product chromatograms were consistent with infection by a single HBoV lineage. However, mixed HBoV infection cannot be ruled out as population sequencing only allows detection of a minority of variants comprising >10% of the total sequences. 
PMC3140961	P29353	Results	UniProt	False	In addition to being enriched for the seed term, Figure 4A, this ‘robust’ cluster is also enriched for GO:BP term “positive regulation of DNA” proliferation. 	This group is composed of multiple phosphopeptides from SHC1 (Swissprot P29353), an adaptor protein recruited to the EGFR in response to EGF and upstream of the MAPK cascade. 	Additionally, it includes the activation sites of MAPK1 (ERK2, Swissprot Q1HBJ4) and MAPK3 (ERK1, Swissprot Q7Z3H5) and a phosphorylation on a relatively poorly characterized protein, FAM59A (Swissprot Q9H706). A recent study showed FAM59A acts in the MAPK pathway in response to EGF stimulation by binding to Grb2 in a manner that is dependent on the phosphorylation of Y453 [27]. 
PMC3140961	Q1HBJ4	Results	UniProt	False	This group is composed of multiple phosphopeptides from SHC1 (Swissprot P29353), an adaptor protein recruited to the EGFR in response to EGF and upstream of the MAPK cascade.

A recent study showed FAM59A acts in the MAPK pathway in response to EGF stimulation by binding to Grb2 in a manner that is dependent on the phosphorylation of Y453 [27]. The group associated with the cellular compartment “lamellipodium” is composed of only three phosphopeptides from the proteins cortactin (CTTN, Swissprot Q14247), paxillin (PXN, Swissprot P49023), and ENO1 (Swissprot Q96GV1), an enolase. 
PMC3140961	Q14247	Results	UniProt	False	A recent study showed FAM59A acts in the MAPK pathway in response to EGF stimulation by binding to Grb2 in a manner that is dependent on the phosphorylation of Y453 [27].

Paxillin and cortactin are both labeled as being localized in lamellipodium, however, ENO1, at least in full length is currently thought to be only cytoplasmic. This robust “lamellipodium” cluster also has enrichment for two sequence motifs, E.E.VyS, which is shared in both PXN and CTTN and G....Oy (O indicates a degenerate search for hydrophobic amino acids and ‘.’ for any amino acid), common to ENO1 and CTTN. 
PMC3140961	P40763	Results	UniProt	False	We found no particular relationship between the parameters of clustering and the production of infrequently, or highly frequently, occurring phosphopeptide clustering. 	The most robust relationship seen is STAT3 Y705 (isoform 1, Swissprot P40763) phosphorylation with STAT3 Y704 (isoform 2, Refseq NP_003141) phosphorylation, co-clustering all but two times. 	This variability highlights the importance of considering more than a single clustering solution when deriving hypotheses for further testing. We have illustrated only a few examples of a large number of possibilities to demonstrate the power of MCAM in deriving biologically meaningful hypotheses. 
PMC3140961	P00533	Results	UniProt	False	In this comparison, we noticed two sites on SHC1 experience very different phenomena. 	In the case of parental EGF treatment, both sites co-cluster robustly with each other and with phosphorylation on EGFR pY1172 and pY1197 (Swissprot P00533), both known to bind SHC1. 	However, EGF treatment of HER2 overexpressing cells indicates that although pY427 continues to robustly co-cluster with those sites on EGFR, SHC1 pY349 does not, and instead most robustly co-clusters with catenin delta-1, CTTND1 (Swissprot O60716), phosphorylation of Y228. Dynamics of these sites, and their most robustly co-clustered partners, under both conditions are shown in Figure 5.

Dynamics of these sites, and their most robustly co-clustered partners, under both conditions are shown in Figure 5. We also observe large differences in the co-clustering of multiple sites on p130Cas, also known as BCAR1 (Swissprot P56945), between the two cell lines in response to EGF treatment and an extreme change in the association of ENO1 pY44 with annexin A2 (ANXA2, Swissprot P07355) phosphorylation on Y238, where ENO1 Y44 phosphorylation associates with ANXA2 phosphorylation in parental but not HER2 overexpressing cells.

The largest number of differences is observed when comparing the EGF treatment of parental cells to the 24H cell lines treated with HRG, which also has the lowest correlation of any dynamic subset comparison. Both pieces of evidence point to maximum differences in signaling dynamics when both HER2 expression levels and the stimulating ligands are altered. 
PMC3140961	Q9Y2X7	Results	UniProt	False	Although the best agreement the EGF4 MCAM results have is with the parental EGF treatment of the HER2 MCAM results, there is less than ideal correlation. 	We looked to see if there were any serious disagreements by using the same ‘co-cluster swap’ method as mentioned above and found there were only two such instances, which highlight very different measurements made on GIT1 (Swissprot Q9Y2X7) pY545 and EFNB2 (Swissprot P52799) pY304 in HMEC cells in response to EGF treatment, Supplementary Table S4. 	Interestingly, though these measurements are quite different, the extreme differences of co-occurrences with other phosphopeptides are only highlighted in two cases, both with regards to Ephrin family phosphorylation sites that are relatively similar in the two datasets, GIT1 pY545 with EPHB1 (Swissprot P54762) pY600 and EFNB2 pY304 with EPHA2 pY772 (Swissprot Q96HF4). This indicates that the MCAM co-occurrence matrix is a precise way to identify similarities and discrepancies between independent measurements of a system.

This indicates that the MCAM co-occurrence matrix is a precise way to identify similarities and discrepancies between independent measurements of a system. Since this methodology relies on comparing the relationships between measurements within a dataset and then comparing this abstracted metric across datasets, one could imagine that the measurement scheme would not need to be the same between the two datasets of interest. 
PMC3145266	ABO15549	Article	ENA	False	This loss is likely due do the complete loss of the GLO gene because BLAST searches cannot identify GLO gene sequences in any of the completely sequenced teleost fish genomes [28]. 	These negative results are likely significant because BLAST searches using a chicken GLO protein sequence (GenBank accession number XP_001234314) as a query readily finds numerous GLO protein sequences, including that of the sturgeon species Acipenser transmontanus (GenBank accession number ABO15549, which is 74% identical to that of chicken) and even that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (GenBank accession number XP_ 002122023, which is 48% identical to that of chicken). 	Given the high degree of conservation of this gene, the fact that GLO orthologues cannot be identified from the currently available teleost genomes is likely the result of the fact that this non-functional gene has mutated beyond recognition or that it has been deleted from teleost genomes altogether. Furthermore, the gene coding for gulonolactonase, the penultimate enzyme in vitamin C synthesis (Fig. 1), is readily identified in BLAST searches using the human protein as a query (GenBank accession number EAL24133) in teleost genomes such as that of the zebra fish Danio rerio (GenBank accession number AAI52248), the salmon Salmo salar (GenBank accession number ACI69713) and the European flounder Platichthys flesus (GenBank accession number ACI69713), among others.

Again, this suggests that the fact that GLO gene sequences cannot be found in any of the completely sequenced teleost fish genomes is due to their absence from these genomes and not to the methods that are used to find them. VITAMIN C LOSS IN ANTHROPOID PRIMATES AND GUINEA PIGS 
PMC3145266	HQ415789	Article	ENA	False	Since they did not detect GLO activity in any of these species, they concluded that all bats lacked the ability to synthesize vitamin C (Fig. 3). 	However, Cui et al. [38] recently sequenced GLO cDNAs from the bats Rousettus leschenaultia (a Megachiroptera species, GenBank accession number HQ415789) and Hipposideros armiger (a Microchiroptera species, GenBank accession number HQ415790) and showed these genes produced functional GLO proteins in both species. 	However, their expression levels were 6-fold and 4-fold less than those of mice, in R. leschenaultia and H. armiger, respectively. Note that the GLO activity in these two species had not been assessed previously [37].

PMC3161075	IPR012336	Results	InterPro	False	Three of them are related with heat shock protein 70 (IPR001023, IPR013126 and IPR018181), the members of which respond to environmental stresses and may be secreted to manipulate host's immune response in schistosomiasis [14]. 	Two domain are associated with thioredoxin (IPR017936 and IPR012336), whose member such as thioredoxin glutathione reductase was identified as protective antigen and drug target in Schistosomes [15], [16], [17]. 	Besides, other domains such as Dynein light chain (IPR001372) and calcium-binding site (IPR018247 and IPR002048) were also found significant in SjSPs. It has been reported that some proteins similar with dynein light chain are expressed in tegument and act as antigens in Schistosomes [18], [19], and the calcium-binding proteins were found to be secreted and function in host-parasite interactions in Schistosomes [20], [21].

PMC3161075	GO:0043648	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Among them, 23 are terms of biological processes; 14 are terms of cellular component and 18 are terms of molecular function. 	In the terms of biological process, most are associated with metabolic and physiological process such as DNA metabolic process (GO:0006259), dicarboxylic acid metabolic process (GO:0043648) and protein metabolic process (GO:0019538). 	Other terms are associated with regulation, development or stress response including regulation of growth rate (GO:0040009), negative regulation of apoptosis (GO:0043066), response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and response to stress (GO:0006950) and so on. After penetrating host, S.japonicum will transfer to schistosomula, and then develop into a mature stage and ultimately produce eggs.

After penetrating host, S.japonicum will transfer to schistosomula, and then develop into a mature stage and ultimately produce eggs. SjSPs related to metabolism, regulation and development may be important in schistosoma's maturation and response to host immune system. 
PMC3161075	ACA62791	Results	ENA	False	For example, glutathione S-transferase (CAX72404.1) can stimulate anti-fecundity immunity [24]. Thioredoxin peroxidase (|CAX75864.1), an egg secretory product and antioxidant enzyme, is necessary for schistosome to escape oxidative damage from host immune system [25], [26]. 	Another important protein is paramyosin (ACA62791.1) which is released by schistosome cercariae while penetrating human skin. 	It may function in immune evasion and immune response during infection [27], [28]. Furthermore, tetraspanin (CAX70119.1) expresses in the tegument and functions in the host immune response and invasion. 
PMC3161075	CAX77287	Results	ENA	False	Furthermore, tetraspanin (CAX70119.1) expresses in the tegument and functions in the host immune response and invasion. 	It was suggested that tetraspanin might interact with host ligand such as MHC and was considered as a candidate vaccine for schistosome [29], [30]. Fatty acid binding protein 7 (CAX77287.1) is secreted by adult S.japonicum and plays an important role in the uptake and transport of host-derived fatty acids for the schistosomes lacking the system of fatty acids synthesis [10]. 	In addition, superoxide dismutase (CAX71766.1) is also reported as ES protein [21]. All these facts suggest the accuracy of our SVM classifier. 
PMC3161075	AAX30806	Results	ENA	False	In our analysis, 7 interactions between 4 ES proteins of S.japonicum and 7 human immune proteins were identified following the pipeline described in Methods (Table S9 and Fig. 8). 	Among the 4 ES proteins, SJCHGC07797 protein (AAX30806.1)has the largest number of interacting partners (4 proteins, Fig. 8). 	One of the partners, called neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), is involve in the expansion of T cells and dendritic cells which play an important role in immune surveillance in human. Neural cell adhesion molecule was found to be upregulated in Chagas' disease myocarditis which caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) parasite and considered as a receptor for tissue targeting and cellular invasion by T. cruzi in Chagas' disease [31]. Another partner named platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta precursor (Pdgfrb) was upregulated in liver of human infected by Clonorchis sinensis [32].

PMC3200340	HM769132	Results	ENA	False	36 unique COI haplotypes were recovered from 75 samples. 	All haplotypes were compared to the existing database of haplotypes as calculated for a larger set of Lake Victoria Biomphalaria sequences (GenBank accession numbers HM769132.1-HM769258.1) and matched accordingly. 	For the COI sequences, the mean corrected distance across the dataset as a whole was 2.0%. The within-morphogroup means were very similar to the between-morphogroup mean distances (Table 2; see also Table S1 for 16S gene corrected distances). 
PMC3200340	DQ084823	Results	ENA	False	The average genetic distance within the samples was comparable to that within other Biomphalaria species. 	For COI, there was 1.6% difference across the Lake Victorian samples, as compared to 1.8% between African-wide samples of B. pfeifferi and 3.4% difference between three sequences of B. glabrata, from South America as well as laboratory strains (Genbank sequences DQ084823.1, DQ084866.1 and DQ084824.1). 	Distances between the Lake Victorian samples and other species were also comparable to inter-specific distances between other Biomphalaria species. Difference compared to B. alexandrina was lowest, at 1.7%, but otherwise for the other African Biomphalaria it ranged from 2.9% to 3.7%. 
PMC3206007	2igf	Methods	PDBe	False	Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the programs HKL and SCALEPACK [29]. 	The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe [30], using antibody variable and constant dimers derived from PDB entry 2igf as search models. 	Two independent Fab molecules, expected from the unit cell volume, were readily located and the structure was refined using the program autoBUSTER (Global Phasing Ltd.). Manual adjustments between refinement runs and building of the R13 peptide in the complex were performed with the program COOT [31]. 
PMC3206007	2VT4	Methods	PDBe	False	All procedures were performed with Discovery Studio 2.5 software from Accelrys (San Diego, CA, USA). 	The crystal structure of the turkey β1-AR (PDB 2VT4) was used as template to build a model of the human β1-AR. 	We mutated all residues to the human sequence and optimized the conformation of both the mutated residues and any surrounding residues that lay within a cut-off radius of 2 Å. Five models thus obtained were scored by the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE). We continued analysis using the lowest energy model (DOPE = −39358.55 kcal/mol), which was superimposed onto a membrane model. 
PMC3206007	2ECL	Results	PDBe	False	Briefly, we generated a model of the human β1-AR as described under material and methods. 	The structure of TcP2β epitope, R13, was aligned to the humanized second extracellular loop (2ECL) of the model to allow positioning the Ab on the putative binding site ( Figure 4A ) and the complex was subjected to a two minimization steps followed by heating, equilibration and production protocols under a distance-dependent, dielectric-implicit solvent model ( Figure 4B ). The interaction energy of the complex Ab-β1-AR was estimated at −430 kcal/mol. 	Polar contacts found in the model are summarized in  Table 3 . Some of Ab residues identified in the interaction with the humanized 2ECL peptide were key residues in the interaction with the T. cruzi epitope, such as Thr31, Arg52 and Asn56 of the heavy chain. 
PMC3206007	2Y01	Discussion	PDBe	False	Recently, the crystal structure of turkey β1-AR in complex with different agonists and antagonists was published [37]. 	In this work, the authors showed the presence of structural differences between the 2ECL of the β1-AR bound to the agonist dobutamine (PDB 2Y01) and to the antagonist cyanopindolol (PDB2VT4). 	A 1 Å contraction of the ligand-binding pocket between helices H5 and H7 was observed in the agonist complex relative to the antagonist complex. The contraction of the catecholamine-binding pocket induced a conformational change in the 2ECL [37].

PMC3229708	2XKU	Figure	PDBe	True	Assuming that the fibrils formed at neutral pH are structurally similar to those formed at acidic pH, as suggested by FTIR [135] and solid state NMR [133,134], large conformational changes are required in order to transform the anti-parallel β-sheet arrangement of ΔN6 into the parallel in-register arrangement of β-strands characteristic of β2m amyloid fibrils, as reported recently [132] (reproduced, with permission, from [9]). 	(B) Summary showing the consequences of β2m cleavage of the N-terminal hexapeptide that generates ΔN6 as a persistent IT state (PDB code 2XKU). 	Once formed ΔN6 is able to nucleate and elongate its own fibrils and also to cross-seed elongation of its fibrillar seeds with the wild-type protein, leading to the development of long straight amyloid-like fibrils (the image of the fibrils was redrawn from the cryo-EM structure of β2m amyloid fibrils from [139]). Furthermore, ΔN6 can transform the innocuous native state of β2m via bimolecular collision. 
PMC3235092	CU989003	Methods	ENA	False	5′-RACE PCR and primer walking 	In silico analysis within the ‘Gigasdatabase’ oyster Crassostrea gigas EST database [32] revealed that three sequences produce significant homologies with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (GenBank Accession numbers: CU989003, CU992640 and FP010921). 	These sequences were used to design oligonucleotides which were used downstream in 5′-RACE and primer walking strategies for the characterisation of the whole sequence of the ACE orthologue in C. gigas, named CgACE. Five prime rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed on spat cDNA (Generacer kit, Invitrogen). 
PMC3235092	JN382542	Methods	ENA	False		The whole protein sequence of the CgACE protein (Genbank accession number JN382542) was submitted to multiple sequence alignment with the ClustalW2 algorithm [35] (www.ebi.ac.uk) using the Gonnet matrix (parameters: gap open: 10; gap extension: 0,2; gap distance: 5; no end gap penalty; no iteration; numiter: 1; clustering method: neighbour-joining). 	The alignment file was used to generate a tree file with the neighbour-joining method using the Quicktree program v1.1 [36]. Based on this tree file, an unrooted tree diagram was plotted with the PHYLIP 3.67 Drawtree software [37] (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr).

Resulting cDNAs were diluted and the equivalent amount of 5 ng of starting RNA was assayed for CgACE expression using actin (Genbank accession number: AF026063) and elongation-factor alpha (Genbank accession number: BAD15289) transcripts as reference genes. 	SYBR-green quantitative PCR was realised on an iCycler iQ© apparatus (Bio-Rad). Absolute Blue SYBRgreen Supermix (ThermoScientific) was used in 40 cycles (95°C/15 s, 60°C/15 s) reactions with the following primers: CgACE-F1 (5′-CAAGTGGAGATGGAGGGTGT-3′) and CgACE-R1 (5′-AACAGGAGGAGGTCACTTCCTT-3′); QaActin: (5′-CGTTGCCAATGGTGATG-3′) and QsActin (5′-GCCCTGGACTTCGAACAA-3′); or Qs-Cg-EF (5′-ACCACCCTGGTGAGATCAAG-3′) and Qa-Cg-EF (5′-ACGACGATCGCATTTCTCTT-3′) as sense and antisense primers respectively.

The CgACE sequence was submitted to the Esypred3D server (http://www.fundp.ac.be/sciences/biologie/urbm/bioinfo/esypred/) and alignments were obtained by combining, weighting and screening the results of several multiple alignment programs following the procedure described in [43].

PMC3235092	JN382542	Methods	ENA	False	The cloning strategies allowed the characterization of a ∼2 kb cDNA exhibiting an in-frame 5′ stop codon, a 1896 base pairs coding sequence and a conserved polyadenylation signal. 	The aforementioned Crassostrea gigas Angiotensin-I converting enzyme cDNA sequence, named CgACE, was deposited in the Genbank database with the accession number JN382542. 	After signal peptide cleavage (A19/R20), the mature CgACE is predicted to be a 613 residues protein bearing a single conserved gluzincin motif HHEMGH(24)E starting at position 369, and a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor (A506 to Y524) (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1). Western blot of CgACE displays a single band slightly higher than 75 kDa, in line with the theoretical prediction of 74 kDa when considering putative post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (T136, T350, S425) (Figure 1B).

PMC3254606	1WLS	Results	PDBe	False	It is worth mentioning that model quality was different when we used different chain of the same structure as a template. 	To understand this difference in model quality, we superimposed two chains in one of the templates (for example: PDB code: 1WLS, chains A and B) and noticed the differences between two chains as jugged by the RMS value (0.877 Å) when two chains were superimposed. 	The difference in the RMS value may be due to the missing residues in some cases and/or due to differences in resolution between two chains. The Swiss Server Alignment mode provided better results when multi-sequences were used.

PMC3254606	2EO3	Results	PDBe	False	Interestingly, we observed that the sequence of apoptin was somewhat similar (identical residues 21.7%, and similarity 40.6%) to that of SH2 domain of CrkL, and apoptin's proline-rich segment (aa: 81–88) was found to be within this aligned region of SH2 domain. 	We then compared the shape of known 3D structure (PDB code: 2EO3) of SH2 domain of CrkL and apoptin model. 	Sequence alignment structural similarities are shown in figure 6A, B, and C respectively. We also performed the virtual docking experiments between the structure of SH2 domain of CrkL and the structure of Bcr-Abl (PDB code: 2ABL).

PMC3254606	2ABL	Results	PDBe	False	We have been able to build a model of apoptin by applying a comparative or homology protein modeling approach despite low identity (about 31%) and similarity (about 52%) of the templates. Figure 4A–C, and E shows the sequence alignment of the templates, ribbon view, space filling full-length model of apoptin, and Ramachandran plot, and solvent accessible surface area respectively. 	This model was used to virtually examine various binding interactions with Bcr-Abl by performing virtual docking experiment between apoptin and the X-ray crystal structure of Bcr-Abl (PDB code: 2ABL). 	First, accessible surface area for apoptin was identified. As shown in figure 4E, the large cream colored area is the hydrophobic region, the sites for protein-interaction, purple-red areas and blue areas are hydrophilic regions, purple-red indicates hydrogen bonding acceptors (for example, C = O) and blue regions indicate hydrogen bond donors (for example, N-H or O-H).

PMC3325407	rs1800407	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Mutations in the gene OCA2 are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 2, but polymorphisms in and around OCA2 have also been associated with normal pigment variation. 	In Europeans, three haplotypes in the region have been shown to be associated with eye pigmentation and a missense SNP (rs1800407) has been associated with green/hazel eyes (Branicki et al. in Ann Hum Genet 73:160–170, 2009). 	In addition, a missense mutation (rs1800414) is a candidate for light skin pigmentation in East Asia (Yuasa et al. in Biochem Genet 45:535–542, 2007; Anno et al. in Int J Biol Sci 4, 2008). We have genotyped 3,432 individuals from 72 populations for 21 SNPs in the OCA2-HERC2 region including those previously associated with eye or skin pigmentation. 
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Abstract	RefSNP	False	We report that the blue-eye associated alleles at all three haplotypes were found at high frequencies in Europe; however, one is restricted to Europe and surrounding regions, while the other two are found at moderate to high frequencies throughout the world. 	We also observed that the derived allele of rs1800414 is essentially limited to East Asia where it is found at high frequencies. 	Long-range haplotype tests provide evidence of selection for the blue-eye allele at the three haplotyped systems but not for the green/hazel eye SNP allele. We also saw evidence of selection at the derived allele of rs1800414 in East Asia.

PMC3325407	611409	Introduction	OMIM	False	Many genes have been associated with normal variation in human pigmentation (Sturm 2009; Sturm and Larsson 2009). 	Of those, OCA2 [MIM 611409], named for an abnormal pigmentation phenotype, oculocutaneous albinism type II (OCA2 [MIM 203200]), is a large gene extending over 300 kb on chromosome 15. OCA2 encodes the protein P, a transmembrane protein, and has been shown to play a role in pigmentation in both humans and mice (Frudakis et al. 2003). 	In humans, it has been implicated in iris, skin, and hair pigmentation (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007). The exact function of P is unknown though it has been suggested to process and traffic tyrosinase, regulate melanosomal pH, or regulate glutathione metabolism (Toyofuku et al. 2002; Staleva et al. (2002); Sturm et al. 2001; Edwards et al. 2010). 
PMC3325407	rs4778138	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Several sites in and around OCA2 have been reported to be the functional variant or to be tightly linked to the functional variant leading to blue eyes. 	These sites include a three-SNP haplotype (rs4778138, rs4778241, rs7495174) and four individual SNPs, rs1129038, rs12913832, rs916977, and rs1667394 (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007; Mengel-From et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010). 	Four of the SNPs (rs1129038, rs12913832, rs916977, rs1667394) are actually located in introns of the Hect Domain and RCC1-like Domain 2 (HERC2 [MIM 605837]), which are located 10 Kb upstream of OCA2. These are thought either to be located in or near an upstream regulatory region of OCA2 or to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with functional elements in HERC2 and affect a possible HERC2 regulation of OCA2.

We also examine the LD between the SNPs and haplotypes of interest. 
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Introduction	RefSNP	False	We also examine the LD between the SNPs and haplotypes of interest. 	Finally, we use long-range haplotype tests to show that OCA2 is or has been under selection in Europe and the derived allele of rs1800414 is, or has been, under selection in East Asia. 	
PMC3325407	rs4778138	Methods	RefSNP	False	We typed all of the implicated SNPs as well as others for a total of 21 SNPs spanning a total of 398,549 bp (Table 2) in our 72 population samples. 	Nine of the SNPs (rs4778138, rs4778241, rs7495174, rs1129038, rs12913832, rs916977, rs1667394, rs1800407, rs1800414) were chosen because of their previous association with pigmentation; the remainder was chosen based on allele frequencies in European populations from the Applied Biosystems SNP catalogue and to bring up the average coverage to one SNP for every 20 kb. 	SNPs were typed using Applied Biosystems TaqMan® assays performed in 384-well plates using ~50–100 ng of DNA per well. 
PMC3325407	rs4778138	Results	RefSNP	False	The three haplotype systems we define here are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3. 	Duffy et al. (2007) previously identified a three-SNP haplotype system (rs4778138, rs4778241, and rs7495174) associated with blue eyes; for the purpose of this paper, we will refer to this system as BEH1, blue-eye associated haplotype #1. 	The blue-eye associated allele of BEH1 is ACA, the fully derived haplotype. Sturm et al. (2008) reported that rs12913832 is associated with blue eyes. 
PMC3325407	rs12913832	Results	RefSNP	False	In the HGDP populations, BEH2 will consist of rs12913832 only since rs1129038 is not present in that dataset. 	We also typed an SNP that occurs between rs12913832 and rs1129038; however, it has not been associated with pigmentation, and is monomorphic on the blue-eye associated allele of BEH2 and was therefore not included in BEH2. 	Two other SNPs, rs916977 and rs1667394, have previously been associated with blue eyes (Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007). In our data, with the exception of a low frequency haplotype in Africa, rs916977 and rs1667394 are in nearly complete LD.

Using the nHS test we see strong evidence of selection for the derived allele of rs1800414 in both the Western China and Southeast Asian groups (Fig. 10d, e).Fig. 10Selection results at rs1800414 in East Asia. This figure shows the results of an REHH test in East Asia (a, b), an nHS test in Western China (c), and an nHS test in Southeast Asia.

Using the nHS test we see strong evidence of selection for the derived allele of rs1800414 in both the Western China and Southeast Asian groups (Fig. 10d, e).Fig. 10Selection results at rs1800414 in East Asia. 	This figure shows the results of an REHH test in East Asia (a, b), an nHS test in Western China (c), and an nHS test in Southeast Asia.

PMC3325407	rs1800414	Results	RefSNP	False	Again, the cyan points represent the results from 1,000 simulated populations under the neutral constant population size model. 	In a and b we show strong evidence of selection at the derived allele of rs1800414 (CAC) in East Asia. 	This result is confirmed in Western China (c) and Southeast Asia (d) where the derived allele (circled in red) is <0.50 using nHS We saw no evidence for selection at any of the pigmentation regions in Africa or the Americas (supplemental Figs. 9 and 10). 
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Global distribution of the light skin allele 	We have shown that the C allele of the missense SNP rs1800414 is found almost exclusively in East Asia (Fig. 4). 	Within East Asia there is a general cline in the frequency of the C allele with the lowest frequencies in Western China, midrange frequencies in Southeast Asia, and high frequencies in Eastern East Asia. The major exception to this pattern is the Malaysians; in our small sample the derived allele is absent, but the Malays are an Austronesian group and they show similar frequencies to our other Austronesian populations (Micronesians and Samoans). 
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Another possible explanation is that the blue eye phenotype is not being selected for; rather the TG allele of BEH2 has another phenotype, such as lighter skin pigmentation, which is under selection. 	In East Asia, we show that the C allele of the missense SNP rs1800414 is also under selection (Fig. 10). 	Again this result is not completely unexpected since this allele has been associated with lighter skin pigmentation in East Asians, and variants affecting skin pigmentation have previously been shown to be targets of selection (Edwards et al. 2010; Izagirre et al. 2006; Lao et al. 2007; Norton et al. 2007). 
PMC3325407	rs12913832	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	We also show that the TG allele of BEH2 has a strong signal of selection. 	Cook et al. (2009) showed melanocytes homozygous for the blue-eye associated allele of rs12913832 of BEH2 produced significantly less melanin than heterozygotes or those that were homozygous for the ancestral allele, but did not control for other SNPs in the region. 	This evidence suggests that BEH2 may contain the causal allele for blue eyes or at minimum is the best marker for the region in LD that does contain the causal allele. We have also shown that the C allele of rs1800414 is both restricted to East Asia and under selection in that region. 
PMC3325407	rs1800414	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	This evidence suggests that BEH2 may contain the causal allele for blue eyes or at minimum is the best marker for the region in LD that does contain the causal allele. 	We have also shown that the C allele of rs1800414 is both restricted to East Asia and under selection in that region. 	This research provides further evidence for lighter pigmentation evolving by means of selection at least partly independently in Europeans and East Asians but at some genes in common. These results, taken together with those from several forensic studies predicting iris pigmentation in mixed populations (Mengel-From et al. 2010; Spichenok et al. 2010; Valenzuela et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010; Pospiech et al. 2011), suggest that the SNPs of BEH2 (rs1129038 and rs12913832) are the best markers for blue eyes for forensic purposes. 
PMC3325407	rs1129038	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	This research provides further evidence for lighter pigmentation evolving by means of selection at least partly independently in Europeans and East Asians but at some genes in common. 	These results, taken together with those from several forensic studies predicting iris pigmentation in mixed populations (Mengel-From et al. 2010; Spichenok et al. 2010; Valenzuela et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010; Pospiech et al. 2011), suggest that the SNPs of BEH2 (rs1129038 and rs12913832) are the best markers for blue eyes for forensic purposes. 	A recent study by Liu et al. (2010) found that rs12913832 has the strongest effect when eye color is measured quantitatively and can explain most of the variance in eye color amongst Europeans. However, several questions need to be answered. 
PMC3325407	rs12913832	Conclusion	RefSNP	False	Are blue eyes under sexual selection or is the TG allele also responsible for an additional selected phenotype such as light skin pigmentation? 	Both Eiberg et al. (2008) and Sturm et al. (2008) suggest that the BEH2 falls into a regulatory region of OCA2; however, Eiberg et al. believe the causal allele is a 166 kb haplotype that happens to contain the two SNPs of BEH2 and Sturm et al. suggest that rs12913832 is the causal allele. 	Eiberg et al. based their conclusion on lower activity when they used their blue-eye associated haplotype in a luciferase assay compared to other haplotypes. Sturm et al. based their conclusion on not finding a better associated SNP of known SNPs in the 5′ region of OCA2 or the 3′ end of HERC2 and that the probability of there being an unknown SNP with a stronger association was unlikely.

PMC3355159	GSE8402	Results	GEO	False		The Setlur Prostate Cancer Dataset was described in [53] and it is publicly available from GEO (website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo, accession number GSE8402); gene expression is measured by a custom Illumina DASL Assay of 6144 probes known from literature to be prostate cancer related. 	Setlur and colleagues identified a subtype of prostate cancer characterized by the fusion of the 5′-untranslated region of the androgen-regulated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) promoter with erythroblast transformation-specific transcription factor family members (TMPRSS2-ER). A major result of the original paper is that this common fusion is associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype, and thus a distinct subclass of prostate cancer exists, defined by this fusion.

As detailed in GEO and in NCBI Nucleotide DB (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/), its RefSeq ID is NM_004449, whose functional description is reported as “v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG), transcript variant 2, mRNA” (information updated on 28 June 2009). 	In Table 9 we analyse the performances obtained by a SRDA and a DLDA model with the sole feature DAP2_5229 on all combinations of US and Sweden cohort as training and test set. The high performance reached by these single feature models are supporting the claim in [68] of the global effectiveness of single-gene models in microarray studies.

PMC3374772	rs12979860	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In the immunodominant ‘a’ region of the surface gene, point mutations were identified in 31% (n = 58/187) of sequences, and 2.2% (n = 4/187) and 5.3% (n = 10/187) specimens contained the major vaccine escape mutations G145A/R and P120L/Q/S/T, respectively. 	368 HBsAg positive individuals were genotyped for the IL28B SNP rs12979860 and no significant association between the IL28B SNP and clearance of HBsAg, HBV viral load or HBeAg was observed. 	This study confirms the high prevalence of HBV infection in Viet Nam and also highlights the significant levels of blood-borne virus coinfections, which have important implications for hepatitis-related morbidity and development of effective management strategies.

PMC3374772	AF046996	Methods	ENA	False	Statistical support for the topology of the trees was provided by 1000 bootstrap replicates. 	Reference sequences used represented all currently assigned genotypes of HBV, with the woolly monkey HBV strain (Genbank accession number: AF046996) used as an out-group. 	Numbering of HBV nucleotides starts at the EcoRI cleavage site or at homologous sites, if the EcoRI site is absent. HBV pol gene sequences were also analysed using the online genotyping tool Geno2Pheno (http://hbv.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/index.php) which compares the query sequence to reference sequences to identify known mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir and telbivudine, and with immune escape. 
PMC3374772	JQ281259	Results	ENA	False	Evaluation of fragments for which there was an available corresponding S gene sequence also identified a difference in mutational patterns at the subgenotype level: B2 viruses compared to B4 for both G1896A (20%, n = 1/5 vs 40.2%, n = 53/132) and A1762T/G1764A (40%, n = 2/5 vs 19.7%, n = 26/132). 	We also identified a 21 bp deletion in the basal core promoter region of one sequence from a 55 year-old multi-transfused patient in Khanh Hoa (JQ281259). 	Genetic Variability at the IL28B Locus HBsAg positive individuals (n = 368) from the five centres were genotyped for the IL28B SNP rs12979860 and the C allele frequency was found to be 93%. 
PMC3374772	rs12979860	Results	RefSNP	False	Genetic Variability at the IL28B Locus 	HBsAg positive individuals (n = 368) from the five centres were genotyped for the IL28B SNP rs12979860 and the C allele frequency was found to be 93%. 	Overall, 86.41% (n = 318) were major homozygotes [CC], 13.04% (n = 48) were heterozygotes [CT] and 0.54% (n = 2) were minor homozygotes [TT]. A comparison of all monoinfected HBsAg positive individuals (n = 214) with individuals with resolved infection (i.e. HBsAg negative, HBc total positive and HBV DNA negative; n = 53) demonstrated no significant difference in genotype frequency (p = 0.50). 
PMC3388970	GQ487713	Article	ENA	False		In March 2007 a tomato sample (Isolate-Q1510) displaying fine necrotic rings and spots on the leaves was collected from Ratchburi, Thailand. The sample was negative in Tospo IV ELISA (Agdia reagent set). Partial L-gene was amplified using degenerate tospovirus primers gL3637 and gL4435c (Chu et al. 2001) and the resulting sequence (GenBank accession GQ487713) was most closely related to Watermelon silver mottle virus (AF133128) with a nucleotide (nt) identity of 78% over a 752 bp overlap. 	
PMC3397135	BE321117	Results	ENA	False	To investigate the evidence of the translocation in depth, we calculated LD among SSR markers that are denoted in Fig. 1 by asterisks with remaining markers of both chromosomes 4 and 8 separately. 	We observed only two significant associations when all accessions were considered: SSR marker BE321117 showed significant LD with al367160 on chromosome 4 and with aw267840 on chromosome 8 (Fig. 1). 	However, when the five groups identified by Structure were analyzed separately, no significant LD was detected, suggesting the observed LD was created by family structure rather than a real physical proximity. We excluded a total of 20 pairwise LD calculations because we could not infer the accurate distance between markers in the above-mentioned situation.

A probe for a highly conserved region of the Pcdh-β2–β22 genes, pan-Pcdh-β probe, was designed based on the sequence in mouse β12 (nucleotides 1422–2152 according to GeneBank™ accession number NM_053137). 	The Pcdh-β isoform-specific probes were designed based on mouse β3 (nucleotides 237–1364; GeneBank™ accession number NM_053128), β15 (nucleotides 161–1362; GeneBank™ accession number NM_053140), β16 (nucleotides 277–1293; GeneBank™ accession number NM_053141), β19 (nucleotides 227–1147; GeneBank™ accession number NM_053144), and β22 (nucleotides 213–1146; GeneBank™ accession number NM_053147). The similarity of each Pcdh-β isoform-specific probe to other Pcdh-α, Pcdh-β, and Pcdh-γ genes and to other mouse genes was low enough (less than 65%) to detect specific Pcdh-β transcripts of interest.

The probes were designed based on mouse GAD67 (nucleotides 1073 ~ 2012; GeneBank™ accession number NM_008077), rat ChAT (nucleotides 243 ~ 745; GeneBank™ accession number NM_001170593), and rat VAChT (Slc18a3) (nucleotides 1201 ~ 2194; GeneBank™ accession number NM_031663). 	The DIG-labeled Pcdh-β probe and a FITC-labeled GAD67, ChAT, or VAChT cRNA probe were hybridized to sections, which were washed as above. To detect the FITC-labeled probes, the sections were incubated with an anti-FITC antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratory, 1:4000 in the blocking buffer) for 2–5 hrs at room temperature.

The structure of the Eg5–ispinesib complex was solved in space group P21 by molecular replacement with MOLREP using the Eg5 tetramer of PDB entry 2gm1 as the search model (Kim et al., 2006 ▶). 	Twinning analysis was carried out with phenix.xtriage from the PHENIX suite (Adams et al., 2002 ▶). Iterative improvement of this structure then proceeded through cycles of model building with Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004 ▶) and refinement using PHENIX or REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011 ▶), resulting in a final model with an R free of 25.3% and overall reasonable geometry.

Comparison with apo Eg5 (PDB entry 1ii6; Turner et al., 2001 ▶) shows that the region around the inhibitor-binding pocket undergoes major conformational changes on ispinesib binding. 	Additional changes extend towards the other end of the motor domain, bringing about larger conformational changes in the switch II cluster (helix α4, loop L12 and helix α5) and the neck-linker region (Yan et al., 2004 ▶).

PMC3480684	rs10503669	Abstract	RefSNP	False	In an association analysis for 16 genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based candidate loci, we confirmed significant associations of a genetic predisposition to lipoprotein concentrations in a childhood obesity study. 	Having two loci (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC) that showed the strongest association with blood levels of TG and HDL-C, we calculated a genetic risk score (GRS), representing the sum of the risk alleles. 	It has been observed that increasing GRS is significantly associated with decreased HDL-C (effect size, -1.13 ± 0.07) compared to single nucleotide polymorphism combinations without two risk variants. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between allelic dosage score and risk allele (rs10503669 at LPL) on high TG levels (effect size, 10.89 ± 0.84).

In addition, a positive correlation was observed between allelic dosage score and risk allele (rs10503669 at LPL) on high TG levels (effect size, 10.89 ± 0.84). 	These two loci yielded consistent associations in our previous meta-analysis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the genetic architecture of circulating lipid levels (TG and HDL-C) overlap to a large extent in childhood as well as in adulthood. 
PMC3480684	rs2074356	Methods	RefSNP	False	For more information, the study has been reported [15]. 	For the replication study in Health2 (7,861), we performed a genotype assay using the TaqMan reaction for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2074356, rs16940212, rs12708980, rs599839) and the GoldenGate assay (Illumina Inc.) for nine SNPs (rs780092, rs10503669, rs2001945, rs603446, rs12686004, rs11216126, rs12229654, rs519113, rs12654264, rs2738446). 	To analyze the quality control, we conducted duplicate genotyping using 1-2.5% of samples. For further association analyses, concordance rates were satisfied with duplicates of over 99% and a genotype success rate of over 98%. 
PMC3480684	rs10503669	Results	RefSNP	False	In an attempt to determine whether well-established lipid-related variants contribute to significant and reproducible genetic factors for susceptibility to blood lipid concentrations in a childhood obesity study, we first examined the associations between individual genetic variants and lipid-related phenotypes using linear regression analysis. 	Of these 16 SNPs for blood lipid traits, rs10503669 in LPL (genotyped SNP in a childhood obesity study) was significantly associated with TG and HDL-C, respectively. 	In addition, rs16940212 in LIPC (linkage disequilibrium-based proxy SNP) was associated with HDL-C (Table 2). The direction of these associations was consistent with our previous GWAS [9]. 
PMC3480684	rs10503669	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The direction of these associations was consistent with our previous GWAS [9]. 	Having two loci (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC) showing the strongest association with TG and HDL-C, we next investigated whether the cumulative allelic dosage of risk alleles contributes to the quantitative variation of lipoprotein concentrations in the KARE study using a method of calculating a GRS. 	We evaluated the joint effects of the best-associated SNPs at the two loci showing evidence of association with HDL-C (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC). We calculated a GRS, representing the sum of the risk alleles, and observed that increasing GRS was significantly associated with decreased HDL-C (effect size, -1.13 ± 0.07) compared to SNP combinations without two risk variants (Fig. 1).

PMC3480684	rs10503669	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In addition, the LIPC gene was further observed in decreased HDL-C. 	In analyses of the joint effects of these variants, we found that GRSs on the two risk alleles (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC) were associated with a cumulative effect of TG and HDL-C levels. 	However, these facts indicate that currently identified risk variants might have low discriminatory ability and modest genetic contribution to disease prediction [24]. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an important role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing TGs of circulating chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins.

As shown in Figure 3 the expression levels of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 across 61 tumour samples (and all four molecular subtypes) were higher compared with the MMR gene expression assessed in the CB samples. The expression of PMS2 in primary MB tissues was within the range of the reference CB.

Importantly, with the CHCA TL sample matrix preparation the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (O88569) was identified and confirmed by MS/MS. 	However, when the digests of the same spots were analyzed by the DHB ML sample preparation Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (P16858) was additionally identified and confirmed by MS/MS. Therefore, a careful comparison of the spot in the developed immunoblot of the 2-DE-cCBB gel and the visual inspection of regions in which the spots appeared needed to be confirmed. 
PMC3499474	P16858	Methods	UniProt	False	Importantly, with the CHCA TL sample matrix preparation the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (O88569) was identified and confirmed by MS/MS. 	However, when the digests of the same spots were analyzed by the DHB ML sample preparation Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (P16858) was additionally identified and confirmed by MS/MS. 	Therefore, a careful comparison of the spot in the developed immunoblot of the 2-DE-cCBB gel and the visual inspection of regions in which the spots appeared needed to be confirmed. Likewise co-migrated and adjacent spots were examined. 
PMC3499474	O55222	Results	UniProt	False	Specifically, the use of two different MALDI sample preparation methods and the acquisition of MS/MS spectra in an automated mode enabled reliable identification of phosphoproteins. 	The pSset of MAbs facilitated the MS identification of a large number of kinases including the SRC kinase (P05480), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (O88351), integrin-linked protein kinase (O55222) and serine-protein kinase ATM (Q62388) mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (Q63844). 	For spots commonly identified by immunoblotting and by 2-DE MALDI MS/MS experiments were additionally performed (Table S1) With the MPM-2 MAb 43 unique proteins were detected by WB. Despite the overall reduced number of proteins detected with the this MAb unique proteins (n = 6) were identified and had not been detected by the pSmix Abs most likely as a result of differences in specificity of epitop recognition. 
PMC3499474	P17563	Results	UniProt	False	The immunoblot procedure does not always define all the possible residues subjected to posttranslational modifications. 	As shown in Figure 6, the phosphoserine specific MAbs pSset recognized aldehyde dehydrogenase (P47738) and selenium-binding protein 1 (P17563), but with the MAbs 4G10, MPM-2 and pYset only one of these proteins were detected. 	These two proteins are phosphorylated at different sites as reported elsewhere. Thus, by use of several anti-phosphoprotein Abs with different specificity in the recognition of epitopes a more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteins can be achieved.

Next, frequencies of distinct tags were used to evaluate the normality of DGE data [47].

PMC3689664	rs2234693	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Generally, ESR1 is implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility by stimulating aberrant prostate growth, controlling prostate cell growth and programming prostate cell death [15]. 	Recently, several ESR1 gene polymorphisms have been identified as candidates for prostate cancer susceptibility and among these, ESR1 PvuII (rs2234693 C>T) and XbaI (rs9340799 A>G) polymorphisms were suggested to possess significant associations with the development of prostate cancer. 	Both PvuII and XbaI can affect ESR1 transcription activity and possibly contribute to the elevated risk of prostate cancer [3], [6], [16], but the exact effects of ESR1 gene mutations on prostate epithelial cells are still debated despite the fact that estrogen is already used in treatming prostate cancer due to its growth-inhibitory effects [17]. A recent case-control study observed no associations between the selected genetic polymorphisms of ESR1 and prostate cancer risk [14]. 
PMC3689664	rs2234693	Results	RefSNP	False	Various genotype methods were used among these studies, including polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), direct DNA sequencing, Taqman, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). 	Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ESR gene were considered, including PvuII (rs2234693 C>T), XbaI (rs9340799 A>G), codon 10 (rs2077647 T>C), codon 325 (rs1801132 C>G), codon 594 (rs2228480 G>A) and +261G>C (rs746432 G>C); and among these, PvuII (C>T) and XbaI (A>G) polymorphism were the most common SNPs. 	Genotype frequencies among the controls were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test, except for four studies [25], [29], [31], [32]. The characteristics and methodological quality of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. 
PMC3689664	rs9340799	Discussion	RefSNP	False	ESR1 gene mutations may alter the concentration of reactive estrogens in the prostate [28]. 	Several polymorphisms in ESR1 gene, such as PvuII (rs9340799 A>G) and XbaI (rs2234693 C>T), have been studied to a assess their causal relationships with prostate cancer [23], [25], [37], [40]. 	It appears that inherited alterations of the ESR1 gene can possibly explain interpopulation differences in the incidences associated with estrogen-related diseases [29]. Many investigations have demonstrated that prostate cancer risk was associated with the ESR1 gene polymorphism [36], [37].

The rate of change of the molecular species are monitored by calculating, at given time steps, their rates of production and consumption [14]. The original model was recently modified to account for the postulated R-Gt precoupling in the dark [15], leading to the inclusion of the following reactions, which describe: a) the dynamic formation and b) dissociation of dark R-Gt complexes:

PMC3835687	NG_016212.1	Introduction	RefSeq	False	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; OMIM#603516) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia variably associated with epilepsy and other nervous system disorders [1], [2]. 	The SCA10 mutation is an unstable expansion of an (ATTCT)n repeat in intron 9 of ATAXIN 10 (ATXN10; NCBI GeneID: 25814; Genomic DNA Accession: NG_016212.1) on chromosome 22q. 	The polymorphic repeat expands up to 4,500 repeats in SCA10 patients [3] (normal range: ≤32 [4]; reduced penetrance range: 280–850 repeats [5]–[7]). All reported SCA10 cases occur in patients from Latin America with oral family histories, and in most cases physical characteristics, of Amerindian ancestry [1], [2], [8]–[13]. 
PMC3835687	rs136005	Methods	RefSNP	False	SNPs were identified by examining the electropherogram for each sequencing reaction. 	To identify the SCA10 haplotype for SNP, rs136005, that segregates with the normal allele, a 1.5-Kbp DNA fragment containing the normal ATTCT repeat allele was PCR amplified using the forward primer from the flanking PCR reaction used to size normal SCA10 alleles and is located upstream of the ATTCT repeat [29] and a reverse primer for SNP rs136005, located downstream of the expansion. 	PCR conditions were such that only the 1.5 kb fragment containing the wild-type allele was amplified while the larger 8.5 kb SCA10 allele associated with the disease was not amplified (data not shown). The 1.5 kb fragment containing the normal allele was purified and subjected to sequence analysis using the same primers the forward and reverse PCR primers for SNP, rs136005.

PMC3914871	rs1799750	Abstract	RefSNP	False	While the importance’s of other SNPs in the MMP-1 promoter have not yet been studied in gastric cancer, our aim was to investigate MMP-1 gene promoter polymorphisms and gastric cancer susceptibility in eastern Indian population. 	A total of 145 gastric cancer patients and 145 healthy controls were genotyped for MMP-1 −1607 1G/2G (rs1799750) by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), while MMP-1 −519 A/G (rs1144393), MMP-1 −422 T/A (rs475007), MMP-1 −340 T/C (rs514921) and MMP-1 −320 T/C (rs494379) were genotyped by DNA sequencing. 	A positive association was found with MMP-1 −422 T/A SNP that showed significant risk for regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.021, Odd’s ratio (OR) = 3.044, Confidence intervals (CI) = 1.187–7.807). In addition, we found a significant association with lower stomach tumor formation among gastric cancer patients for three adjacent polymorphisms near the transcriptional start sites of [MMP-1 −422 T/A (P = 0.043, OR = 2.182, CI = 1.03–4.643), MMP-1 −340 T/C (P = 0.075, OR = 1.97, CI = 0.94–4.158) and MMP-1 −320 T/C (P = 0.034, OR = 2.224, CI = 1.064–40731)]. 
PMC3914871	rs1799750	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Although the enhanced expression of MMP-1 was associated with local invasion and poor prognosis in gastric cancer [25], the role of the MMP-1 promoter SNPs and their haplotypes in the development of gastric cancer is currently unknown in any human population. 	In the present study, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study to explore the association of the MMP-1 gene promoter SNPs [−1607 1G/2G (rs1799750) (MMP-1.1), −519A/G (rs1144393) (MMP-1.2), −422T/A (rs475007) (MMP-1.3), −340C/T (rs514921) (MMP-1.4), and −320C/T (rs494379) (MMP-1.5)] and their haplotypes with the risk of gastric cancer development in an eastern Indian population. 	We also explored the relationship between the polymorphisms and the clinicopathological factors among gastric cancer patients. The study demonstrated the putative association of MMP-1.3, MMP-1.4, and MMP-1.5 polymorphisms with the risk of lower stomach tumor formation in gastric cancer. 
PMC3914871	AF023338	Results	ENA	False	Naturally occurring, common sequence variants of the MMP-1 gene promoter in cases and controls were searched by direct DNA sequencing. 	Alignment of sequence chromatogram with the MMP-1 gene promoter contig sequence (Genebank accession no- AF023338) confirmed the SNP positions at −1607 (1G/2G, i.e., G insertion/deletion), −519 (A/G), −422 (T/A), −340 (T/C) and −320 (T/C) (Figure S1 in File S1). 	MMP-1.1 genotyping by PCR-RFLP was then performed among the gastric cancer patients and controls. Figure S1A (File S1) shows a typical PCR-RFLP pattern. 
PMC3914871	rs1144393	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The low degree of linkage disequilibrium between the MMP-1 gene polymorphisms likely reflects the presence of recombination hotspots at this genomic locus. 	Three of the five polymorphisms, i.e., MMP-1.2 (rs1144393), MMP-1.3 (rs475007) and MMP-1.4 (rs514921) have been studied in the international HapMap project, and have been shown to be located near a recombination hotspot and thus accounted for low LD [24]. 	We found nearly 16 haplotypes for studied MMP-1 polymorphisms, none of which contribute a major part in the population. In the MMP-1 gene promoter, in which linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms is substantially weaker, to partition the different haplotypes would require the genotyping of four of the five polymorphisms (MMP-1.1 and MMP-1.5 are in complete linkage). 
PMC3919015	212750	Introduction	OMIM	False		Celiac disease (CD, MIM: 212750) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder caused by intolerance to ingested gluten that develops in genetically susceptible individuals and affects ∼1% of Caucasians (1). 	Histological analysis of intestinal biopsies at diagnosis (when disease is active) shows that CD is characterized by the loss of villi, crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in the gut, and there are circulating IgA and IgG class autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 and antibodies against gliadin (2). Clinical presentation varies from typical gastrointestinal symptoms to extraintestinal manifestations, all of which develop in the context of a sustained, chronic inflammation of the gut, but usually revert if gluten is totally excluded from the diet. 
PMC3943257	JQ690762	Abstract	ENA	False	In this study, a variant of CAV was detected using PCR with CAV-based primers in fecal samples of stray cats. 	The genome of CAV variant was sequenced and the results suggest that it could be a recombinant viral strain from parental CAV strains JQ690762 and AF311900. 	Recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism that contributes to genetic diversification. These findings indicate that CAV variant might have originated from CAV-infected chickens. 
PMC3943257	JQ690762	Introduction	ENA	False	Viral surveillance programs have isolated more than 50 CAV samples from different provinces in China during 2009–2012, and the epidemiological analysis suggested that CAVs were prevalent in China. 	We also analyzed the characteristic of one strain (GD-1-12), which was isolated in Southern China in 2012; the GD-1-12 isolate's genome at position 183 has a 21 nt deletion (TCCGTACAGGGGGGTACGTCA) in comparison with the genome (accession no. JQ690762) of the CAV isolate from human fecal samples. 	It is unclear if the 21 nt deletion is related to host specificity or pathogenicity [5]. In 2010, the CAV genome has been detected in breeder and commercial chicken flocks in South Korea [6].

Comparative analyses showed that CAV variant shared the greatest sequence identity (98.1%) with the CAV isolate from Japan (AH9410) and the least identity (38%) with the GyV3 isolate from the USA. The VP1, VP2, and VP3 genes of the CAV variant showed nucleotide variations of 1–63.1%, 0.5–51.9%, and 0.5–50.5%, respectively, among the 36 relevant sequences from GenBank. 
PMC3943257	KC414026	Results	ENA	False		The above results suggested that CAV variant (accession no: KC414026) was a potential recombinant isolate between two CAV strains, namely, CAV strain AF311900 as the minor parent and CAV strain JQ690762 as the major parent (Figure 2) with the recombination breakpoints mapping to position 2,100 (beginning breakpoint) and 158 (ending breakpoint). 	The recombination region of CAV variant was located in the partial VP1 coding region, the entire 3′ untranslated region (UTR), and a portion of the 5′UTR (Figure 3). In order to identify if the two breakpoints are precise, we divided the CAV variant genome into two segments: the recombinant region from genomic nucleotide position 2,100-158 and the nonrecombinant region from genomic nucleotide positions 159-2,099.

PMC3964965	P19883	Article	UniProt	False	Previously these mappings were given only in a tab-delimited file that contains very limited information; now, however, they have also been formalized and expanded into a supplementary OBO-format file (promapping.obo, see later in text) that contains complete definitions of and relationships between the mapped terms. 	For example, we indicate that human follistatin protein (UniProtKB:P19883) is a subtype of follistatin protein found in any organism (PR:000000015) and is encoded by the human follistatin gene FST (HGNC:3971). 	The PRO mappings, which previously covered only three organisms (human, mouse and E. coli), now cover 12 GO reference proteomes (12): human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, chicken, fruit fly, budding yeast, fission yeast, E. coli, A. thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum. Assignment of each organism-specific protein to a PRO organism-agnostic gene category term is done (largely) automatically using 1:1 ortholog inferences provided by OMA (13). 
PMC3964965	P23611	Article	UniProt	False	Scientists can thus compare these different products directly, either using the GO-centric view (middle panel), where the relevant products of the gene are mapped to each GO annotation, or the PRO-centric view (bottom panel), where the relevant GO annotations are shown for each gene product. 	For example, mouse interferon regulatory factor 8, encoded by the Irf8 gene (MGI:96395; protein sequence given in UniProtKB: P23611), can be sumoylated. 	When in the unsumoylated form (PR:000035709), the protein can positively regulate RNA polymerase II transcription initiation (GO:0060261). The sumoylated form (PR:000035707), however, cannot.

PMC4011874	BC034235	Methods	ENA	False		To generate adenoviral vectors for MCU overexpression and fusion with a C-terminal Myc tag, human MCU cDNA clone (GenBank: BC034235) was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E consortium (ID: 5296557) and subcloned into pAd5CMV-KN (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core, Iowa City, IA, U.S.A.) by PCR using the GeneArt Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (Life Technologies). 	PCR primers amplifying Myc-tagged Mcu were: forward 5′-ATA AGC TTA TGG CGG CCG CCG CAG GTA GAT CG-3′, reverse 5′-CTA CAG GTC TTC TTC GCT AAT CAG TTT CTG TTC ATC TTT TTC ACC AAT TTG TCG GAG-3′, and pAd5CMV-KN: forward 5′-GAA GAA GAC CTG TAG GAT ATC GAA TTC CTG CAG CCC-3′, reverse 5′-GCC GCC ATA AGC TTA TCG ATA CCG TCG ACC TC-3′.

PMC4070555	GO:0000082	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	As expected, many cell-cycle related functional gene sets were found to be related to most of the TFBS gene sets. 	For example, the ‘DNA replication (GO:0006260)’ and ‘G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000082)’ are associated with four of the five TFBS sets while the ‘cell cycle (KEGG)’ and ‘cell cycle checkpoint (GO:0000075)’ are associated with three. 	For each gene set, many conditions likely to activate cell cycle progression were observed, e.g. iPS or diverse cancer cell conditions. For the union of all the E2F1 TFBS gene sets (E2F1_all), the ‘transcription activator activity (GO:0016563)’ set is captured and several of the putative targets exhibit high expression fold-changes for a number of the HeLa cell conditions treated with vaccinia virus (GSE 11238): Bmp2, E2f3, Epc1, Fosl1, Mll5, Myc and Nr4a3 (Figure 3a). 
PMC4100386	rs9863274	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However, there were many singular risk loci left (Table S2). 	We noted three singular risk loci among them: rs9863274 located on 3q24, rs104554013 located on 5q21.3, and rs952125 located on 21q21.1. 	The region 3q24 was a well-known CNV-associated locus identified in many studies of lung cancer [25, 30–32] and the amplification of this locus [30] was the most prominent difference between squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and adenocarcinomas (ACs) [31]. The loss of copy number in 5q21 had been previously reported to be associated with lung cancer [33] and the CNVs of this locus were implicated in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma in patients who smoked [34]. 
PMC4104715	SRR1023085	Methods	ENA	False	Library concentrations were determined using the KAPA qPCR kit (KK4835; Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, Massachusetts, USA) on an ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York, USA). 	The resulting libraries were multiplexed in one Illumina HiSeq 2000 lane (∼187.5 million reads per lane [Glenn, 2011]) at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, yielding ∼12.5 million 100-bp single-end reads for each taxon (GenBank Sequence Read Archive accessions: SRR1023085, SRR1023089, SRR1023095, SRR1023112, SRR1023113, SRR1023126, SRR1023128–SRR1023136). 	Average depth of coverage of our sequencing experiment was ∼8333× (taking 150 kb as the average plastome size). The results obtained here clearly do not maximize the potential of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 for plastome sequencing. 
PMC4104715	KF922718	Methods	ENA	False	Given that our shortest overlap between amplicons is 135 bp (between regions 9 and 10; Table 2), with the rest spanning hundreds of base pairs (Table 2), and that our experiment yielded a high sequencing depth, we had no problems calling bases unambiguously (99.99% on average, Table 1). 	The Bartsia inaequalis Benth. assembly (Fig. 1; GenBank accession no. KF922718) was annotated using DOGMA (Wyman et al., 2004) and visualized in GenomeVx (Conant and Wolfe, 2008).

PMC4133960	rs1800795	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In breast cancer patients there were substantial genetic findings that increased activity of pro-inflammation-related genes in leucocytes may contribute to persistent CRF [24]. 	Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the cytokines ILB -511 C>T (rs 16944), IL6 -174 G>C (rs1800795) and TNF -308 G>A (rs 1800629) suggests an inflammatory basis for fatigue [25]. 	Already in 2007, Bower JE [26] summarized emerging evidence that inflammatory processes my be involved in CRF during and after treatment and his group recently examined the hypothesis that CRF is driven by activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine network [27]. The hypothesis driven view that CRF is related to inflammatory processes [28] or to the serotonin, to the vagal-afferent activation, to the anemia and to the adenosine triphosphate hypotheses [29] has a history since midth of 2007.

Because of a mutation in the start codon (ATG→ACG), Tokyo/cat/130627 lacked ORF3b. In addition, type II FCoVs, M91-267 and Tokyo/cat/130627 possessed a truncated ORF 3c (Fig. 1). 
PMC4168835	604313	Introduction	OMIM	False	Evidence for a major gene has been identified for cortical [17] and nuclear [18,19] cataract, with heritability estimates of 58% [20] and 48% [21], respectively. 	A whole genome STR scan conducted in families in Wisconsin revealed a major locus for age-related cortical cataract on chromosome 6p12-q12 [22], and specific candidate genes that have been studied include galactokinase (Gene_ID: 2584; OMIM: 604313) [23,24], apolipoprotein E (Gene_ID: 348; OMIM: 107741) [25], glutathione S-transferase (Gene_ID: 2944; OMIM: 138350)[26], N-acetyltransferase 2 (Gene_ID: 10; OMIM: 612182) [27,28], and estrogen metabolism genes [29]. 	Two recent studies found an association between the EPHA2 gene (Gene_ID: 1969; OMIM: 176946) and cataract [30,31]. Higher body mass index (BMI) has been shown in many studies to increase risk of cortical and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5–2.5) [32-38].

PMC4168835	610966	Introduction	OMIM	False	Higher body mass index (BMI) has been shown in many studies to increase risk of cortical and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5–2.5) [32-38]. 	A recent study found that nuclear cataract was not associated with obesity but was associated with the FTO obesity gene (Gene_ID: 79068; OMIM: 610966) in an Asian population [39]. 	Although familial aggregation studies have shown a potential role for gene and environment interactions in nuclear cataract [40,41], research in this area is limited. The association of glutathione S-transferase with cataract has been shown to be modified by smoking [42] and sunlight exposure [43]. 
PMC4168835	605379	Results	OMIM	False	Figure 1 shows the Manhattan plots for the single locus tests of association for cataract case control adjusted (Figure 1A) and age-at-diagnosis adjusted (Figure 1B) and Figure 2 shows the corresponding QQ plots for each GWAS analysis. 	Our top hits in the adjusted case-control analysis include gigaxonin (GAN; Gene_ID: 8139, OMIM: 605379; p value = 2.42×10−6), which encodes a member of the cytoskeletal Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric a brac (BTB/kelch) repeat family. 	The encoded protein plays a role in neurofilament architecture and is involved in mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of some proteins. Defects in this gene are a cause of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN). 
PMC4168835	607299	Results	OMIM	False	Defects in this gene are a cause of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN). 	Other potential interesting findings include DNER (Gene_ID: 92737; OMIM: 607299; p value = 1.87×10−5), which encodes for the Delta and Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor, and EHHADH (Gene_ID: 1962; OMIM: 607037; p value = 2.80×10−5) encodes for enoyl-CoA, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase.

Mutations in this gene result in an autosomal recessive disorder of fructose intolerance, and cases of cataract have been reported in the first decade of life [52]. Another interesting associated gene is MAP3K1 (Gene_ID: 4214; OMIM: 600982; p value = 1.33×10−5), a functional mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1.

Another interesting associated gene is MAP3K1 (Gene_ID: 4214; OMIM: 600982; p value = 1.33×10−5), a functional mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1. 	Molecular signatures of MAP3K1 have been shown to be important in embryonic eyelid closure in the mouse [53]. In total, 45 SNPs were statistically significant at p<10−5 or smaller. 
PMC4168835	614356	Results	OMIM	False	In total, 45 SNPs were statistically significant at p<10−5 or smaller. 	In the age-at-diagnosis analysis, our top hits include ACSS3 (Gene_ID: 79611; OMIM: 614356; p value = 6.39×10−7), which is acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3; EPHA4 (p value = 7.03×10−5), ephrin type-A receptor 4, which is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EPHA4 gene (Gene_ID: 2043; OMIM: 602188). 	This gene belongs to the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family, along with EPHA2. EPH and EPH-related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, especially in the nervous system [54]. 
PMC4178425	CJJ81176	Results	ENA	False	BIOLOG phenotype microarray analysis suggested that dipeptides like glycyl-glutamine and glycyl-proline enhance the respiratory activity of C. jejuni and can be used as carbon sources though strain specific differences exist (Gripp et al., 2011; Muraoka and Zhang, 2011). 	This variability in peptide catabolism might be the consequence of C. jejuni isolates having variable number of peptidases: GGT, the putative S15 family dipeptidyl-peptidase CJJ81176_1680 or the putative subtilisin-like serine peptidases Cj1365 / CJJ81176_1367 and CJJ81176_1371 occur in a subset of C. jejuni strains (Champion et al., 2005; Hofreuter et al., 2006; Hepworth et al., 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2009; Zautner et al., 2011). 	Only ggt-positive C. jejuni strains can efficiently use the tripeptide glutathione as carbon/energy (Hofreuter et al., 2008) and cysteine source (Vorwerk et al., 2014). A recent study using the BIOLOG phenotype microarray technology suggested that the C. jejuni NCTC 11168 transporter protein Cj0917c, which has homology to the carbon starvation protein A (CstA) of E. coli, is involved in the catabolism of several tri- and dipeptides (Rasmussen et al., 2013). 
PMC4178425	CJJ81176	Results	ENA	False	This oxidoreductase has 28% protein sequence identity with Cj0264c and may catalyze the reduction of DMSO / TMAO as well. 	The dmsA gene (cju34 / cjj81176_1570) of C. jejuni 81–176 is organized in a gene cluster together with three other gene genes encoding for the iron-sulfur containing DMSO reductase subunit DmsB (CJJ81176_1571), the DMSO reductase anchor subunit DmsC (CJJ81176_1572) and chaperon protein TorD (CJJ81176_1572) that are predicted to participate with DmsA at the electron transfer to DMSO / TMAO or other S- and N-oxides (Hofreuter et al., 2006). 	Several human pathogens harbor nitrate and nitrite respiration systems (Sparacino-Watkins et al., 2014). C. jejuni encodes for the periplasmic located Nap-type nitrate reductase (Cj0780-Cj0785) catalyzing the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (Pittman and Kelly, 2005). Nitrite can subsequently be used as electron acceptor and reduced to ammonia by C. jejuni through the concerted activity of the pentaheme nitrite reductase NrfA (Cj1357c) and the electron donor protein NrfH (Cj1358c) of the tetraheme NapC/NirT cytochrome C family (Pittman et al., 2007). 
PMC4190355	rs2243250	Abstract	RefSNP	False		To clarify the effects of IL-4 gene polymorphisms on the risk of HBV-related HCC, two common variants, −590C/T (rs2243250) and −33C/T (rs2070874), and their relationship with HBV-related disease risk were investigated in a Chinese population. 	
PMC4190355	rs2243250	Introduction	RefSNP	False	The human IL-4 gene is located on chromosome 5q31 and consists of 25 kbps [16]. 	So far, more than 50 allelic variant polymorphisms have been found (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), including −590C/T (rs2243250), −33C/T (rs2070874), +3437C/G (rs2227282), and 2979G/T (rs2227284) [17]. 	The impact of IL-4 gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of HBV infection has been investigated, and numerous studies have suggested that IL-4 variants play pivotal roles in hepatitis B vaccine response and HBV infection risk [18]–[21]. However, to date, few studies have been conducted to investigate the role of these polymorphisms in HCC development [22]. 
PMC4190355	rs2243250	Introduction	RefSNP	False	However, to date, few studies have been conducted to investigate the role of these polymorphisms in HCC development [22]. 	In the present study, the two most common promoter polymorphisms of IL-4, −590C/T (rs2243250) and −33C/T (rs2070874), were evaluated in four Chinese patient groups – patients with CHB, LC, and HBV-related HCC, and a healthy control group – to determine whether these IL-4 gene polymorphisms contribute to the susceptibility of HBV-related HCC. 	
PMC4190355	rs2243250	Discussion	RefSNP	False	In a meta-analysis conducted by Zheng et al. [20] exploring the IL-4 590C/T polymorphism and its susceptibility to liver disease (including HBV infection, HCV infection, liver cirrhosis, etc.), significant associations between the IL-4 590T polymorphism and increased risk of liver diseases was found in Caucasian populations, but not in Asian populations. 	Another meta-analysis investigating the association of IL-4 polymorphisms with response to HBV vaccine and susceptibility to HBV infection, also found no evidence indicating a correlation between IL-4 polymorphisms (rs2243250 C>T) and susceptibility to HBV infection [21]. 	It is noted that all “Asian population” studies included in the two meta-analyses mentioned above were conducted in China [40]–[45]. It is noteworthy that, in the present study, the significant association between CHB in males was found in the CC genotypes of −589C/T and −33C/T polymorphisms, as opposed to the T allele in the Caucasian populations studied in the meta-analysis of Zheng et al. [20].

PMC4190437	E-MTAB-2736	Results	ArrayExpress	False	Thirty libraries were built and sequenced using the SOLID™ technology, generating 9 to 15 million reads for each library. 	All sequence data can be retrieved from the ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MTAB-2736. 	After adaptor trimming and size selection, about 70% of these reads were mapped to the EquCab2 horse genome for each sample, defining about 53998 to 97964 regions. Among these regions, 327 and 329 in cartilage and bone, respectively, overlapped with previously known mammalian miRNA (Additional file 2: Table S1-A, and Additional file 3: Table S1-B). 
PMC4222229	NCT00709592	Methods	NCT	False		Patients with recurrent hematological malignancies enrolled in a Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board approved protocol (Clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00709592) were included in this study. 	To identify all the potentially immunogenic differences that exist in a SCT DRP, whole exome sequencing was performed on previously cryopreserved DNA from the donors and recipients enrolled in this study as previously described (14). Of the nine DRP examined, four were from HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 MRD, and 5 from URD. 
PMC4222229	E-MTAB-513	Methods	ArrayExpress	False	Relative gene (and protein) expression level is a critical factor contributing to HLA class I presentation of a peptide derived from the gene (21). 	To investigate the tissue-specific expression of genes incorporating presented peptides, software from the European Bioinformatics Institute, Illumina Body Map, (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-513/) was used to correlate presented peptides from the peptide library with relative gene expression in different tissues represented in this software. 	
PMC4226036	KJ201908	Results	ENA	False	Mitochondrial gene content 	The Chrysochromulina tobin mitochondrial genome [GenBank:KJ201908] is 34,288 bp in size, has a GC content of 31.4%. 	The genome encodes 48 genes, including 25 tRNAs, 21 protein coding genes and a split ribosomal operon comprising the 16S and 23S rRNA genes (Figure 1). The mitochondrial 21 protein coding gene complement includes a single novel open reading frame (orf457) that encodes a 457 amino acid protein that lacks strong homology to any other protein within the NCBI database. 
PMC4226036	AY342361	Results	ENA	False	As in other sequenced haptophytes, NCBI translation table 4 [24] was used, where UGA codes tryptophan rather than a termination codon. 	Comparison of the genomic content among all published haptophyte genomes (E. huxleyi[25, 26]: [GenBank:AY342361, JN022704]; P. antarctica[27]: [GenBank:JN131834, JN131835]; P. globosa[27]: [GenBank:KC967226]; P. lutheri: [GenBank:HQ908424]) indicate that 14 energy and metabolism genes are conserved in all examined taxa. 	All haptophyte genomes also contain an identical complement of five ribosomal proteins (rps3, rps8, rps12, rps14, and rpl16) except for P. antarctica and P. globosa which are missing the rps8 or the rps8 and rps14 genes respectively (Table 1). Most notably, nad7, nad9 and nad11 are consistently missing from all haptophyte and rhodophyte mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date. 
PMC4226036	KJ201907	Results	ENA	False		The Chrysochromulina tobin chloroplast genome [GenBank:KJ201907] is 104,518 bp in size and has a GC content of 36.3%. 	The genome encodes 145 genes (Figure 2) including 27 tRNA coding genes, 112 protein coding genes and an inverted repeat, with each repeat copy containing the 23S, 16S and 5S rRNA genes. The tRNAs present in this genome represent all potential amino acid anticodons, including a start methionine. 
PMC4226036	AY741371	Results	ENA	False	Inverted and tandem repeats are also designated. 	The C. tobin chloroplast gene complement is similar to other sequenced haptophyte chloroplast genomes: (Table 2; E. huxleyi[26, 31]: [Genbank:AY741371, JN022705]; P. antarctica: [GenBank:NC_016703]; P. globosa[27]: [GenBank:NC_021637] and P. lutheri: [GenBank: NC_020371] [6]). 	Additionally, an “uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847” (derived from metagenomic data of oceanic samples collected from the North Atlantic [GenBank:HM565909] [34]) was included in this analysis. All haptophyte genomes are relatively small in size when compared to other microalgal species (Additional file 2). 
PMC4226036	HM565909	Results	ENA	False	The C. tobin chloroplast gene complement is similar to other sequenced haptophyte chloroplast genomes: (Table 2; E. huxleyi[26, 31]: [Genbank:AY741371, JN022705]; P. antarctica: [GenBank:NC_016703]; P. globosa[27]: [GenBank:NC_021637] and P. lutheri: [GenBank: NC_020371] [6]). 	Additionally, an “uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847” (derived from metagenomic data of oceanic samples collected from the North Atlantic [GenBank:HM565909] [34]) was included in this analysis. 	All haptophyte genomes are relatively small in size when compared to other microalgal species (Additional file 2). Gene content comparison shows E. huxleyi (113 protein-coding genes) contains dfr (a two component signaling protein) that is absent in C. tobin. Unlike C. tobin, P. antarctica and P. globosa chloroplast genomes (both having 108 genes) are missing ORF132 (unknown function), ycf20 (unknown function), thiG, and thiS (thiamine biosynthesis protein G and S respectively). 
PMC4226036	C19847	Results	ENA	False	The chloroplast genome of the phylogenetically distant haptophyte, P. lutheri, is missing 7 genes, and contains an additional 9 genes that are not found in available haptophyte chloroplast genomes (Table 2). 	While gene content is similar among all of the haptophytes analyzed, the freshwater C. tobin actually has the highest sequence identity to the marine uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847. 	This result is not too surprising given recent studies that document the occurrence of multiple, independent freshwater colonizations by haptophytes [20, 35]. 
PMC4226036	C19847	Results	ENA	False	However, C. tobin has only tRNA alanine in inverted repeat A, and tRNA isoleucine in inverted repeat B (Figure 4). 	This pattern is also likely present in the uncultured prymnesiophyte C19847. 	Only a single operon was assembled for this organism, but that operon solely contained tRNA-Ile within the ISR. Interestingly, the C19847 ribosomal operon that is adjacent to the petB gene contains a tRNA-Ile, while the ribosomal operon adjacent to petB in C. tobin contains tRNA-Ala.

The numbers (top) represent the amino acid position in the template structure, 2JL1. 	The corresponding residues in ycf39 were found by multiple sequence alignment using HHpred server [74]. To determine whether the proposed model of Ycf39 could bind an NADP molecule, a large number of NADP conformers (n = 885, see Methods) were randomly docked into the largest pocket in the Ycf39 3D model. 
PMC4226036	2JL1	Results	PDBe	False	Of the resulting random docked protein-ligand conformations obtained (n = 7,000), the top binding energy conformation is presented in Figure 8B. 	The model showed an equivalent positioning of NADP in the proposed pocket of the Ycf39 3D model as was observed in the template structure (PDB code 2JL1 and Additional file 11). 	In both cases, the nicotinamide group is buried in the protein, while the adenine group is near the surface. Additionally, locating the NADP interacting amino acids on the template (2JL1) and finding corresponding amino acids in Ycf39 based on sequence alignment showed 38% sequence identity and another 24% similarity (Figure 8C). 
PMC4226036	2JL1	Methods	PDBe	False	A total of 20440 comparative modeling trajectories were run and a few top scoring models visualized using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC). 	To dock NADP to the top-ranked predicted ycf39 structures, NADP atomic coordinates were taken from one of the HHpred search hits (PDB code 2JL1) that had a bound NADP molecule. 	Protons were added to this NADP structure using Avogadro molecule editor software [105], while the phosphate groups were kept deprotonated and the nicotinamide group was kept planar to match the deprotonated form of the molecule. The formal charge of the resulting NADP molecule was zero.

PMC4240164	rs57095329	Article	RefSNP	False	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have also drawn attention to polymorphic regions in the genomic segments coding for miR-146a and SLE-susceptibility. 	Within the Asian population, the variant rs57095329 in the promoter region of the miR-146a gene, which is suspected of reducing efficient transcription factor binding (i.e., for Ets-1), contributes to the decreased expression of the miRNA and an increased risk to develop SLE (60). 	Similarly, an increased risk for SLE was identified in European individuals possessing the variant rs2431697 in the intergenic region of miR-146a, which reduces the expression of the miRNA (61). In contrast, screening for SLE-susceptible regions in the genomic segments around miR-146a did not show any significance in an alternate sampling of the Asian population (62).

In contrast, screening for SLE-susceptible regions in the genomic segments around miR-146a did not show any significance in an alternate sampling of the Asian population (62). Taken together, these studies suggest that the under-expression of miR-146a in SLE may contribute to an aberrant IFN-signature during the course of the disease.

PMC4251355	K01803	Results	ENA	False	Absence of length mutation (nucleotide position 473–481) in Malaysian FeLV isolates, as observed in FeLV isolates from Taiwan (FeLV-TW-25 and FeLV-TW-30) and a European isolate (FeLV-GM1), might suggest limited influence of geography in evolutionary patterns of FeLV, unlike its lentiviral counterpart, feline immunodeficiency virus [33, 48]. 	Phylogenetic analysis based on the U3LTR-gag sequence revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates are closely related (Tables 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c)) but when compared with reference isolates, separated into two distinct clusters, with the majority (86.2%) being closely related to FeLV-K01803 isolate from UK. 	The remaining local FeLV isolates (13.8%) clustered with FeLV-GM1 (Figure 2). The reason for the observed similarity between local FeLV isolates and European isolates, but not with Taiwanese isolates, may suggest the lack of geographical influence, this should be explored further. 
PMC4251355	K01803	Conclusion	ENA	False	This study revealed the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA among naturally infected Malaysian cats. 	Based on the U3LTR-gag sequence, Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly conserved and more closely related to K01803 isolate from UK compared to Taiwanese and other reference isolates. 	Presence of multiple enhancers some of which have been linked with FeLV induced tumours may contribute to the development of poor prognostic outcome in naturally infected Malaysian cats although this needs further investigation. Overall, this is the first molecular study for evidence of FeLV in Malaysia. 
PMC4253427	ss1509426	Results	RefSNP	False	In this respect, Freemantle and Moran previously showed that the minimal promoter (MP) of FPGS resides 43bp upstream to the first methionine of the mitochondrial leader sequence and extends 150bp into the first exon [21]. 	We therefore sequenced a 300bp DNA fragment upstream to the first methionine, the entire exon1 as well as the entire 3′-UTR; we found that the MP of FPGS was free of mutations, whereas the 3′-UTR contained the single nucleotide polymorphism ss1509426 (T1956C) in both parental and MTA C-3 cells. 	Thus, no sequence alterations in these regulatory elements could account for the differences in the expression of the WT and mutant FPGS alleles in MTA C-3 cells. Exon12 of FPGS has transcriptional regulatory capability 
PMC4253427	1jbw	Methods	PDBe	False	To generate the 3D model of the hFPGS, a multiple alignment of the hFPGS was performed by 10 iterations of HHpred using HHblitz MSA generation method. 	The L.casei FPGS, the crystal structure of which was previously reported (PDB 1jbw), scored the highest in conservation and was therefore used as a template to generate the 3D model of the hFPGS using Modeller. 	The model was visualized using UCSF Chimera [44]. MatInspector (Genomatix) was used to analyze the MP, UPE and exon12 of FPGS for putative TFs binding sites.

PMC4255922	277400	Introduction	OMIM	False		The cblC defect (ORPHA 79282; MIM 277400) is an inborn error of intracellular cobalamin (cbl) metabolism caused by mutations in the MMACHC gene, which is located on chromosome 1p34.1 [1]. 	Due to the defective MMACHC gene product, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin cannot be synthesized. Since methylcobalamin is the essential cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase, the defect causes an impairment of the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine (Met).

PMC4278900	158900	Introduction	OMIM	False	Notably, monozygotic twin discordance has been reported, thus suggesting a strong epigenetic component in the disease [3], [4]. 	Two forms of the disease have been described: FSHD1 (MIM 158900) and FSHD2 (MIM 158901). 	Different from most Mendelian disorders, FSHD1 (accounting for 95% of FSHD cases) is not due to a mutation in a protein-coding gene. Instead, it is linked to reduction in copy number of a 3,3 kb macrosatellite repeat called D4Z4, located in the long arm of human chromosome 4 (4q35).

PMC4284131	160500	Introduction	OMIM	False	The inherited distal myopathies are a group of genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by weakness of the distal muscles of the arms and legs. 	They are caused by defects in several genes including TTN, DYSF, GNE, LDB3, and MYH7.1MYH7 (slow/β-cardiac myosin heavy chain 7) is expressed in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle,2 and mutations can give rise to a familial hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy3 as well as several skeletal muscle disorders: Laing distal myopathy (MPD1; MIM# 160500), scapuloperoneal myopathy (MIM# 181430), and myosin storage myopathy (MSM)/hyaline body myopathy (MIM# 608358). 	Laing distal myopathy4–7 presents clinically with weakness and atrophy of the forearm finger extensors and the anterior compartment muscles of the legs.1 Only within the last decade, MYH7 has been identified as a gene causing distal skeletal myopathy.6 Although clinical findings have been fairly uniform, biopsy findings have proven to be more varied. Observed features include type 1 fiber atrophy, myofiber degeneration with regeneration, endomysial fibrosis, and fatty replacement.

PMC4309091	rs4950928	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Furthermore, we sought to compare the magnitude of any effects on vascular risk observed for YKL‐40 to the magnitude of effect observed for 3 alternative systemic inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, sICAM‐1, and fibrinogen). 	Finally, we evaluated the role of a prespecified lead single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs rs4950928, and 40 additional SNPs at the chitinase 3‐like 1 (CHI3L1) gene locus as potential determinants of YKL‐40 levels and for their effect on incident vascular events among the 23 294 study participants of European ancestry. 	
PMC4309091	rs4950928	Methods	RefSNP	False	For the genetic component of the current analysis, genotype data were evaluated for 41 SNPs within 110 kb 5′ to 40 kb 3′ of the CHI3L1 encoding YKL‐40 protein. 	Genotypes for 40 of these SNPs were obtained as part of the WGHS, which used the Illumina (San Diego, CA) HumanHap300 Duo+platform to query a genome‐wide panel of tag and candidate SNPs, as described previously.12 Given previous data16 and to avoid issues related to linkage disequilibrium and multiple hypothesis testing, we elected, on an a priori basis, to use rs4950928 as the lead SNP for these analyses. 	Thus, in addition to the above 40 SNPs, genotypes for rs4950928 were derived by imputation with MaCH v.1.0.16 using the HapMap2 release 22 CEU reference panel and had imputation quality of R2=0.91. One of the directly genotyped SNPs, rs946263, was in high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2=0.78 in 1000 genomes CEU panel) with rs4950928.

PMC4309091	rs946263	Methods	RefSNP	False	Thus, in addition to the above 40 SNPs, genotypes for rs4950928 were derived by imputation with MaCH v.1.0.16 using the HapMap2 release 22 CEU reference panel and had imputation quality of R2=0.91.

To investigate the relationship of genetic variation in CHI3L1 to plasma levels of YKL‐40, we limited our analyses to those women who participated in the plasma component of this study and who were of European ancestry (N=614). Median levels of YKL‐40 were computed by genotype for each of the 41 SNPs and association tests used to evaluate for statistical significance of any effect of genotype on YKL‐40 levels. 
PMC4309091	rs4950928	Results	RefSNP	False	Multiple SNPs at the CHI3L1 locus (many in LD with each other) were significantly associated with plasma YKL‐40 levels. 	For example, as shown in Figure 3 for the prespecified lead SNP at rs4950928, median levels of YKL‐40 were significantly higher for those with the CC (40.4 ng/mL) than with the GG genotype (17.5 ng/mL), whereas CG heterozygotes had intermediate YKL‐40 levels (31.0 ng/mL; P‐trend in plasma YKL‐40 levels across genotypes, <0.0001).

PMC4309091	rs4950928	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The association with stroke persisted after control for several lipid and nonlipid CV risk factors and had a magnitude of effect similar to that of the nonspecific inflammatory biomarker, hsCRP (Figure 2). 	In these analyses, both environmental and genetic factors influenced YKL‐40 levels, though SNPs associated with lifelong differences in plasma YKL‐40 levels, including the lead SNP at rs4950928, were not, in turn, significantly associated with incident vascular events. 	Earlier clinical data relating plasma YKL‐40 to vascular disease and vascular risk factors have included cross‐sectional and retrospective studies. For example, in previous studies as in our data, YKL‐40 levels have been found to increase with age, blood pressure, and severity of insulin resistance.25–26 However, it is difficult in cross‐sectional or retrospective study designs to discern whether elevations of YKL‐40 precede or are a result of specific vascular or metabolic abnormalities. 
PMC4309091	rs4950928	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Despite expression in several disease states, the function of YKL‐40 in humans remains uncertain. 	In our data, and as shown in patients with or at risk for asthma,16 genetic polymorphism at CHI3L1 has a major effect on plasma YKL‐40 levels, with more than a doubling of levels when comparing individuals with the CC and GG genotypes at rs4950928. 	Yet, unlike earlier data for asthma, where genotypes associated with higher YKL‐40 levels were also associated with a higher prevalence of asthma,16 we were unable to detect a statistically significant influence of genotype on incident vascular events. However, the total number of vascular events is relatively modest in our secondary genomic analyses, particularly for events of thromboembolic stroke, where the plasma data are most informative.

PMC4407186	rs8007267	Article	RefSNP	False	Furthermore decreased BH4 levels have been demonstrated to lead to NOS uncoupling, which results in increased oxidative and nitrative stress (Chen et al., 2014). 	The authors previously described that a haplotype of three SNPs (rs8007267, rs3783641 and rs10483639) at the GCH1 genomic locus influences plasma GCH1 activity and BH4 levels (Antoniades et al., 2008) and identified BH4 as a vascular defence mechanism against inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction (Antoniades et al., 2011). 	Consequently the authors propose that a link between BH4 levels, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation could represent the mechanism underlying GCH1-associated Parkinson’s disease. Fitting well with this model, and possibly supporting Ryan et al.’s view, we found that the GCH1 SNP (rs11158026), recently identified as a risk variant for Parkinson’s disease (Nalls et al., 2014), is in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r2 0.457; D’ 0.932) with the SNPs constituting the functional haplotype.

PMC4413647	CGP57380	Discussion	ENA	False	In the present study, NRs treatment dramatically reduced the expression of MNK1, MNK2, and peIF4Eser209 without affecting total eIF4E expression. 	Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and clinically relevant retinoids-ATRA and 4-HPR. 	Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs, the critical activators of eIF4E. Degradation of MNKs by VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to 5′ mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation initiation [30].

PMC4417161	4C2M	Discussion	PDBe	False	Three correspond to amino acids (Proline 253, Glycine 254 and Aspartate 269) that are adjacent to one another in the yeast AC40 crystal structure (14,15) and are also adjacent to the conserved arginine (position R271 of yeast AC40) whose mutation in human AC40 (POLR1C) is associated with Treacher-Collins Syndrome (Figure 5B and C) (29,61,62). 	In the yeast Pol I crystal structure (Protein Data Bank structure 4C2M, (14)), this patch of amino acids in AC40 contacts the Pol I-specific A34.5 subunit (Figure 5E), suggesting that differences at these conserved positions in NRPA3 and NRPC3 of Arabidopsis (and related species) are good candidates for specifying Pol I- versus Pol III-specific interactions. 	By contrast, amino acid differences in NRPA3 versus NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast Y84 or I63 are less likely to be critical because these positions interact with Rpb12 and AC19 in yeast AC40 (Figure 5F), which are subunits common to Pols I and III in yeast and Arabidopsis (with the caveat that Rpb12 association with Pol I was not confirmed by mass spectrometry in our study). Amino acid differences in NRPA3 and NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast I72, Q93 or R293 are also potential candidates for mediating Pol I versus Pol III-specific interactions, as these positions make polymerase-specific contacts, such as with the A135 catalytic subunit of Pol I (Figure 5G and H).

PMC4607013	163950	Introduction	OMIM	False		Noonan syndrome (NS, OMIM 163950) is a relatively common developmental disorder belonging to the RASopathies, a group of clinically and genetically related syndromes [1, 2]. 	The molecular cause underlying RASopathies is dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and 15 different genes affecting this pathway have been associated to RASopathies. Of these 15 genes, eleven have been found to be involved in NS or NS-like conditions, where mutations in PTPN11 are the cause of ~50 % of the cases. 
PMC4619622	121011	Introduction	OMIM	False	Approximately one in 1000 children is affected by severe hearing loss at birth or during early childhood, which is defined as pre-lingual deafness [3, 4], with approximately half of these cases attributable to genetic causes [5]. 	Among the >100 known forms of non-syndromic deafness with identified genetic loci, by far the most common and best characterized is the one associated with GJB2 (OMIM 121011), the gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) [6]. 	We previously reported the generation of mouse models for Cx26-associated deafness and their molecular pathophysiologies. We recently showed that the delayed programmed cell death observed in Cx26 mutant mice resulted in an abnormal shapes for the organ of Corti [7], and mutation of Cx26 resulted in a drastic disruption and reduction in the gap junction plaque as well as an ion transport disorder. 
PMC4641828	KT867373	Methods	ENA	False	To identify different isoforms of Caprin-2 several different clones were analysed by restriction with frequently cutting enzymes (4-cutters): Alu I (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA), Dpn I (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA), Hae I and Rsa I (New England Biolabs), followed by agarose gel, and sequencing analysis (Source BioScience). 	We found that, similar to mouse Caprin-2 (ENSMUST00000111569), the rat Caprin-2 gene consists of 18 coding exons (Supplementary file 1; Genbank accession number—KT867373). 	To maintain consistency with the mouse sequence, we labeled them 2–19. Since several different isoforms of Caprin-2 have been found in human (Aerbajinai et al., 2004), we also looked for different Caprin-2 isoforms in rat brain. 
PMC4641828	AC_000072.1	Methods	RefSeq	False	We found that the longest isoform was 3090 bp long, which encodes 1029 aa. 	Exons were predicted on the basis of GT and AG flanking regions of introns in rat Caprin-2 gene (NCBI reference sequence AC_000072.1, 170273255–170328842, complement strand) and verified by comparison to the mouse Caprin-2 sequence ENSMUST00000111569. 	We then identified four other isoforms, which are shorter than the first one due to the absence of several base pairs (Cap2-2), or to the removal of entire exons (E13 and 14 in Cap2-3, E17 in Cap2-4, E13 in Cap2-5) (Supplementary file 1). Previous studies have shown that human Caprin-2 is homologous to Xenopus RNG105, which is also known in rodents as Caprin 1 (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010).

PMC4654818	IPR004618	Results	InterPro	False	High levels of expression were also observed for dUTPase, another enzyme predicted to be involved in nucleotide biosynthesis [53]. 	The most highly transcribed metabolic enzyme was an asparagine synthetase A (asnA, THOM_2136, InterPro ID: IPR004618). 	Among Microsporidia, coding sequences for this protein are found on the genomes of T. hominis, V. culicis, Enterocytozoon bienieusi, N. ceranae and Nosema pernyi, and were likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from bacteria [10, 11]. Among eukaryotes, AsnA is almost exclusively found in parasites [10] including Typanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani, where it is essential for survival [54, 55]. 
PMC4654818	IPR004364	Results	InterPro	False	One possibility is that microsporidian AsnA may play important roles in interconversion between essential amino acids, including glutamine, an important precursor to both chitin biosynthesis for spore wall formation and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis required in parasite detoxification systems. 	This ORF contains an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (class II) domain (InterPro ID: IPR004364) suggesting that it may also function to add asparagine to its cognate tRNA. 	Its specificity to parasitic eukaryotes, coupled with its functional importance, high expression level, and the availability of an AsnA crystal structure make the protein a promising potential drug target [55]. Maintaining supplies of glutamine is important for the generation of GSH, a detoxifying molecule required for the prevention of damage by reactive oxygen species [57].

Bowtie2 [99] was used to separately index the genomes of T. hominis and O. cuniculus. Quality control on the raw RNA sequencing reads was performed using FastQC [100] and Illumina sequencing adapters and low quality bases were trimmed using fastq-mcf [101]. In order to quantify the expression levels of T. hominis transcripts, and for novel transcript discovery, TopHat2 [102] was used to map quality-filtered reads from each infected sample to the T. hominis genome.

In addition, the analysis also reveals that both Royal Kelantan Malay genomes shared 3 SNP markers; HBG1 (rs1061234), HBB (rs1609812) and BCL11A (rs766432) where all three markers were associated with beta-thalassemia. 	
PMC4685156	rs1061234	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The analysis revealed that both Royal Kelantan Malays (Melayu Kelantan) genomes shared 3 SNP markers, where all three markers were associated with beta-thalassemia. 	The SNPs implicated in the disease, rs1061234, rs1609812 and rs766432 were identified in the HBG1, HBB and BCL11A genes, respectively. 	BCL11A functions as a myeloid and B-cell proto-oncogene and plays important roles in leukemogenesis and hematopoiesis. An essential factor in lymphopoiesis is required for B-cell formation in fetal liver and may function as a modulator of the transcriptional repression activity of ARP1.

PMC4799242	KF836512	Discussion	ENA	False	In Europe, the metaanalysis of the mean prevalence of Borrelia spp. infections in ticks indicates that the overall mean was 18.6 % in adults and 10.1 % in nymphs (Rauter and Hartung 2005). 	The obtained fla gen sequence differed by one nucleotide with, among the other, sequences of B. garinii isolate O2-27 from I. ricinus, Lower Silesia, Poland (KF836512), B. garinii strain J3-1F-IR from I. canisuga feeding on a red fox Vulpes vulpes, Poland (KF918608) (Wodecka et al. unpublished), and B. garinii strain BRZ38 from I. ricinus collected in Moravia, Czech Republic (JF828688) (Norek et al. unpublished). 	In Europe, B. garinii follows B. afzelii as the most prevalent B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies (Reye et al. 2010). In Poland, the prevalence of B. garinii in infected ticks ranged between 10.1 and 21.4 % (Cisak et al. 2006; Kiewra et al. 2014; Stańczak et al. 2000; Strzelczyk et al. 2006). 
PMC4799242	KF447530	Discussion	ENA	False	Further sequencing of gltA fragment enabled definitive identification. 	The sequence was 100 % comparable with sequences of R. helvetica isolated from I. ricinus ticks along Europe, from France (KF447530), Germany (JX627379, strain 4TI3; KC007126, isolate 6DI76), Romania (JX040636; strain 99Bc/Romania) to Russia (AM418450, isolate 1–97). 	Moreover, the consensus sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was identical to R. helvetica clone CsFC (GQ413963) isolated from human cerebrospinal fluid (Påhlson, unpublished), Rickettsia sp.

R. helvetica is widely distributed in the tick population in Poland with the mean prevalence up to 10.6 % (Chmielewski et al. 2009; Stańczak et al. 2008) and was also noted in ticks feeding on deer hosts (10.8–19.0 %) (Stańczak et al. 2009).

PMC4854269	NT_007933	Article	RefSeq	False	In humans, P-gp is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily and is encoded by the ABCB1 gene located on chromosome 7q21.12 (UCSC Genome Browser, March 2006 Assembly [hg18]).21,22 	The complete molecular structure of the gene is well known. ABCB1 was first cloned in the year 1985.23 The gene contains 28 exons and 28 introns in a genomic region of 209.6 kb (GenBank accession number NT_007933).24 Transcriptional start region consists of a proximal and distal promoter. 	Proximal promoter responsible for constitutive expression is present in exon 1 and intron 1, while distal promoter is active in patients with cancer for overexpression of the protein product. However, two 5′ exons are not translated. 
PMC4854269	3B5W	Article	PDBe	False	Out of 28 introns, 26 that left disrupt the protein-coding sequence relative to the open reading frame, thereby suggesting that the P-gp arose by fusion of genes.25 	The first structure of a mammalian P-gp was derived from the mouse Mdr3 gene product heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast in the year 2009.26 The structure of mouse P-gp is almost similar to the bacterial ABC transporter MsbA (3B5W and 3B5X).27ABCB1 gene is expressed as 4,872 bp-long messenger RNA (mRNA),24,25 which encodes P-gp, a single polypeptide chain of 1,280 amino acids. 	It has a molecular weight of 170 kDa and spans ~100 kb. Both the N and C termini of the polypeptide chain are cytoplasmic and contain three N-linked glycosylation sites (N91, N94, and N99) of 10–15 kDa in the first extracellular loop.28,29 P-gp consists of two similar halves with >65% amino acid similarity.30 The two halves are separated by a flexible linker region.30 Each half is made up of six transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic NBD. 
PMC4854269	rs2032582	Article	RefSNP	False		Out of 66 SNPs, three of them in the coding region of ABCB1 gene such as 2677G>T/A (exon 21, rs2032582), 3435C>T (exon 26, rs1045642), and 1236C>T (exon 12, rs1128503) are extensively studied and characterized. 	Studies have shown these polymorphisms to be associated with altered mRNA levels,52 protein folding,53 and drug pharmacokinetics.54 The 2677G>T/A polymorphism is a triallelic variant, and it is found in the wild-type sequence with G at nucleotide 2677 and in the variant sequence with A or T. It is located on the intracellular side of P-gp after transmembrane region 10.

H. melpomene orthologues were then blasted against H. numata sequence. H. numata sequences are available in the Sequence Read Archive under the project number PRJNA317526. 	Specific DNA oligonucleotide primers were designed using sequences from H. numata coupled with H. melpomene’s genome annotation to identify exonic regions (Table 1). To distinguish cDNA amplicons from amplicons produced from residual traces of genomic DNA, we preferentially designed primers on either side of an intron.

PMC4957768	ECK36980	Introduction	ENA	False	Although their function has yet to be fully elucidated, putative vertebrate-like male hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; as well as steroidogenic androgen- and estrogen-producing enzymes, such as aromatase and 5α-reductase; have been found in the gonads and digestive tract of several invertebrate groups [19–23], particularly mollusks and annelids. 	Moreover, the genes encoding for 5α-reductase have been sequenced in several mollusk species (e.g. Crassostrea gigas (ECK36980), Lottia gigantea (Pid: 194080)), perhaps suggesting that similar mechanisms exist in invertebrates. 	Prior to the commencement of the research presented in this manuscript, the presence of a ‘classical’ androgen receptor (AR) in mollusks had been inferred [24,25], but this has remained an area of controversy [26], since homologues have not been identified despite investigations specifically searching for the gene [27]. Recently, systematic searches of mollusk genomes have failed to identify an androgen receptor [28,29] homolog suggesting that the reported effects of androgens in mollusks must be attributed to a different mechanism, either using different nuclear receptors or potentially through non-genomic membrane-bound receptors. 
PMC4957768	JZ875074	Methods	ENA	False	Cluster analyses were performed using Seqtools (8.4ver) (http://www.seqtools.dk/). 	Unique sequences were compared to GenBANK using BlastN, BlastX and tBlastX using Blast2go (http://www.blast2go.com) and submitted to GenBank (Accession Numbers JZ875074-JZ875078). 	
PMC4957768	DY523257	Results	ENA	False	None were identified from ovotestis (all the sequences were a poly SMART primer artifact). 	Homology searches (Table 2) indicated that, of the 3 MT dosed specific transcripts from the albumen gland, 2 had no known protein homologues, although they matched (Expect value E = 0) previously sequenced B. glabrata ESTs (GenBank: DY523257.1 (and 29 other ESTs) and CV548292.1). 	The other transcript identified (E = 0) a c-type lectin previously identified in B. glabrata (EB709537.1). The control-specific transcripts were identical to a previously sequenced lipopolysaccharide binding protein/bactericidal permeability increasing protein (GenBank: KC206037; [43]) and a gram-negative binding protein (GenBank:EF452345.1; [44]). 
PMC4957768	KC206037	Results	ENA	False	The other transcript identified (E = 0) a c-type lectin previously identified in B. glabrata (EB709537.1). 	The control-specific transcripts were identical to a previously sequenced lipopolysaccharide binding protein/bactericidal permeability increasing protein (GenBank: KC206037; [43]) and a gram-negative binding protein (GenBank:EF452345.1; [44]). 	Quantitative PCR using specific primers was carried out to determine if gene expression levels for the differentially expressed transcripts, found in the pooled samples, were differentially expressed across all individuals. However, qPCR indicated that one specific individual, exposed to MT, was biasing the libraries (Fig 4) even though equal amounts of RNA had been pooled. 
PMC4964384	rs12208357	Results	RefSNP	False	Computational Predictions for Coding SNPs 	For the SLC22A1 gene, which encodes the Oct1 protein, results from the analysis of two cSNPs (rs12208357 and rs34059508) are discussed here. 	The analysis of rs34130495 is reported in the Figure S1. The rs12208357—a C/T substitution in the first exon of SLC22A1 (Figure 1A)—causes R61C amino acid substitution into an extracellular topological domain of Oct1 protein (organic cation transporter 1; UniProt ID O15245) involved in the binding of the substrate. 
PMC4964384	O15245	Results	UniProt	False	The analysis of rs34130495 is reported in the Figure S1. 	The rs12208357—a C/T substitution in the first exon of SLC22A1 (Figure 1A)—causes R61C amino acid substitution into an extracellular topological domain of Oct1 protein (organic cation transporter 1; UniProt ID O15245) involved in the binding of the substrate. 	It leads to a decreased binding affinity to substrates [14]. Notably, the mutated residue is not charged, is smaller and more hydrophobic than the arginine, and it is predicted to alter inter-residual interactions and the correct folding of the ion channel. 
PMC4964384	rs1801278	Results	RefSNP	False	In addition, taking advantage of public human transcriptome data (available at Gene Expression Atlas; [15]) we found that SLC22A1 has high tissue-specific expression, mainly restricted to the liver (Figure S10). 	For the IRS1 gene, we focused on a cSNP (rs1801278) in the exon 1 that causes the G971R change. 	Notably, it is often referred to as G972R, even though—according to dbSNP and UniProt databases—the exact nomenclature is G971R. Thus, we will refer to it as “G971R”. 
PMC4964384	rs1799853	Results	RefSNP	False	This is in line with the pleiotropic role of Irs1 protein in the activation of the PI3K/AKT1/GSK3 signaling pathway, and, consequently, in the stimulation of glucose transport and of glycogen synthesis [16]. 	Finally, we analyzed cSNPs (rs1799853 and rs1057910) in the CYP2C9 gene associated with sulphonylureas resistance. 	The gene encodes for cytochrome P450-2C9, a hepatic enzyme involved in the metabolism of most of sulphonylureas. The rs1799853 is a C/T variation in the exon 3 (R144C; Figure 1C) and is associated with resistance to sulphamethaxazole in T2D patients [17,18]. 
PMC4964384	rs1801278	Results	RefSNP	False	Interestingly, as schematized in Figure 2, rs34130495 (in the SLC22A1 gene) disrupts the consensus sequence recognized by Tcf12, Tfap2a, Tfap2c and Max, and the rs35167514 in the same gene alters a binding site for Max, a master transcriptional regulator. 	The SNP rs1801278 (IRS1 gene) falls within a Pol2a consensus sequence, while the rs3842570 in CAPN10 gene falls within the binding site of Znf263, a negative transcriptional regulator. 	Using a similar approach, we also analyzed whether drug resistance-associated SNPs map to genomic regions hypersensitive to DNAseI digestion, i.e., nucleosome-free transcriptional regulatory regions usually accessible to transcription factors. In line with the previous analysis, the rs34130495 and rs35167514 SNPs in SLC22A1 falls within a strong DNAseI hypersensitive site (DHS), supported by experimental evidence in 80 cell lines. 
PMC4964384	rs3842570	Results	RefSNP	False	Weaker evidence has been also found for rs5030952 in CAPN10 and rs757110 in ABCC8 genes (DHS reported in 23 and 14 cell lines, respectively). 	The rs12208357 in SLC22A1 gene falls in a DHS were reported only in hepatocytes and medulloblastoma, while, for the SNP rs3842570, in chorion cells and pancreatic islets. 	Similar analysis was also carried out on computationally predicted consensus for TFBS (Jaspar and TRANSFAC databases). The rs5219 SNP—which causes the K23E substitution in KCNJ11 gene (Figure S3)—maps to the consensus of the nuclear receptor PPARγ, and it is predicted to alter the binding affinity of this TF, a crucial player in glucose and lipid homeostasis and that is associated with metabolic disorders [19]. 
PMC4964384	rs3792267	Results	RefSNP	False	The new transcript reconstructed from RNA-Seq overlaps an AceView [20] gene model (CAPN10 and GPR35.mAug10-unspliced) and EST BF528146. 	Similarly, the SNP rs3792267—located in the third intron of the same gene—overlaps a new transcribed region—unspliced ESTs (BQ899318, AL703891 and DA094595) from sciatic nerve and cerebellum libraries and a transcript annotated as “retained intron” in Ensembl and GENCODE databases (ENST00000494738). 	Taking advantage of RNA-Seq transcript reconstruction combined with a RT-PCR assay in RT+ (Reverse Transcriptase) and RT-cDNA from HEK293 cell line (Methods), we could confirm that both of the SNPs map to actively transcribed regions, despite being currently annotated as “intronic” SNPs of the CAPN10 gene. Direct Sanger sequencing validated our findings (Figure 3). 
PMC4964384	rs12255372	Results	RefSNP	False	We concluded that rs5030952 should be considered an ”intronic” SNP of this new transcript encompassing CAPN10 and GPR35 loci. 	Similarly, we found that the intronic SNPs associated with TCF7L2 (rs12255372 and rs7903146) map to a transcribed region (data not shown) and overlap two unspliced ESTs (details in the Table S1). 	Finally, taking advantage of our recently published—and still unpublished—RNA-Seq datasets, we investigated whether the presence of these SNPs may correlate to gene expression levels. RNA-Seq datasets of two HEK293 replicates, 22 thyroid [21], 2 MCF7 [22], eight heart biopsies (manuscript in preparation) were analyzed in order to find samples homozygous for the wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous for the alternative alleles. 
PMC4964384	rs5219	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Interestingly, we found that all analyzed SNPs fall within at least one TF binding site or genomic region overlapping a DHS and/or CpG island or a splicing regulatory region, according to public ChIP-Seq data and computational predictions. 	In particular, since few studies investigated the role of polymorphism rs5219 in the KCNJ11 gene in therapeutic response to sulphonylureas [9] or hypoglycemia risk [29], we inferred that this SNP falls in a PPARγ binding site and within a CpG island located in the gene body, possibly linking such variant to altered KCNJ11 expression. 	However, although we could not find any statistically significant association between this SNP and mRNA levels in our RNA-Seq datasets, we cannot definitely exclude such a mechanism. More interestingly, we found that SNPs, until now annotated as “intronic” or “intergenic”, are misannotated. 
PMC4964384	rs3842570	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Indeed, through ab initio transcriptome reconstruction and experimental validations we have shown they map inside mature mRNAs. 	Two intronic CAPN10 SNPs (rs3842570 and rs3792267) belong to actively transcribed (and spliced) CAPN10 transcripts. 	Our findings are in line with the gene predictions of AceView database and with ESTs. Notably, the former SNP (a 1 bp deletion) is located in an intron splicing enhancer region, and its presence is predicted to affect the binding of two different splicing factors.

GCED was defined as a tumor having a primitive intestine-like structure composed of cuboidal or columnar cells with clear cytoplasm and immunohistochemical positivity for either alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), Glypican 3 (clone 1G12, 1:200; BioMosaics, Burlington, VT, United States) or SALL4 (clone 6E3, 1:100; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan).

In this regard, we took advantage of GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and chose three independent GSE studies that reported metastasis of colon (GSE2509), melanoma (GSE8401), and pancreatic cancer cells after TGFβ exposure (GSE23952) to find commonly altered gene(s) after metastasis (Figure S3A). 	We found 28 genes with altered expression (greater than two fold, p < 0.05) (Figure S3B). We further narrowed down these 28 candidates using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with the terms “adhesion” and “signal”, and identified 16 gene candidates (nine downregulated genes and seven up-regulated genes) (Figure 5A).

PMC5058631	1S78	Introduction	PDBe	False	All three proteins comprise a similar structure with 2 V-class domains responsible for antigen binding and 2 C-class domains linked by a C-terminal inter-chain disulfide bond. 	For the study described here, we utilized pertuzumab (pdb 1S78) as a representative κ LC Fab and PGT128 (pdb 3TV3) as a representative λ LC Fab. 	On the bottom, are schematics of the chimeric Fabs that were generated to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of variable and constant domains within Fabs.

The additional Fabs originated from pdbs 1NL0 (10C12 Fab) and 3THM (EP6b_B01 Fab).25,26 Both Fabs expressed well as monodisperse proteins. 	DSC data showed that both Fabs had much higher thermal stability than PGT128 (Fig. 5C). Both had very high thermal stability, with Tms greater than or equal to 6 °C the Tm (78 °C) observed for the CH1/Cλ subunit in isolation.

Accoding to the literatures and research studies, PulB from B. naganoensis (GenBank accession number AB231790.1), with an optimum temperature of 60°C and optimum pH 4.5 [10,11], meets the criteria necessary for saccharification. 	And PulB from B. naganoensis has better catalytic activity [27–29]. But by preliminary trial, it shows good stability under acidic conditions but not under thermal stress, limiting its further application. 
PMC5072729	P07711	Methods	UniProt	False	To find out the binding modes of cathepsin-cystatin/stefin complexes, crystallographic and modeled structures of stefin A, B, cystatin C, D, F, M/E, S, SA & SN were docked with CL1 using protein-protein rigid body docking program ZDOCK [34] of Discovery Studio (DS) 2.5. 	The active site of CL1 (CYS 25, HIS 163, ASN 187) [UniProt ID: P07711] and the possible inhibitory sites of cystatins [6, 35] were defined to screen the potential docking configurations. 	A total of 2000 docked poses were generated for each of the cystatin/stefin-cathepsin complexes and ranked based on the default ZDOCK scoring function [36, 37] combining shape complementarities with electrostatics and desolvation energy (DE), and subsequently re-ranked with a more detailed weighted energy function ZRANK [38]. On basis of known cathepsin-cystatin/stefin conformations, binding site root mean square deviation (RMSD) were calculated and all docked poses within 7Å deviation were subjected to RDOCK [39] for further refinement. 
PMC5072729	1ICF	Results	PDBe	False	The unbound CL1s were named after the corresponding CL1-stefin/cystatin complex (say, CL1A denotes the unbound CL1 taken from CL1-Stefin A complex) from which its initial coordinates were taken as stated in MDS section under Methods. 	The amino acid residues of stefins/cystatins were referred according to their positions in the alignment (S2 Fig) and for CL1 the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1ICF) numbering was followed. 	Consistency of simulations: unbound cathepsins All nine simulations of unbound CL1 were appeared to be in stable state in terms of intra-protein, protein-solvent electrostatic and VDW energy (Fig 1A). 
PMC5072729	1ICF	Results	PDBe	False	Here a true representative average structure of every trajectory was computed by an iterative procedure; average structure was calculated using the first frame and then repeated with the resulting average structure until the RMSD between successive average structure becomes <0.001 Å [50]. 	The individual trajectory-average structures of CL1 differed from the crystal structure by 0.873–1.033 Å, compared to a 0.272–0.419 Å difference with respect to the global trajectory-average; while they differed from each other by 0.399–0.639 Å. S3 Table showed, the individual trajectory-averages of unbound CL1s (CL1A—CL1SN) were closer to the global trajectory average (CL1GT) than the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1ICF). 	Little variation among these average structures pointed towards convergence of simulation and indicated toward possible overlap of conformational spaces between the trajectories [51]. In fact PCA depicts an overlap of 0.327–0.614 among individual trajectories and 0.449–0.643 between individual and global trajectories (S4 Table).

PMC5108427	NCT02132936	Discussion	NCT	False		In addition to the enhanced potency demonstrated by this study, a Phase III study has demonstrated that Cal/BD aerosol foam is highly efficacious and well‐tolerated.21 Phase II studies have demonstrated significantly greater efficacy of Cal/BD aerosol foam compared with each individual active component used alone (Cal aerosol foam and BD aerosol foam),22 and compared with Cal/BD ointment.23 A further Phase III trial has been performed (NCT02132936). 	Enhanced delivery and increased bioavailability of the active components in the skin,6 as well as increased treatment efficacy,7, 22 may translate into less medication and exposure to corticosteroid being required for effective disease management; however, this requires further investigation. No AEs were reported during this study, although it must be considered that the study was in healthy volunteers and the treatment period was very short (32 h), meaning that very few AEs would be expected.

PMC5122352	rs2853677	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The binding of Snail1 to the enhancer disrupts enhancer-promoter colocalization and silences TERT transcription. 	The high risk variant of rs2853677 disrupts the Snail1 binding site and derepresses TERT expression in response to Snail1 upregulation, thus increasing lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility. 	Our data suggest that Snail1 may be a co-factor of rs2853677 for predicting lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility and prognosis.

However, how these SNPs affect lung cancer susceptibility is completely unknown.

Here, we investigated these 6 previously reported risk loci and confirmed that rs2853677 in the second intron of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is associated with a high risk of lung adenocarcinoma in the Han Chinese population. 	A DNA fragment encompassing rs2853677 functions as an enhancer, which increases TERT transcription when colocalizing with TERT promoter. Snail1 binds to the enhancer, reconfigures the chromatin structure within the TERT gene, and represses TERT transcription. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Introduction	RefSNP	False	Snail1 binds to the enhancer, reconfigures the chromatin structure within the TERT gene, and represses TERT transcription. 	The high risk allele of rs2853677 disrupts the Snail1 binding site, causing derepression of TERT transcription in response to Snail1 upregulation. 	Our data implicate that rs2853677 may be a potential biomarker for prognosis in Snail1 associated cancer. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	False	The TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. 	To test whether rs2853677 resides in a cis-regulatory element of TERT, a 600 bp fragment encompassing the rs2853677 was amplified from human A549 cellular DNA that carries the T/C genotype of rs2853677. 	PCR products with the T or C allele were inserted into a construct containing a luciferase reporter gene, upstream of the TERT promoter in the original or inverted orientation. Luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the − 518 to + 10 fragment exhibited basal promoter activity. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	False	Our data indicate that rs2853677 is located in a functional enhancer of TERT. 	Thus, the polymorphism of rs2853677 may affect the transcription of TERT by altering the binding affinity of a transcription factor. 	rs2853677-C disrupts a binding site for Snail1 and abolishes the suppressive role of Snail1 in TERT transcription Bioinformatic analysis revealed that CG[C/T]CTG is a potential binding site of the Snail family of proteins. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	False	Neither Snail2 or Snail3 binds to either oligo. 	We then examined the effect of polymorphism rs2853677 on the in vivo occupancy of Snail1 to the consensus binding site using ChIP analysis. 	We analyzed the genotype of rs2853677 in 5 human lung cancer cell lines, including A549, H1229, H69, H209 and H446. H446 and H209, which carry the T/T and C/C genotypes, respectively, were selected for further analysis.

H446 and H209, which carry the T/T and C/C genotypes, respectively, were selected for further analysis. Snail1 conjugated with FLAG at its C-terminus was transfected into these two cell lines. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	True	Enrichment fold was evaluated by real-time PCR. 	Upper panels showed genotype of rs2853677 in H446 and H209 cells. 	Lower panels showed relative fold enrichment of Snail1 in the TERT intronic enhancer. CDH1 promoter was used as a positive control and its enrichment was set to 1.0. Actin was used as a negative control. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	False	These data indicate that Snail1 can bind to the enhancer and repress TERT transcription by inhibiting enhancer activity. 	The C allele of rs2853677 disrupts the association of Snail1 and prevents TERT downregulation in response to Snail1 upregulation. 	The well-known function of Snail1 is to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that is critical for cancer malignancy and metastasis. We accessed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database to analyze any correlation among Snail1, TERT and E-cadherin (an important cell-cell adherent junction protein whose downregulation is a golden mark of the EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Results	RefSNP	False	Snail1 associates with the enhancer, disrupting enhancer-promoter physical interaction, downregulating TERT transcription. 	The C allele of rs2853677 disrupts the binding site of Snail1, thereby abolishing the suppressive effect of Snail1 on TERT transcription (Figure 3D).

(C) Western blot showing the expression of Snail1 in variant cells. 
PMC5122352	rs2853677	Discussion	RefSNP	False	Therefore, Snail1 executes dual functions in tumorigenesis. 	The C allele of rs2853677, however, disrupts the Snail1 binding site and derepresses the expression of TERT by Snail1, blocking the inhibitory effect of Snail1 on tumorigenesis and thus increasing lung cancer susceptibility. 	Although the well-known function of Snail1 is to promote the EMT, rs2853677 does not seem to affect the EMT. Unexpectedly, rs2853677 is associated only with lung adenocarcinoma and is not related to SCLC, although SCLC expresses similar levels of Snail1 compared with lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure S1) and SCLC expresses more TERT than lung adenocarcinoma [33, 34].

It was first described in 1966 and was originally named Job's syndrome.42 HIES has either a dominant or recessive pattern of autosominal inheritance, with the rare AR HIES largely shown to be caused by mutations in DOCK8 (OMIM ID: 243700); in addition, AD HIES has been shown to be mainly caused by germline heterozygous STAT3 mutations (OMIM ID: 147060).15 STAT3 has a central role in signal transduction downstream of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-27. 	The STAT3 mutations identified in AD HIES patients are loss-of-function (LOF) and exert a dominant-negative effect on wild-type STAT3-mediated signaling.15 In addition to their infectious phenotype, patients with STAT3 mutations present with multiple clinical manifestations, including characteristic facial features, high-arched palate, retained primary teeth, scoliosis, osteoporosis and hyperextensibility of joints. STAT3-deficient patients also frequently develop CMC associated with other infectious and clinical manifestations. 
PMC5192062	240300	Article	OMIM	False		APECED, also called APS-1 syndrome, is an AR inherited disorder caused by biallelic mutations in AIRE (OMIM ID:240300). 	Affected patients suffer from autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, such as Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism and hypogonadism. They also develop alopecia areata, vitiligo and ectodermal dystrophy, such as nail dystrophy, or dental enamel dysplasia. 
PMC5192062	614891	Article	OMIM	False	IL-23 binds to its receptor complex (IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23R) on Th17 cells and has an important role in maintenance of Th17 cells and induction of IL-17 and IL-22. 	AR-complete IL-12Rβ1 deficiency (OMIM ID: 614891) is the most common genetic cause of MSMD, explaining 44% of MSMD patients with a known genetic etiology.48 The first cases of AR-complete IL-12Rβ1 deficiency were reported in 1998.27, 28 From the first identification, a total of 180 patients from 136 kindreds have since been reported.48 A large cohort study, collecting 141 patients from 102 kindreds with AR-complete IL-12Rβ1 deficiency, revealed its heterogeneous clinical manifestations. 	Mycobacterial disease (83%), Salmonellosis (43%) and CMC (23%) were the three major infectious phenotypes reported in symptomatic patients.11 Moreover, 78% of BCG-vaccinated patients developed BCG disease. In contrast, 8 of the 29 genetically affected siblings were asymptomatic (27%), suggesting incomplete penetrance of this disorder. 
PMC5192062	614892	Article	OMIM	False		Germline monoallelic hypomorphic or LOF-STAT1 mutations are responsible for AD MSMD (AD STAT1 deficiency; OMIM ID: 614892). 	These STAT1 mutations do not disturb STAT1 protein expression, but exert a dominant-negative effect on IFN-γ-induced STAT1-mediated signaling.48 In 2011, monoallelic GOF-STAT1 (OMIM ID: 614162) mutations were shown to cause the AD form of CMCD (Table 1).30, 31 These mutations impair dephosphorylation of STAT1, leading to hyperphosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr701 in response to IFN-γ, IFN-α/β and IL-27 stimulation.

PMC5192062	613956	Article	OMIM	False		The first identification of AD IL-17F deficiency (OMIM ID: 613956) was in a multiplex family from Argentina in 2011.38 A heterozygous missense mutation, S95L (c.284C>T), in IL17F was identified in this family. 	The S95L mutation was found in four patients with CMC, as well as two asymptomatic family members (aged 9 months and 21 years), suggesting incomplete clinical penetrance. All four patients developed CMC from the first year of life. 
PMC5192062	613953	Article	OMIM	False		The first patient reported with AR IL-17RA deficiency (OMIM ID: 613953) was born to consanguineous Moroccan parents.38 A homozygous nonsense mutation, Q284*, in IL17RA that was inherited from asymptomatic consanguineous parents was identified. 	The patient developed recurrent CMC, and was resistant to local antifungal treatment from the first month of life. He was also susceptible to S aureus, presenting with skin abscess and folliculitis on the buttocks. 
PMC5192062	616445	Article	OMIM	False		So far, three unrelated CMCD patients, one from Argentina and the others from Turkey, have been reported with AR IL-17RC deficiency (OMIM ID: 616445).40 Three different nonsense homozygous mutations, Q138*, R376* and R378*, in IL-17RC that were inherited from asymptomatic parents, were identified in the patients. 	All patients with biallelic mutations in IL-17RC developed CMC, suggesting complete clinical penetrance for this disorder. Unlike AR IL-17RA and ACT1 deficiencies, patients with AR IL-17RC deficiency did not have recurrent staphylococcal infections. 
PMC5198957	NCT01763385	Discussion	NCT	False	Patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations can thus be primarily treated with targeted therapy, and radiotherapy could be considered when intracranial progression is shown. 	The ongoing prospective trial called TRACTS (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01763385), comparing concurrent WBRT and erlotinib to erlotinib alone with WBRT at time of progression, will provide further insight into the optimal time to add brain radiotherapy. 	To our knowledge, there are few published reports describing the management of EGFR‐mutant NSCLC patients with symptomatic central nervous system metastases. In the present study, more patients presented with symptomatic BM in the brain radiotherapy group compared to those who received EGFR‐TKI alone, and they had a greater burden of intracranial disease.

PMC5231271	rs821722	Results	RefSNP	False	To identify the SNPs associated with susceptibility to FTND, we set the reduced type I error rate at 10−6. 	Based on the marginal p-values, we identify 1 SNP (rs821722, p = 9.54 × 10−7) to be associated with ftnd_1 and 1 SNP (rs3138134, p = 7.94 × 10−7) with ftnd_3. 	The other four FTND items are not associated with any SNP. The derived phenotype based on ftnd_total is also not associated with any SNP. 
PMC5231271	rs17538699	Results	RefSNP	False	Besides, the SNP that is associated with ftnd_1 is also associated with ftnd_total (binary). 	On the other hand, using the proposed multivariate test, we identify 9 SNPs (rs17538699, rs17798885, rs2245261, rs4077464, rs4658846, rs4658847, rs6553017, rs7672047, rs944582) to be associated with the six FTND phenotype variables. 	This demonstrates that combining multiple phenotypes can increase the power of identifying markers that may not be, otherwise, chosen using marginal tests. In addition, marginal tests may identify those SNPs that only contribute to a particular phenotype.

Although, no signals of an increase in dementia or cognitive impairment were seen in the PARADIGM-HF trial,[17] the effects of Sacubitril/valsartan on cognitive function will be assessed in the ongoing PARAGON-HF trial (NCT01920711)[35] In addition, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study is planned in order to specifically evaluate cognitive impairment and brain amyloid plaque deposition (PET imaging) comparing Sacubitril/valsartan vs. valsartan.[35] 	Sacubitril/valsartan in HF: looking ahead In the next years, clinical impact of Sacubitril/valsartan will be investigated in different HF scenarios like, preserved EF (NCT00887588), real life setting (NCT02690974), biomarkers (NCT02554890), pediatrics (NCT02678312), Japanese population (NCT02468232), ischemic functional mitral regurgitation (NCT02687932), post acute decompensation (NCT02661217) or asymptomatic patients with elevated natriuretic peptide and left atrial volume index (NCT02682719).

In this context, the previously mentioned PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) has a transcendental importance since our current lack of proven clinical benefits in patients with HF and preserved EF. This trial is designed to compare the effects of Sacubitril/ valsartan and valsartan alone in reducing CV death or total HFH in patients with the following entry criteria: LVEF ≥ 45%, NYHA class II-IV, histories of HFH within 9 months or elevated NPs, and evidence of structural heart disease (left ventricular hypertrophy or left atrial enlargement)

PMC5380505	NCT01590771	Results	NCT	False	Six studies were initially selected for inclusion into the NMA from the systematic search [4–7, 10, 32]. 	In addition to these six studies, an abstract in support of the efficacy and safety of alogliptin evaluating subjects treated with only metformin and SU at baseline from the EXAMINE trial [10] was provided by Takeda, along with a non-indexed study identified from ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01590771) [33], taking the total amount of studies to eight. 	A PRISMA flow diagram summarizing search results and study selection is provided in the supplementary material (Fig. S1). TableS3 in the supplementary material presents study and patient characteristics from the eight RCTs included in the NMA. 
PMC5380505	NCT01099137	Results	NCT	False	Baseline HbA1c ranged from 8.15% to 8.80% across treatment arms in the studies. 	In terms of other characteristics, the majority of patients were Caucasian in each study apart from Chen et al. [34] and NCT01590771 [33] where the patients were Chinese, and Hong et al. [32] (ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT01099137) where the patients were Korean. 	All patients were reported to be uncontrolled on metformin + SU dual therapy in line with inclusion criteria for the systematic review and NMA. Where reported, there were some differences in the type of SU given and their dose (glimepiride or gliclazide); the dose of metformin; and duration of prior metformin or SU. 
PMC5380505	NCT00602472	Results	NCT	False	HbA1c Change from Baseline: Base Case Analysis 	The base case analysis for HbA1c change from baseline was performed on the FAS/ITT data for six of the eight studies (EXAMINE, Heller et al. [10], Hermansen et al. [4], Lukashevich et al. [6], Moses et al. [7], NCT01590771 [33], and Owens et al. [5], ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00602472). 	The relevant network plot is shown in Fig. 1. The two studies excluded from the main analysis group were the studies where analysis was carried out per protocol (Chen et al. [34] and Hong [32]), but were included within a sensitivity analysis. 
PMC5380505	NCT01590771	Results	NCT	False	HbA1c Change from Baseline: Sensitivity Analysis 	To explore the impact of study heterogeneity, all analyses were repeated eliminating the two sitagliptin trials (Hermansen et al. [4] and NCT01590771 [33]). 	As both these studies were the only alogliptin comparator DPP-4 treatment studies that were deemed to be of moderate quality, this trial set also serves as sensitivity analysis relating to study quality. The elimination of the two studies had no qualitative impact: individual treatment results under the Bayesian fixed effect NMA remained the same as displayed in Fig. 3 (omitting the comparisons involving sitagliptin) and the non-inferiority probabilities of alogliptin against individual DPP-4 treatments remained high (increasing for the quasi-random effects models where the between-trial standard deviation fell to 0.1). 
PMC5380505	NCT01590771	Results	NCT	False	These results are presented in the supplementary material (Figs. S4–S16, Tables S9–S14), with the exception of the sensitivity analysis removing studies with potential outlier baseline HbA1c values (shown below). 	From the leverage plot analysis potential outlier trials that were identified were Lukashevich et al. [6] and NCT01590771 [33] which had relatively high baseline HbA1c values of 8.75% and 8.61%, respectively, contrasting with the other studies in the main analysis set (range 8.15% to 8.37%). 	Under the fixed effects model only, this resulted in a marginal statistically significant advantage for sitagliptin over alogliptin decreasing HbA1c by an additional 0.27% (95% CIs of 0.02% to 0.52%).

Among up-regulated genes, majority belonged to protein kinase domain (PF00069), Myb-like DNA-binding (PF00249), pectinacetylesterase (PF03283), protein tyrosine kinase (PF07714), zinc-binding (PF13966), Hsp20/alpha crystalline family (PF00011), protein phosphatase 2C (PF00481), and late embryogenesis abundant protein (PF02987). 	Also, protein kinase, protein tyrosine kinase, cytochrome P450, NB-ARC, UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase Pfam domains were in majority among down-regulated genes. Three up (g161426.t1, g77173.t1 and g86441.t1) and two down (g134601.t1 and g40229.t1) regulated drought responsive genes were validated by qRT-PCR in WW and LMS samples for the proof of concept. 
PMC5472924	PF01370	Results	Pfam	False	The Pfam based identification of drought responsive genes revealed that 2866 genes were distributed across 19 Pfam domains. 	The protein kinases (PF00069), protein tyrosine kinases (PF07714), BTB/POZ (PF00651), NAD dependent epimerase/dehydratase family (PF01370), U-box (PF04564), universal stress protein family (PF00582), and DCPS (PF00571) domains containing genes were majorly distributed in ML-365 genome (Table 3). 	Most of these genes were associated with WRKY, MYB, MYC, ZFHD, NAC, ABF, AREB, GRF, and NF-Y transcription factors, which are responsible for drought tolerance [72–75]. Utilization of these TFs to study the binding sites of TFs and analyzing cis-acting elements will enhance further understanding of drought tolerance in finger millet.

The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02282228) before the recruitment of the first study participant. 	All patients were referred to Sahlgrenska University Hospital for operation of cSDH, during the period September 2015 to January 2016. The HC group was recruited in the same period as the patients and matched to the patient cohort for age and sex. 
PMC5510669	NCT02728908	Discussion	NCT	False	Obviously, for the acute trauma setting, it would be more interesting to include patients with acute hematomas. 	Further studies are under way to test the device in patients with acute hematomas (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02728908). 	Further, to work properly in a clinical setting, the device must also be tested for patients with other intracranial pathologies (e.g., hydrocephalus) or foreign objects implanted (e.g.. shunts or aneurysm clips), which were excluded in this investigation. The cSDH in the current study were all large (mean total hematoma volume [left and right side summed if bilateral] = 112 mL), because of the study design of recruiting patients admitted for surgery of cSDH, and usually acute intracranial hemorrhages are smaller.

PMC5536051	JAP88178	Results	ENA	False	Only transcripts homologous to the troponin T and I subunits were identified among the top 50 most abundant transcripts of the Illumina 1st and 4th leg transcriptomes. 	One 1st leg transcript (contig 22) and one 4th leg transcript (contig 42) both had high sequence homology (93%) to R. appendiculatus troponin T (JAP88178.1), and were sequenced 410,660 and 316,355 times, respectively (Table 1 and Table 2, Figure S4). 	One 1st leg transcript (contig 33) and two 4th leg transcripts (contigs 194 and 51752) were sequenced in high frequency with significant homology to troponin I and the wings’ up A protein (Table 1 and Table 2). Contigs homologous to the coiled coil protein tropomyosin were also identified in the top 50 most abundant transcripts of the Illumina 1st and 4th leg transcriptomes. 
PMC5536051	AMB19056	Results	ENA	False	Contigs homologous to the coiled coil protein tropomyosin were also identified in the top 50 most abundant transcripts of the Illumina 1st and 4th leg transcriptomes. 	One transcript (contig 17) in the Illumina 1st leg transcriptome and one transcript (contig 239) in the Illumina 4th leg transcriptome both had high sequence homology (100%) to R. microplus tropomyosin (AMB19056.1) and were sequenced 72,240 and 89,239 times, respectively (Table 1 and Table 2, Figure S5). 	Titin is a giant elastic protein found in striated muscle sarcomeres that connects myosin to the Z-line. Titin allows for muscle cell elasticity and is essential for ensuring the mechanical stability of muscle fibers [9]. 
PMC5536051	EEC05627	Results	ENA	False	Titin allows for muscle cell elasticity and is essential for ensuring the mechanical stability of muscle fibers [9]. 	Three 1st leg transcripts (contigs 4832, 1517, and 696) and two 4th leg transcripts (contigs 6805 and 680) had sequence homology to the Ixodes scapularis myofibril scaffold component titin (EEC05627.1) and were each sequenced several times (Table 1 and Table 2, Figure S6). 	One transcript in the Illumina 1st transcriptome and one transcript in the 4th leg transcriptome were each sequenced in high frequency with significant homology to an I. scapularis cuticle protein (EEC04237.1; Table 1 and Table 2). The integument of ticks consists of an epidermis and its secreted cuticle [11]. 
PMC5536051	EEC04237	Results	ENA	False	Three 1st leg transcripts (contigs 4832, 1517, and 696) and two 4th leg transcripts (contigs 6805 and 680) had sequence homology to the Ixodes scapularis myofibril scaffold component titin (EEC05627.1) and were each sequenced several times (Table 1 and Table 2, Figure S6). 	One transcript in the Illumina 1st transcriptome and one transcript in the 4th leg transcriptome were each sequenced in high frequency with significant homology to an I. scapularis cuticle protein (EEC04237.1; Table 1 and Table 2). 	The integument of ticks consists of an epidermis and its secreted cuticle [11]. Since tick legs are surrounded externally by cuticle, it is not surprising to identify cuticle proteins among the top 50 most abundant transcripts of the Illumina 1st and 4th leg transcriptomes. 
PMC5536051	JZ183505	Results	ENA	False	OBPs and PBPs were not present in any of our four transcriptomes and were also not present in any of the tick or mite sequence data in GenBank or in the Ixodes scapularis genome [13]. 	Renthal et al. [14] reported the identification of two OBP-like expressed sequence tag coded proteins (EST; JZ183505.1 and JZ172282.1) in the foretarsus proteome of the lone star tick Amblyomma americanum. 	Unfortunately, tBLASTn searches of our Illumina 1st and 4th leg BLAST databases determined that the putative OBP-like ESTs were not exclusive to the 1st pair of legs. Numerous transcripts homologous to the OBP-like EST JZ183505.1 were identified in both the 1st and 4th legs. 
PMC5536051	JAG92140	Results	ENA	False	Numerous transcripts homologous to the OBP-like EST JZ183505.1 were identified in both the 1st and 4th legs. 	The percent identity between one such 4th leg transcript (contig 343) and the OBP-like EST JZ183505.1 was calculated to be 73%, with both transcripts having significant homology to the same BLASTx GenBank hit, a putative A. americanum secreted protein (JAG92140.1; Figure S7). 	Interestingly, only one transcript homologous to the OBP-like EST JZ172282.1 was identified, and in only the 4th legs. tBLASTn searches of the Illumina 1st leg BLAST database for the OBP-like EST JZ172282.1 did not identify any matches. 
PMC5536051	JAG92350	Results	ENA	False	tBLASTn searches of the Illumina 1st leg BLAST database for the OBP-like EST JZ172282.1 did not identify any matches. 	The percent identity between the 4th leg transcript (contig 114) and the OBP-like EST JZ172282.1 was calculated to be 89%, with both transcripts having high homology (100%) to the same BLASTx GenBank hit, a putative A. americanum secreted protein (JAG92350.1; Figure S8). 	Additional EST coded proteins theorized to function as OBPs in ticks, such as the dust-mite antigen, neto-like protein, Niemann-Pick C2, and microplusin were either identified in the Illumina 4th leg transcriptome and not exclusive to the 1st legs or missing from all transcriptome datasets completely [14]. In vertebrates, the OBPs are lipocalins with no sequence homology with insect OBPs [15]. 
PMC5536051	JAC30054	Results	ENA	False	Since homologous transcripts were found in both the front and back legs, and there are no known chemosensory organs on the latter, this argues that the A. americanum lipocalin EST JZ171538.1 is not acting as an OBP. 	BLASTx analysis of the identified putative D. variabilis Haller’s organ spf lipocalin (contig 84287) determined the top GenBank hit (lowest e-value) to be an A. triste lipocalin (JAC30054.1). 	An alignment between the Haller’s organ spf lipocalin (contig 84287) and the A. triste lipocalin (JAC30054.1) showed a significant number of conserved residues despite the short nature of the Haller’s organ spf lipocalin (Figure S10). Phylogenetic analysis of the putative Haller’s organ spf lipocalin (contig 84287) suggested it was not related to vertebrate chemosensory lipocalins (Figure 1). 
PMC5536051	EEC13968	Results	ENA	False	tBLASTn searches of the Illumina 1st and 4th leg BLAST databases for I. scapularis TRPA (EEC13968.1) homologs identified one putative TRPA, that was common to both the Illumina 1st and 4th leg transcriptomes (contig 8166, 1st legs; contig 4943, 4th legs). 	With the identified Illumina 1st and 4th leg TRPA transcripts having such low sequence homology (34%) to the I. scapularis TRPA (EEC13968.1), it is questionable if the identified TRPA transcripts are indeed members of the “A” subfamily, and not another TRP subfamily. 	The Illumina 1st and 4th leg TRPA transcripts (contig 8166, 1st legs; contig 4943, 4th legs) also had very low sequence homology to insect olfactory TRPA splice variants resulting in poor alignments; conserved residues were only found in the copies of Ankyrin repeats (Appendix A; Figure S11). With a lack of supporting evidence validating the identification of the putative TRPA transcripts, and its presence in both the 1st and 4th legs, it is unlikely TRPAs are used in an olfactory capacity in the Haller’s organ. 
PMC5536051	GO:0004930	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Gene ontology (GO) annotation and phylogenetic analyses of the putative Haller’s organ spf GPCR transcripts determined that both transcripts were putative clade A, rhodopsin-like GPCRs showing GPCR and photoreceptor activity (GO term identification no. 	GO:0009881, GO:0004930; Figure 2). 	With such few olfactory GPCRs identified in the Haller’s organ spf transcriptome, and the identified transcripts short in nature, additional BLAST searches were performed in attempts to identify more olfactory GPCRs or additional olfactory receptors of a variant type. tBLASTn searches of the Illumina 1st leg BLAST database were performed looking for analogues to the C. elegans chemosensory GPCRs str-2 and odr-3, the insect OR co-receptor OR83b also known as Orco and several randomly selected odorant receptors from D. melanogaster with no new GPCRs or ORs found (Appendix A; e-value ≤ 1.0). 
PMC5536051	GO:0007186	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of all the identified putative Gα subunit transcripts determined that the Haller’s organ spf transcript (contig 13937) encoded a putative Gαo subunit, while the transcripts common to the Illumina 1st and Illumina 4th leg transcriptomes (contigs 14072 and 46297, 1st legs; contigs 2423 and 13329, 4th legs) encoded Gαq and Gα12/13 subunits (Figure 3 and Figure S14). 	GO annotation and pathway identification of the putative Gα12/13, Gαo and Gαq subunits revealed functional roles in the GPCR signal pathway and signal transduction (GO:0007186, GO:0007165). 	Gα12/13 subunits are primarily associated with cell proliferation, cytoskeleton remolding and calcium signaling and are not of interest as possible chemosensory G-proteins [30,31]. In C. elegans and insects, Gαo and Gαq subunits are involved in chemosensation with evidence of Gα protein compartmentalism within chemosensory neurons; Gαq subunits are localized to the dendrites, whereas only one Gαo subunit is exclusively located along the chemosensory neuron axon [28,32]. 
PMC5536051	GO:0043547	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the putative Gβ transcripts determined that both the Haller’s organ spf transcript (contig 24477) and the Illumina 1st leg transcript (contig 57459) encoded a divergent clade of Gβ subunits (Figures S15 and S16); the Illumina 1st leg Gβ transcript (contig 57459) was homologous to a Gβ transcript identified in the Illumina 4th leg transcriptome (contig 36459). 	GO annotation and pathway identification of the putative Haller’s organ spf and Illumina 1st leg Gβ transcripts revealed functional roles in GTPase regulation (GO:0043547). 	The GTPase activity of Gβ subunits deactivates Gα subunits and instigates the re-association of all G-protein subunits with the GPCR [24,33]. Gβ subunits are not well documented in Acari, and their roles in sensory signal modulation remain unclear. 
PMC5536051	GO:0006182	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Alignments and phylogenetic analysis of the two putative AGCs transcripts (contigs 37845 and 77721) determined that both transcripts encoded transmembrane AGCs. 	GO annotation and pathway identification of the putative AGC transcripts (contigs 37845 and 77721) revealed functional roles in cNMP biosynthesis and signal transduction (GO:0006182, GO:0035556; Figures S19 and S20). 	Since Gαo subunits are associated with guanylate cyclase and Gαq subunits with adenylate cyclase, it is reasonable to assume that chemosensory AGCs also exhibit the same neuron compartmentalism as seen with Gα subunits [31]. The identification of both adenylate and guanylate cyclase exclusively in the Haller’s organ specific transcriptome further supports the presence of a two-step chemosensory signal transduction system in ticks. 
PMC5536051	GO:0034220	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	A similar putative CNG transcript was also identified in the 454 1st leg transcriptome. 	Alignments and phylogenetic analysis of the putative CNG transcript (contig 82720) determined that it encoded an α-subunit, and GO annotation and pathway identification revealed functional roles in ion transmembrane transport (GO:0034220; Figure S21). 	No β-subunits were identified. In C. elegans and D. melanogaster a single type of CNG α-subunit is expressed in chemosensory neurons and is required for chemosensation. C. elegans also express a CNG β-subunit in their chemosensory neurons, but a β-subunit has yet to be identified in D. melanogaster antennae [34,36]. 
PMC5536051	GO:0055114	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the 4 putative Haller’s organ spf P450 transcripts (contigs 1691, 6898, 14383 and 69591) determined that one transcript belongs to the CYP2 clade (contig 1691), two to CYP3 (contigs 14383 and 6898), and one to CYP4 (contig 69591; Figure 5). 	GO annotation and pathway identification of the Haller’s organ spf CYP transcripts (contigs 1691, 6898, 14383 and 69591 revealed functional roles in oxidation-reduction processes (GO:0055114). 	The majority of chemosensory specific P450s identified in insects belong to CYP2, CYP3 and CYP4 [42]. CYP2s, CYP3s and CYP4s are also commonly found in the gut and fat bodies of insects, though this does not preclude these enzymes from having chemosensory specific functions [43]. 
PMC5536051	GO:0019430	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	False	Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the Haller’s organ spf SOD transcript (contig 83534) determined that it encoded a Cu/Zn binding cytosolic SOD (Figure S30). 	GO annotation of the putative SOD transcript (contig 83534) revealed a functional role in the removal of superoxide radicals (GO:0019430). 	Currently there are discrepancies in the reported functions of cytosolic SODs in insects and Acari, but it clear that SODs play a role in protecting chemosensory cells from ROSs damage [50]. ODEs in chemosensory sensilla protect chemosensory neurons from xenobiotic damage and odor desensitization.

PMC5554225	244400	Introduction	OMIM	False		Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; MIM: 244400) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder due to impairment of ciliary function and has an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 15,000–20,000 individuals1. 	Ineffective cilium movement of cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tracts may result in limited mucus clearance, leading to neonatal respiratory distress, rhinitis, sinusitis, rhinorrhea, chronic cough, recurrent respiratory infections and bronchiectasis. Male infertility may occur as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function. 
PMC5554225	615408	Discussion	OMIM	False	To date, a total of 40 known PCD-causing genes have been reported (Supplementary Table S2). 	Among these genes, ARMC4 (MIM: 615408) encodes a protein required in a late step for proper targeting and anchoring of outer dynein arms (ciliary structure proteins)37. 	Thus far, 9 different ARMC4 mutations (2 missense mutants, 6 truncated mutants, and 1 frameshift mutant) have been identified in PCD patients (Fig. 3), with most of these mutations being found in exons 17 and 12. The frameshift mutation ARMC4 (c.1488delG/p.E497Kfs*3) in our study is located in the ARM-repeat unit (ARM) domain (Supplementary Figure 4) and is predicted to cause premature protein truncation, resulting in the assembly defect of the outer dynein arm. 
PMC5554225	608706	Discussion	OMIM	False	The frameshift mutation ARMC4 (c.1488delG/p.E497Kfs*3) in our study is located in the ARM-repeat unit (ARM) domain (Supplementary Figure 4) and is predicted to cause premature protein truncation, resulting in the assembly defect of the outer dynein arm. 	The DYX1C1 gene (MIM: 608706) was another gene reported to be involved in PCD38. DYX1C1 encodes a 420-amino acid protein with 3 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that are thought to be protein interaction modules. 	DYX1C1 is a cytoplasmic axonemal dynein assembly factor, acting together with DNAAF2 at an early step in the cytoplasmic assembly of the inner and outer dynein arms38. To date, seven pathogenic variants of DYX1C1 have been reported38. 
PMC5554225	607752	Discussion	OMIM	False	Our finding that a single-base deletion of C at position 384 (c.384delC) results in p.Y128* is consistent with the previous report by Tarkar et al.38. 	The pathogenetic variant (c.248_249insGCCCG/p.Q88Rfs*8) identified in CCNO (MIM: 607752) was previously reported22. 	Due to the lack of situs inversus phenotype, the patients in family 2 were initially diagnosed with common pulmonary infection and bronchiectasis. Additional examinations revealed that both siblings exhibited chronic sinusitis symptoms, which was further confirmed via computerized tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses.

Methylation of 4 CpGs in the HPV 16 URR (reference HPV 16 sequence AF125673.1), encompassing CpG sites within the E2BS 3 and 4 (Figure 3A), was quantitatively analysed by bisulfite pyrosequencing as described previously [69]. 	The primer pair covering the proximal E2BSs 3 and 4 was used for amplification. Global CpG methylation analysis was performed using PyroMark LINE-1 reagents (Qiagen). 
PMC5592930	SRP068874	Methods	ENA	False	The whole genome shotgun project for the first version of the scaled quail genome has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL//GenBank under the accession MCFN00000000, and the whole genome shotgun project for the second version of the bobwhite genome has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL//GenBank under the accession AWGT00000000. 	Illumina sequence reads were also deposited in the SRA (accession numbers SRP068874 and SRP018482). 	
PMC5592930	KT722338	Results	ENA	False	While natural and experimental hybridization has been documented between the bobwhite and the scaled quail (Johnsgard 1970; Shupe 1990), the extent of historic hybridization has not been estimated using nuclear, genome-wide variation. 	However, a recent mitochondrial population study for the bobwhite (n = 53), which also produced a complete scaled quail mitochondrial genome for comparison (GenBank accession KT722338), failed to detect any evidence of historic hybridization (bobwhite ♂ × scaled quail ♀), despite sampling from regions where both species naturally occur (Halley et al. 2015). 	A subset of the nuclear microsatellites presented here may prove useful to facilitate low-cost investigations of management concerns using larger sample sizes, including issues related to population structure, gene flow, and nuclear introgression between the scaled quail and bobwhite. Beyond microsatellite loci, we also predicted genome-wide autosomal sequence variation resulting from biparental inheritance of alternative alleles (heterozygosity) for the scaled quail (v1.0) and the bobwhite (v2.0). 
PMC5592930	CP015961	Results	ENA	False	Quality control analyses aimed at identifying nonavian scaffolds via blast (blastn, blastx), and the evaluation of read depth, led to the removal of one scaffold from the scaled quail assembly (v1.0), and two scaffolds from the bobwhite assembly (v2.0); based on convincing evidence that these scaffolds were not produced from the targeted avian genomes. 	The scaffold removed from the scaled quail assembly was 1287 bp in length, and produced a blastn alignment with 100% identity (across 1287 bp) to the bacterium Dietzia timorensis (strain ID05-A0528) complete genome (accession: CP015961.1), indicating the presence of an unknown bacterium, and produced no meaningful blastn alignments to the chicken or zebra finch genomes (MaSuRCA scaffold ID: jcf7180005140066; File S2). 	The two scaffolds excluded from the bobwhite (v2.0) genome assembly were previously reported to produce convincing blastn and blastp alignments to apicomplexan parasite sequences in the bobwhite (v1.0) assembly (Halley et al. 2014; Orosz 2015). The MaSuRCA scaffolds jcf7180006226006 and jcf7180006136291 were independently assembled updates to contig 108821 (AWGU01108821) and contig 45101 (AWGU01045101) in the first-generation bobwhite assembly, and are included in File S2.

Scaffold jcf7180006136291 produced a blastn alignment with 76% identity to the Toxoplasma gondii apicoplast complete genome (accession U87145.2) across 99% of the scaffold (8761 bp), and could represent a portion of an apicoplast sequence. 	Scaffold jcf7180006226006 produced a blastn alignment with 72% identity to Sarcocystis neurona (strain SN3, clone E1, contig 00498) whole genome shotgun sequence (accession: JAQE01000498.1) across 37% of the scaffold length (357,155 bp).

PMC5598801	rs8330	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Interindividual variability in polymorphic uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) ascribed to genetic diversity is associated with relative glucuronidation level among individuals. 	The present research was aimed to study the effect of 2 important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs8330 and rs10929303) of UGT1A1 gene on glucuronidation status of acetaminophen in healthy volunteers (n = 109). 	Among enrolled volunteers, 54.13% were male (n = 59) and 45.87% were female (n = 50). The in vivo activity of UGT1A1 was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography-based analysis of glucuronidation status (ie, acetaminophen and acetaminophen glucuronide) in human volunteers after oral intake of a single dose (1000 mg) of acetaminophen. 
PMC5598801	rs8330	Abstract	RefSNP	False	The TaqMan SNP genotyping assay was used for UGT1A1 genotyping. 	The wild-type genotype (C/C) was observed the most frequent one for both SNPs (rs8330 and rs10929303) and associated with fast glucuronidator phenotypes. 	The distribution of variant genotype (G/G) for SNP rs8330 was observed in 5% of male and 8% of the female population; however, for SNP rs10929303, the G/G genotype was found in 8% of both genders. A trimodal distribution (fast, intermediate, and slow) based on phenotypes was observed.

The HPLC-based phenotypic studies for acetaminophen glucuronidation have been conducted in Hong Kong, Chinese, and Caucasian healthy population using acetaminophen as probe drug.28,29 Based on the individuals’ glucuronidation ability, accessed by plasma PAP-Glu/PAP ratio, the studied populations have presented a trimodal phenotypic distribution and the volunteers have been classified as fast, intermediate, and slow glucuronidators.

(b) The distribution of group specific sites on the structures of NA (PDB:3TIA). 	Sites of group 1 NA and group 2 NA were colored as red and blue, respectively. H-bond variations of group specific sites in subtypes of group 1 HA (c), group 2 HA (d), group 1 NA (e), and group 2 NA (f). 
PMC5662722	4WSB	Discussion	PDBe	False	In the meantime, we assessed the effect of the mutation on H-bonds based on the avian consensus sequence environment without consideration of residue combinations in the real strains. 	Besides, the crystal structure of RNA polymerase of IAVs used in homology modeling was bat origin (A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/060/2010, H17N10, PDB ID :4WSB) and its chain sequences were greatly different from the ones in other subtypes, which might result in structural differences. 	Therefore, more accurate and suitable crystal structures are needed to validate these H-bond variations resulting from adaptive mutations. Both H5N1 and H7N9 have caused sporadic human cases without any evidence of sustained and human-to-human spread, but their patterns of H-bond variations were significantly different (Fig. 3c and d). 
PMC5662722	CY014988	Methods	ENA	False	Sequence identities between allele A and B were about 70%, whereas those within each allele were above 90%39. 	We eliminated allele B sequences according to identities, in which case the NS of A/tern/South Africa/1961 (allele A; accession: CY014988) and A/redhead duck/ALB/74/1977 (allele B; accession: CY004739) were chosen as references. 	Reassortants at a given period such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 appear to be highly similar. We collapsed identical sequences for each protein with identity threshold equal to 1 using cd-hit40. 
PMC5671994	GCA_000020705.1	Methods	GCA	False	The library was prepared using the PacBio’s 20 Kb template prep protocol (PN_100-286-000-06) and it was size-selected by using a range setting of 8,000 bp to 50,000 bp. De Novo assembly was performed using PacBio native pipeline (27). 	Comparative genomic analysis was independently performed with MAUVE v.20150225 (28) and Mummer v.3.23 (29) programs, using the annotated genome of SH strain SL476 as reference (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_000020705.1) (30). 	The shared genomic fragments between UFPR1 and SL476 were identified with Mummer while the regions with no match between them were identified with a Perl script (available in https://github.com/CaioFreire/Scripts). PROKKA v.1.12 software was used for genome annotation (31) and the circular map was drawn using DNAPlotter v.10.2 (32). 
PMC5671994	CP020101	Methods	ENA	False	PROKKA v.1.12 software was used for genome annotation (31) and the circular map was drawn using DNAPlotter v.10.2 (32). 	The fully sequenced SH UFPR1 genome was deposited at the NCBI genome database under the number CP020101. 	In addition, missing fragments between each other were found using Megablast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and verifying if the gene sequences in these missing fragments were present in other parts of the genome. 
PMC5671994	PRJNA378710	Results	BioProject	False	Nevertheless, the comparison between the genomes of these strains revealed high similarity with few translocation events and conserved synteny (Figure 7). 	Moreover, no plasmid-sequences were found in the assembled sequences from reads of the UFPR1 strain (BioProject NCBI number PRJNA378710), using Canu software v1.3 (33) to correct all input data. 	
PMC5679599	SRX2996560	Methods	ENA	False	A second pool of five normal Duroc animals, which are assumed to harbor only normal chromosomes with respect to the translocation, was used as a reference normal sample. 	Sequencing data of the Duroc and Large-White pooled samples are publicly available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession numbers SRX2996560 and SRX2996558, respectively. 	Sequences were trimmed for adapters using cutadapt [23]. The reverse complement sequences were aligned to the Sscrofa10.2 genome assembly using bwa [24] and alignments with a mapping quality above 10 were kept for further analysis. 
PMC5679599	CU928801	Results	ENA	False	Seven new STS markers were designed from the pig draft sequence and PCR were performed with Hb1.8 DNA as template (Fig 3B). 	The minimum interval was defined between the SSC3_Tsloq_frag29 and SSC3_Tsloq_frg30 loci, which mapped to the same BAC clone CH242-117J1 (accession number CU928801). 	Five additional STSs were defined from the BAC sequence and a short interval of 968 bp containing the breakpoint was defined on SSC3 between the SSC3_Tsloq_frag29 and SSC3_Tsloq_frag32 loci (Fig 3B). On SSC4, the comparison of the Sscrofa10.2 assembly between positions 107.808 Mb and 107.989 Mb to the human genome sequence showed conserved synteny with the 150.417–150.555 Mb interval on HSA1 but in the opposite orientation. 
PMC5679599	CU655899	Results	ENA	False	The localization of the breakpoint was refined to a region between the ADAMTSL4 and ECM1 genes that are separated by 52.924 kb on the human genome sequence. 	Finally, a STS marker (Ssc4_Tsloq_frag23) was selected on the pig BAC clone CH242-160A10 (accession number CU655899), which contains ADAMTSL4 and was used to reduce the breakpoint interval on SSC4 to 20 kb (Fig 4B). 	Characterization of the breakpoint By applying this chromosome walking approach, we identified the two most proximal positive loci obtained with the Hb1.8 clone, on both sides of the breakpoint, i.e. SSC3_Tsloq_frag29 on SSC3 and ADAMTSL4 on SSC4. 
PMC5679599	CU655899	Results	ENA	False	This product was purified, directly sequenced, and the sequences were compared to identify precisely the junction between the two chromosomal segments. 	The der(4) breakpoint was precisely mapped on SSC3 to position 48,007 Mb within the sequence of clone CH242-117J1 (GenBank accession number CU928801) and on SSC4, to position 27,558 Mb within the sequence of clone CH242-160A10 (GenBank accession number CU655899). 	To validate this result, a pair of primers was selected from the two BAC sequences on both sides of the breakpoint to amplify the junction der(3) using Hyb25.1 DNA as template. The resulting PCR product was sequenced and compared to the BAC DNA sequence. 
PMC5685704	NCT01968109	Introduction	NCT	False	One of those studies also describes the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 [18], but to the best of our knowledge nothing has been described about the expression of T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) in mesothelioma effusions. 	The latter two are upcoming immune checkpoints that are gaining more attention due to interesting preclinical results in different tumor types [21–25] and ongoing clinical trials testing specific blocking antibodies (NCT01968109; NCT02817633). 	LAG-3 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells. It also binds to MHCII molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells but in contrast to CD4, LAG-3 exerts a negative regulatory effect on the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes [21, 22]. 
PMC5685704	NCT02817633	Discussion	NCT	False	Based on our results from MPM fluids not only TIM-3 could be an interesting target for MPM, but also LAG-3 might offer new opportunities. 	Clinical trials with TIM-3 and LAG-3 blockade in various solid tumor types are ongoing (NCT02817633; NCT02608268; NCT01968109; NCT03005782). 	Interestingly, our recent work [15] showed no expression of LAG-3 on tumor cells and immune cells in MPM tissue samples while our data in fluid samples showed its presence on T cells as well as NK cells. Since effusions most often occur in an inflammatory context which is known to influence the expression of immune checkpoints [45] it is quite possible that the fluid samples do not reflect the tumor microenvironment. 
PMC5686275	NCT01197794	Methods	NCT	False	Phase IIb dose-finding case study 	Part of the PhIIb clinical trial data and the study protocol of the asthma drug candidate AZD1981 (ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01197794) was utilized in this work. 	One endpoint goal of the study was to demonstrate that the drug improved the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of asthma patients by, on average, at least 0.1 L (placebo and baseline adjusted). This clinical trial was chosen as a case study since FEV1 is a highly variable endpoint (standard deviation of 0.3 L in the placebo effect) relative to the expected effect magnitude; hence it is hard to characterize the dose–effect relationship from PhIIb clinical trials. 
PMC5687643	NC_000007.14	Results	RefSeq	False	DNA sequence analysis of the AKR1B10 promoter region, a gene frequently silenced in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer [31, 32], revealed a repetitive sequence composed of tandem 4-nucleotide repeats, (TTCC)2(TCCC)5(TCCT)7, with a flanking C and T- enriched sequence (Figure 1A). 	This repetitive sequence is located at Chromosome 7 q33 (NC_000007.14, nucleotide number 134526936 - 134527095) (Figure 1B). 	In this study, we used this sequence as a reference sequence. 
PMC5687643	NC_000007.14	Results	RefSeq	False	To characterize this repetitive sequence, we evaluated its polymorphisms and possible clinical implications in colorectal cancer. 	We first assessed its polymorphic changes in healthy subjects using the DNA sequence of NC_000007.14 as a reference sequence. 	Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR for conventional sequencing analysis. Figure 2 shows the chromatography of the sequencing data and representatives of polymorphic changes. 
PMC5703901	1COY	Results	PDBe	False	Structural analysis of PsChO 	We generated a structural homology model of PsChO using Brevibacterium sterolicum cholesterol oxidase as template (PDB ID: 1COY, sequence identity 66%, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), 0.06 Å; 488 aligned Cα atoms)23, which possessed the characteristic nucleotide-binding fold (Rossmann fold) consisting of a β-pleated sheet sandwiched between α-helices (Fig. 2A). 	A loop region (L56-P77), which is located at the entrance of the active-site cavity, forms a flexible lid23,24. This flexible loop is presumed to open and allow the substrate to enter the binding site and then close to seal steroid from the solvent25,26. 
PMC5703901	CP009896	Methods	ENA	False	Cloning, expression and purification 	The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET28a(+) with the wild-type PsChO gene (GenBank No. CP009896.1; Protein ID: WP_052138420.1) were grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth medium containing 40 μg/mL kanamycin. 	Overexpression was induced by adding 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when OD600 reached 0.6–0.8. The culture was then further incubated at 16 °C overnight. 
PMC5703901	1COY	Methods	PDBe	False	The three-dimensional (3D) homology model of PsChO was generated using Modeller 9.929. 	The crystal structure of cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sterolicum (PDB ID: 1COY, 1.8 Å), which has 66% sequence identity to the target protein PsChO, was chosen as the template. 	The align2d command was used to automatically generate a sequence alignment between the template and PsChO. Subsequently, homology modeling was performed by the automodel command.

PMC5735066	rs10757274	Article	RefSNP	False	However, recent reports have challenged this view, demonstrating that mummies from various ancient societies—from as much as 5,300 years ago—exhibited a high prevalence of arterial changes compatible with atherosclerosis (Thompson et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2014; Zink et al., 2014). 	Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) recently shown to be a genetic risk factor for CVD (minor allele of rs10757274 on chromosome 9p21) was detected in at least one of these mummies, despite the fact that it was initially believed that this gene modification arose much later in history (Zink et al., 2014). 	Many putative mechanisms have been considered to account for the presence of CVD that far back in human history (Thompson et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2014). In contrast, risk factors most commonly associated with disease in modern populations include modifiable risks—such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, and physical inactivity—and non-modifiable risks—including age, gender, numerous identified SNPs in germ cells, and race (Yusuf et al., 2004; Goldschmidt-Clermont et al., 2012).

A national multicenter phase III clinical register study by Professor Yansong Lin's group is currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03048877). 	Also a newly paper shows that apatinib also has a good effect on osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases and may be related to the rich vascular supply of osteosarcoma.[23] In terms of adverse events, milder adverse events have been observed with apatinib compared with other targeted drugs, which may be because of its high selectivity for VEGFR-2. 
PMC5817250	LT622838	Article	ENA	False	As a preliminary molecular characterization, almost the complete 16S rRNA gene was re-sequenced according to previously described methods [1]. 	The resulting sequence (1385 bp; GenBank accession number LT622838) was almost identical to the original sequence (1454 bp; GenBank accession number HG800055) [1] when aligned with the silva Incremental Aligner (sina; v1.2.11) [26]. 	For detailed phylogenetic placement of BII-R7T, its 16S rRNA gene sequence was aligned with the silva Incremental Aligner and implemented into the ‘All Species Living Tree Project’ (LTP) [27] using the arb software package release 5.2 [28] for analysis.

PMC5817390	rs1045642	Abstract	RefSNP	False	Edoxaban and its low-abundance, active metabolite M4 are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1) and organic anion transporter protein 1B1 (OATP1B1), respectively, and pharmacological inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 can affect edoxaban and M4 pharmacokinetics (PK). 	In this integrated pharmacogenomic analysis, genotype and concentration–time data from 458 healthy volunteers in 14 completed phase 1 studies were pooled to examine the impact on edoxaban PK parameters of allelic variants of ABCB1 (rs1045642: C3435T) and SLCO1B1 (rs4149056: T521C), which encode for P-gp and OATP1B1. 	Although some pharmacologic inhibitors of P-gp and OATP1B1 increase edoxaban exposure, neither the ABCB1 C3435T nor the SLCO1B1 T521C polymorphism affected edoxaban PK. A slight elevation in M4 exposure was observed among SLCO1B1 C-allele carriers; however, this elevation is unlikely to be clinically significant as plasma M4 concentrations comprise <10% of total edoxaban levels. 
PMC5817390	rs1045642	Methods	RefSNP	False	PK parameters were statistically compared between genotypes using analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SAS Proc MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA), with genotype and study ID as fixed effects. 	Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the ratios of the PK parameters between different allele variations of ABCB1 rs1045642 (CC vs CT, CC vs TT, and CT vs TT) and SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (C-carriers vs TT) were calculated using multiple pairwise comparisons by applying exponential transformation to the difference in least squares (LS) means calculated using ln-transformed values and CIs obtained from the ANOVA model. 	Assuming the expected mean ratio was within the range of 95% to 105% with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons among the three rs1045642 variant subgroups, a genotype subgroup of at least 37, 105 and 98 subjects for edoxaban AUCinf, Cmax and C24, respectively, was required in order to have at least 80% power so that the 90% CI for the mean ratio would fall within the range of 80–125%. Using similar criteria, rs4149056 genotype subgroups required a minimum of 26, 75 and 70 subjects for edoxaban AUCinf, Cmax and C24, respectively, while the corresponding PK measures for M4 required 57, 103 and 96 subjects, respectively.

We identify two new AS loci, on chromosome 1p21 near PALMD (rs7543130; odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 1.2 × 10−22) and on chromosome 2q22 in TEX41 (rs1830321; OR = 1.15, P = 1.8 × 10−13). 	Rs7543130 also associates with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (OR = 1.28, P = 6.6 × 10−10) and aortic root diameter (P = 1.30 × 10−8), and rs1830321 associates with BAV (OR = 1.12, P = 5.3 × 10−3) and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.05, P = 9.3 × 10−5).

This variant was previously shown to associate with sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation10,11, and was recently reported also to associate with coarctation of the aorta, BAV, and AS (OR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.78–3.96; P = 1.8 × 10−6)12. The effect size on BAV is substantially greater than that for AS (P = 0.023), suggesting that the AS risk conferred by this variant is mediated through BAV.

Chromatin interactions between the regulatory regions harboring candidate causal variants at the PALMD and TEX41 loci were much less frequent in right ventricular tissue and aorta, compared with the left ventricle, and none overlapped with gene promoters (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
PMC5840367	rs7543130	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However, as we have limited information on whether AS occured on the background of bicuspid or tricuspid valve, we were not able to determine whether these variants associate with AS in the absence of BAV. 	Interestingly, the AS and BAV risk allele of rs7543130 near PALMD also associates with increased aortic root size. 	The relationship between BAV and aortopathy is well recognized and several studies suggest that the dilation of the proximal ascending aorta results from changes in flow secondary to the presence of BAV5,23,29. This raises the question whether the effect of chromosome 1p21 variant on aortic root size can be explained by its association with BAV. 
PMC5840367	rs17696696	Discussion	RefSNP	False	We also note that the MYH6 missense variant has a large effect on BAV but no effect on aortic root size. 	We did not find a consistent relationship between genetic associations with risk of AS and aortic root size, but found that one additional aortic root size variant, rs17696696 intronic to CFDP1, associates with AS. 	We demonstrate that this new AS variant, rs17696696 in CFDP1, associates genome-wide significantly with CAD, like rs1830321 near TEX41 and the LPA rs10455872 (ref. 6). Further, we found that four other CAD variants associate with AS, supporting the notion that there may be a cause shared by CAD and AS.

Further, we found that four other CAD variants associate with AS, supporting the notion that there may be a cause shared by CAD and AS. However, contesting a generalized common pathophysiology, causal analysis suggests that only some genetic pathways are shared by CAD and AS, and that the risk of both diseases conferred by Lp(a) and LDL/non-HDL cholesterol levels contributes substantially to the frequent co-occurence of these two diseases. 
PMC5840367	rs1890753	Discussion	RefSNP	False	These experiments show folding of chromatin such that distinct regulatory regions harboring variants in high LD with the lead AS variants, physically interact with several gene promoters, suggesting several candidate causal genes at both loci. 	Interestingly, in line with an impact during fetal development, a poised promoter state was found in fetal heart tissue for a candidate causal variant rs1890753 at chromosome 1p21. 	Poised promoters are considered to be involved in the expression of developmental genes allowing for a rapid response to differentiation signals. At the TEX41 locus, we note that ZEB2, one of the genes suggested through chromatin interaction studies, is a strong biological candidate.

Association with incident AS was tested in a case–control analysis utilizing logistic regression under an additive inheritance model adjusted for age and sex. Case–control matching was performed in SAS v9.4 with the greedy algorithm, matching 1 AS case to 1 population-based controls for sex, baseline age (<3 years age difference), year of baseline visit (within 3 years from visit), and requiring at least equal follow-up in controls.

PMC5879690	2D0T	Article	PDBe	False	(Compound 1 is BMS-978587, 2 is BMS-986205, and 3 is BMS-116.) Both inhibitors bound in a manner that displaced the heme cofactor, with each occupying different, although overlapping, space in the vacated heme pocket (Figs. S4 and S5). 	Remarkably, the overall structure of IDO1 bound to each inhibitor was largely unperturbed compared with a heme-containing IDO1 structure (0.61 and 0.44 Å rmsd from 2D0T for cocrystal structures with 1 and 3, respectively). 	The carboxylate of 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ala-264 and with His-346, which ordinarily coordinates with the heme iron on the proximal side. Binding of 1 also led to a shift in the flexible loop made of residues 260–265, an event previously observed with the binding of phenylimidazole (40). 
PMC5880025	NCT03306680	Discussion	NCT	False	The model-based predictions presented here are meant to give an estimate for tumor control and toxicity; further prospective clinical research is needed to better assess the true therapeutic ratio of different dose fractionation schemes for ultra-central lung tumors and inform clinical decision-making. 	To prospectively address this clinical issue, the Canadian Pulmonary Radiotherapy Group (CAPRI) has launched the Stereotactic body radiotherapy for ultra-central non-small cell lung cancer: A safety and efficacy trial (SUNSET trial, NCT03306680). 	SUNSET is a multi-centre phase 1 dose escalation study using the continuous re-assessment method, to determine the maximally tolerated SABR dose associated with 30% or lower rate of grade ≥ 3 toxicity within 2 years. This trial will investigate a dose of 60 Gy starting in 8 fractions and escalate to 5 fractions (with de-escalation down to 15 fractions, if necessary). 
PMC5880025	NCT01795521	Discussion	NCT	False	Our modeling results suggest only 4 of the 10 patients included in our study would meet the SUNSET outcome objectives at level 1 (60 Gy in 8 fractions). 	Additional data from the EORTC LungTech phase II trial of SABR (60 Gy in 8 fractions) for central early stage lung cancer are also awaited (NCT01795521). 	Until the efficacy and toxicity analysis from these trials are complete, the best dose-fractionation regimen for ultra-central tumors remains unclear.

The top of the Matlab file should look similar to the following:  % Protein data [sys,inter]=protein('1D3Z.pdb','1D3Z.bmrb',options); % Magnet field sys.magnet=21.1356; % Tolerances sys.tols.prox_cutoff=5.0; sys.tols.inter_cutoff=2.0;  Cut‐off tolerance for proximity is specified in Angstrom and cut‐off for J‐coupling is specified in Hz. 	In the example above, dipolar couplings would not be taken into account between spins that are further than 5.0 Å apart and any J‐coupling smaller than 2.0 Hz would be ignored. The next thing to be specified is the relaxation theory.

The sequence of human IL-18 (Uniprot: Q14116) and murine IL-18 following a T2A linker were synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies and Invitrogen. 	The parental vector pTRPE or MSGV was used to generate the constructs CAR-GFP, CAR-IL-18, GFP, and GFP-IL-18. Human normal donor or murine CD45.1 T cells were ex vivo-expanded by anti-CD3/CD28 beads with exogenous IL-2 and transduced with a lentivector or retroviral vector as reported previously (Milone et al., 2009).

PMC6032224	rs7170178	Article	RefSNP	False	In search of the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of AnxA2 on human osteoclast formation [88,89], a novel type I membrane protein was identified as a putative AnxA2 receptor [90]. 	A recent study linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AnxA2 gene (rs7170178) to osteonecrosis in sickle cell patients. 	The SNP frequency of the AnxA2 gene polymorphism was higher in sickle cell osteonecrosis patients than those without osteonecrosis [91]. Interaction of AnxA2 with the AnxA2 receptor also mediates adhesion and activation of the cells responsible for the initiation and maintenance of multiple myeloma [92] and this signal pathway could be used as a therapeutic target. 
PMC6034563	NCT02066116	Methods	NCT	False	This research protocol was approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the regulatory standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, 2000). 	The trial was registered with the National Institute of Health ClinicalTrials.gov protocol registration system (registration number: NCT02066116). 	Planned sample size was 40 but we decided to interrupt the study because for another clinical trial to see the effect of intervention for upper limb recovery in stroke patients was being conducted simultaneously, which made further enrollment in our trial difficult, and because of the pilot nature of our initial plan, we decided that the number of enrollments was sufficient at the time of termination.

PMC6041410	NCT00028262	Article	NCT	False	As LF and other lipopigments, such as ceroids, represent a marker of post-mitotic normal and pathologic aging, and they have been causally associated with neuropathological changes, LF elimination has been suggested as a suitable target in anti-aging therapies (Riga et al., 2006b). 	Recently, a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00028262) for the treatment of patients with infantile NCL associated with mutations in the CLN1 gene encoding for palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 has been carried out by orally administering the nucleophilic small molecules cysteamine bitartrate and N-acetylcysteine, aiming at the reduction of ceroid lipofuscin and granular osmiophilic deposits (GROD) (Levin et al., 2014). 	The results of the trial indicated that the patients presented a significant decrease of GROD in peripheral leukocytes, together with improved functional and behavioral parameters and fewer seizures. However, the results of these trials did not support the idea that the removal of the storage deposits correlates with a clinical benefit or halt neurodegeneration (Levin et al., 2014; Neverman et al., 2015).

PMC6060540	rs145633958	Introduction	RefSNP	False	However, the germline RET proto-oncogene variants identified during the past 20 years are localized in specific regions and involve eight exons (exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16) (9). 	We here report the first two cases of MTC associated with the variant of exon 2 of RET proto-oncogene causing the substitution of Leucine with Methionine at codon 56 (p.L56M; rs145633958), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported in association to MTC. 	In one case, the diagnosis of MEN2A cannot be excluded, considering the concomitant occurrence of pheochromocytoma. Interestingly, the above-mentioned variant has been described in association with Hirschsprung disease, which has been excluded in these two patients. 
PMC6060540	rs10900296	Discussion	RefSNP	False	To date, four missense exon 10 RET variants have been implicated in this association, most frequently in codon C620 (mostly C620R and occasionally C620S, and rarely C620W), but also in other areas (e.g., C609, C611, and C618) (6). 	Common variants in the RET promoter (rs10900296; rs10900297), at a SOX10 binding site in intron 1 (rs2435357), and in exon 2 (rs1800858; c.135G>A;p.A45A) have also been associated with Hirschsprung's disease, suggesting that common as well as rare variants might influence the occurrence of Hirschsprung's disease (17). 	It is important to mention that the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in our two patients was excluded based on clinical evaluation. However, the association between MTC and exon 2 p.L56M variant, which in turn is also related with a disease involved in MEN 2 phenotype, underlines the possibility of a pathogenic role of p.L56M variant in MTC.

PMC6073630	rs7853346	Article	RefSNP	False	The above examples identify three lncRNA as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ESCC patients. 	Three lncRNA PTENP1 tagSNPs, namely, rs7853346 C>G, rs865005 C>T, and rs10971638 G>A were genotyped in 768 GC patients and 768 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population [231]. 	Those patients with rs7853346 G allele had significantly reduced risk of GC, compared with those carrying C allele and was more obvious in older subjects (≥60 years), nonsmokers, nondrinkers, and subjects without family history of GC. Through bioinformatics analyses, it was found that rs7853346 might change the local folding structure of lncPTENP1 abolishing its sponging effect on miR-106b and miR-93 with a consequent reduction of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene expression (Figure 3G2). 
PMC6073630	rs7853346	Article	RefSNP	False	Through bioinformatics analyses, it was found that rs7853346 might change the local folding structure of lncPTENP1 abolishing its sponging effect on miR-106b and miR-93 with a consequent reduction of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene expression (Figure 3G2). 	These data suggest that GC susceptibility can be predicted by lncRNA PTENP1 polymorphism rs7853346 [231]. 	In another study it was found that the lncRNA H19 SNPs may contribute to susceptibility to GC resulting in gain and loss of function of miRNA-lncRNA interactions [232]. 
PMC6093992	490000	Article	OMIM	False		Despite progress in reducing the number of children newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) annually from 490000 to 150000 in the last 15 years, an estimated 1.8 million children under the age of 15 are living with HIV in 2015 [1, 2]. 	Compared to older populations, HIV-infected infants have high rates of mortality and rapid disease progression [3–5]. Among untreated HIV-infected infants, mortality peaks at 2–3 months, and approximately 35% die by their first birthday and 52% die by 2 years of age [3, 5].

PMC6095929	MF417837	Methods	ENA	False	As we were expecting to recover complete phage genomes due to viral enrichment, only contigs above 2.5 kb were considered for analysis. 	The assembled contigs used in the analysis presented here were submitted to the GenBank database under accession numbers MF417837-MF417995. 	Reads from various metagenome and metavirome studies were mapped to our phage contigs using the built in “map reads to reference” function in CLC Genomics Workbench. The same length and similarity fraction parameters mentioned above were used for read mapping of these datasets to our phage contigs. 
PMC6095929	HG813242	Results	ENA	False	As the proteins in the “back halves” of some of these genomes show highest homology to both CNPH82 or vB_SepiS_phiIPLA5, these recombinations may have happened at the single gene level. 	BLASTn of the Stb20 genome sequence against the NCBInr database (February 15th, 2017) show substantial regions of nucleotide identity (55% of the genome at 89% identity) covering the structural genes, to portions of three S. epidermidis genomes from Finland (HG813242.1), Australia (LT571449.147 and Russia (KT429161.1; 2015), as well as one Staphylococcus xylosus genome (LN554884.1)48,49. 	This suggests that these phages are closely associated with Staphylococcus species from human skin. These observations suggest three distinct possibilities: 1) That these phages perhaps infect hosts other than S. capitis and could suggest a wider host range 2) That genetic exchange between phages capable of infecting S. capitis and other Staphylococcus species has resulted in these hybrids or 3) That the various Staphylococcus infecting phages that seem to compose the Stb20-like phages shared a common ancestor. 
PMC6095929	CP008742	Results	ENA	False		One phage which was identified in samples from all individuals is most closely related (80% nucleotide identity over 19% of the length of the genome) to prophages identified on Pseudomonas savastanoi NCPPB 3335 genome (CP008742), and more distantly to Pseudomonas infecting phage vB_PaeP_Tr60_Ab31. 	Remarkably, the sequence of all contigs identified was perfectly conserved at the nucleotide level. One possible explanation is that these sequences were derived from contamination of the samples, in which case one could expect them to be present in all samples, which was not the case. 
PMC6095929	CP010979	Results	ENA	False	The vConTACT analysis also indicated that the phages with taxonomic affiliation to Enterobacteria phage mEp235 shared protein clusters with the ±49 kb phiPSA1-like genomes (Fig. 2A). 	A Mu-like phage found in a variety of samples (Supplementary Table S2) showed highest nucleotide identity to a prophage of P. putida S13.1.2 (CP010979.1). 	All the genomes identified across a range of body sites and individuals were 100% identical. Best BLAST analysis showed that several Pseudomonas JBD phages, as well as Mannheimia phage vB_MhM_3927AP2 and Vibrio phage martha12B12 were distant relatives to those identified in our study (Supplementary Fig. S6).

A total of 31,648 unigenes (75.63% = 31,648/41,848 of ALL unigenes, Table S2) were annotated by using the BLASTX and a variety of protein databases taking into account the identity between the unigene sequences and the sequences in the database (E-value < 10−5). In addition, 30,853 (73.73%), 22,722 (54.29%), 7,060 (16.87%), 13,781 (32.93%), and 24,306 (58.08%) unigenes were aligned against the Nr, SWISS-PROT, GO (Gene Ontology), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins), and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases, respectively.

After removing the adaptor sequences, empty reads, and low-quality sequences, a large number of high-quality reads were obtained, and the resultant datasets are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession numbers SRX3822957 and SRX3822958 for PH-FB and PH-LF transcriptome datasets, respectively. 	After combining the high-quality clean reads from PH-FB and PH-LF transcriptome datasets, the de novo assembly was performed using the Trinity de novo program to generate the ALL transcriptome datasets [83]. The functions of the assembled transcripts (contigs and unigenes) were first aligned by BlastX to the protein databases of NR, Swiss-Port, KEGG, and COG specifying the E-values of less than 10−5.

The Oncomine website (https://www.oncomine.org/resource/login.html) provided E2F3 expression analysis in the TCGA and gene expression omnibus (GEO) (accession number GSE3189 and GSE7553) databases. 	In addition, we have provided two supplemental tables on the data used in this article. More details about the raw data can be found in Tables S1 and S2. 
PMC6124799	GSE3189	Results	GEO	False	Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between E2F3 and melanoma. 	Further study found that E2F3 gene expression was increased in the TCGA and GEO databases (Figure 1D), and the ROC curve of GSE3189 revealed that E2F3 can identify melanoma tissue (AUC=0.9709) (Figure 1E). 	Survival analysis showed that high E2F3 expression results in decreases in OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients (Figure 1F and G). The relationship between CNV and E2F3 expression level 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Results	PDBe	False	We crystallized and solved the core structure of the mouse CAMSAP3 CKK domain (residues 1121–1239; denoted CKK3core) by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.4 Å (Table 1). 	Similar to a previously deposited but unpublished NMR structure (PDB ID 1UGJ), the CKK3core has a compact, globular structure composed of two N-terminal α-helices, which are connected by a disordered loop (loop1) and pack against a central, five-stranded β-sheet (Supplementary Fig. 3). 	Although CKK shows clear preference for MT minus ends, at high concentrations it can also decorate the whole MT lattice. We reasoned that a high-resolution structure of the lattice-bound CKK domain might shed light on the mechanism of its MT minus-end recognition. 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Results	PDBe	False	To confirm and extend the cryo-EM data, we also analyzed the structure of the CKK domain of CAMSAP3 bound to MTs using solid-state NMR (ssNMR), which provides a sensitive means to study ligand and protein binding to MTs at the atomic level24, 25. 	To do this, we compared the solution NMR (PDB ID 1UGJ) and our X-ray crystallographic results of free CKK with 2D ssNMR data recorded on [13C,15N] labelled CKK in complex with MTs. 	This allowed us to identify CKK residues that underwent significant chemical-shift/intensity changes on MT binding (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5a-d, labelled red) and those that experienced no significant change (labelled blue). For example, in our EM density, helix-α1 of the CKK domain sits across the β1- and β2-tubulins, while beneath it, loop7 and adjacent regions of the beta barrel wedge in between the β-tubulin subunits (Fig. 3a-c and Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Results	PDBe	False	The ssNMR data thus support the EM-derived binding mode at an atomic level. 	Neither the CKK N- and C-termini are visible in the crystal structure and both are flexible in solution (PDB ID 1UGJ). 	However, our cryo-EM and ssNMR data also support the role of the CKK N- and C-termini in MT binding. Density corresponding to the final portion of the N-terminus leading into helix-α1 (starting at S1120) is visible in our cryo-EM reconstruction contacting α2-tubulin (Fig. 2d, 3a,d), while additional cryo-EM density suggests that more N-terminal regions make additional contacts with β2-tubulin (red asterisks, Fig. 3a; red dashed line in Fig. 3d,). 
PMC6134180	Q80VC9	Methods	UniProt	False	Protein expression and purification for crystallization 	The DNA encoding the Mus musculus CAMSAP3 CKK core domain (denoted CKK3core, residues 1121–1239; Uniprot: Q80VC9) was amplified from the Mus musculus CAMSAP3 CKK domain vector (denoted CKK3) (residues 1112–1252) and cloned into the pET-based bacterial expression vector PSTCm2 (with an N-terminal 6x His-tag) by the positive selection methods53. 	The CKK3 and the mutants for biophysics characterization were cloned into the pET28a vector. Protein production was performed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) in LB media containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin. 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Methods	PDBe	False	Diffraction data were collected at the X06DA macromolecular crystallography beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institut) at a wavelength of 1 Å. The data were indexed with LABELIT55, refined and integrated in XDS56. 	The crystals diffracted up to 1.4 Å at a wavelength and the crystals belonged to the space group I422 with a = 96.4 Å, b = 96.4 Å and c = 63.3 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER57 with the available NMR structure (PDB ID 1UGJ) as a search model. 	Several rounds of manual model building in COOT58 and refinement in PHENIX.refine59 and REFMAC560 produced a final model with satisfactory R-work/R-free. The structure was validated by MolProbity and the wwPDB Validation Service. 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Methods	PDBe	False	A homology model of CAMSAP1-CKK (residues 1474–1600) was generated using MODELLER65, based on the CAMSAP3-CKK crystal structure as template. 	In order to model missing loops and terminal regions for both CKKs, the deposited NMR structure of the CAMSAP3 CKK domain (PDB ID 1UGJ) was used as template. 	CKK models were selected based on MODELLER’s statistical potentials score - zDOPE66. The model of CAMSAP1-CKK was rigidly fitted into its density map and for both CKKs, the local fits of secondary-structural elements and loops were scored with a local correlation score using TEMPy (SCCC,67. 
PMC6134180	3J6G	Methods	PDBe	False	To create the N1492A CAMSAP1 CKK model, the point-mutation on the wild type CAMSAP1 model was performed in Coot69 and this was rigidly fitted into the corresponding mutant CKK density. 	Final CKK fits were combined with rigid fits (using Chimera’s ‘fit in map’) of two tubulin dimers from the structure of the paclitaxel stabilized-MT44(PDB ID 3J6G). 	The rigid fitted models were already a good fit to experimental density, therefore the models underwent final refinement to their Bfactor sharpening resolutions (Table 2) with NCS restraints using the phenix.real_space_refine tool in Phenix70 to resolve clashes and improve model geometry. The MolProbity validation indicated zero Ramachandran outliers, 98.1 % Ramachandran favored residues, zero rotamer outliers and a clash score of 0.56. 
PMC6134180	1UGJ	Methods	PDBe	False	Finally, the pellet was transferred and packed into a 3.2 mm rotor. 	Resonance assignments were obtained from previous results (PDB ID 1UGJ) and additional solution-state NMR experiments on free CKK were recorded on a 600MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) to assign missing residues (2D HSQCs, 3D HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HAHB(CO)NH, hCCH-DIPSI). 	Solid-state NMR experiments involved two-dimensional NCA and CC Proton-driven spin diffusion (PDSD) experiments (temperature 260 K, MAS rate 14 kHz) as well as additional 2Q-1Q experiments (temperature 268 K, MAS 10 kHz). Mixing schemes employed SPECIFIC-CP transfers71 as well as SPC572 and Spin diffusion under weak coupling conditions73 for longer PDSD mixing times.

In case of control, the relative expression of each gene was set to 1. beta-Actin (GenBank accession #KM438516) due to its low expression variations was chosen as housekeeping gene. 	The mid-gut samples extracted from red palm weevil larvae fed on different diets were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the significant differences between means were determined by applying Fisher’s LSD test [44].

PMC6162525	rs25531	Conclusion	RefSNP	False		Among all the gene polymorphisms studied in this study, the 5-HTTLPR (rs25531) can be considered as the candidate gene for the early development of PAH among Malay ASD patients. 	
PMC6166924	rs12806698	Results	RefSNP	False	Genotyping was successful for all 26 SNPs in 243 samples after quality control procedures (134 cases and 109 controls), and all loci were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). 	Minor allele frequencies (MAF) ranged from 0.021 (RRM1 rs12806698) to 0.477 (RRM1 rs1465952) as shown in Table 2. 	The MAF of seven SNPs in the Southern African cohort differed significantly (P<0.05) from MAF in Kenya Luhya, including three SNPs in the d4T drug transporter gene and four SNPs in genes of the thymidine synthesis pathway, RRM2, RRM1 and TK2 (Table 2). The MAF for rs1801131 and rs1801133 in MTHFR reported here were also not significantly different from the MAF reported in a previous South African black cohort with unknown HIV infection status [35]. 
PMC6166924	rs1465952	Results	RefSNP	False	Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was analysed in seven genes where more than one SNP was genotyped. 	Complete linkage (D’ = 1.000) was found among the following SNPs: rs1465952, rs11030918 and rs12806698 in RRM1; rs3743712 and rs11859474 in TK2; rs8124728, rs1291142 and rs1891643 in SAMHD1; rs12505410 and rs2725252 in ABCG2. 	In addition, D’ was 0.961 between rs2290272 and rs8187758 in SLC28A1. SNPs in MTHFR and in SLC28A3 were not in significant LD with each other (D’ <0.3). 
PMC6166924	rs1801131	Results	RefSNP	False	Variation in SAMHD1 remained associated with SN in multivariable analysis, including rs8124728 (Pemp = 0.013), rs1891643 (Pemp = 0.017) and haplotype GGA (Pemp = 0.015, Table 3). 	Two SNPs in the thymidine synthesis pathway, rs1801131 in MTHFR and rs16918482 in RRM2B were associated with SN in a multivariable genotypic and recessive models (Pemp = <0.002, Table 3). 	These Pemp values were not corrected for multiple testing and may therefore be false positives; we have used them as hypothesis- generating associations. The Pemp values calculated using permutation models were considered more robust than the p values used for calculation of odds ratios (Table 3). 
PMC6166924	rs1891643	Results	RefSNP	False	The Pemp values calculated using permutation models were considered more robust than the p values used for calculation of odds ratios (Table 3). 	Considering the odds ratios generated during logistic regression, the recessive genotype of SAMHD1 rs1891643 may be considered as a possible risk factor for SN occurrence (OR = 5.089) whereas all other genotypes described above as significant in multivariable analysis may be protective against SN (OR<1, Table 3). 	Weak effect sizes were noted for these loci. The complete results for multivariable analysis can be found in S1 Table. 
PMC6166924	rs2242046	Discussion	RefSNP	False	A previous study found an association in Ethiopians between variation in SLC28A1 and dose-toxicity of zidovudine (AZT), another thymidine analogue used in ART [36]. 	However the associated variant in that study was rs2242046, which was not associated with SN in the current study, and not in linkage with significant SNPs in the current study. 	In this study, SLC28A1 SNP rs8187758 was associated in univariate analysis, but not multivariable analysis, with SN occurrence. This SNP has been previously reported to increase thymidine uptake [37], but its effect on d4T is not known. 
PMC6166924	rs8187758	Discussion	RefSNP	False	However the associated variant in that study was rs2242046, which was not associated with SN in the current study, and not in linkage with significant SNPs in the current study. 	In this study, SLC28A1 SNP rs8187758 was associated in univariate analysis, but not multivariable analysis, with SN occurrence. 	This SNP has been previously reported to increase thymidine uptake [37], but its effect on d4T is not known. If only thymidine uptake and not d4T uptake is increased, this should potentially cause decreased d4T toxicity, however if this SNP also increases d4T influx then the protective effect would be ablated. 
PMC6166924	rs8187758	Discussion	RefSNP	False	If only thymidine uptake and not d4T uptake is increased, this should potentially cause decreased d4T toxicity, however if this SNP also increases d4T influx then the protective effect would be ablated. 	SNP rs8187758 was in high LD with rs2290272 in our cohort, which has been shown to cause reduced expression of CNT1 and lowered affinity for substrates [38]; the effects of combinations of these SNPs on d4T uptake is not known. 	The SAMHD1 enzyme dephosphorylates dTTP but does not hydrolyse active d4T back to its unphosphorylated form [27]. SAMHD1 activity may therefore increase efficacy or toxicity of thymidine analogues by reducing competition with intracellular dNTP [39]. 
PMC6166924	rs8124728	Discussion	RefSNP	False	SAMHD1 activity may therefore increase efficacy or toxicity of thymidine analogues by reducing competition with intracellular dNTP [39]. 	We found significant associations between SAMHD1 genotypes and haplotypes involving SNPs rs8124728 and rs1891643, and SN in our cohort in both univariate and multivariable analyses. 	These SNPs are located in an intron and the 3’ UTR of the gene respectively with unknown function. They were in complete LD with rs1291142, a SNP described as causing decreased SAMHD1 expression [40]. 
PMC6166924	rs1891643	Discussion	RefSNP	False	They were in complete LD with rs1291142, a SNP described as causing decreased SAMHD1 expression [40]. 	However rs1291142 itself was not found to be associated with SN in this study, and SNP rs1891643 was seen to cause a 5-fold increase in SN risk, not a decrease in risk as would be expected from decreased SAMHD1 expression. 	Further work is required to understand the functional cause of the SAMHD1 SNP associations with SN observed in this study. Domingo et al. [41, 42] found associations in Caucasians between low expression TYMS genotypes in combination with MTHFR polymorphisms, and the development of several d4T-related toxicities, including lipodystrophy, sensory neuropathy and pancreatitis. 
PMC6166924	rs1801131	Discussion	RefSNP	False	They hypothesized that normal / high levels of MTHFR would cause decreased levels of thymidylate synthetase (causing lower de novo thymidine production) and therefore increased d4T toxicity, while low levels of MTHFR could associate with decreased d4T toxicity [41]. 	Our results showed a significant association between MTHFR SNP rs1801131 and SN, supporting the suggestion of a role of variation in this gene and ART toxicity. 	SNP rs1801131 or A1298C causes a glu429-to-ala (E429A) substitution which decreases MTHFR activity [43], which theoretically would cause increased thymidylate synthetase levels and decreased d4T toxicity. This is consistent with our finding of a protective effect of rs1801131 against SN.

SNP rs1801131 or A1298C causes a glu429-to-ala (E429A) substitution which decreases MTHFR activity [43], which theoretically would cause increased thymidylate synthetase levels and decreased d4T toxicity. 	This is consistent with our finding of a protective effect of rs1801131 against SN. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyses the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides [44] and therefore plays a critical role in de novo DNA synthesis and cell proliferation The tetrameric enzyme is composed of large RNR1 and small RNR2 subunits encoded by the RRM1 or RRM2 genes. 
PMC6166924	rs16918482	Discussion	RefSNP	False	The RNR2b isoform encoded by the RRM2B gene is induced by p53 and controls mtDNA synthesis in non-proliferating cells [45]. 	We found an association between RRM2B SNP rs16918482 and SN in a multivariable model. 	This SNP is in the 3’ UTR of the gene with no known function. In the 1000 genomes data from the Luhya from Kenya, this SNP tagged 25 other SNPs in RRM2B and further work to identify the causal variant underlying association with SN is required.

SNP in the promoter of CYP4A11 (rs9332978 T>C) has been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease in females of Russian cohort (Sirotina et al., 2018). 	This study proposed that the estradiol inhibits expression of CYP4A11 in the carriers of CC genotype which would result in reduced production of the vasoactive 20-HETE (Sirotina et al., 2018). Other polymorphism in CYP4A11gene is (T8590C) polymorphism which reduces its catalytic activity (White et al., 2013).

PMC6171375	1PQ2	Introduction	PDBe	False	The CYP2A6 crystal structure revealed that the CYP2A6 catalytic domain fold in 16 alpha helices and 4 beta sheets like all mammalian microsomal CYPs. 	However, its binding pocket is hydrophobic, compact and represent about one quarter of the binding pockets of some important drug-metabolizing CYPs like CYPs 2C8 (PDB code 1PQ2), 2C9 (PDB code 1R9O) and 3A4 (PDB code 1TQN)(Yano et al., 2005). 	Site-directed mutagenesis and homology modeling studies have indicated that the amino acids residues (e.g. Phe300, Ala 301, Ser 208 red, Ser369, and Leu370) may play have a key role in recognition of substrates, Figure 1 (Di et al., 2009). CYP2A6 gene polymorphism has been associated with smoking behavior, drug metabolism and lung cancer risk (Di et al., 2009).

The presence of this novel binding pocket suggests CYP2C9 may binds multiple ligands and undergo allosteric mechanism during its biological function (Williams et al., 2003). The crystal structure of CYP2C9 in complex with NSAID flurbiprofen has also been elucidated (Protein Data Bank ID: 1R9O) (Wester et al., 2004).

The crystal structure of CYP2C9 in complex with NSAID flurbiprofen has also been elucidated (Protein Data Bank ID: 1R9O) (Wester et al., 2004). 	It has revealed that the residue Arginine 108 is responsible for the binding of flurbiprofen and other substrates like naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac to CYP2C9 (Wester et al., 2004). Two residues of on helix I (Aspartate 293 and Asparagine 289) are interacting and stabilizing Arginine 108 (Wester et al., 2004).

Furthermore, recently, it has been reported that patients taking long-term oral anti-coagulants treatment with Vitamin K antagonists are at a high risk of thrombotic and/or major hemorrhage adverse events if they are carriers of one of three polymorphisms (Misasi et al., 2016), and the (Iso359Leu rs1057910) is one of them (Misasi et al., 2016).

Moreover, CYP1B1 gene polymorphisms L432V and A119S (rs1056827) were reported to be risk of developing endometrial (Zhu et al., 2011), laryngeal cancers and T2D (Yu et al., 2015; Elfaki et al., 2018). 	
PMC6171375	rs762551	Introduction	RefSNP	False	The substrate binding pocket of CYP1A2 is narrow, compact and closed to fit binding and oxidation of relatively large and planar substrates such as PAHs (Sansen et al., 2007). 	It has been reported that there is a SNP C>A (rs762551) in intron 1 of CYP1A2 with AA homozygote carriers metabolize the caffeine at highest rate (Womack et al., 2012). 	This polymorphism influences the inducibility of CYP1A2 particularly in smokers (Koonrungsesomboon et al. 2017). The highest CYP1A2 induction rate was reported in AA genotype and no difference between AC and CC genotypes (Sachse et al., 1999).

PMC6192338	CP015749	Introduction	ENA	False	Currently, there are five publicly available genomes of P. parmentieri (NCBI servers, June 2018), whereas only 3 of them are closed to a full chromosome. 	The genome (GenBank accession: NZ_CP015749.1) of the type strain P. parmentieri CFBP 8475T (previously P. wasabiae RNS 08.42.1A) is 5.03 Mb in size with GC content of 50.4% [27]. 	Among the 4462 proteins it encodes, there have been described some proteins speculated to ensure specific phenotypic traits that are important for P. parmentieri virulence and adaptation to its primary host - potato, such as PCWDE, components of secretion systems and AHL-dependent quorum sensing system [27]. The aim of the here presented study is to elucidate the genomic basis of P. parmentieri spread and rapid adaptation to different climate conditions (temperature, humidity).

PMC6208079	KY365435	Methods	ENA	False	Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian analysis (MrBayes 3.2) (10,000 tree generations, sampling each 10, discarding first 250 trees) and TreeDyn for tree drawing at the phylogeny.fr platform [54]. 	The 28S D2-D3 data set included 25 taxa and sequences homologous to nucleotides (nt) 3053–3968 of the P. falciformis sequence (KY365435). 	The ITS2 data set included 26 taxa and sequences homologous to nt 2513–2983 (including 15 nt of the flanking 5.8S rRNA gene and 28S rRNA gene). The cox1 data set included 15 taxa and sequences homologous to nt 200–650 of KY365437.

PMC6208079	KY365436	Results	ENA	False	The obtained ITS2 sequences of P. falciformis from the three countries were 100% identical, except one clone, suggesting an overall low geographical variation. 	The one exceptional rDNA clone (GenBank: KY365436) of the amplicon NF1-NC2 was from a female fragment from Germany, which had 15 SNPs (1802/1817 bp identities) compared to sequences from six other clones. 	This could be an additional haplotype or a rare intraspecific sequence variation in the rDNA repeats. GenBank database searches with the P. falciformis 18S and 28S rDNA sequences did not support the close phylogenetic relationship to A. abstrusus as would have been expected from the current taxonomic classification where Perostrongylus is considered as a subgenus of Aelurostrongylus [17].

PMC6237974	GSE120292	Results	GEO	False	Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was employed to compare the VgrR-binding promoters in the genome of X. campestris pv. campestris 8004. 	As shown in Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 4, after being challenged by 1.0 M sorbitol, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that the VgrR of the WT strain was potentially bound to the promoters of 87 genes (GenBank GEO: GSE120292). 	In the Δprc mutant, VgrR bound the promoters of 105 genes. Only 41 VgrR-regulated genes were shared by the two strains under osmostress (Fig. 7a). prc may regulate VgrR-promoter binding, and, therefore, a prc deletion may cause changes in genome-scale binding events. 
PMC6249285	3NHQ	Results	PDBe	False	Selected conserved amino acids are highlighted as sticks, water molecules are shown as red spheres. 	In the Pfr state of bathy bacteriophytochromes (a, wild-type Agp2-PCM and b, Agp2-PAiRFP2; c, PaBphP-PCM (P. aeruginosa; PDB entry 3NHQ29)) Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg202 show a conserved conformation. 	Furthermore, the cysteines are always β-facially bound to BV. In the Meta-F state of Agp2-PAiRFP2, the two monomers (Mol A and B) of the asymmetric unit (d, e) show slightly different structures. 
PMC6249285	4Q0J	Results	PDBe	False	In Mol B (e), the N-terminus is tightly packed to Mol A (Fig. 5). 	In the Pr states of prototypical bacterial (f, Agp1-PCMSER13 of A. fabrum, PDB entry 5HSQ30 and g, DrBphP-PCM of D. radiodurans; e.g. PDB entry 4Q0J18), cyanobacterial (h, Cph1-PCM of Synchocystis sp.; PDB entry 2VEA31) and plant (i, AtPhyB-PCM of A. thaliana; PDB entry 4OUR32) phytochromes, the rotameric states of the corresponding amino acids as well as the same two water molecules between the Tyr and Arg residues are similar to Mol A in the Meta-F state of Agp2-PAiRFP2 (d). 	Because of the low resolution (3.4 Å), these water molecules were not resolved in the AtPhyB-PCM structure32 Group III structural changes within the PHY tongue region 
PMC6249285	4Q0J	Discussion	PDBe	False	The group II structural changes seem to constitute the key process for coupling chromophore and protein structural changes. 	Here the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for ring D via reorientation of Tyr165 and Phe192 and the hydrogen bonding interactions of Tyr165 with the rotated Arg202 via two new water molecules is a structural motif that can be deduced from the various Pr state structures of prototypical bacterial (Agp1-PCMSER13 of A. fabrum [PDB entry 5HSQ30], DrBphP-PCM of D. radiodurans [e.g. PDB entry 4Q0J18]) and cyanobacterial (Cph1-PCM of Synechocystis sp. 	[PDB entry 2VEA31]) phytochromes. Also in plant phytochrome AtPhyB-PCM of A. thaliana (PDB entry 4OUR32) in its (dark adapted) Pr state, very similar rotameric states of the corresponding amino acids were found although the two water molecules between the Tyr and Arg residues were not resolved in that structure due to the low resolution (3.4 Å) (Fig. 7f–i).

In the Pfr structures of the bathy phytochrome PaBphP and the prototypical phytochrome of DrBphP, the conformations of all three amino acids (Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg202 in Agp2) are very similar to those observed in the present Pfr structures of Agp2-PCM and Agp2-PAiRFP2.

Also in plant phytochrome AtPhyB-PCM of A. thaliana (PDB entry 4OUR32) in its (dark adapted) Pr state, very similar rotameric states of the corresponding amino acids were found although the two water molecules between the Tyr and Arg residues were not resolved in that structure due to the low resolution (3.4 Å) (Fig. 7f–i). 	In the Pfr structures of the bathy phytochrome PaBphP and the prototypical phytochrome of DrBphP, the conformations of all three amino acids (Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg202 in Agp2) are very similar to those observed in the present Pfr structures of Agp2-PCM and Agp2-PAiRFP2. Consistent with these results, alternating conformations of Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg211 (numbering of Agp2) have been observed in the mixed Pr/Pfr state crystals of the Q188L PaBphP variant29.

PMC6305680	300746	Introduction	OMIM	False		Hemophilia B is an X‐linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F9 (OMIM 300746) on Xq27.1 resulting in reduced factor IX (FIX) activity. 	It occurs in about 2.8 cases per 100.000 males (Berntorp & Shapiro, 2012). Patients may experience surgery or trauma‐induced bleeding and, if more severe, spontaneous bleedings, for which they can be treated prophylactically or on‐demand with FIX concentrate.

PMC6395339	NCT03387475	Discussion	NCT	False	We recently showed potential positive effects of low doses of deferasirox in MDS patients. 	It is postulated that this drug quenches levels of reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of nuclear factor-κB in erythroblasts, which in turns induces proliferation of these cells and possible improvement of anemia.30 An ongoing clinical trial is investing the use of low-dose deferasirox in anemic patients with lower-risk MDS who have failed to respond to treatment with ESA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03387475). 	Secondly, increasing hepcidin level could prevent further accumulation of iron and reduce iron-mediated tissue injury by redistributing iron from parenchymal tissues to macrophages where iron is less toxic. A clinical trial with an agonist of hepcidin (LJPC-410) is ongoing in patients with β-thalassemia with myocardial iron overload (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03381833).

PMC6399298	NA12877	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	Comparison on the Platinum sample mixture dataset 	For the first synthetic dataset, as in previous studies5,10 we mixed two normal Platinum Genomes18 samples, NA12877 and NA12878, at 70:30, 50:50, and 25:75 tumor purity ratios to create three tumor contamination profiles, and at 5:95 ratio to create a contaminated normal sample. 	We also included a test with 100% pure normal and 50% pure tumor. We used the germline variants in NA12878, which were reference calls in NA12877 as truth set for the evaluation. 
PMC6399298	NA12877	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	False	Comparison on the Platinum tumor spike dataset 	For the third synthetic dataset, as in previous studies1,10, we constructed a tumor sample by spiking reads from NA12878 into NA12877 in variant positions of NA12878 with spike in frequencies sampled from a binomial distribution with means [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3] and used an independent set of NA12877 reads as pure normal. 	Note that, unlike earlier strategy, which mixed samples in fixed proportions yielding somatic mutations at fixed AFs, this mixing approach generated them at varying AFs ranging from 0.025 to 0.3. NeuSomatic yielded 80.9 and 66.7% F1-scores for SNVs and INDELs, respectively, overall and an improvement of up to 4% over the best method (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 4).

For the normal, we downsampled NA12877 to 50×. For tumor, we constructed three 50× in silico mixture samples with 70, 50, and 25% tumor purities, by independently downsampling NA12877, respectively, at 15×, 25×, and 37.5×, and mixing each with downsampled NA12878 at 35×, 25×, and 12.5×.

Thus, depending on the zygosity of the germline variants in NA12878, somatic mutations across these three tumor mixture ratios have AFs ranging from 12.5 to 70%. We also generated another 50× virtual tumor sample by randomly spiking reads from a downsampled (to 50× coverage) NA12878 into a downsampled (to 50× coverage) NA12877 data at heterozygous and homozygous variant locations in NA12878, which are reference calls in NA12877.

We built the long-reads error profile using the CHM1 dataset32 (SRA accession SRX533609). 	We then simulated a 100× pure normal sample using the VarSim simulation framework33 in combination with the LongISLND in silico long-reads sequencer simulator34. Using a set of random somatic mutations, we also simulated a 100× pure tumor sample with the same error profile. 
PMC6404619	PRJNA265040	Methods	BioProject	False	Reads longer than 18 nt were retained and were sequentially mapped to Arabidopsis thaliana rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, and transposable elements (TEs; downloaded from https://plants.ensembl.org/info/website/ftp/index.html and www.arabidopsis.org) using Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) to remove reads matching the same. 	Bowtie was used to map RNAseq datasets of Massonnet et al. (2017; NCBI BioProjects PRJNA265039 and PRJNA265040) to pre-MIR828 and downstream effector targets quantified by qRT-PCR (see below) in our field samples. 	There remained a few abundant 32-53 nt long reads in the libraries after pre-filtering that mapped to XR_002032162.1 “Vitis uncharacterized ncRNA”, XM_002283070.4 “DELETION OF SUV3 SUPPRESSOR 1”, a snoRNA, and a 5.8S rRNA. The pre-filtered reads were mapped to the reference Vitis vinifera 12X genome sequence, version NCBI RefSeq GCF_000003745.3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000003745.3) (Jaillon et al. 2007) using ShortStack (version 3.8.2) (Johnson et al. 2016).

Although vvi-MIR482 expression was not significantly changed by UV treatment in in vitro plantlets (P = 0.21, possibly due to small sample size and high read number), PhaseTank analysis revealed a non-coding phasi-RNA candidate TAS locus (chr13:15496204-15497757) (ShortStack phase score 1,737) generating a tasiRNA [3′D3(-)] by vvi-miR482 cleavage (Allen score = 5.0; P < 0.07) (Supplementary Table 4 and File S5). This novel candidate TAS locus significantly up-regulated by UV treatment (Supplementary Table 3a) was named vvi-TAS11 following the nomenclature of Zhang et al. (2012).

(2012). 	vvi-TAS11 maps to the 5′ end of an unannotated 87aa peptide-encoding locus VIT_13s0047g00100 with ESTs (GenBank XR_002031633.1, XR_787251.2) annotated as ’uncharacterized non-coding RNA’. 	Additionally, degradome evidence (Allen score 4.0; Supplementary Table 4) supports cleavage of a phasi-RNA-producing (phase score =93.5) Leucine-Rich-Repeat (LRR) transcript by the tasiRNA3′-D3(-), which is predicted to target another phasi-RNA-producing LRR (phase score 29.2), 12 NB-ARC-LRRs (Supplementary Tables 2b, 3a, 4), and the putative cation/hydrogen exchanger Vvi-CHX15. Induction of MYBA6 and MYBA7 in vegetative tissues upon UV-B radiation has been observed previously (Matus et al. 2017).

PMC6447580	2F61	Results	PDBe	False	This mutation at 409 changes D to V (Valine), a non-polar amino acid side chain, which lost all WT interactions with surrounding amino acid side chains. 	Human PDB crystal structures 2F61, pH7.2, 2.5 Å and 3GXI, pH 5.5, 1.84 Å from Swiss PDB Viewer (DeepView, SPDBV,Version 4.10) program were used for modelling. 	Amino acids involved side chain interaction are listed in Supplementary Table 1. V394 is located on Domain 1 of GCase at the anti-parallel β-sheet, which is close to the active site pocket (a loop formation) opening13,30. 
PMC6447580	3KEH	Results	PDBe	False	At pH 5.5, the force field energy for V394L mutant changes from 12.841 to 28645.000 KJ/mole (2230 fold) compared to WT, especially in the non-bound energy calculation, suggesting this mutation affects GCase both in structure as well as accessibility for side chain interaction leading to reduced enzymatic activity. 	The side chain interaction at N370S was analyzed based on its crystal structures at pH 7.1 (3KEH) and acidic pH 5.4 (3KEO)18. 	Located at Domain III, the role of N370 in the catalytic cycle is significant, probably associated with local conformational effects at or near the active site15. Here, N370S at pH 5.4 showed slight conformation changes compared to WT (Supplementary Table 1).

PMC6448008	rs1360780	Article	RefSNP	False	The GR regulating gene, FKBP5, has also been the subject of several studies investigating differential methylation in peripheral tissue. 	Certain polymorphisms of FKBP5 (rs1360780, rs9296158, rs3800373, and rs9470080) interact with ELA to predict MDD and suicide attempts (Roy et al., 2010; Appel et al., 2011). 	One study by Klengel et al. (2012) examined FKBP5 methylation levels in the blood of individuals with a history of ELA and found hypomethylation in intron seven. Another study collected saliva samples from children who had experienced ELA, and assessed them for DNA methylation levels at two CpG sites in intron seven of FKBP5 (Tyrka et al., 2015).
