PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	Results	False	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1). 
PMC2154357	1BL8	Methods	Methods	False	All values are reported in Table I together with previous results on KcsA (Bernèche and Roux, 2001; Noskov et al., 2004). 	We estimate that the accuracy and overall significance of the calculated free energies is roughly on the order of 1 kcal/mol, based on the difference between the computations with 1K4C (Noskov et al., 2004) and 1BL8 (Bernèche and Roux, 2001) and the comparison between the CHARMM PARAM27 and AMBER force fields. 	For the simulations with the AMBER force field, the systems were reequilibriated for 1.5 ns before starting the free energy computations. The hydration number of K+ and Na+ in the various binding sites were computed from the average of 800 ps of MD for each configuration; statistical error was estimated by comparing block averages. 
PMC2216687	Q9XVV3	Results	Results	False	We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. 	For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. 	Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively.

PMC2216687	P01023	Results	Results	False	Moreover, the CSIDOP may provide additional functional terms to existing proteins. 	For example, the Alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor [Swiss-Prot: P01023], was predicted by CSIDOP to be involved in protease inhibitor activity (GO:0030414), which is not among the current list of functions annotated in GO. 	Consistent with this prediction, alpha-2-macroglobulin is found to be a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested [33].

PMC2677866	1CW0	Methods	Methods	False		Similarity of the Vsr-like homing endonuclease to known structures was found using the Phyre server (34), and a structure model was created with the Rosetta structure prediction program suite using the K*Sync alignment method (35), with PDB structure 1CW0 as a template. 	For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein.

Residues that were modeled in similar positions and backbone conformations after sequence threading and energy minimization are shown in upper case; unaligned sequence regions are shown in grey lowercase. Identical residues are highlighted in red. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	Results	False	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17). 
PMC2677866	NZ_ABDA01000203.1	Results	Results	False	In another case, Vsr-like ORFs are present in two group I introns of recA genes. 	One of these introns is found in a gene fragment from a whole genome shotgun sequencing project of Bacillus cereus (NCBI accession NZ_ABDA01000203.1). 	The fragment includes part of a recA 5′ region and a group I intron with a complete Vsr-like ORF. This region is 94% identical to a B. anthracis recA gene with an active group I intron (45) and identical recA loci from several other sequenced Bacilli (data not shown).

PMC2928273	rs1799724	Results	Results	False	Inflammation-related SNPs and Risk of Pneumonitis 	A different set of inflammation-related SNPs was found to be significantly associated with risk of developing pneumonitis following radiation therapy and remained so at an FDR of 10% ( Table 4 ). Only one of the 12 SNPs identified were also associated with esophagitis risk – TNF:rs1799724. 	Patients homozygous for this variant exhibited a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI:1.33–18.57) of pneumonitis. This risk is similar for esophagitis risk in patients carrying at least one variant allele ( Table 2 ).

PMC2928273	rs1801275	Results	Results	False	Joint Analysis of Pneumonitis Risk Alleles 	In combined analysis, the significant SNPs together with an additional borderline significant variant – IL4R: rs1801275 (P = 0.053) – showed an increase in pneumonitis risk as the number of unfavorable genotypes increased ( Table 3 ). The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013). 	This risk was dramatically increased for the group of patients with four or more unfavorable genotypes (P<0.0001). These high risk individuals also had a shorter duration between start of treatment and development of pneumonitis of only 5.33 months compared to over 12 months for those with 0 to 2 unfavorable genotypes ( Figure 1B ).

The other two significant variants (rs5275 and rs689470) are located in the 3′-UTR and regulate PSTGS2 mRNA levels. 	Our results suggest that these SNPs are linked with an increase in pro-inflammatory activity leading to esophagitis.

PMC2928273	rs4073	Discussion	Discussion	False	IL1A:rs17561 is a non-synonymous SNP and increases processing of the IL1-α precursor resulting in an increase in the levels of active IL1-α [29]. 	The variant of IL8:rs4073, which was found to increase pneumonitis risk 3-fold, has been associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL8 [30]. 	IL4 and IL13 work together to regulate the inflammatory response. Four genetic variants in these two genes were associated with ∼3-fold increased risk of pneumonitis. 
PMC2928273	rs1061622	Discussion	Discussion	False	Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. 	For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. 	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis.

This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. 	Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant results in production of a variant allozyme with reduced enzyme activity [43] resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide production [44]. These observations support our findings of decreased pneumonitis due to decreased inflammatory signaling.

PMC3044699	106210	Introduction	Introduction	False		Aniridia (AN; OMIM 106210) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. 	The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1]. 
PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	Introduction	False	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18].

(c) The interface structure of the antibody-VEGF is depicted based on the G6-Fab-VEGF complex structure (2FJG), where the 30 CDR interface residues are shown in stick model and the VEGF homodimer structure (V and W chains) shown in sphere model. 	The distribution of the color-coded CDR residues shows the position-dependence of the amino acid preferences towards VEGF-binding. The core interface region (boxed in red square) contains residues with high stringency in amino acid type requirement comparing with the residues in the peripheral interface region. 
PMC3310866	3AUV	Results	Results	False	Since the phage display systems in Figure 1 are based on the scFv and the sc-dsFv scaffolds, it is important to verify that both the scFv and the sc-dsFv structures are similar to the variable domain structure in G6-Fab even in the absence of the two Fab constant domains in the scFv or the sc-dsFv structures. 	High-resolution sc-dsFv structure with the sequence identical to the parent G6-Fab variable domains (except for the two interface cysteines in the sc-dsFv shown in Figure 2) has been elucidated with x-ray crystallography as shown in Figure 2 (PDB code 3AUV); the refinement data are shown in Table S3. 	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details.

The structural differences of the engineered interface disulfide bond unique to the sc-dsFv structure are also highlighted in Figure 2.

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	Discussion	False	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to ACSL1 rs6552828. 	In the single-SNP analyses, rs6552828 explained 6.1% of the variance in the response of VO2max. 	Homozygotes of the rs6552828 minor allele (AA) had 125 mL/min (−28%) and 63 mL/min (−17%) lower VO2max response than the common allele homozygotes (GG) and the heterozygotes (AG) respectively.

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	Discussion	False	Further investigations are thus needed with other ethnic groups and populations as the one studied here, i.e. representing an important fraction of the total planet population. 	In summary, our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is marginally associated with male elite endurance status in Chinese (Han) population yet such association was not found in Chinese females or in a different (Caucasian) cohort. 	Our findings exemplify the need for further genetic association studies in the field of sport sciences to use at least two cohorts of a different ethnic background in order to increase the generalisability of their results.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	Results	False	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). 	Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	Results	False	From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. 	Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. 	The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2]. 
PMC3689696	AY452039	Methods	Methods	False	For distance calculation the distance estimation method K3ST (Kimura’s three-substitution-types; [29]) was used. 	To construct cluster networks in form of rooted rectangular phylogrammes, the sequence AY452039 of Candida picachoensis CBS 9804T was used as outgroup. 	This species is close enough to the M. pulcherrima group [7] to have a D1/D2 sequence moderately related to the analysed sequences but far enough to be an uncontroversial outgroup. To generate neighbor-nets, Equal Angle setting was chosen and the sequence used as outgroup in cluster networks was excluded from the analysis, as its inclusion had little effect on the overall structure (the neighbor nets are unrooted networks) of the network and the layout of the network was improved by its exclusion.

PMC3730352	AB065375	Introduction	Introduction	False	For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. 	In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). 	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010).

PMC3791179	rs5743808	Abstract	Abstract	False	No polymorphisms in TLR1 or TLR2 were associated with LD. 	A TLR6 polymorphism, 359T>C (rs5743808), was associated with an elevated risk of LD in genotypic and dominant (OR 5.83, p=7.9×10−5) models. 	The increased risk in persons with 359 TC or CC genotypes was further enhanced among smokers. In a multivariate model, 359T>C was associated with a higher risk of LD (OR 4.24, p=0.04), than any other variable, including age and smoking. 
PMC3791179	rs3821985	Results	Results	False	We analyzed 14 candidate polymorphisms, 5 in TLR1, 3 in TLR2, and 6 in TLR6 in 98 cases and 268 controls. 	Two TLR6 SNPs (rs3821985 and rs3775073) had HWE p values ≤ 0.001 and were not analyzed further. 	Since TLR1 and TLR6 are contiguous genes on chromosome 4p14, we evaluated the linkage disequilibrium pattern for the 5 TLR1 and 4 TLR6 SNPs in the control population (Fig. 2). The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage. 
PMC3791179	rs5743618	Results	Results	False	The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage.

The frequency of a single TLR6 SNP, rs5743808 (359T>C), a nonsynonymous variant in the extracellular leucine rich repeat domain of the protein (encoding an isoleucine-to-threonine transition at amino acid residue 120), was greater in cases compared to controls (genotypic analysis: p= 7.9 ×10−5) (Table 2). This association remained significant after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons (p=9.5 ×10−4).

PMC3843656	rs11209026	Introduction	Introduction	False	Different studies have identified IL23R as a susceptibility factor associated to multiple inflammatory conditions [16,17,18]. 	In these studies several independent signals located within IL23R locus were suggested; however, only the R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism, whose minor allele plays a protective role for several autoimmune disease, appear to have a functional involvement [19,20]. 	Additionally, the rs1495965 polymorphism has been reported as the stronger IL23R association with Behçet’s disease (BD), a systemic autoimmune disease involving uveitis, in a previous combined meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [21,22]. On the other hand, STAT4 has been also identified as another shared susceptibility locus [23,24]. 
PMC3843656	rs3821236	Methods	Methods	False	Since the aim of this study was to investigate whether different STAT4/IL23R autoimmune disease-associated polymorphisms were also implicated in the susceptibility to develop non-anterior uveitis, the IL23R and STAT4 polymorphisms most robustly associated with autoimmunity were selected. 	Following this criterion, we studied the IL23R rs11209026 genetic variant, encoding the functional amino-acid change Arg381Gln [16,17,18,19,20], and two independent STAT4 SNPs (rs3821236 and rs7574865), influencing levels of the protein [23,24,25]. 	Additionally, two IL23R polymorphisms were analyzed; rs7517847, strongly associated with Crohn’s disease and whose association seems to be independent on rs11209026 [16], and, rs1495965, previously associated with BD by GWASs [21,22]. On the other hand, two STAT4 genetic variants, rs7574070 and rs897200, recently associated with BD, were included in the study [26,27].

PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	Abstract	False	Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), we identified rs17099451 in MMP8, using a single locus model, with a mean cross-validation of 87.0%. 	Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%. 	Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease.

The sequences obtained were compared with the reference sequence of COL6A1 gene (NM_001848.2) with Sequencer ver. 4.10.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). 	As a result, we found three variants of unknown significance; one homozygous intronic variant (c.588+19dupC), one heterozygous missense variant in the start of exon 11 (c.904G>A; p.Gly302Arg), and one homozygous silent variant (c.1095T>C; p.Gly365=). Of those variants, c.904G>A (p.Gly302Arg) was considered as a potential candidate for disease-causing mutation (Fig. 3).

PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	Methods	False	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search.

Highest similarity of the LSU sequences was found with “Mollisia incrustata” GenBank GU727556; however, this sequence does not appear to be congeneric with other Mollisia sequences on GenBank (data not shown) and thus the application of the supposed taxonomic lineage of Mollisia (Leotiomycetes; Helotiales; Dermateaceae) would not be confirmed here. 	Examination of the blast results also did not result in a clear affinity to any of the classes, with a more or less equal similarity to both Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes and therefore this genus is treated here as incertae sedis. It is quite possible that the genus belongs to a class that is currently not represented in the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database.

PMC4188009	1c3w	Discussion	Discussion	False	It has been reported that the neutral purple form is destabilized in bR-containing vesicles reconstituted with egg lethicin, in which the transition from the neutral purple form into an inactive red form with λmax at 480 nm takes place at pH 6.5 (Nasuda-Kouyama et al., 1990 ▶). 	With respect to the protein structure in the P63 crystal, Glu194 OE2 in the structural model solved at 1.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 1c3w) has an unusually large B factor (62 Å2; Luecke et al., 1999 ▶). 	(The B factor of Glu199 OE2 of aR2 in the H32 crystal is 31 Å2.) It is possible that the conformation of Glu194bR in the P63 crystal represents a mixed state between the neutral purple form and the alkaline pink form. There is another caveat to the structural model of bR that was built using the P63 crystal.

PMC4208647	A23187	Results	Results	False	Then, we investigated whether VNUT gene expression is linked with the secretion of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells. 	Nucleotide secretion was triggered by the addition of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, since it causes entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell interior; the resultant rapid increase in Ca2+ facilitates exocytosis of secretory vesicles. 	As shown in Figure 4A, appreciable amounts of ATP and ADP were released from the cells in a time‐dependent fashion. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in the medium, no A23187‐dependent release of nucleotides was observed.

PMC4479853	rs1420101	Introduction	Introduction	False	SNPs associated with childhood asthma could be consistently linked to transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.13 The second asthma GWAS analyzed sequence variants affecting blood eosinophil counts in Icelanders, and the ten most significant SNPs were further studied in 12118 Europeans and 5212 East Asians including Koreans. 	While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

Furthermore, homozygous ALDH1A3 missense and nonsense mutations in humans have been linked to anophthalmia and microphthalmia (MIM: 615113; A/M) with some affected individuals also exhibiting autistic traits [18–23]. 	Though no clear evidence supports a link between variants in ALDH1A3 with autism, mouse studies show that lack of Aldh1a3 (Gene NC_000073.6) results in abnormal GABAergic neuronal differentiation in the forebrain basal ganglia [24]. Malfunctions in this inhibitory system have been found to be associated to mental disorders like ASD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [25,26]. 
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	Introduction	False	This overexpression has also been reported in ASD children [32]. 	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs).

PMC4591669	P50694	Results	Results	False	The most abundant contig by far was Pa_24402 with a FPKM sum of 523 781 over the 24 samples, or 4.2 million mapped reads total. 	Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. 
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	Results	False	The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. 	The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase MdPL1 in growing apple.72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. 	Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 
PMC4591669	BG319625	Results	Results	False	The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 	Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry (PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry.73 	In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Table S4). 
PMC4591669	JU090722	Results	Results	False	Notable contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 further included two putative transcription factors (an AP2 family member, Pa_00973 and an MYB family member, Pa_23194, best B2G hit MYB66), a putative (hemi)cellulase (Pa_10720) and a lipid transport protein (Pa_22556, best BG2 hit uncharacterized GPI-anchored protein). 	The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein, PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit.29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572. 	
PMC4591669	IPR012392	Results	Results	False	Exocarp-specific contigs with probable relevance for wax biosynthesis included Pa_00478 (best hit WAX2, or CER1), Pa_06166 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) and the Top 40 contig Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid-transfer protein, allergen Pru av 3) in cluster NG1-QT28, and the unclustered contig Pa_08907 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 19). 	Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. 	Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation. 
PMC4591669	AY376878	Results	Results	False	With Pa_06731 (NG1-QT43), it is the most abundant pectate lyase transcript in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome. 	It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY37687814) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase PcPEL1 from sour cherry73 (best hit of PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). 	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. 
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	Results	False	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. 	Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. 	Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage.90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB.

This process was performed using UCSF Chimera v.1.8 software (Pettersen et al. 2004). T. cruzi culture and DNA extraction - T. cruziepimastigotes were cultured at 27ºC in Schneider medium (Sigma S9895) that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (Gibco) (Baker & Price 1973, Miralles et al. 2002).

The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003].

At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type BRAF (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). 	Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (Fig. 1).

PMC4682451	138120	Methods	Methods	False	M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. 	The promoter of the HSPA5 (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. 	GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region ≥150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI. 
PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	Discussion	False	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

A randomized, multi-center study of adult cigarette smokers switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus or ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917) (Ogden et al., 2015b). 	Subjects’ experience with the randomized product was followed for 24 weeks. A group of never smokers was included for baseline comparisons.

PMC4724163	KT594769	Results	Results	False	The genome of MaHV-1 is the first metatherian herpesvirus to be sequenced. 	Excluding the genomic termini, which remained unresolved, the final genome length of MaHV-1 was approximately 140.1 kbp (Fig. 1) [GenBank:KT594769], larger than previously predicted. 	This difference appears to be due to a larger than predicted inverted repeat region [15]. This included a 98.8 kbp UL region and a 15.3 kbp US region flanked by 13 kbp inverted repeat sequences (IRS/TRS). 
PMC4724163	BAP00706	Results	Results	False	Comparison of other viral core genes yielded similar clustering patterns. 	Comparison of the MaHV-1 UL27 and UL30 ORFs with those of the recently sequenced fruit bat herpesvirus 1 (FbHV-1) [GenBank:BAP00706 and GenBank:YP_009042092; UL27 and UL30, respectively] showed that these ORFs shared 71 and 67 % pairwise aa identity, respectively (83 and 78 % aa similarity). 	This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials. 
PMC4724163	SRP067309	Methods	Methods	False	Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina, Inc.) in paired-end 150 bp format. 	Over 350 Mbp of sequence data were obtained from 2.69 million paired reads with a mean length of 137 bp (standard deviation of 26.3) and were submitted to the Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP067309]. 	Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and de novo assembly was performed using medium-low default sensitivity settings on the bioinformatics package Geneious version 6.1.7 [37] (Biomatters Ltd). This yielded four large contigs (52.6 kbp, 37.3 kbp, 14.9 kbp and 17 kbp) with consensus sequences that corresponded to herpesvirus sequence, according to Blastx and Blastn searches of GenBank databases [38, 39].

PMC4732286	GSE50393	Results	Results	False	Identification of downstream targets of CHIR and LIF in mESCs 	To screen the possible shared targets of the Wnt/β-catenin and LIF–Stat3 signaling pathways, we performed a DNA microarray analysis in mESCs treated with or without CHIR (GEO Number: GSE50393). 	We then looked for genes that were upregulated by 1.5 times or greater by CHIR treatment or by Stat3 stimulation (Bourillot et al., 2009). From this comparison, two common targets emerged: Trh and Sp5 (Fig. 1A).

PMC4748402	3R5N	Article	Article	False	A pharmacophore model is a 3D arrangement of physicochemical features (e.g., hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, hydrophobic area, aromatic ring) that represents the key interactions between a ligand molecule and its target protein. 	As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	3D-multiconformational compound libraries can be screened against a pharmacophore model to retrieve molecules that map the pharmacophore features and consequently have a high likelihood of being active on the target. Depending on the target, this method can achieve success rates between 2 and 30% (Hein et al., 2010). 
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	Figure	True	As indicated, the used search keywords were plant chemistry, plant pharmacology, plant natural product, plant compound, plant drug discovery, plant bioactivity, and the total number of PubMed publications per year was retrieved by search with the symbol *. The trend analysis reveals that the increase of PubMed citations in the target areas is faster than the increase in the total number of annual PubMed citations (indicated by the steeper slopes of the respective trend lines). 	(A) Two molecules of magnolol concomitantly occupying the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) are shown, with the chemical interaction pattern that defines the activity of the molecules depicted. 	Yellow spheres represent hydrophobic interactions, red and green arrows mark hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms. This interaction pattern may be converted into a structure-based pharmacophore model and used for virtual screening.

PMC4920148	135100	Introduction	Introduction	False		Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. 	The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously.

PMC5070816	AFW98990	Discussion	Discussion	False	A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. 	The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. 	Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].

PMC5296949	NCT01692756	Conclusion	Conclusion	False	Corticosteroids have previously been demonstrated to reduce early OA changes such as osteophyte formation and cartilage lesion in a canine OA model [54] and to reduce cartilage degradation when administered early after anterior cruciate ligament injury in a porcine model [55]; however, they do not entirely halt disease progression. 	Clinical trials are currently underway to examine the effect of intra-articular administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid on pain, joint function, inflammation, and cartilage degradation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01692756). 	Anti-cytokine, anti-MMP therapies, and anti-S100A8/A9 therapies are promising candidates for new disease-modifying OA drugs. However, preventing the expression and/or release of degradative mediators rather than inhibiting their activity may prove more efficient. 
PMC5346417	KFX50394	Article	Article	False	This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. 	It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). 	The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure.

Moreover, the mtDNA of Lottia digitalis (GenBank Accession Number NC_007782) turned out to be very fast-evolving and very prone to create LBA artifacts, therefore this taxon was excluded from the study, thus lowering the number of ingroups to 109. 	Being Lottia the only known representative of the clade with a published complete mtDNA, unfortunately this also led to the exclusion of the whole Patellogastropoda from our analysis. The ML analysis was extensively described elsewhere (see, in particular, see supplementary Additional file S4, Supplementary Material online of Plazzi et al. 2016).

In the present study, we analyzed public breast cancer expression profiles made using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (NCBI GEO database 20, accession GSE65194) for the expression of alpha subunits of NKA. 	We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05).

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	Discussion	False	In the present study of patients with established CAD, we investigated the association between 45 lead SNPs from loci associated with CAD and five common biochemical markers of inflammation. 	The main findings were; 1) for SNP rs2075650 in the TOMM40, APOE locus, the established CAD-risk allele was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP levels, 2) No other CAD-related SNPs were associated with the inflammatory marker levels, either measured as individual SNPs or when combined into a GRS. 	Previous GWASs have demonstrated a robust association between the rs2075650 G-allele and an increased risk of CAD [11]. In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19].

Considering the well-established relationship between increasing levels of hs-CRP and adverse cardiovascular outcome [20], it may be surprising that the CAD risk allele of rs2075650 was associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in our sample. 	However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies. In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21]. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	Discussion	False	The CAD risk allele (G) has been associated with a range of other phenotypes including reduced longevity [24], reduced BMI [25], increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [22,26], and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [27]. 	Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene. 	The APOE encodes the apolipoprotein E with three different isoforms (ε2, ε3, and ε4 defined by the combination of rs7412 and rs429358. Northwestern European ancestry (CEU): r2 = 0.02 and r2 = 0.20 with rs2075650, respectively), of which the ε4 isoform has long been known to associate with LDL-C, Alzheimer’s disease, and hs-CRP [28,29].

Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response.

PMC5501546	rs1561198	Discussion	Discussion	False	To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the association between calprotectin and CAD-associated risk variants. 	Although none of the CAD-associated variants significantly affected calprotectin levels, a trend was observed for rs1561198. 	This SNP is located between the VAMP5 and VAMP8 genes, whose products are involved in different aspects of vesicle trafficking including cytokine release and phagocytosis [43]. Hence, a link between this locus and calprotectin levels may plausibly exist. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	Conclusion	False		In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3.

PMC5520553	rs10052999	Discussion	Discussion	False	In conclusion, patients with OLT for HCC require different therapeutic regimens compared with patients with etiologically distinct liver disease. 	Specifically, this study found that recipient C6 rs9200 allele G was associated with rapid tacrolimus metabolism during the first 3 weeks after transplantation, and donor C6 rs10052999 homozygote represented a marker for rapid tacrolimus metabolism at weeks 2, 3, and 4 after OLT. 	Further, this study confirmed the association of CYP3A5 rs776746 SNPs with tacrolimus C/D ratios. The combination of C6 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms exerted a greater effect on tacrolimus metabolism than individual SNPs and developed better equations that described the association between genotype and tacrolimus metabolism.

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	Discussion	False	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 	In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	Discussion	False	First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. 	However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population.

To our knowledge, the PROS1 c.1871‐14T>G variant was not described associated with PSD and it is very rare in the general population (rs754929347; MAF C = 0.000009/1). 	Analysis of this variant using the Alamut‐v2.2 interactive biosoftware predicted the creation of a new cryptic acceptor splice site (scores: SSF = 71.78; MaxEnt = 2.32 and HSF = 76.10). As c.1871‐14T>G has a potential effect on intron 14–exon 15 acceptor splice site, we decided to study its PROS1 mRNA.

PMC5731891	NCT02876861	Discussion	Discussion	False	Currently, only a few prospective randomized studies are ongoing for locally advanced UTUC. 	One ongoing randomized trial (NCT02876861) evaluating the role of 2 to 4 cycles of NAC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for patients with locally advanced UTUC who are eligible for cisplatin hopefully will provide insight for clinical benefit. 	However, this study will not provide the useful information for the role of NAC in cisplatin-ineligible patients. The use of carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting is still a matter of debate [14]. 
PMC5737465	PRJNA275635	Methods	Methods	False	Population Genomic Data Processing 	We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single C. grandiflora population, generated by Josephs et al. (2015) (NCBI accession number PRJNA275635, ID: 275635). 	We trimmed the paired-end 100-bp raw reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014), and randomly subsampled reads of each individual to a total of 54 million reads per sample (average coverage 25×) to avoid an overrepresentation of individual samples with high coverage. We mapped the trimmed reads to a TE-merged reference with bwa bwasw 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin 2009), as recommended before analyses with PoPoolationTE2 (Kofler et al. 2016). 
PMC5737465	PRJNA212731	Methods	Methods	False	C. rubella was derived from a C. grandiflora-like outcrossing ancestor fairly recently, most likely <200,000 years ago (Foxe et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2009; Brandvain et al. 2013; Slotte et al. 2013), and it is the best available model for inferring such information. 	Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs.

The two M(NLS-88E) structures were also solved using 1EA3. 	Refinement and model building were carried out using PHENIX34 and COOT.35 Final refinement of M(NLS-88R)-acidic, M(NLS-88R)-neutral, M(NLS-88E)-acidic and M(NLS-88E)-neutral resulted in Rwork/Rfree of 19.2/23.6, 27.2/32.1, 22.0/31.2 and 22.8/30.8, respectively.

PMC5750462	1EA3	Results	Results	False	Detailed crystallographic data for all four structures (M(NLS-88R)-neutral, M(NLS-88R)-acidic, M(NLS-88E)-neutral and M(NLS-88E)-acidic) obtained are presented in Table 1. 	M(NLS-88R)-neutral occurs as physiological monomers similar to wt-M1 structure 1EA3 (also crystallized at neutral pH),12 and are arranged loosely in a so-called ‘face-to-back’ orientation with each other in the cell (Figure 1A). 	The residues Lys104 (part of the NLS motif), Arg134, Tyr100 and Asp94 on the ‘face’ of one molecule (Monomer A) interact with several complementary residues on the ‘back’ of a second molecule (Monomer B), including Glu29, Asp30, Lys21 and Ser17 (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite also crystallizing at a neutral pH, the two monomers (A and B) of M(NLS-88E)-neutral unexpectedly associate to form a physiological face-to-face dimer with the NLS basic residues adjacent to each other similar to wt-M1 dimer 1AA7 (crystallized at acidic pH).13 The two monomers of M(NLS-88E)-neutral are similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ~0.4 Å, but are different from those in wt-M1 1AA7.13 
PMC5750462	1AA7	Discussion	Discussion	False	When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (Figures 1F and 2). 	When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation.

PMC5766183	4mut	Results	Results	False	EMSA experiments revealed that the E89A+R91A mutant of the UbaLAI-N domain retained residual DNA binding ability (KD for specific DNA is approx. 200 nM, or 5000-fold lower than observed with wt UbaLAI-N, Supplementary Figure S5A and D). 	To generate an UbaLAI variant with a completely disabled N-domain, we have introduced two additional mutations, R37A and H38A, thereby generating a quadruple (R37A + H38A + E89A + R91A) mutant of the full-length UbaLAI (henceforth referred to as UbaLAI-4mut), and a corresponding variant of the UbaLAI-N domain. 	EMSA experiments with the quadruple UbaLAI-N mutant confirmed complete loss of its specific DNA binding ability (Supplementary Figure S5E). DNA binding by the full-length UbaLAI-2mut and UbaLAI-4mut proteins was investigated by a standard gel-shift assay. 
PMC5766183	3hqf	Discussion	Discussion	False	We show here that Type IIE enzymes UbaLAI and EcoRII use similar N-terminal effector domains specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ sequence. 	Despite the fact that UbaLAI-N and EcoRII-N domains share only 18% sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1C), their overall structures are very similar (Figure 4B): 134 of 173 residues of the EcoRII N-terminal domain (3hqf) could be aligned with UbaLAI-N with r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (DALI server (22)). 	The loops of the N-arms adopt slightly different conformations in both domains; the C-arms overlay better, but the loop between the strands in the C-arm of UbaLAI-N is shorter (Supplementary Figure S6). Both domains make identical contacts with the central T0:A0 base pairs employing overlaying residues (Figure 4D and E, Supplementary Figure S6). 
PMC5766183	2reu	Discussion	Discussion	False	According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). 	Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	Discussion	False	Intriguingly, analysis of the genetic landscape of SHH subgroup medulloblastoma identified frequent somatic alterations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.25 In light of these findings, our data together with the previous studies by the Canettieri group may provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and guide possible new therapeutic approaches. 	The clinical relevance of our findings is further underlined by a recent phase I clinical trial with 4SC‐202, where 18 out of 24 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies went into follow up treatment, one patient showed complete response and remained on study medication for >28 months, while another patient had a partial response over a period of 8 months (Clinical trial: NCT01344707, poster J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	Although it is unclear whether the promising clinical response to 4SC‐202 treatment was due to inhibition of GLI activity, the results of the present study warrant further clinical evaluation of 4SC‐202 as a treatment for GLI‐dependent cancers including BCC, medulloblastoma and possibly other malignancies with high medical need.

PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	Results	False	However, rs10033464 (4q25, PITX2) displayed a risk estimate in the opposite direction than had been previously reported by others. 	This discrepancy appears to be in part due to linkage disequilibrium between this marker and the nearby SNP with the strongest association in this gene, rs2200733 (p = 0.005). 	We and others have observed that the risk alleles at these markers are negatively associated with each other. There remains uncertainty in the optimal genetic risk model for AF, and superior models will certainly evolve in the future as more genetic discoveries are made. 
PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	Results	False	In this light, we also considered a modified AF GRS that included only the most strongly associated SNP in each gene—which is a common solution in GRS estimation to eliminate confounding due to linkage disequilibrium [32]. 	The resulting 9-SNP model included rs2200733 for PITX2 and the other 8 SNPs from the other genes. 	The risk of AF with this modified AF GRS, as in the 12-SNP model, was greater for the highest AF GRS quintile than for the lowest AF GRS quintile (OR 5.07; 95% CI 2.04–12.60; p < 0.001), and this model appeared to better differentiate risk of AF throughout the distribution of genetic risk (S3 Table). As expected, the risk estimates derived for both AF GRS models remained significant in an analysis limited to participants who self-reported as white (S4 Table). 
PMC5856400	PXD008494	Abstract	Abstract	False	175 proteins were identified in NSC osteoblast secretome. 	Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008494. 	Compared to NSC osteoblast secretome, 12 proteins were significantly less secreted (Osteomodulin, IGFBP5, VCAM-1, IGF2, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, versican, calumenin, IGFBP2, thrombospondin-4, periostin, reticulocalbin 1 and osteonectin), and 13 proteins were significantly more secreted by SC osteoblasts (CHI3L1, fibulin-3, SERPINE2, IGFBP6, SH3BGRL3, SERPINE1, reticulocalbin3, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, TIMP-2, IGFBP3, TIMP-1, SERPINF1, CSF-1).

PMC5893785	NCT00297193	Introduction	Introduction	False	Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. 	Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). 	This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17). Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17).

PMC5953197	NCT02685397	Discussion	Discussion	False	Radiation therapy can be an effective treatment for bone pain relief and 48 Gy in 3 fractions SBRT treatment in patients with multiple oligometastases, have shown promising long-term disease control (Salama et al 2012). 	An on-going clinical trial is investigating the eradication of oligometastases, including bone lesions, in patients with mCRPC (NCT02685397). 	Radiation therapy is typically used in symptomatic and late stages of disease. However, implementation of treatment early in the course of the disease may increase quality of life and reduce overall metastatic tumour burden; in turn, delaying disease progression and improving long-term survival.

PMC6155776	4NNI	Introduction	Introduction	False	However, there are limitations that make them inapplicable for our compounds. 	The complex of POA bound to the ribosomal protein S1 (involved in trans-translation process) was resolved (pdb: 4NNI). 	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24].

Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA. The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA.

The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA. 	The binding site and interaction patterns for PZA/POA are therefore unknown. Simulations of PZA/POA binding to PanD by docking and docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation of the complex gave uncertain results [25].

PMC6243512	rs2066842	Discussion	Discussion	False	Environmental carcinogens and NOD-induced proinflammatory cytokines could be possible reasons by which the studied polymorphisms may increase the risk for gastric cancer [9]. 	A meta-analysis evaluated several NOD2 polymorphisms such as rs2066842 C/T, rs2066844 C/T, rs2066845 C/G, rs2066847, L1007fsinsC and risk of cancer. 	The NOD2 rs2066844 C/T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer for individuals bearing TT or CT genotype compared to individuals with CC genotype. The subgroup of analysis revealed that TT+CT genotype was associated with high risk of colorectal cancer, but there was no important association with the development of gastric cancer.

PMC6303916	rs12953717	Article	Article	False	It was shown that there was a significant difference between the rs4464148 AG frequency of SMAD7 in the CRC and control groups. 	It was demonstrated that the allele T at rs12953717 of SMAD7 can be introduced as a risk factor of CRC among Iranian patients [24]. 	Canonical Wnt/b-catenin is one of the critical pathways during the tumorigenesis in which the unphosphorylated and activated b-catenin enters into nucleus and activates the LEF/TCF/PYGO2 transcriptional complex [25]. GSK3b, AXIN, and APC are the components of a complex which is responsible for the regulation of b-catenin. 
PMC6303916	rs3135500	Article	Article	False	It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. 	There was a significant correlation between AA genotype of rs3135500 and increased risk of CRC in Iranian population [42]. 	CD86 is expressed by immune cells and is associated with inflammation related malignancies and cancer susceptibility. The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43].

IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine is commonly secreted by type 1 regulatory T cells and can be an oncogene or tumor suppressor based on microenvironment condition. A case–control study showed that there was significantly lower serum levels of IL-10 in Iranian CRC cases compared with controls which cause an aberrant innate immune reaction and tumor cell ignorance by adaptive immune. 
PMC6303916	rs2228570	Article	Article	False	It has been reported that the vitamin D interaction with its receptor (VDR) is associated with CRC susceptibility [76]. 	It was observed that the ff (TT) genotype of rs2228570 can be suggested as a risk factor genotype for CRC susceptibility among a group of Iranian CRC patients [77]. 	Moreover, another group also reported that the VDR ApaI genotype “aa” is correlated with higher risk of CRC among a sub population of Iranian patients [78].

PMC6347085	NCT00940602	Discussion	Discussion	False	A general recommendation has been to initiate ICT when SF reaches greater than 1,000 ng/mL. 	Further prospective evaluation of deferasirox in the TELESTO trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940602) is needed to confirm these data and further define the use of ICT in MDS patients (Shenoy et al., 2014; Taran & Taran, 2015). 	Life expectancy, transfusion burden, and evidence of iron excess (elevated SF), as well as any related patient comorbidities, are currently the main factors to consider when deciding on ICT in the absence of more rigorous evidence-based guidelines (Chaudhary & Pullarkat, 2013).

Similarly, carriers of the risk allele rs12255372 T/T were less likely to respond to SU than carriers of G/G3. 	Differences were also observed in the response to some dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 i)4. Variants in the SLCO1B1 (encoding the hepatic cationic transporter OATP1B1) and CYP2C8 genes (encoding the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP450 C8) have been shown to have an impact on the therapeutic response to the thiazolidinedione OAD, rosiglitazone (but not to pioglitazone)5.

PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	Discussion	False	Considering the higher statistical power of haplotype analysis compared to individual SNP analysis when LD was exploited to explore genes associated with diseases, we conducted the haplotype analysis and haplotype—environment interaction analysis to further investigate the roles of SPRY genes in Chinese NSCL/P. 	The results of haplotype analysis altogether indicated that one genetic segment (rs541731- rs9669948, from 80345577 to 80372188) located at 4.5 kb—31.1 kb downstream of SPRY2 was associated with NSCL/P, indicating that the neighborhood region of this segment might contain causal variants. 	Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies.

Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies. 
PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	Discussion	False	Although statistical interactions do not always guarantee biological interaction, evidence about the biological function of SPRY2 [21,29,30] and the signals in the single haplotype analysis might together support a biological interaction. 	Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P.
