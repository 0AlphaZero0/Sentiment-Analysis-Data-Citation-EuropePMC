PMC2862243	216900	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Achromatopsia (ACHM; OMIM 216900) is a congenital autosomal recessive cone disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 individuals [1]. 	The clinical features include low visual acuity, nystagmus, photophobia, severe color vision defects, and no recordable or only residual cone function on electroretinography (ERG) with normal rod functions. Fundoscopy is usually normal, although macular pigmentary changes and atrophy have been described in the literature [2-5]. 
PMC3884852	1SR3	Article	PDBe	False	Background	CcmE is a heme-binding protein, discovered as an essential System I component as early as the late 1990's [63]. 	CcmE is a monotopic membrane protein, anchored to the membrane via its N-terminal TM segment and exposing its active site to the periplasm; it is the only Ccm component of the heme trafficking and delivery module of System I for which a three-dimensional structure is available ([21] PDB: 1SR3; [64] PDB: 1LM0). 	The 3D structure of the apo-state (without bound heme) consists of a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, reminiscent of the classical OB-fold [65] with N- and C-terminal extensions. CcmE can be considered a “heme chaperone,” as it protects the cell from a potentially dangerous compound by sequestering free heme in the periplasm [66]; it is thought to act as an intermediate in the heme delivery pathway of Cytc maturation.

PMC3210356	NCT01217008	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Indeed, this has been recognized by the U.S. 	Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in allowing a clinical trial of embryonic stem cell-derived cells in SCI to proceed on the basis of pre-clinical safety demonstrated exclusively in rodent models (www.clinicaltrial.gov; clinical trial identifier: NCT01217008). 	Moreover, it is important to note that rodent contusion/compression models of SCI are generally “incomplete” with partial sparing of motor and sensory functions. These models closely mimic most patients with severe, partial lesions with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment (ASI) scale rating of AIS B or C. Given that most trials of cell therapy have been carried out in AIS A patients (the safest to inject, but also the least likely to show cell therapy-induced benefit), there is a need for future clinical trials to include patients actually modeled in the laboratory. 
PMC3210356	NCT01231893	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	Current Clinical Trials of Cell Therapy for SCI 	There are currently more than a dozen recently completed, ongoing, or recruiting cell therapy clinical trials for SCI listed on clinicaltrials.gov [26], of which 2 do not involve stem cells per se (a phase I trial of OECs in thoracic AIS A subjects [clinical trial identifier: NCT01231893], and a phase II trial of activated macrophages in cervical and thoracic SCI [clinical trial identifier: NCT00073853], subsequently suspended due to financial constraints experienced by the sponsor). 	Most trials are phase I or I/II clinical safety and feasibility studies, indicating that cellular treatments for SCI developed in the laboratory are still in the very early stages of clinical translation. These trials build on the development of micro-neurosurgical techniques and image-guided approaches that facilitate the safe targeting of the injured CNS with cell-based approaches.

PMC3210356	NCT01328860	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	The inflammatory component of SCI and subsequent demyelination of surviving axons are serious limiting factors in the efficacy of early cell therapy for SCI, as implanted cells are more likely to be eliminated by the host. 	It is therefore worth considering interventions to modify the inflammatory milieu to enhance donor cell survival and efficacy, as in the newly initiated clinical trial of autologous BMSCs in children suffering from SCI (Table 2) (clinical trial identifier: NCT01328860). 	On the other hand, and considering the 1 case of neoplasms in a recipient of fetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reported by Amariglio et al. [53], the question of whether this strategy may increase the oncogenic risk of cell therapy must be considered. 
PMC3210356	NCT01327768	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	At least 2 of these trials [60, 61] have reported functional improvement in small patient cohorts, which may be confirmed by future pre-clinical studies on human OECs of various anatomical derivations to support future clinical trials. 	The safe use of OECs in clinical trials for other conditions, such as ischemic stroke, further strengthens the case for their use in SCI (clinical trial identifier: NCT01327768).

In the latter, they have recently been shown to persist without causing harm for as long as 2.5 years after implantation into immunosuppressed patients (http://www.internationaldrugdiscovery.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ContentID=2474). There is a lack of trials of NPCs in SCI, in spite of the bulk of pre-clinical findings to date in support of the potential of fetal and adult neural stem/progenitor cells (particularly the former) in experimental SCI models [23], which is likely to reflect ethical concerns as to their origins and practical issues hindering their isolation and directed differentiation.

PMC3210356	NCT01151124	Article	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	The conditional immortalization of cells might provide a partial solution to limiting the use of fetal and embryonic tissue, overcoming the limited supply of cells irrespective of donor age, removing a source of variability between clinical trials and enabling extensive characterization of cell lines prior to clinical application. 	Clinically approved, conditionally immortalized fetal cortical NPCs (ReN001 or CTX0E03) of human origin are already in a phase I clinical trial for stroke in Scotland, UK (Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke; clinical trial identifier: NCT01151124). 	These cells have been developed by the biotechnology firm ReNeuron using a karyotypically stable immortalization platform to enable cells to proliferate in culture and differentiate when induced without oncogenic transformation. Although this clinical trial will not include SCI patients, the results of this trial will be very interesting and relevant because stroke and SCI share many common pathophysiological mechanisms.

Two ongoing clinical trials are investigating the use of Seprehvir in young patients with either CNS (NCT02031965) or non-CNS (NCT00931931) solid tumors, the latter including patients with neuroblastoma. 	In this study we evaluated a panel of 12 human neuroblastoma cell lines for their expression of HSV entry mediators and assessed their responses to Seprehvir treatment. Most cells showed high expression of nectin-1 and 3-OS HS, two HSV entry receptors that have been shown to be important determinants of HSV susceptibility in various cell types (8, 9, 16, 17) Unexpectedly, we found that HSV receptor expression did not necessarily correlate with virus entry.

Currently, there are some promising examples of doxorubicin conjugated with antibodies now in clinical trials (NCT00051584), and the use of liposomal formulations for drug delivery (NCT01227941). 	The multifunctionalization of IONPs by targeting agents and drugs, and its acceptance in clinical processes, might be a breakthrough in the development of specific therapies. The presence of targeting moieties such as those discussed above will increase the localization of IONPs in the diseased tissue, therefore augmenting drug delivery and local drug concentration.

PMC6104680	NCT02453256	Introduction	NCT	False	ClinicalTrials	As previously reported, primary clinical data from the faSScinate trial showed a trend of benefit in favour of TCZ for the primary endpoint or mRSS and a strong trend at 48 weeks together with congruent benefit in exploratory endpoints including lung function. 	Based on these results, a phase 3 trial of TCZ is under way (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02453256). 	Here we define the molecular and functional phenotype of explant dermal fibroblasts from a representative subset of patients with SSc enrolled into faSScinate and demonstrate a profound reversal of the hallmark profibrotic properties of these cells after treatment with TCZ for 24 weeks compared with controls from the PBO arm of the trial.

Here, an interventional study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01221844) was conducted by orally administering 100 mg of 20–30% iron-saturated bLf (corresponding to 70–84 μg of elemental iron) twice a day. 	This treatment was compared with the Italian standard therapy, consisting in the oral administration of 329.7 mg of ferrous sulfate once a day (corresponding to 105 mg of elemental iron). Treatments were carried out on 29 anemic women with minor β-thalassemia (20 pregnant and 9 non-pregnant), 149 women with hereditary thrombophilia (HT) (70 pregnant and 79 non-pregnant) affected by AI and 20 anemic pregnant women suffering from various pathologies.

PMC5509858	2A79	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	While this model provides a new template for understanding the effects of mutations in this region, it contains a pore domain in the closed state, and the molecular volume available for binding inside the pore is far too small to accommodate any of the common blockers. 	Therefore, to study the potential interactions between the channel and hERG blockers, we used a previously developed and experimentally validated model of the hERG pore in the open state (Durdagi et al. 2012; Anwar‐Mohamed et al. 2014) based on the Kv1.2 X‐ray crystal structure (PDB ID 2A79), determined at 2.9 Å resolution (Model 2). 	It is important to stress that this previously published model of the hERG pore displays remarkable structural conservation with the published Eag1 structure for residues critical for drug binding (T623, S624, Y652 and F656), with major differences in the pore loop region far away from the common intra‐cavity binding site (Wang et al. 2016). To further refine both Model 1 and Model 2 of the hERG channel, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a protocol described below. 
PMC5519329	PF00096	Methods	Pfam	False	Use	We then assessed significance empirically by comparing the value of this statistic to other C2H2 ZF genes from the same species (where possible). 	To this end, for each species with a PRDM9 ortholog, we downloaded the nucleotide and protein sequences for all available RefSeq genes with a C2H2 ZF motif annotated in Conserved Domain Database (pfam id# PF00096). 	To simplify alignment generation, we only used tandem ZF arrays with four or more ZFs matching the 28 amino acid long C2H2 motif (X2-CXXC-X12-HXXXH-X5 where X is any amino acid). In all of our analyses, if a gene had multiple tandem ZF arrays that were spatially separated, only the first array of four or more adjacent ZFs was used for the following analysis (Supplementary file 3B).

Surflex-Dock program [25,26] has been widely used to calculate the protein–ligand interactions, and to efficiently predict the active conformations [27–35]. Surflex-Dock uses a Protomol-based method and an empirical scoring function to dock a ligand into the binding site of a receptor. 
PMC3292029	2OH4	Results	PDBe	False	Use	Binding Modes of Pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine Derivatives 	To determine the probable binding conformations of these compounds, Surflex-Dock was used to dock one potent compound 20 into the active site of KDR (PDB code: 2OH4). 	First, the docking reliability was validated by a known inhibitor 53 (Figure 2) that was reported to bind in the DFG-out inactive conformation of KDR [23]. The co-crystallized 53 was re-docked into the binding site, and the docked conformation having the highest total score was selected as the most probable binding conformation (Figure 3). 
PMC3343019	AE007317	Results	ENA	False	Use	By this approach, in the present study, we identified a novel 161 amino acid-long fragment, herein referred to as R4, using serum antibodies from a patient convalescing from invasive pneumococcal disease. 	The sequence matched ORF spr1875 of the S. pneumoniae R6 strain genome (GenBank accession no. AE007317), encoding a 380 amino acid-long protein with an N-terminal peptidoglycan interaction lysine motif (LysM) domain, which is found in cell wall degrading enzymes and in virulence factors (Fig. 1). 	The predicted protein sequence of Spr1875 contains a leader peptide with a leader sequence and a cleavage site present in variety of streptococcal surface proteins. We next produced a recombinant R4-GST fusion protein and assessed its ability to bind to serum antibodies from patients recovering from pneumococcal infection.

This allowed very high conversion rates with purified CRTI from Pantoea ananatis (formerly Erwinia uredovora), overexpressed in E. coli. This has permitted us to gain insights into the CRTI-catalyzed reaction, to obtain structural information (PDB code: 4DGK; RCSB ID code: RCSB070301), to make statements on membrane topology and on putative substrate and cofactor binding sites. 	
PMC3382138	PF01593	Results	Pfam	False	Use	The structure of apo-CRTI is composed of 19 β-strands (forming 5 sheets), 12 alpha-helices, and three 310-helices. 	Altogether these fold into three pseudo-domains consistent with the flavin containing amino oxidoreductase family (Pfam: PF01593) as revealed by structural search comparisons (see the topology diagram and structural alignment in Figure S3 and Figure 10, respectively). 	The first, the FAD binding domain is composed of a five-stranded, parallel sheet (sheet 1) sandwiched between a three-stranded anti-parallel sheet (sheet 5) and a five-helix bundle. The ligand binding domain is composed of a seven-stranded mixed topology sheet (sheet 4) with two alpha-helices packed onto the top surface and two, two-stranded anti-parallel sheets (sheets 2 and 3) and two 310-helices packed onto one edge of the bottom surface of the sheet. 
PMC3382138	2IVD	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	CRTI and mxPPOX share an overall 20% sequence identity and 35% sequence similarity. 	Of the twenty-nine residues implicated in FAD binding in mxPPOX (pdb code 2IVD), thirteen are invariant in CRTI with a further six residues being of similar type (45% identity, 66% similarity). 	Of the nine residues that make hydrophilic contacts with FAD only E39 (E31, CRTI) makes side-chain only contacts (with the ribose moiety) and is one of only six residues that are invariant in all six proteins (the others being G8, G10, G38, G53 and V244 in CrtI). Two others form main-chain and side-chain contacts, S20 and N441, but both are replaced by G12 and G466 in CRTI, allowing only the main-chain contacts to be preserved. 
PMC3386246	3M0E	Results	PDBe	False	Use	Sequencing revealed that the four LuxO D47E mutants carry I211F, L215F, L242F, or V294L alterations, implicating these residues as important for binding of the inhibitors. 	We mapped these four alterations onto the existing crystal structure of ATP-bound Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 (PDB:3M0E) [43], which has high sequence homology to LuxO (Figure 6B). 	The four residues we identified in the screen map to three regions that abut the Walker B motif (D245, E246, L247, and C248 in LuxO) (Figure 6B). In other NtrC-type proteins, mutations in this region have been shown to prevent ATP hydrolysis (See DISCUSSION).

RP is the most frequent cause of inherited blindness, affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide. This disease is initially characterized by night blindness followed by visual field constriction that can ultimately lead to legal blindness at a later stage [4]. 
PMC3472925	603937	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa 1 gene (RP1, OMIM 603937) are thought to account for approximately 5.5% of adRP cases and only 1% of arRP cases, depending on the type and the position of the mutations [6]. 	To date, more than 50 disease-causing mutations in the RP1 gene have been identified. They are predominantly frameshift or nonsense mutations in individuals with dominant RP, clustered in a region spanning codons 500–1053 in exon 4 [6-24].

PMC3794799	M73321	Introduction	ENA	False	Use	Among the thermophilic actinomycetes, Thermobifida fusca is a major degrader of plant cell walls owing to its abundant extracellular cellulases and xylanases [23]. 	In this study, one gene cel6A (GenBank accession No. M73321) encoding an endoglucanase was selected to study the capacity of the novel expression vector we constructed in this paper. 	The reason for selecting endoglucanase Cel6A lies in the potential industrial application because of its thermostability, utility through a broad pH range and high activity [24]. Although an expression vector for production of endoglucanase Cel6A from T. fusca YX in Streptomyces has been reported recently, its maximum expression level was relatively low (about 64 mg/L) [25].

PMC3884852	2KCT	Article	PDBe	False	Background	Recently, it was shown that CcmE proteins from the proteobacteria D. desulfuricans and D. vulgaris contain the unusual CXXXY heme-binding motif, where the Cys residue replaces the canonical His binding residue. 	NMR solution structure of D. vulgaris CcmE (PDB: 2KCT) revealed that the proteins adopt the same OB-fold characteristic of the CcmE superfamily. 	Contrary to what reported for the D. desulfuricans CcmE [69], the homologous protein from D. vulgaris binds ferric heme noncovalently through the conserved C127 residue [70]. An additional conserved residue in CcmE proteins is Tyr134, which was shown to provide a coordination bond to the heme iron of holoCcmE [71, 72] once it is released from CcmABCD complex [36], as discussed below.

Looking at the 3D structure of the periplasmic domain of the prototypical Pa-CcmG, it is possible to identify the βαβ and ββα structural motifs of the TRX fold linked by a short α-helix and forming a four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three helices; the protein contains an additional N-terminal extension (residues 26–62) and a central insert (residues 102–123).

PMC3884852	2HL7	Article	PDBe	False	Background	Notably, CcmH proteins from different bacterial subgroups may display structural variability; indeed, while in E. coli Ec-CcmH is a bipartite protein characterized by two soluble domains exposed to the periplasm and two TM segments, CcmH from P. aeruginosa (Pa-CcmH) is a one-domain redox-active protein, anchored to the membrane via a single TM helix and homologous to the N-terminal redox-active domain of Ec-CcmH. 	Surprisingly, the 3D structure of the soluble periplasmic domain of Pa-CcmH revealed that it adopts a peculiar three-helix bundle fold strikingly different from that of canonical thiol-oxidoreductases (Figure 5; PDB: 2HL7; [23]). 	The N-terminal domain of Ec-CcmH was also shown to have the same 3D structure, although helix-swapping and dimerization have been observed in this case (PDB: 2KW0; [91, 92]). The conserved redox-active motif (LRCPKC) is located in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2; close to the activesite, the crystal structure reveals the presence of a small pocket on the surface of Pa-CcmH surrounded by conserved hydrophobic and polar residues, which could represent the recognition site for the heme-binding motif of apoCyt.

PMC3892923	1CNV	Results	PDBe	False	Use	The cis confirmations of peptide bonds are mostly responsible for these deviations. 	For example, in the protein concanavalin B (PDBID:1CNV), there are four violation of the 3.8 Å constraint: Ile33/Ser34 - 4 Å, Ser34/Phe35 - 3 Å, Pro56/Ser57 - 4 Å and Trp265/Asn266 - 3.4 Å. These all these deviations are noted in the PDB file as footnotes, mentioning that ‘peptide bond deviates significantly from trans conformation’ 34. 	Another example is the Glu223-Asp24 violation in PBDid:1ADS, which is between two cis prolines (as noted in the PDB file) 35. However, these conformations are rare and not expected to occur frequently in a protein structure.

This validates our hypothesis that RDCC is minimized in native structures. Hence, structures that have a RDCC value more than a user specified threshold can be pruned out as structures with low quality or non-native structures.

PMC3892923	3D01	Results	PDBe	False	Use	Only five sets have RDCC values above the 0.012 Å threshold: T0492 - 0.013 Å, T0476 - 0.014 Å, T0419 - 0.025 Å, T0470 - 0.051 Å, T0423 - 0.09 Å. Some of these are the result of erroneous residue numbering in the CASP8 I-TASSER decoy set. 	For example, Ala24 is mistakenly numbered as Ala19 in T0423 (PDBid:3D01, identified by doing a BLAST search). 	Correcting this numbering results in a RDCC of 0.002 Å. Similarly, T0470 (PDBid:3DJB) has a correct RDCC of 0.001 Å, since Ser112 is mistakenly numbered as Ser101.

Certain outliers have been removed - for example, PDBid:2JLI mentions a ‘cleaved peptide bond between N263 and P264’. 	The distance between the C α atoms of N263 and P264 in this protein is 9.4 Å. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation for these sets, and demonstrates that the RDCC values are independent of the resolution of the structure under consideration. We have applied this cutoff on decoy sets from the Decoys 'R' Us database 28. 
PMC3892923	1FC2	Results	PDBe	False	Use	The first protein (the native structure) in all decoy sets has RDCC below the 0.012 Å cutoff ( Figure 1c).

All 500 decoy structures in each protein structure in the fisa decoy set are discriminated by applying the RDCC criterion. Figure 3 shows the superimposition of the native structure and the first decoy structure (AXPROA00-MIN) for a protein (PDBid:1FC2) taken from the fisa decoy set. 	The distance between Ile12/C α and Leu13/C α atoms is 3.8 Å and 4.1 Å in the native and the decoy structures, respectively. According to our hypothesis, a 4.1 Å distance between consecutive C α atoms is typically unfeasible in protein structures, and their occurrence should be relatively rare.

PROSA was unable to discriminate between the decoy and the native structures, reporting equivalent Zscores of -4.12 and -5.28, respectively. The WHATIF server report also reports steric clashes in the decoy structures ( Data File 1).

This region shows significant similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels to two previously sequenced phage: Xanthomonas phage Cfc1 (RefSeq: NC_001396.1) [26] and Stenotrophomonas phage phiSHP2 (GenBank: HM150760.1). Specifically, two Tanzanian isolates (NCPPB4392 and NCPPB4395) appear to have completely lost at least 17 genes from this region, while Ethiopian isolate NCPPB2005 has lost 11 of the same genes.

PMC4146382	4BUM	Introduction	PDBe	False	Background	Thus, the 3D structure of the VDAC2 and VDAC3 isoforms have been predicted on the basis of secondary structure prediction servers [5]. 	It was only during revision of the present work that a crystallographic structure of VDAC2 was published [30] (zebra fish VDAC2; PDB code 4BUM at 2.8 Å resolution) confirming the very high degree of structural similarity with the VDAC1. 	The most striking difference between the three human isoforms is certainly the longer N-terminal fragment of hVDAC2, which has 11 residues more than the other two isoforms (figure 1). The N-terminal fragment of VDAC, comprising the first 25 amino acid residues (36 in the case of hVDAC2), is located inside the channel in the 3D structures, partially closing the wide pore [20]–[22].

The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between zebra fish VDAC2 and the mVDAC reference structure used in this work is only 0.98 Å. The zebra fish VDAC2 amino acid sequence has 84% identity and 98% similarity with the human VDAC2, with the main differences located in the external loops. In agreement with the solved 3D structures, the N-terminal fragment crosses the lumen with a helical folding from the residue 6 to 20 in all the isoforms, and is horizontally located close to the lumen center.

PMC4228564	190685	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background		Down syndrome (DS) (MIM 190685), is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation, resulting from the presence of three copies of genes located on chromosome 21 and the most common chromosomal disorder in newborns with prevalence of 1/700 live births. 	Advanced maternal age is the only well-documented risk factor for nondisjunction of chromosome 21.[1] In spite of high prevalence, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic nondisjunction are not yet understood, and much research have been done on factors that influence the rate of chromosome nondisjunction. The relationship between chromosomal nondisjunction and folate metabolism has drawn attention in the past decade. 
PMC4228564	607093	Introduction	OMIM	False	Background	Increased homocysteine and decreased methionine cause decreased SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, which takes part in DNA methylation.[4] 	The MTHFR gene (OMIM 607093) has been mapped at short arm of chromosome 1 (1p36.3) and more than 40 polymorphism have been described in MTHFR, but C677T (rs1801133) is the most common[5] in which a cytosine is replaced by thymine at 677th position (alanine →valine in protein). 	C677T mutation was shown to render the enzyme thermolabile and homozygotes (T/T) and heterozygotes (C/T) had about a 70% and 35% reduced MTHFR enzymatic activity. Frequency of mutant T allele differs in various ethnic and geographical populations of the world.

PMC4293902	2F5Z	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	An atomic resolution model for a monomer of PfaE3 was constructed from a combination of models generated using the PHYRE2 server [31] and the I-TASSER server [32]. 	This was then superimposed on one chain of the dimer structure of human E3 (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]) using PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC) and the process repeated for the second chain of human E3 in order to gain an overview of how a putative PfaE3 dimer would compare with its human counterpart. 	
PMC4293902	2F5Z	Methods	PDBe	False	Use	An additional model was generated with the I-TASSER server [32] in which all the residues were modelled. 	Dimer forms of both models were generated by superimposition on the dimer structure of human E3 (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]). 	Whilst the PHYRE2 monomer superimposed well, residues 406–420 of the I-TASSER monomers sterically clashed. Therefore a composite model was made in which residues 403–418 of the I-TASSER model were replaced with those from the PHYRE2 model. 
PMC4293902	2F5Z	Discussion	PDBe	False	Use	This limitation notwithstanding, the AUC and SAXS data are all consistent with a dimeric structure for PfaE3 and are not inconsistent with the augmented homology model. 	In addition to the two extra loops, the high-resolution model positions a two-stranded anti-parallel β motif in the space that, in the structure of human E3 plus the SBD of E3BP (PDB ID: 2F5Z, [33]), is occupied by the E3BP SBD. PfaE3 does not interact with E3BP SBD, but rather the SBD of PfE2 since the parasite genome does not encode an e3bp homologue. 	The presence of this ‘extra’ β motif implies that this interaction may be quite different from that observed for human E3-E3BP, supporting the suitability of PfaE3 as a target for the development of intervention strategies. To further assess PfaE3 function, we generated Pfae3 null mutants (3D7Δae3).

While MetA from E. coli and a homoserine acetyltransferase from H. influenzae belong to the non-hexapeptide acyltransferases, SATs generally possess this structural motif that can be found using InterProScan (IPR001451). 	We searched for these hexapeptide sequences in the L. casei SAT protein but did not detect this structural motif (data not shown). Therefore, the L. casei SAT is, to our knowledge, the first SAT to be described as a non-hexapeptide acyltransferase.

For ease of clarity we will refer to the gene products using their respective ORF gene numbers.] gpl15 (NP_043563) is a minor structural protein, while hypothetical protein gp35 (AAO49840) is proposed to be a host-determinant protein (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). 	gpl15/gp35 show conservation at the N termini and to a lesser degree the C-terminal ends while the middle is variable and likely to be involved in host recognition. It has been shown that recombinant bIL67 isolates which maintained the 5′ and 3′ ends of gene ORF35 but exchanged the middle section for that of phage CHL92 ORF2 acquired the host range of CHL92. 
PMC5156332	AAD20610	Introduction	ENA	False		Adsorption patterns of these hybrid bIL67 isolates were equivalent to those of CHL92 (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003). 	Lastly, gpl16 (NP_043564) is a minor structural protein while hypothetical protein gp36 (NP_042309) is possibly a collar protein (AAD20610). 	In the infection process, lactococcal phages including C2viruses initially recognize carbohydrate receptors to bind to the host cell wall (for recent reviews see Ainsworth et al., 2014; Chapot-Chartier, 2014; Mahony et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2015). More extensive studies have been performed on carbohydrate receptors of the 936 and P335 type phages while studies of C2viruses have focused on a cell membrane protein secondary receptor designated Pip (phage infection protein) (Valyasevi et al., 1991; Monteville et al., 1994). 
PMC5156332	L14679	Introduction	ENA	False		For phage c2, binding to carbohydrate receptors is reversible, and interaction with Pip results in irreversible binding followed by phage DNA ejection (Monteville et al., 1994; Geller et al., 1993). 	The lactococcal Pip protein, first described in L. lactis C2 (GenBank accession number L14679), is a 901 aa membrane-spanning protein encoded by a 2706-bp gene (Geller et al., 1993) with homologues in most Gram-positive bacteria (Mooney et al., 2006); notably Bacillus subtilis orthologue yueB (São-José et al., 2004, 2006). 	It has been reported that inactivation of pip virtually eliminates infection by C2virus in lactococci without any apparent effect on the host (Garbutt et al., 1997; Kraus & Geller, 1998). Similarly, SPP1 requires YueB to infect B. subtilis, where the interaction has been extensively studied (Plisson et al., 2007; Jakuytė et al., 2012).

Minor structural protein 5 is identified as ORF 52/BppA in lactococcal phage TUC2009 (accession number NC_002703), a component of the tripod baseplate structure with a putative carbohydrate binding domain and involved in receptor binding (McGrath et al., 2006, Legrand et al., 2016). 	gpl16/gp36 are classified as minor structural/hypothetical proteins (NP_043564/NP_042309), possibly collar proteins as a gene with 76 % identity to ORF36 was found in addition to l16 in a phage c2 isolate exhibiting a prominent collar structure at its head–tail interface (accession number AAD20610). 	HHpred analyses of gpl16/gp36 from all phages in this study likewise identified carbohydrate binding domains with top hits to 1GU3 and 1GU1. McGrath et al. (2006) showed that the saccharide binding site of Tuc2009 Bpp A is more similar to 1GU1 in structural comparisons. gpl15/gp35 is a minor structural protein proposed to be involved in phage adsorption to the host (NP_043563/ AAO49840) (Stuer-Lauridsen et al., 2003).

Note that as YjaE and Pip are structurally similar (HHpred analysis identified domains 3CNI and 2CH7 in both), the same inference can be extended to both proteins.

PMC5216611	168600	Introduction	OMIM	False			Genetics plays a significant role in PD [MIM*168600], both in determining risk (if one will develop PD: cause) as well as age-at-onset (when a disease might manifest: modifier) (1). 	Several rare causative genes (2–11) and 28 common risk alleles (12–16) have been confirmed for PD. The known genes and risk factors account for ∼5% of the heritability (17), hence much of the genetic component of PD is still missing. 
PMC5216611	609718	Discussion	OMIM	False		The loci accounted for 3.5% (5q14.1) and 3.9% (15q22.2) of variation in age-at-onset. 	The 5q14.1 signal maps to LHFPL2 [MIM*609718], a member of the lipoma HMGIC fusion partner (LHFP) gene family. 	The function of LHFPL2 is unknown. Interestingly, LHFPL2 is expressed in all normal tissues and cell lines except brain and leukocytes (40); however, while healthy brain tissue has no detectable LHFPL2 transcript, LHFPL2 protein is abundant in malignant brain tissue (41). 
PMC5216611	191010	Discussion	OMIM	False		Interestingly, LHFPL2 is expressed in all normal tissues and cell lines except brain and leukocytes (40); however, while healthy brain tissue has no detectable LHFPL2 transcript, LHFPL2 protein is abundant in malignant brain tissue (41). 	The 15q22.2 signal maps to the tropomyosin 1 gene (TPM1 [MIM*191010]). TPM1 encodes a highly conserved actin-binding protein that plays a central role in calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction. TPM1 is a tumour suppressor gene (42). 	Cancer and Parkinson’s disease are often likened to the two sides of a coin. Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of developing PD is inversely associated with the risk of developing cancer (except skin cancer) (43).

PMC5346138	2MNA	Methods	PDBe	False		NMR HSQC experiments were carried out using 0.8–1 mM SsoSSB OB domain (1–114) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015) in the presence and absence of equimolar amounts of ssDNA (6T) and RNA (6U) (purchased from Sigma Aldrich), respectively, at 298 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Advance III) equipped with 5-mm TCI cryoprobes. 	An in-silico model was calculated using HADDOCK (Dominguez et al. 2003; de Vries et al. 2007) using the NMR structure (PDB ID 2MNA) as a template (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). 	DNA (6T) was replaced by RNA (6U) and the definition of semiflexible and flexible residues; all ambiguous and unambiguous interaction restraints (AIR and UIRs, respectively) as well as base planarity restraints were taken from the docking calculations of the SsoSSB-DNA structure (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). 
PMC5346138	1O7I	Results	PDBe	False		These data suggest that the interaction surface is conserved between ssDNA and RNA. 	Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). 	We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). The NMR data suggest that this base-stacking mechanism is conserved between ssDNA and RNA.

PMC5352143	3V8U	Results	PDBe	False		We treated full-length LbpB and TbpB from N. meningitidis strains MC58 and B16B6, respectively, with a homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester crosslinker (disuccinimidyl suberate; DSS), and analyzed the trypsin-digested products via LC-MS/MS. 	LbpB crosslinks were mapped onto an in silico homology based model of LbpB using Swiss-Model that was modelled against N. meningitidis TbpB [4] (PDB entry 3V8U) as a template. 	The LbpB model should be quite reliable for the core beta-barrel and handle structures but will be least reliable in the loop regions that harbour the clusters rich in aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues. TbpB crosslinks were mapped onto the crystal structure of TbpB from N. meningitidis strain B16B6 [17] as a control.

To dock these two proteins, we used the HADDOCK 2.2 web interface and included the inter-protein constraints relevant to the LbpB-N:hLf-C interaction noted in Table 1. The crosslinked residues were converted to ambiguous restraints for docking with a distance constraint of 5-25Å between the alpha carbons.

Although the functional properties of KCC2a-S25 remain to be determined, the fact that mKCC4 cloned from several sources (GenBank accessions: AK166215, AK149750, BC059242, AK143535, AK131129, BC141107, AF087436) lacks exon 27 (homologous to exon 25 in Slc12a5), adds an extra layer of complexity to our current understanding of the molecular physiology of KCC2, particularly when considering that KCC2a-S25 accounts for ~55–60% of total KCC2 transcripts in β-cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). 	KCC2a-S25 lacks five C-terminal residues located immediately after the so-called “ISO-domain”, which is responsible for the high basal activity of the transporter35 whereas KCC4, which lack ISO domains, is an inactive cotransporter under normal isotonic conditions35, 63, 64. However, unlike KCC2, KCC4 is robustly activated by hypotonicity64. 
PMC5433092	KX243552	Introduction	ENA	False		Thus, studying the expression and regulation of dehydrin genes under different abiotic stress conditions contributes to our understanding of the resistance of bermudagrass to abiotic stresses. 	We determined the full-length cDNA sequences of a novel YSK2-type dehydrin CdDHN4 from Tifway (drought-tolerant) and C299 (drought-sensitive) (GenBank accession no. KX243552). 	The objective of this study was to determine the regulation of dehydrin genes in drought conditions. The main steps were as follows: (1) isolating the promoter sequence of CdDHN4 and analyzing its cis-acting elements in bermudagrass; (2) identifying environmental stresses that can activate the CdDHN4 promoter and inducing the CdDHN4 expression; (3) the response of CdDHN4 expression under drought and ABA conditions in Tifway and C299.

PMC5638308	CA095885	Results	ENA	False		Moreover, the exposure to 500 μM Al did not affect the expression of ASR5, either between genotypes (i.e. Nipponbare and Modan) or among exposure timeframes (0, 24, 48, or 72 h) [61]. 	A putative NAC gene from maize, identified with the accession number CA095885, which is similar to the rice OsNAC5 gene, was induced in the roots of maize plants exposed to 283 μM Al, but not in those exposed to 75 μM Al [18]. 	In the presence of 200 μM Al, this gene was induced in the roots of all four cultivars evaluated (Fig 2A) and in the shoots of three cultivars, with the exception of Temporalero (Fig 2B). Under our experimental conditions, the Cotaxtla and Temporalero cultivars showed a similar expression profile in the roots, while Tres Ríos and Huimanguillo formed another group with similar expression profiles between them.

The structure of ValFadR was determined by molecular replacement using EcFadR structure (PDB: 1E2X) as a search model. 	The model was first built automatically using PHENIX package (Adams et al., 2002) and then manually with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and structure refinement was performed with Phenix. For the structure of ValFadR and palmitoyl-CoA complex, the apo-ValFadR structure was used as a search model and then was built manually with Coot and refined with Phenix. 
PMC5751318	1FZB	Results	PDBe	False			The analysis of the crystal structure of human fibrinogen fragment D (PDB 1FZB) showed that the Aguadilla, Ankara, and Brescia mutations fall nearby the regions exploited by the globular domains of two γ chains in their “end-to-end” interaction necessary for the D dimer formation, and also that these regions feature patches of hydrophobic residues that normally remain hidden upon correct dimerization (Figure 2). 	Patches of hydrophobic residues are also present in the lipid-binding region of APOB, as it can be observed by examining the homology model of APOB by Richardson et al. [13] and also in the crystal structure of lipovitellin (PDB 1LSH), which is the closest homologue of APOB with a known folding (Figure 3).

PMC5751318	200100	Discussion	OMIM	False		Interestingly, the molecular genetic analysis of the two genes, APOB and MTTP, which are involved in the transfer of triglycerides, assembly, and transport of APOB-containing lipoproteins, failed to demonstrate any mutation in these genes in our FSD cases. 	These results led to the conclusion that the hypo-APOB-lipoproteinemia associated with hypofibrinogenemia does not fit into the spectrum of hereditary a-betalipoproteinemia (OMIM# 200100). 	The latter is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the virtual absence of VLDL and LDL from plasma [20]. In this disorder, the failure of secretion of VLDL points to defects in the processing of the APOB proteins or to an impairment of the assembly or secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. 
PMC5751318	107730	Discussion	OMIM	False		The molecular defect was identified in the absence of activity of MTTP, a factor critical to lipidation of APOB. 	In familial hypo-beta-lipoproteinemia (FHBL) (OMIM# 107730), a genetic heterogeneous autosomal codominant disorder [21], defects of APOB genes are involved in most cases, leading to the formation of prematurely truncated APOB species. 	However, a number of defects affecting the rate of synthesis or the rate of removal of APOB is also emerging [21]. The second point to bring into discussion is the colocalization of the two proteins (the abnormal fibrinogen and the normal APOB) in the same ER inclusions. 
PMC5751318	1FZB	Discussion	PDBe	False		With regard to the presence of lipid droplets within the fibrinogen inclusions, we can assume that the overexposed hydrophobic patches of particular γ chain mutations can bind APOB molecules, since the latter protein is characterized by large hydrophobic regions that are normally used for the transport of lipids. 	These hydrophobic features are highlighted in Figure 2, showing the arrangement of fibrinogen α, β, and γ chains and the D–D interface of two gamma chains in the fragment D from the PDB structure 1FZB [22], and in Figure 3 showing a fibrinogen gamma monomer from the previous structure, the homology model of APOB [13], and the crystal structure of the lamprey lipovitellin (PDB 1LSH) [23] that is the closest homologue of APOB with known folding. 	γ chain mutants anomalously bound to APOB may serve as nucleation centers for the formation of hydrophobic clusters. Above a critical concentration, the latter coalesce into a lipid phase that becomes visible in the form of lipid droplets at both light and ultrastructural levels.

PMC6222480	2HCK	Results	PDBe	False		Molecular docking studies provide a virtual screening of different molecules as a potential ligands to predict their ability to interact with the given target candidates. 	For the present study we have chosen the hematopoietic cell tyrosine kinase (PDB ID: 2HCK) in the complex with quercetin as a target molecule [33]. 	Molecule with the best determined antioxidant activity (2e) was chosen as a ligand. Docking score and energy of the interactions between protein residue and ligand are tabulated in Table 3. 
PMC6222480	2HCK	Results	PDBe	False		The molecular docking of the most active compound 2e was performed with iGEMDOCK (BioXGEM, Taiwan). 	Crystal coordinates of the haematopoietic cell tyrosine kinase (PDB ID: 2HCK) in the complex with quercetin was downloaded from Protein Dana Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2HCK). 	In the first step, structure of 2HCK was prepared, including the removal of water molecules and optimized protein structure using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA).

PMC6278402	E3EEN8	Results	UniProt	False		As shown in Table 1, ten peptides were retrieved and assigned to four pectate lyases, which belonged to PL families 1, 3, 9, and 10, respectively, predicted using the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org/) [19]. 	The amino acid sequence of the protein with UniProt accession number E3EEN8 (NCBI protein ID WP_013370345.1) was consistent with a PL family 10 pectate lyase. 	The PL10 enzyme showed the highest intensity in LC-MS/MS analysis (Table 1), which suggested that the enzyme may be a major component of the pectin-degrading enzymes of P. polymyxa KF-1. Only five pectate lyases belonging to PL family 10 have been characterized, including PelA from B. alcalophillus NTT33 [20], Pel-15E from Bacillus spp. strain KSM-P15 [21], PelA from Azospirillum irakense [22], rPelA from Treponema pectinovorum ATCC 33768 [23], and r-PL_D from Xanthomonas campestris ACCC 10048 [24].

Using the family 10 polysaccharide lyase from Cellvibrio cellulosa (PDB ID: 1GXN, identity = 44.79%) as a template [27], the structure of PpPel10a was modelled; it displayed a predominantly α-helical structure with short β-strands and irregular coils (Figure S2). The structure of family 10 pectate lyases is different from that of the pectate lyases from PL families 1, 3 and 9, which have a parallel β-helix fold [28].

The structure of family 10 pectate lyases is different from that of the pectate lyases from PL families 1, 3 and 9, which have a parallel β-helix fold [28]. From the amino acid sequence alignment it is deduced that residues D138, N139, R273, E276, R355 and R370 of PpPel10a were responsible for catalysis. 
PMC6278402	1GXN	Results	PDBe	False		Signal peptides were predicted using the SignalP 4.1 Server [25]. 	A structural model of the pectate lyase PpPel10a was generated using SWISS-MODEL with the family 10 polysaccharide lyase from C. cellulosa (PDB ID: 1GXN, identity = 44.79%) as the template [28,37].
