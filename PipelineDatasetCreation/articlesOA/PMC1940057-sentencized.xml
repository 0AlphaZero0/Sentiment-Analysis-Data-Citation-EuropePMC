<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Peptides are involved in a wide number of physiologic and biochemical processes, including metabolism, pain, reproduction, and the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While many naturally occurring peptides are linear compounds, nature also provides us with a wide variety of monocyclic and polycyclic peptides and proteins of all different shapes and sizes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Among them, diketopiperazines (DKP), cyclic dipeptides, are the smallest head-to-tail cyclic peptides and form a very attractive family because of their many potential uses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In fact, useful biological properties have been demonstrated for some of them such as antibacterial, fungicidal, herbicidal, antiviral, immunosuppressor, and antitumour activities [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the number of newly isolated naturally occurring DKPs has increased during the last few years, the biosynthetic pathways of these molecules remain largely unexplored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Generally, DKP derivatives seem to be produced by three different ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The first one is nonribosomal pathway and product formation takes place under the catalytic control of a large multimodular enzyme complex, termed NRP synthetase (NRPS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Molecular characterization of NRPS genes has revealed a modular organisation [4] in which each module within this biosynthetic assembly line is responsible for the recognition, activation, and incorporation of a certain amino acid into the nascent peptide product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Such catalytic unit (module) is composed of functionally specific and independent domains, each of them responsible for catalyzing one single reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Much of the attention in the field of NRPSs is attracted by the potential to obtain new peptide products with novel biological activities by directed engineering of the biosynthetic genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In fact, the modular organisation of NRPSs lends itself to biocombinatorial approaches, such as domain and module swapping, as well as fusion and truncation of existing catalytic units [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>DKP derivatives can be also obtained as a side product in the course of nonribosomal synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is the case of the Cyclo (Phe-Pro) formation during the nonribosomal synthesis of tyrocidine A and gramicidin S in certain strains of Bacillus brevis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Tyrocidine A, (Phe-Pro-Phe-DPhe-Asn-Gln-Tyr-Val-Orn-Leu-)cyc, is produced at the onset of the stationary phase of growth of Bacillus brevis ATCC 8185 strain via a nonribosomal pathway and possesses antibiotic activities against several gram positive bacteria [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Gramicidin S, a cyclic decapeptide consisting of two identical pentapeptides (Phe-Pro-Val-Orn-Leu)2, is produced via a nonribosomal pathway by Bacillus brevis ATCC 9999 and presents antibacterial activities [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The third DKP biosynthesis way has been described from Streptomyces noursei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about the DKP derivatives from Streptomyces species and their biosynthetic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The only isolated and studied DKP biosynthetic gene cluster from this bacterium genus is that of albonoursin of the Streptomyces noursei [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been reported by these authors that the biosynthesis of the albonoursin diketopiperazine is independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the isolation from Tunisian soil of a new actinomycete strain called Streptomyces sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>US24 producing divers biological activities, the purification, and the structure elucidation of two active molecules from this bacterium [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The first one is the 3-indolethanol and the second active molecule is a DKP derivative, the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) diketopiperazine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to detect the biosynthetic pathway of this DKP derivative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our strategy is based on gene disruption approach by homologous recombination via a suicide vector derived from pSET152 [11] containing a 696 bp DNA fragment amplified by PCR using the Streptomyces sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>US24 genomic DNA as a template. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The detection of the biosynthetic pathway of the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) diketopiperazine (DKP) derivative from the Streptomyces sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>US24 strain will permit the study and the comprehension of the natural biosynthesis of diketopiperazines from Streptomyces genus and consequently the production of hybrid DKP molecules having interesting biological and pharmacological activities. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Although the biosynthetic pathways of DKP derivatives remain largely unexplored, in bacteria and fungi these active molecules generally seem to be produced by nonribosomal pathways (NRPS: nonribosomal peptide synthetases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In analogy to type-I polyketide synthases (PKSs), NRPSs exhibit a modular architecture and a module can be further subdivided into different domains, each responsible for a certain biochemical reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The adenylation domain (A-domain) controls the entry of the substrates into the peptide as it recognizes and adenylates its cognate substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The thiolation domain (T-domain) is referred to as peptidyl carrier protein (PCP), from where it is condensed with the aminoacyl or peptidyl moieties at the neighboring modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The latter reaction is catalyzed by the condensation domain (C-domain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>These three domains, C, A, and T, constitute a minimal elongation module, the basic repetitive unit of multimodular NRPSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the first module of an NRPS complex lacks a C-domain, whereas the last module usually contains also a termination domain (Te-domain) to release the product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This modular architecture offers a real potentiality to construct new hybrid peptides with novel biological activities by directed engineering of the biosynthetic genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to detect the biosynthetic pathway of the Cyclo (L-Phe, L-Pro) active molecule produced by Streptomyces sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>US24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>For that purpose, two degenerate oligonucleotides (P1 and P2) were prepared, according to the typical Streptomyces codon usage, based on the amino acid sequences alignment of two synthetases 1 of the Tyrocidine A and Gramicidin S, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>For these two decapeptides, Phe and Pro are the residues number one and two, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Three genes (tycA, tycB, and tycC) coding for three proteins of 124, 405, and 724 kDa, respectively, are involved in the biosynthesis of the Tyrocidine A. TycA (synthetase 1) comprises only one module corresponding to the phenylalanine activase (phenylalanine activing domain) and racemase [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In the biosynthesis of the Gramicidin S, three open reading frames organised in one transcriptional unit were identified and the corresponding genes are called grsT, grsA, and grsB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The GrsA (Gramicidin S synthetase 1) is an enzyme with a molecular weight of 126.6 kDa which activates and racemize the amino acid phenylalanine as the first step in nonribosomal biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotic gramicidin S [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the amino acid sequences of GrsA and TycA revealed an extensive degree of homology over 56%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>If similar amino acids are also considered, the degree of homology increases to over 70% [26]. </plain></SENT>
