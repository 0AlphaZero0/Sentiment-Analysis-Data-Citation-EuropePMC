Defects in intraphotoreceptor transport can lead to retinal degeneration and blindness. The transport mechanisms are unknown, but because the OS is a modified cilium, intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a candidate mechanism. IFT involves movement of large protein complexes along ciliary microtubules and is required for assembly and maintenance of cilia. We show that IFT particle proteins are localized to photoreceptor connecting cilia. We further find that mice with a mutation in the IFT particle protein gene, Tg737/IFT88, have abnormal OS development and retinal degeneration. Thus, IFT is important for assembly and maintenance of the vertebrate OS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rods and cones; retinitis pigmentosa; blindness; primary cilia; orpk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Intraflagellar transport (IFT)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>) is essential for the assembly and maintenance of sensory cilia in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, motile cilia in sea urchins and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and primary cilia in mice, and is likely to be important in all cilia. During IFT, kinesin-II transports a large protein complex from the cell body to the tip of the flagellum (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Morris and Scholey, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Piperno and Mead, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Orozco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Signor et al., 1999b</xref>). These particles are then returned to the cell body by the DHC1b/DHC2 isoform of cytoplasmic dynein (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Signor et al., 1999a</xref>). IFT particles in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> are composed of at least 17 proteins and are thought to carry components needed to build and maintain the ciliary axoneme and membrane (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Piperno and Mead, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>). The functions of individual IFT particle proteins are not known, but their sequences are conserved among green algae, nematodes, and vertebrates (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding IFT particle proteins prevent ciliary assembly in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, and mice (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murcia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Vertebrate photoreceptors are polarized sensory neurons consisting of a photosensitive outer segment (OS) that develops from a nonmotile primary cilium by movement of membrane and phototransduction proteins, such as opsin, into the cilium (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besharse and Horst, 1990</xref>). The cilium remains in mature photoreceptors as the sole connecting link between the inner segment (IS) and OS and is presumably the major transport corridor. Mature photoreceptors continue to require transport from the IS to the OS to replace components of the OS that are turned over each day (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Young, 1967</xref>). It has been estimated that normal turnover in each mammalian OS requires delivery of as many as 2,000 photopigment molecules per minute throughout the life of the cell (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besharse and Horst, 1990</xref>). In the larger photoreceptors of amphibians, this rate must be increased by more than an order of magnitude (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besharse and Horst, 1990</xref>). In addition to photopigment molecules, phototransduction proteins (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Philp et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whelan and McGinnis, 1988</xref>) and phospholipid components of the discs (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1980</xref>) also turn over rapidly. Although disruption of intersegmental transport results in photoreceptor degeneration and blindness (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hagstrom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>), the transport mechanisms have not been identified.</p><p>IFT has been proposed as a connecting cilium transport mechanism (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rosenbaum et al., 1999</xref>). In support of this idea, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek et al. (2000)</xref> showed that a conditional knockout of KIF3A, which is a subunit of the anterograde IFT motor, leads to retinal degeneration. However, KIF3A-containing motors are believed to be involved in other cellular processes, including neuronal transport, melanosome movement, and secretory pathway transport (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek and Goldstein, 2000</xref>). To more directly test the role of IFT in connecting cilium transport, we here investigate the distribution of IFT particle proteins in vertebrate retinas, and examine the effect of a mutation in an IFT particle subunit gene on the mouse retina. We show that mouse homologues of four <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> IFT particle proteins are localized to the connecting cilium, and mice with a mutation in the Tg737/IFT88 subunit of the IFT particle form abnormal OSs followed by progressive photoreceptor degeneration. These data strongly suggest that IFT is an important transport mechanism in vertebrate photoreceptors and raise the possibility that defects in IFT may cause some forms of human blindness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Vertebrate IFT particle proteins</title><p>The <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> IFT particle is composed of &#x0223c;17 proteins.

To determine if the four mammalian homologues also are present in a large complex, we fractionated cytoplasmic extracts of mouse testis on sucrose gradients and examined the distribution of the IFT particle proteins by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, a and b). Testis was chosen because the IFT proteins are much more abundant in this tissue than in any other, including retina. The four mammalian IFT proteins cosedimented at 17S, indicating that, like their algal homologues, they are part of a large complex. These data provide the first direct evidence of an IFT particle in a mammalian system and demonstrate the utility of the affinity-purified antibodies to IFT proteins.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

Several additional bands were detected with this antibody. It is likely that these are unrelated cross-reactive proteins, as their level did not change in the Tg737 mutant mice. The IFT88 antibody was used to stain mutant and wild-type mouse retinas to see if differences could be detected. The IFT88 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d, green) strongly labeled the IS of the wild-type retina without significantly labeling this segment in the mutant. The staining was distinctly granular in nature and the brightest foci were associated with the ends of photoreceptor connecting cilia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d, red). Connecting cilia could be detected in the mutant retinas but green foci were not associated with them, indicating that this staining is due to the IFT88 protein, and not one of the cross-reactive proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of IFT proteins to basal body and connecting cilium in bovine retina</title><p>The low abundance of IFT proteins in the retina and the small size of the mouse retina made biochemical studies difficult. To circumvent this problem, we used bovine retina. Bovine retina is often used as a biochemical system for photoreceptor research, and techniques are available for making a detergent-extracted photoreceptor cytoskeleton (DEPC) fraction that is enriched in connecting cilia (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Horst et al., 1987</xref>). Furthermore, the K26 monoclonal antibody, which binds specifically to and is an excellent marker for the photoreceptor connecting cilium (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Horst et al., 1990</xref>), works only in bovine photoreceptors.</p><p>Affinity-purified antibodies to IFT20, IFT52, IFT57, and IFT88 did not readily detect proteins of the expected sizes in whole cell extracts of bovine retina (unpublished data). However, these antibodies strongly detected single bands of &#x0223c;16, 52, 57, and 90 kD, respectively, in the DEPC fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, a and b), suggesting that these proteins are associated with the photoreceptor connecting cilium. The retina is composed of multiple cell types, and it is likely that the failure to detect IFT proteins in whole retina is because these proteins are not abundant in the nonphotoreceptor cells. If the IFT proteins are concentrated at the connecting cilia, as the mouse result suggested, the DEPC would be greatly enriched for these proteins, as the purification of the DEPC would remove the nonphotoreceptor cells as well as most of the proteins of the photoreceptor cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

Much weaker immunoreactivity was also seen in the outer plexiform layer, which contains the synaptic terminals of photoreceptors. This and the presence of kinesin-II in these synapses (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Muresan et al., 1999</xref>) raise the possibility that IFT proteins may have functions in photoreceptor synaptic terminals.</p><p>Double label immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody (K26) that recognizes an unknown connecting cilium&#x02013;specific epitope (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Horst et al., 1990</xref>) demonstrated that all four IFT proteins are associated with the cilium and basal body in situ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, d&#x02013;j).

At p10, the OSs in Tg737 mutant mice are greatly reduced in size and difficult to see by light microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). At the EM level, the mutant OSs are disorganized.

Instead, discs often form parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, the connecting cilium, and in some OSs the disc membranes are broken into small segments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E). Another frequently seen anomaly is the development of the OS from the lateral side of the IS and partial intrusion of the OS into the IS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F). This anomaly suggests breakdown of the mechanism that correctly positions the basal body, because in wild-type mice OSs always develop from the apical (distal) end of the IS.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>

These four proteins copurify with photoreceptor ciliary axonemes, and localize immunocytochemically to the basal body and connecting cilium of intact photoreceptors. Additional data indicate that IFT proteins are also associated with photoreceptor cilia of the fish and frog (unpublished data). The accumulation of these proteins at the basal body with lesser amounts in the ciliary axoneme is remarkably similar to the distribution of IFT particle proteins in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Deane et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The critical importance of IFT in photoreceptors is demonstrated by our data showing that a hypomorphic mutation in the mouse Tg737/IFT88 gene leads to aberrant rod OS development and progressive photoreceptor degeneration, resulting in loss of 60&#x02013;80% of the photoreceptors by p77. The basic features of the photoreceptor defect are initial aberrant, dysplastic development of both rod and cone OSs, followed by progressive photoreceptor death by apoptosis. During initial OS formation, discs fail to properly align and often are vesiculated or form parallel to the connecting cilium. Frequently, formation of the cilium occurs at sites distant from the apical region of the IS, leading to the formation of cells with anomalous polarity. Although disc rims form in many cells, discs are often unusually large, suggesting disruption of the mechanisms that normally regulate disc size. Interestingly, <italic>rom1</italic> mutant mice also form oversized disks (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>), and in Tg737 mutant mice, ROM1 is reduced in severely disrupted OSs. In addition to the OS structural defects, Tg737 mutant mice retain opsin in their ISs and cell bodies, and accumulate extracellular vesicles containing opsin. However, opsin trafficking is not completely disrupted as large amounts of opsin are transported to the OSs. The photoreceptor cells still alive at p77 had aberrant OSs similar to those seen early in development.</p><p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Tg737/IFT88 is absolutely required for assembly of ciliary structures (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2001</xref>). The assembly of the connecting cilium and its development, albeit abnormal, into a rod OS in the Tg737 mutant mouse is probably made possible by the presence of a small amount of Tg737/IFT88 made from the Tg737 insertional allele. The Tg737 insertional mutation, which was generated by integration of exogenous DNA into an intron without affecting the coding potential of adjacent exons, greatly reduces but does not eliminate the production of normal-sized Tg737 message (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 1994</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Taulman et al., 2001</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>During the course of this work, we examined the retinas from 29 mice of various ages that were homozygous for the Tg737 mutant allele and 55 that were heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type Tg737 allele.

Other RP-causing mutations are in genes with broader expression patterns, such as myosin VIIA, which causes RP and deafness (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Because IFT is important for the assembly and maintenance of all cilia and flagella, defects in IFT also would be expected to affect multiple cell types and tissues. Indeed, the Tg737 mutant mouse is defective in assembly of the primary cilia in the kidney, leading to polycystic kidney disease (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is of interest that there is a longstanding connection in the literature between RP and polycystic kidney disease (see &#x0201c;266900 renal dysplasia and retinal aplasia&#x0201d; at the online Mendelian inheritance in man website, www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?266900). For example, both Senior-Loken and Jeune syndrome, which appear to be separate diseases, are characterized by retinal degeneration and cystic kidneys (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Traboulsi et al., 1998</xref>).

Strikingly, we find both structural alterations in Tg737 mutant mice, arguing further that IFT provides a transport mechanism critical for normal assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Model for intraphotoreceptor transport</title><p>Our data allow us to propose a model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) based on the idea that one or more of the cytoskeletal, membrane (including rhodopsin, peripherin-2, Rom-1, and phospholipid), or cytosolic protein components (including IFT proteins) normally synthesized in the IS and targeted to the OS via the connecting cilium are transported via IFT. The macromolecules are all synthesized in the IS. The polarity of IS microtubules (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Troutt and Burnside, 1988</xref>), with their minus ends associated with the base of the cilium, suggests that membrane vesicles are transported there by cytoplasmic dynein 1. This dynein is a well-established vesicle transporter and has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al., 1999</xref>). At the base of the connecting cilium where IFT particle proteins are most concentrated, the IFT particles associate with the surface of the vesicles and components of the ciliary axoneme, as well as soluble proteins of the OS such as transducin and arrestin. Once the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane adjacent to the cilium, the complex is moved along the connecting cilium by kinesin-II. Kinesin-II is the anterograde IFT motor in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Orozco et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Signor et al., 1999b</xref>). Kinesin-II has been localized to the connecting cilium in vertebrates (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Beech et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Whitehead et al., 1999</xref>), and mice with photoreceptor-specific defects in the KIF3A subunit of kinesin-II accumulate opsin and arrestin in the IS (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek et al., 2000</xref>). In the OS, the IFT particles disengage from their cargo, and the membrane is organized into disks through a mechanism involving myosin VIIA. Myosin VII is required for phagocytosis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Titus, 1999</xref>), and mice with defects in the myosin VIIA gene accumulate opsin in the connecting cilium (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Soluble proteins of the transduction machinery and cytoskeleton then associate with appropriate protein complexes within the OS, and IFT particles that have reached the distal end of the connecting cilium are returned to the base of the cilium by cytoplasmic dynein 1b/2. This dynein is the retrograde IFT motor in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Signor et al., 1999a</xref>) and has been localized to the connecting cilium of vertebrate photoreceptors (unpublished data). At the base of the connecting cilium, the IFT particles reenter a peribasal body pool of IFT particle proteins and begin the cycle again. The IFT particles also may move components of the transduction machinery from the OS to the IS. For example, both transducin and arrestin have been reported to rapidly move between the segments during light and dark adaptation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Philp et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whelan and McGinnis, 1988</xref>), and arrestin accumulates in the IS in KIF3A mutant mice (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>

Both mutations cause accumulation of opsin in the IS and result in substantial age-related loss of photoreceptors. The principal difference in the two phenotypes is that kinesin-II mutant mice accumulate intracellular vesicles in the IS before degeneration of affected cells, whereas Tg737 mutant mice accumulate extracellular vesicles and show anomalous OS development before degeneration. Although the initial IS defect in the KIF3A mutant mice may reflect a nonciliary role for kinesin-II in photoreceptors, it seems likely that the principal differences between the two relates to the fact that the kinesin-II defect appears suddenly in individual cells after the OSs have developed (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek et al., 2000</xref>), whereas the hypomorphic Tg737 mice have an insufficient quantity of IFT88 during development and do not form proper OSs. In both the Tg737 and the kinesin-II mutant mice, opsin accumulates within the IS, and it has been suggested that kinesin-II specifically transports opsin (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszalek et al., 2000</xref>). Although opsin is a potential cargo for IFT, its accumulation in IS membranes is a general feature of diverse photoreceptor degenerations (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nir and Papermaster, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nir et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hagstrom et al., 1999</xref>) and could result indirectly from multiple defects that alter the transport/assembly of discs in the OS.

Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti&#x02013;rabbit or goat anti&#x02013;mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Texas red&#x02122;, fluorescein, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, or Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes). In double label experiments, discrimination of signals for K26 versus IFT proteins involved the use of conjugated anti&#x02013;mouse and anti&#x02013;rabbit antibodies, respectively. For discrimination of two monoclonal antibodies (K26 vs. tubulin or opsin), we labeled with one monoclonal antibody and a fluorescent anti&#x02013;mouse antibody, and then repeated the procedure for the second monoclonal antibody using a different fluorophore. Images of cells labeled with more than one fluorophore were pseudocolored and merged using NIH Image 1.62 or Adobe Photoshop<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Antibodies used in these studies were the four IFT antibodies (above), an antirhodopsin monoclonal antibody (B630N; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Besharse and Wetzel, 1995</xref>), a monoclonal anti-acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin antibody (611&#x003b2;1; Sigma-Aldrich), an antibody to ROM1 (provided by Rod McInnes, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada), and a monoclonal antibody (K26) directed at an unidentified epitope of the bovine photoreceptor connecting cilium (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Horst et al., 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse breeding</title><p>The original TgN737Rpw mouse line was homozygous for the autosomal recessive <italic>Pdeb</italic>
