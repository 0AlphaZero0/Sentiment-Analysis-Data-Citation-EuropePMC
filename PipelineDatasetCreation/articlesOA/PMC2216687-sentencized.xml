</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Genome sequencing projects have deposited tremendous amounts of protein sequence data for a vast number of genomes, and as we move into the post-genomic era, it will be crucial to determine biological functions for all these encoded proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Currently, a substantial portion of most genomes is still unannotated [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For instance, among the current list of Drosophila genes downloaded from FlyBase (November 2006) [2], only 54% are annotated with “molecular function” terms in gene ontology (GO) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Additionally, many proteins are modular, consisting of multiple functional domains, and therefore the existing annotations may still be incomplete. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>While experimental methods such as loss of function mutational analysis, RNAi, or targeted misexpression approaches have been very successful in identifying protein functions, they are labor intensive and time consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As a result, much of the genome-wide functional annotations are based upon in silico methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most established computational approaches to function detection primarily depend on homology matching to genes with known functions utilizing programs such as FASTA [4] and PSI-BLAST [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="?"><plain>However, assuming functional annotations by sequence similarity poses some critical questions, such as at what level of sequence similarity can we feel assured that the two proteins carry out the same function, and at what level of detail if the function is conserved? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Over the years, numerous non-homology based computational techniques have been developed to derive protein functions from additional sources of biological data such as gene fusion events [6], [7], phylogenetic profiles of proteins in multiple genomes [8], gene expression and mutant phenotype data [9], and heterogeneous data such as gene expression, physical interactions, motif information and transcription factor binding sites data [10]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>With the ever-increasing accumulation of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, a number of computational approaches have emerged to take advantage of these data for gene function prediction [14]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In general, these approaches are based upon the premise that proteins often physically interact to achieve a common objective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Hence, it may be possible to infer functions for a protein based on its interaction partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The concept is also known as ‘guilt-by-association’, which assumes that interacting proteins are more likely to carry out similar functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Schwikowski et al. [14] applied a neighbor counting method where unknown proteins were assigned functions based on the frequencies of their interaction partners having particular functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, several research groups attempted to improve the neighbor counting method through application of χ2 statistics [15], Bayesian analysis [16], and Markov random field analysis [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several researchers have introduced protein interaction network based methods [19], [20], and Brun et al. [21]–[24] clustered the Saccaromyces cerevisiae proteome into several groups to predict cellular functions using protein interaction data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although most computational methods have shown great promise in function assignment, current methods still suffer from two major limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>First, most function prediction algorithms can predict protein functions with 50%–75% accuracy, which may not be of practical use for biologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some methods use only several tens to hundreds of functional categories in the prediction process which resulted in more generic rather than specific functional assignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Therefore, developing more effective in silico methods to increase the fidelity of these functional annotations and to propose novel functions for currently uncharacterized proteins presents a major challenge to the life science community and will eminently aid the biological community as higher quality functional annotations are often used by scientists to generate new hypotheses and direct their research focus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe CSIDOP, Cross-Species Interacting DOmain Patterns, a new method for protein function assignment based on the shared interacting domain patterns extracted from cross-species protein-protein interaction data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In an evaluation of the CSIDOP method we use protein-protein interaction data from the Homo sapiens genome, and find that CSIDOP is capable of making molecular function predictions for human proteins with accuracy of 95.42% using 2,972 gene ontology (GO) functional categories (the most specific terms in GO). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, CSIDOP is able to assign novel functional annotations for 181 previously uncharacterized proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that CSIDOP can complement current GO annotation by providing additional functional annotations for proteins that are already characterized by GO. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The CSIDOP method tackled the protein function determination problem by analyzing interacting domain patterns that are conserved across different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A brief synopsis of the method is presented here with a more detailed description presented in “Materials and methods”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Protein domains are the structural and/or functional units of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>They are conserved through evolution and serve as the building blocks of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Some protein domains serve specific functions such as tyrosine kinase domains that covalently attach phosphate groups to select tyrosine residues in target proteins, whereas other protein domains may be more generic, for example participating in protein-protein binding and thereby being associated with numerous biological activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>A protein may contain only a single domain or it may contain multiple domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In some cases multiple domains may work together for the execution of a single function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Protein functions are often directed by physical interactions of these modular domains [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Pereira-Leal and Teichmann [26] suggested that protein interactions often evolve through duplication of the proteins involved in the interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In their work, partial duplicates are defined as any two interaction pairs with one protein in common and homology between the other proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Any two interactions where both proteins are homologous are counted as complete duplicates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Their results indicated that the duplicated modules tend to retain similar general functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This suggests that interacting modular domains may be conserved over time and between organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a shared pattern between two interacting protein pairs may indicate that both pairs interact through the same shared modular domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We are exploring this property of conservation of interaction as a means to assign protein functions by concentrating on protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs with similar interacting modular domain patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Under this hypothesis, if two PPI pairs contain a common interacting domain pattern, then proteins in the two pairs with similar modular domains are more likely to be associated with similar functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For example, assume that there exist two PPI pairs: protein A interacts with protein B and protein C interacts with protein D. If proteins A and C contain the same modular domain X that interact with the modular domain Y in proteins B and D, then we conclude that the two PPI pairs share a common interaction domain pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we extrapolate that proteins A and C are more likely to have similar functions, and the same applies to proteins B and D (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This also illustrates how domain interaction can contribute to protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>One or more domains in a protein may form modular domains and interact with other modular domains in other proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001562.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The proteins nhr_67 and ESR1 contain the PF00105 domain, whereas daf-21 and HSP90AA1 contain the modular domain (PF02518, PF00183). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In the Gene Ontology database [3], the proteins nhr-67 in C. elegans and ESR1 in human are annotated to the same function terms such as ligand dependent nuclear receptor activity, regulation of transcription, DNA dependent, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Analogously, daf-21 and HSP90AA1 were found to be annotated with the same function terms, ATP binding and protein folding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that this method is fundamentally different from other protein interaction-based function detection algorithms where the function of a target protein is determined strictly by its interaction partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Compared with existing methods, our method is distinctive in the following aspects: (i) protein functions are detected through the shared interacting domain patterns, (ii) the patterns are mined from the cross-species protein interaction data, and (iii) unknown proteins can be assigned to various functional categories in GO, in contrast to most other methods where proteins are assigned with a limited number of functional categories such as MIPS [30] that are less specific than GO. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>An essential issue concerning the protein function prediction problem is the assessment of method reliability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the CSIDOP method, a set of protein interaction data is partitioned into two groups: (1) training data: PPI pairs where both proteins are annotated in the GO, and (2) testing data: PPI pairs with at most one protein annotated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The training dataset is used to extract interacting domain patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The test dataset, on the other hand, contains interaction pairs that have either one of the proteins uncharacterized or both unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Thus, we can assess the reliability of the CSIDOP method by determining how well it worked in function prediction for those GO-characterized proteins and predict functions for proteins that are currently not characterized in GO in the test dataset. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We chose to evaluate the method using proteins in H. sapiens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The collected human protein interaction data were separated exclusively into training and test datasets as described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>To train the CSIDOP method, we integrated protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from the organisms S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, in addition to the large data set from H. sapiens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the relative performance of our method, inferred functions of the H. sapiens proteins (by CSIDOP) were then compared to the known functions in the GO database, which we designate as the ‘true’ terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Hence throughout this paper, the ‘true’ function terms of a protein refer to the known function terms of this protein listed in the GO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>An exact match between a predicted term and the corresponding true GO term for a protein indicates a correct prediction; and wrong prediction otherwise. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>After training, CSIDOP produced a lookup table of significant interacting modular domain patterns from interaction pairs in the training dataset (see Text S1 and Text S2), where each pattern is associated with a number of function terms (please refer to “Material and Method” for details). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Annotations were made to a PPI pair in the test dataset if it contains at least one interacting modular domain pattern listed in the table. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Overall, we could assign functions for 618 H. sapiens proteins from PPIs with common domain patterns in the lookup table. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Among the 618 predicted proteins, 437 had existing annotations in the GO database, and thus could be used to evaluate the CSIDOP method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Among the 437 proteins, 417 were assigned with correct functions by the CSIDOP (assigned functions have an exact match with the ‘true’ terms), i.e., the CSIDOP method had an accuracy of 95.42% (Table 1) using 2,972 GO functional terms, which is higher than most of the existing in silico methods. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>For the 20 proteins with predicted functions that do not match with their ‘true’ terms, the differences between the predicted terms and the ‘true’ terms may be due to incompleteness of the GO annotations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>For example, the Alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor [Swiss-Prot: P01023], was predicted by CSIDOP to be involved in protease inhibitor activity (GO:0030414), which is not among the current list of functions annotated in GO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this prediction, alpha-2-macroglobulin is found to be a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested [33]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Our CSIDOP method predicted that it is also involved in ATP binding (GO:0005524), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), nucleotide binding (GO:0000166), and nucleoside_triphosphatase activity (GO:0017111), all of which can be verified in InterPro [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Other assigned terms for PRS7 by CSIDOP included endopeptidase activity (GO:0004175) and ATPase activity (GO:0016887), which were observed in the orthologous proteins of PRS7. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>A distance of one means that the two terms have a direct parent-child relationship; for instance, protein binding (GO:0005515) is a known function of Furin precursor protein [Swiss-Prot: P09958], and our method predicted it to be involved in protein domain specific binding (GO:0019904), which is a direct child term of protein binding in GO. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>For example, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 [Swiss-Prot: O15524] was identified in GO to be associated with insulin-like growth factor receptor binding (GO:0005159), whereas we assigned the function term, sevenless binding (GO:0005118). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>The CSIDOP method is assessed, both biologically and statistically, on the Homo sapiens genome for function annotation based on domain patterns extracted from interacting protein pairs in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>It makes functional assignments from a pool of 2,972 unique functional categories. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Using the H. sapiens genome, the CSIDOP method accurately assigned functions to 95.42% of the proteins when 2,972 function terms were used, which is highly reliable and is of practical use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The accuracy increased to 98.85% when the number of terms was decreased to 129. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In contrast, with the same testing dataset, the Majority Rule algorithm, the simple domain based method, and orthology based method achieved only 59.50%, 61.98%, and 83.86% in accuracy, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we have shown that the CSIDOP method can not only provide additional functions to the incomplete GO annotations, but also assign functions for 181 human proteins that currently do not have GO functional terms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Domain patterns have been successfully applied in prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) [47]–[51], a problem related to but different from protein function predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>In protein interaction prediction, it mainly focuses on identifying interacting domains. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>For each protein interaction pair in the reference dataset, we tried to identify its neighbors based on functional distances between their individual proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>In doing so, all remaining pairs are compared against this centroid interaction pair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>An incoming PPI pair is accepted to join the group if and only if the distances among individual proteins in the centroid pair and the pair under consideration are below certain threshold t.

<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>In the end, PPI pairs in the same group are assuredly more likely to share the same or similar functions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Thus different combinations of modular domains in a protein should be considered in generating the potential interacting domain patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Due to the existence of some big proteins with more than 15 domains, it is computationally intensive and impractical to generate all possible combinations; therefore, measures had to be taken to trim down the set of all possible combinations by restricting the domain size of each protein to 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>While domain combinations involving more domains from each protein could slightly increase the prediction accuracy, they require much longer computational time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>The assumption is also biologically reasonable because it is unlikely for a large number of domains to come together and form a single unit during interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the same set of a large number of domains is unlikely to occur repeatedly in other proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>In consequence, a list of potential interacting domain patterns is enumerated from each protein pairs in an individual group of PPIs with similar functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Each domain pattern will be associated with a list of function terms from their corresponding PPI pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>In order to select the most significant interacting domain patterns, χ2 statistics is calculated for each pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>The χ2 value is computed using the following formula,(2) N is the total number of PPI pairs in the reference dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Variable A is the number of PPI pairs in the group that contain the particular ‘pattern’, and B is the number of remaining PPI pairs outside the group that contain the ‘pattern’. </plain></SENT>
