<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is especially tempting to approach archaeological and anthropological questions through this type of material, but DNA from ancient human tissue is notoriously complicated to work with due to the risk of contamination with modern human DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Various ways of authenticating results based on ancient human DNA have been developed to circumvent the problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One commonly used method is to predict what the contamination is expected to look like and then test whether the ancient human DNA fulfils this prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If it does, the results are rejected as contamination, while if it does not, they are often considered authentic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We show here that human contamination in ancient material may well deviate from local allele frequencies or the distributions to be found among the laboratory workers and archaeologists. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>New technologies for working with ancient DNA have increased knowledge and explanatory power in several disciplines bordering on evolution and genetics, and the addressing of anthropological issues through ancient DNA has aroused especial interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the first major study exploring the power of ancient DNA was concerned with human remains [1], and that studies of ancient human DNA are still attracting a lot of attention after more than 20 years [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ancient human DNA is challenging to work with, however. This was already recognized a decade ago when it was found that modern contamination is present to a high extent in reagents and materials [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Even more alarming is the evidence that there may be higher concentrations of contaminating DNA than of authentic ancient DNA in specimens from museums and collections [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the contaminating DNA appears to degrade in a fashion similar to ancient DNA, making it hard to use damage patterns to discriminate between the two [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The only quantifiable difference to emerge to date is the level of DNA fragmentation [7], [8], which has proved useful when authenticating DNA from ancient hominids [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A list of tests and criteria aimed at establishing the authenticity of ancient DNA results was published in 2000 [10], and these criteria are often applied in ancient DNA studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>DNA results based on ancient human remains remain controversial in spite of meeting these criteria, however, the best illustration perhaps being the discussion that followed the publication of DNA sequences for the Italian Cro-Magnon remains [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, one criterion in particular has frequently been used in recent studies of DNA from ancient humans, that stating that sequences generated from the ancient specimens should “make phylogenetic sense”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This criterion was developed to authenticate DNA results obtained from non-human remains, i.e. it makes phylogenetic sense when a DNA sequence from a mammoth clusters with sequences from elephants rather than with human sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Initially this criterion was used to test the authenticity of an alleged dinosaur sequence [13] which proved to be a human sequence [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This criterion is nevertheless applied in an inverse fashion when studying DNA from ancient human remains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Haplotype and genotype frequencies in the geographical area where the remains are processed are assessed initially and all the laboratory technicians and archaeologists involved are also typed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The ancient specimens are then analysed and the data generated are accepted as being authentic if they deviate significantly from that initial background assessment [2], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It should be pointed out that this mode of authentication is applicable only if every possible source of contamination can be accounted for. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To test this criterion, we selected a genetic marker that has a clear distribution pattern in Sweden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In a modern Swedish population 74% are carriers of a mutation that makes it possible to drink milk as an adult [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This high frequency should make it possible to trace any contamination arriving from the surroundings and the people who have handled the material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Next we selected some prehistoric skeletal material from Sweden to study the occurrence of the contamination often found in ancient DNA analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We extracted and typed a set of Swedish Neolithic human remains and negative controls for a genetic marker with globally varying allele frequencies in three laboratories and investigated whether the deviating results from the laboratories could be explained by contamination with local alleles or whether there were alternative explanations for the contamination. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>First, we have quantitative mitochondrial DNA data for the samples processed in Linköping (Fig. 2) showing that there is sufficient human DNA in the human samples and significantly more than in the negative controls, to provide for authentic results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This argument is generally accepted on its own as sufficient for authentication [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Second, significantly fewer negative controls were contaminated with modern human DNA at Linköping than at Stockholm and Uppsala (p = &lt;0.001, Z = 7.149479 in a MWU test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was a significant difference in allele frequencies between the negative controls that showed human results and the results obtained from the ancient human samples (p = 0.016, Z = −2.41109, Fig. 3) among those processed in Linköping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The seven human samples had a frequency of 0.36 for the derived allele while the contaminated controls (four out of 43 amplicons from non-human samples and four out of 41 amplicons from extraction controls) had a frequency of 0.88 for the same allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>There is no such difference between the negative controls and the ancient human samples in the results generated in Stockholm and Uppsala (p = 0.93, Z = −0.090854, Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The most striking result, however, is that the contaminating allele (-13910C) present in most of the negative controls and equally many of the samples processed in Stockholm and Uppsala is an allele that is as rare in Scandinavia as in the rest of Europe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>None of the laboratory workers who had been closest to the material was a homozygote for the allele appearing in the contamination (AL, HM, and AG, although AG is a heterozygote). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the material originates from two collections, making it improbable that one physical anthropologist with a deviating allele could have contaminated all the samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>If this had been the case, there would not have been any discrepancy between the results from Linköping and the other two laboratories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The origin of the contamination could lie in reagents manufactured outside of Europe, for example, and used in the various laboratories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Several of the reagents used in all three laboratories were from the same suppliers but from different batches and with different production dates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The water and the ethanol used in the laboratories were of different origins, and while PCR reagents from the same supplier were used in Stockholm and Linköping, PCR reagents from a different supplier were used in Uppsala (but note that the results from Uppsala did not deviate from those from Stockholm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Contamination problems with PCR reagents have been demonstrated in earlier studies [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Other possible sources could be the plastic ware or the gloves, for which the three laboratories use different suppliers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>More important, the contamination we detected in this material is of a type that we would not have expected from samples excavated and processed in Scandinavia, as the allele present in the negative controls is rare in this area (but note that the allele frequencies in the contaminated samples are similar to those known in parts of Asia, where much of the plastic ware and gloves had been produced). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Thus our data raise concerns on how the authentication of ancient human DNA is currently taking place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It is not appropriate to authenticate results solely on the basis of deviation from the modern population or the scientists and laboratory workers who have been in contact with the material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This criterion is not sufficient on its own, but it could possibly be used in combination with other criteria such as real-time qPCR, typing of human DNA in a sufficiently large body of non-human material and massive amplicon cloning. </plain></SENT>
