<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>ERs are involved in the regulation of embryonic development, homeostasis and reproduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Two major estrogen receptors, alpha and beta (ERα and ERβ), convey the physiological signaling of estrogens (17β-estradiol, E2) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ERs are activated by specific synthetic ligands such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, the ERβ-specific ligand diarylpropionitrile (DPN), and the ERβ-specific agonist propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), which belong to the group of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) [2]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has increased dramatically during the recent ten years [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Gender differences in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic disorders are well established [6]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases are largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, lack of ER activation has been implicated in postmenopausal impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism, resulting in visceral fat distribution, insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk after menopause [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In this context the investigation of ER-signaling and its role in metabolic disorders has gained increasing attention [4],[8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To identify the ER subtype involved in the regulation of metabolic disorders, studies have been carried out in ER-deficient mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>ERα-deficient (αERKO) mice have profound insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance [10]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that ERα has a protective role in metabolic disorders by improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The metabolic function of ERβ is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>ERβ knockout mice (βERKO) have a similar body weight and equal fat distribution in comparison to wild type littermates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Additionally, βERKO and wild-type (wt) mice exhibit similar insulin and lipid levels [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies in βERKO mice were only carried out under low fat diet, which may have concealed a phenotype relevant for human obesity normally induced by high-energy/fat diet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) belongs to the NHR family and is a major regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism by modulating energy homeostasis in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Glitazones or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are high-affinity PPARγ agonists, and act as insulin sensitizers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The role of PPARγ in the control of glucose homeostasis expands beyond its primary action in adipose tissue, and involves the regulation of adipocytokine production such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin [19]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Consistently, reduced PPARγ activity has important metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiological consequences leading to insulin resistance, diabetes and end organ damage [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying PPARγ function are similar to those of ER-signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In a basal state, PPARγ, similar to ERs, is bound to corepressor proteins such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) or silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>After binding within the ligand binding domain (LBD), PPARγ ligands induce its heterodimerization with retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRα), and its subsequent interaction with co-activators like steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) followed by binding to PPARγ response elements (PPREs) within target gene promoters [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Importantly, PPARγ is sharing a similar pool of cofactors with ERβ which provides a platform for mutual interactions between these two NHRs [23],[24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>To study the crosstalk between ERβ and PPARγ, we investigated the regulation of PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity by ERβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Our in-vitro experiments in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed that ERβ inhibits ligand-mediated PPARγ-transcriptional activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) prevented the ERβ-mediated inhibition of PPARγ activity, whereas the presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting protein 205 (DRIP205) or PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC1α) had no effect indicating a role for distinct nuclear coactivators for ERβ-PPARγ interaction in-vitro. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In order to demonstrate a molecular interaction between PPARγ and ERβ in a metabolically relevant cell system, we first investigated ligand-dependent PPARγ activity in the presence of ERβ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Cells were treated with the PPARγ-agonist pioglitazone (10 µM), with or without additional E2 stimulation, and PPARγ activation was measured using pGal4-hPPARγDEF/pG5TkGL3 luciferase assay [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Upon pioglitazone stimulation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed pronounced PPARγ activation (bar 1+2, Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This activation was not affected by co-treatment with ligands for ERβ such as E2 (bar 2 vs. 3, Figure 1A) or DPN (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of ERβ led to a marked inhibition of ligand-dependent PPARγ activity (bar 2 vs. 4+6+8, Figure 1A) which was also corroborated in a PPARγ response element (PPRE) luciferase assay ( Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This inhibition was E2 (bar 4+6+8 vs. 5+7+9, Figure 1A) and DPN independent (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of ERβ seemed to be isoform specific, since ERα overexpression resulted in no inhibition of PPARγ activity (bar 11, Figure 1A and Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To further explore the regulation of PPARγ by ERβ, we performed additional experiments coexpressing an activation function 1 domain (AF-1) deleted-ERβ construct in 3T3-L1 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of this truncated form of ERβ which still contains a functional ligand binding domain (LBD) did not reduce PPARγ activity indicating that ERβ AF-1 is necessary for regulation of PPARγ by ERβ (bar 10, Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>To assure adequate overexpression and function of ERβ in our system, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transiently transfected with ERβ followed by Western blot analysis and transactivation assays using ER response elements (ERE)-luciferase system (Figure 1B, C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Consequently, data from βERKO mice suggest that ERβ negatively regulates insulin and glucose metabolism which may, at least in part, result from an impairment of regular adipose tissue function based on a negative cross-talk between ERβ and PPARγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Loss of ERβ resulted in enhanced body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>However, absence of ERβ prevented hepatic/ muscular triglyceride overload, preserved regular insulin signaling in liver/ skeletal muscle, and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This metabolic phenotype strongly suggested augmented PPARγ signaling in mice lacking ERβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>And indeed, PPARγ target genes and PPARγ-DNA binding were markedly induced in gonadal fat from βERKO mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Along this line, blockade of adipose PPARγ signaling by PPARγ ASO injection reversed the metabolic changes in βERKO mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>A mutual signaling cross-talk between ERs and PPARγ has been described previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>PPARγ together with its heterodimeric partner RXRα has been shown to suppress ER-induced target gene expression through competitive binding to an ERE site in the vitellogenin A2 promoter [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In accordance with a bidirectional interaction, Wang and colleagues demonstrated that ERs are capable of inhibiting ligand-induced PPARγ activation in two different breast cancer cell lines [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our results, these authors show that basal and agonist-stimulated PPRE-activity is also blocked by ERα. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional activity of PPARγ differs markedly depending on the cell system and tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The highest level of PPARγ-mediated transcription has been described in adipocytes and adipocytic cell lines, where molecular conditions such as cofactor availability seemed to be optimized [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Compared to adipocytes, breast cancer cells exhibit low PPARγ expression and activity reflected by a less than 2-fold induction of PPRE-activity after ligand stimulation [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The presence of PPARγ suppression by ERα in breast cancer cells might be a result of weak basal PPARγ transcriptional activity in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the pronounced activation of the exogenous PPARγ LBD in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes may require more potent inhibitory stimuli which could not be achieved by ERα overexpression in our system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Suppression of PPARγ-LBD activation by ERβ did not depend on ERβ ligands which is consistent with previous reports [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Also our in vivo studies in estrogen-depleted, ovariectomized wt mice treated with the ERβ-ligand DPN indicate that PPARγ-ERβ interaction is ligand independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>More importantly, overexpression of a truncated form of ERβ containing solely the ERβ-LBD/ AF2 domain did not induce any inhibitory effect on PPARγ suggesting an important role of ERβ's NH2-terminal AF1 domain for ERβ-PPARγ interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Consistently, activity of the ER-AF1 domain is usually not dependent on ligand activation [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Tremblay and coworkers demonstrated that ERβ-AF1 activation involves ligand-independent recruitment of SRC-1, a cofactor involved in ERβ-PPARγ interactions in our study [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>These data corroborate our observation that PPARγ suppression by ERβ involves the AF1 domain and ligand-independent interactions with the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Repression of PPARγ activity through ERβ was reversed by titration of the p160 coactivators, SRC1 and TIF2, suggesting that the suppressive action of ERβ is a result of p160 coactivator interaction with ERβ thereby preventing the binding of PPARγ to the same coactivators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Similar interactions have been described previously for ER interaction with the thyroid receptor [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates for the first time that ERβ impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD implicating pro-diabetogenic actions of this receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>In consonance, we could recently demonstrate that ERβ has a suppressive role on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression in skeletal muscle [8],[37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>GLUT4 has been identified as the major mediator of insulin-induced glucose uptake in fat and skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>In addition, removal of the E2-ERβ signaling by ovariectomy in ERα-deficient mice improved glucose and insulin metabolism supporting the diabetogenic effect of ERβ [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Loss of ERβ resulted in a marked augmentation of adipose PPARγ activity in our model indicating that ERβ mediates its metabolic actions by a negative interaction with PPARγ in adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>This concept is corroborated by a number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>HFD-fed βERKO mice exhibited increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>These metabolic changes are usually observed under chronic PPARγ stimulation [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>PPARγ has been identified as an essential regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Two major mechanisms have been described: (1) Adipose PPARγ protects non-adipose tissue against excessive lipid overload and maintains normal organ function and insulin responses (liver, skeletal muscle) by preserving regular adipose tissue function, and (2) Adipose PPARγ guarantees a balanced and adequate production of adipocytokine secretion such as adiponectin from adipose tissue, factors which are important mediators of insulin action in peripheral tissues [38]–[40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Both processes could be observed in βERKO mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Further support of this notion comes from clinical actions of anti-diabetic PPARγ agonists (TZD) [28],[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Activation of PPARγ by TZDs in diabetic patients resembles the phenotype of βERKO mice including improved insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance in the presence of weight gain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>We also observed increased food efficiency and changes in nutrient partitioning reflected by an increased RQ in βERKO mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Loss of ERβ appears to result in attenuated fatty acid (FA) oxidation which may favor the storage of TGs in adipose tissue and increased fat accumulation, and may provide a possible explanation for the enhanced weight gain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, treatment of obese mice with a synthetic PPARγ agonist has been shown to mediate similar changes including an increase in food efficiency and higher RQ values [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Finally, blockade of PPARγ signaling in adipose tissue of βERKO mice resulted in a reversal of the metabolic phenotype corroborating the importance of adipose PPARγ in the present model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>The observed suppression of hepatic PPARγ activity by ASO injection is unlikely to play a major role since the initial metabolic characterization of untreated βERKO mice under HFD did not reveal any dysregulation of hepatic PPARγ signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In summary, the metabolic phenotype of βERKO mice is mediated by an augmented adipose PPARγ action, which implies that in the presence of ERβ, PPARγ activity might be partially suppressed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>The notion, that ERβ-PPARγ crosstalk requires receptor-p160 interaction, was underlined by our observations in WAT from βERKO mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPARγ-regulated adiponectin promoter in WAT was enhanced in the absence of ERβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>It has recently been demonstrated that p160 coactivators are important regulators of PPARγ transcriptional activity in WAT [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>In particular, TIF2 has been identified as a nuclear coactivator involved in the adipogenic actions of PPARγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Future experiments are required to define the functional relevance of TIF2 and SRC1 in our model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>So far one may conclude that the metabolic phenotype of HFD-fed βERKO mice is, at least in part, explained by increased adipose PPARγ activity as a result of exaggerated binding of p160 coactivators to PPARγ-regulated target gene promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Diabetogenic actions of ERβ are of major significance for the pharmaceutical development of new ERβ-selective agonists intended for use against a multitude of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or postmenopausal osteoporosis [43],[44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Despite the high tissue selectivity of such compounds, and despite the fact that the actions observed in our study were ligand-independent, one has to be aware of the potentially deleterious actions of ERβ on insulin- and glucose metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>As a precautionary measure metabolic profiling of new ERβ agonist should be performed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data provide first evidence that ERβ negatively regulates insulin signaling and glucose metabolism that involves an impairment of regular adipose PPARγ function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Moreover our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>In consonance, impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ERβ has significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and is essential for the development of new ERβ-selective agonists. </plain></SENT>
