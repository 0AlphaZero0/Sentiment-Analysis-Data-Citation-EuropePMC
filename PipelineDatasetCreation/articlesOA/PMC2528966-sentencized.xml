</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Fibroproliferative disorders are a major cause of morbidity and mortality [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Traditionally parsed into categories based on the target organ afflicted-lung, liver, kidney, heart, vasculature, CNS or integument-biomedical scientists now view the fibroproliferative diseases as sharing a common pathobiology independent of the organ or tissue that scars [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Organs can heal or scar following toxic exposures, with fibrosis predominating when the injurious agent cannot be eradicated by the host defense system, as occurs with certain infections; or is repeatedly introduced over a protracted interval of time as occurs in asbestosis, silicosis or alcohol-induced hepatic cirrhosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The clinical focus in these situations is specific antimicrobial therapy or prevention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>More vexing, however, are the fibroproliferative diseases of unknown cause, which frequently progress to organ dysfunction or death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Currently, while there are a few therapeutic leads [4], [5], there are no therapies that reproducibly interdict fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For decades, innate and adaptive immunity has served as the focal point for studies of tissue fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While an unremitting immune response can lead to fibrosis, in many idiopathic fibrotic disorders, immune-suppressive therapy affords limited benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This has shifted attention to the primary effector of the fibroproliferative response, the fibroblast itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis, renal fibrosis, keloids and pulmonary fibrosis display aberrations in processes that govern nearly every aspect of the fibroproliferative response [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that fibrotic fibroblasts manifest pathological control of pathways governing proliferation, viability, motility, contractile function and connective tissue production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that while these differences emerge in the context of exogenous signals from matrix, cytokines, chemokines, morphogens and peptide growth factors; fibrotic fibroblasts appear to retain a distinct cell biology in vitro. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here we study the fundamental pathobiology of tissue fibrosis by focusing on a lethal respiratory disorder, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as a prototype fibroproliferative disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The histological pattern of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), a patchy fibroproliferative process that spares some respiratory units while affecting others nearby. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Progression of fibrosis leads to obliteration of the gas-exchange surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This pathological respiratory phenotype is the culmination of complex interactions among myofibroblasts, epithelial cells, cytokines, and the surrounding extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblast foci, the pathologic hallmark of IPF, are comprised of myofibroblasts embedded in a type I collagen rich matrix [12], and the burden of myofibroblast foci found in lung biopsy samples inversely correlates with patient survival [13], [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Whereas myofibroblasts in healing wounds contract their matrix and undergo apoptosis in a timely manner, myofibroblasts in IPF lesions persist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involves aberrant beta 1 integrin signaling in response to type I collagen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This results in defective PTEN function and unrestrained Akt signaling leading to downstream activation of the translation initiation machinery [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>How this pathological integrin signaling alters the gene expression pathway of fibrotic myofibroblasts has not been elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To answer this question, we took a systems biology approach and examined two key steps in the myofibroblast gene expression pathway genome-wide–transcription and ribosome recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional control in IPF has been previously characterized in lung tissue samples [17]; however, ribosome recruitment pattern-a measure of which transcripts are being translated into protein-has not been examined in tissue or cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We elected to carry out this analysis using primary lung myofibroblasts in 3-dimensional type I collagen gels, an in vitro system that surrounds myofibroblasts in type I collagen in a context that lacks exogenous cytokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To simulate an aberrant, fibrotic environment, we studied cells in type I collagen gels that were fixed to the sides of a tissue culture dish and therefore not allowed to contract (referred to as “non-contractile” matrices); to simulate the environment of physiological healing, we released the type I collagen gels from the sides of the dish and allowed the myofibroblasts to contract their matrices (referred to as “contractile” matrices) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>By examining the gene expression pathway of control and IPF myofibroblasts in both non-contractile and contractile collagen gels, we are able to determine the extent to which matrix type and the tissue of origin accounts for any differences observed at two levels of gene expression regulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Here we show distinct intrinsic differences in the gene expression pathway between control and IPF myofibroblasts in both non-contractile and contractile type I collagen matrices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>While differences are present at the transcriptional level, the majority of differences observed are at the level of ribosome recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we demonstrate that IPF myofibroblasts manifest a much greater dependence on collagen matrix conditions than do their control counterparts, changing the translational activity of a large set of transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that IPF myofibroblasts are intrinsically pathological cells with fundamental changes in their gene expression pathway primarily at the level of ribosome recruitment regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process during embryonic development that has been implicated as a source of pathological myofibroblasts in renal fibrosis and IPF [46], [47], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>To examine whether there was genome-wide indication for EMT at the level of transcription and/or translation, we manually constructed a module comprised of 111 genes that had at least one published study documenting its participation in EMT, and built 4 sub-modules to represent the 3 major cell surface receptor-mediated pathways triggering EMT (Wnt, TGF-β and integrin-matrix) and a module comprised of EMT-related transcription factors (module gene lists provided in Table S9; these modules were not assessed in the “significant gene list analysis” presented above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The global EMT module was not active in IPF compared to control (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>When studying the subgroups the TGF-β -EMT module, the integrin-matrix-EMT module and the transcription factor module distinguished IPF from control–primarily at the level of transcript abundance. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>To test the biological validity of this systems level analysis implicating EMT in the origin of IPF myofibroblasts, we selected the epithelial intermediate filament component, Keratin 18, for further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>In our genome-wide analysis of ribosome recruitment, we found that this epithelial gene was dramatically translationally activated in IPF myofibroblasts compared to controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>To verify this we used the same samples and approach as in Figure 4A–C to assess the level of Keratin 18 mRNA across the polyribosome fractions. Figure 6A shows that Keratin 18 was indeed more translationally active in IPF compared to control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Keratin 18 was also marginally increased at the total RNA level (&lt;1.5 fold, not shown). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In a prior report, we provided the first insights into molecular mechanism, showing that aberrant beta 1 integrin signaling results in defective PTEN function, unrestrained Akt signaling and downstream activation of the translation initiation machinery [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide the first genome-wide analysis of the consequences of this aberrant signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>We find that two steps in the flow of genetic information–transcription and ribosome recruitment-are altered in IPF myofibroblasts, and that changes in ribosome recruitment account for the majority of differences between IPF and control myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>When comparing gene expression in contractile and non-contractile matrices, IPF myofibroblast gene expression showed large-scale translational changes depending on matrix state, whereas the pattern in control myofibroblasts was relatively stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In addition, our analysis provides systems level evidence for EMT as a source of some IPF myofibroblasts, providing strong support for the pathological study suggesting an epithelial origin for some IPF myofibroblasts [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Our data do not exclude the possibility that other IPF myofibroblasts may originate from cytokine altered resident fibroblasts or from circulating fibrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>These findings do, however, establish the power of systems level genome-wide analysis to provide mechanistic insights into IPF, and point to derangements of translational control downstream of defective integrin signaling as a fundamental component of IPF pathobiology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of IPF is the result of complex interactions among myofibroblasts, epithelial cells, cytokines, and the surrounding extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Significant debate continues as to what degree, or even whether, an abnormality in any individual component contributes to the overall disease process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Part of this uncertainty relates to conflicting results found in studies of IPF myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>As an example, investigators comparing proliferation and apoptosis between IPF and control myofibroblasts have reached contradictory conclusions[38], [39], [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>While many aspects of the debate are not resolved by the results of this study, there is no doubt that these key processes are fundamentally different in IPF and control myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates this fundamental difference in a comprehensive microarray analysis of two levels in the gene expression pathway–transcription and ribosome recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>A few previous studies have been performed using microarray technology to compare transcriptional profiles of IPF and control myofibroblasts [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis has also been done using whole lung samples from patients with IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) and controls [17], [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>However, all of these investigations focus on differences in mRNA abundance, which correlates poorly with protein levels [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Analysis of translation, the next step in the processing of genetic information, reveals more prominent and informative differences between cells, and correlates more closely with protein levels [32], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these data, our study demonstrates markedly more genes differing between IPF and control myofibroblasts at the level of ribosome recruitment compared with mRNA abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Our study is also the first to perform this analysis using primary cells rather than immortal, established cell lines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the stability of the transcriptional and translational profiles between IPF and control as a function of matrix state revealed major differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Control myofibroblasts demonstrated no significant differences in transcript abundance and relatively few differences in ribosome recruitment on non-contractile compared to contractile matrices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IPF myofibroblasts displayed extensive changes in transcription and ribosome recruitment as matrix state changed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This analysis illustrates a difference in phenotype between IPF and control myofibroblasts, suggesting that in IPF there is pathologic relaxation of the gene expression control system found in normal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these data fit with the idea that IPF myofibroblast pathobiology includes a loss of translational control, analogous to the loss of tumor suppressor function seen in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Experimental precedent for this concept has been provided by studies showing that IPF myofibroblasts have acquired at least one cancer-related property–the ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner [55]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Given the growing body of experimental work indicating that fibrotic myofibroblasts have a distinct phenotype, one topic that has recently garnered much interest is the source of myofibroblasts in IPF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Published morphological data suggest that myofibroblasts in IPF have an epithelial origin [56]; and there is direct experimental data implicating EMT as a source of myofibroblasts in a mouse model of lung fibrosis [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Using a systems approach to analyze genome-wide data, we establish that myofibroblasts cultured from the lungs of patients with IPF have an EMT signature. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Here we group genes associated with each of the 3 EMT pathways, and find that two of the pathways (matrix and TGF) are active in IPF myofibroblasts–providing the first systems-level indication regarding mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>In accord with this result, recent data indicates that myofibroblast contraction of its extracellular matrix can trigger release of TGF- β from its latent form in the matrix [57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate a difference in transcript abundance and ribosome recruitment for a number of genes when comparing myofibroblasts from patients with IPF to controls. </plain></SENT>
