</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Site-specific recombinases promote controlled rearrangements of DNA sequences, by binding, cutting and rejoining the DNA strands at sites that they recognize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The capacity of site-specific recombinases to bring about insertion or excision of defined DNA segments has led to their widespread application in experimental genetics and biotechnology, with further potential uses in gene therapy (1,2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Members of one large family of these enzymes, the serine recombinases, have biological functions that include bacteriophage integration and excision, switching of bacterial gene expression by DNA inversion and transposon cointegrate resolution (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Much of our understanding of the mechanisms of serine recombinases has come from studies on the closely related cointegrate resolvases from the bacterial transposons Tn3 and γδ (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tn3 (or γδ) resolvase catalyses recombination between two 114 bp res sites (Figure 1A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Each res site contains binding sites for three resolvase dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The DNA strands are broken and rejoined at specific bonds near the centre of the 28 bp binding site I; catalysis of these reactions is by the subunits bound to site I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The ‘accessory’ binding sites II (34 bp) and III (25 bp) are also required for recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Resolvase dimers bound to sites II and III do not participate in the catalysis of strand cleavage and rejoining, but have an essential role in assembly of the synaptic complex (‘synapse’) of two res sites that is a prerequisite for strand exchange (Figure 1A and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The synapse has regulatory functions which include restriction of recombination to pairs of res sites that are in the same orientation in a supercoiled DNA molecule, specification of a single round of recombination and specification of the 2-noded catenane recombinant product (5). Figure 1.Synapsis and recombination by Tn3 resolvase. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Synapsis of two res sites in head-to-tail orientation by wild-type resolvase traps three topological nodes (shaded oval), and strand exchange results in a 2-noded catenane resolution product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Activated mutant resolvases can synapse sites by random collision, giving rise to products of variable topologies; in the example shown, a 5-noded knot inversion product. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Tn3 resolvase is a 185-amino acid protein consisting of two domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal domains (∼45 amino acids) of resolvase dimers make sequence-specific interactions with the DNA at each end of binding sites I, II and III in res. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal domain contains the active site for catalysis of strand exchange, and all known interactions between subunits involve residues of this domain (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The structure of the N-terminal domain of γδ resolvase, solved by X-ray crystallography (6–9), revealed two important types of interaction between subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The 1–2 or dimer interface mediates dimerization of resolvase in solution and when bound to DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The 2–3′ interface connects dimers; it has essential functions for wild-type resolvase in assembly of the synapse of two res sites and in activation of recombination (5,7,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The 1–2 dimer is present in a structure of γδ resolvase bound to site I DNA (11; Figure 2A), but the 2–3′ interaction has not yet been observed in X-ray structures of complexes containing DNA. Figure 2.Resolvase structures and activating mutations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Certain combinations of activating mutations are more effective than any single mutations, and one double mutant (D102Y E124Q) was shown to have site I × site I recombination activity in vitro (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The activating mutations affect residues at or close to surfaces involved in subunit interactions, in particular the dimer interface (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>One group of these residues is near the N-terminus of the long E-helix which lies on the dimer interface, and comprises G101, D102, M103 and Q105. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>M103 is the first residue of the E-helix (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Variants with combinations of activating mutations at these positions have high site I × site I activity in Escherichia coli (13), and have been used in recent analysis of the structures of recombination intermediates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Sarkis et al. (14) demonstrated the formation of a ‘crossover site synapse’ (herein referred to as a ‘site I synapse’) in which two copies of site I are held together by a tetramer of γδ resolvase with several activating mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The low-resolution structure of a site I synapse containing similar Tn3 resolvase mutants was solved by small-angle scattering combined with other biophysical techniques (15), and structures of site I synapses with cleaved DNA strands have been solved by X-ray crystallography (16,17; Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In these structures, the site I DNA is on the outside of a tetrameric core of the resolvase catalytic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>How the activating mutations promote the formation of the site I synapse remains unclear (see Discussion section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The conformation of the resolvase subunits in the crystallographic site I synapse is substantially different from that seen in earlier structures; the dimer interface has been radically altered, resulting in a flat hydrophobic interface between pairs of subunits in the tetramer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Strand exchange by resolvase is proposed to involve a relative rotation of the components of the cleaved site I synapse about this flat interface [16; reviewed by Grindley et al. (4)]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of recombination by ‘activating’ mutations has been observed in other members of the serine recombinase family, including Sin resolvase (18,19), the DNA invertases Cin, Gin and Hin (20–22) and the bacteriophage φC31 integrase (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>These activated recombinase variants have potential uses as tools for genetic manipulation (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Chimaeric recombinases comprising activated serine recombinase catalytic domains attached to zinc finger DNA recognition domains can promote recombination at sites recognized by the zinc finger domains, and might allow natural genomic sequences to be chosen as targets for insertions or deletions (24,25). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Despite the substantial interest in highly activated resolvase mutants, their functional properties in vitro have not yet been reported in any detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the in vitro properties of a number of these mutants, focusing on a set of variants with mutations near the N-terminus of the E-helix, which have particularly striking-activating effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We show that site I × site I cleavage and recombination by these mutants can be fast and efficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The mutants have lost the strong topological selectivity of wild-type resolvase to varying extents, and make products via a random collision synapsis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Increased site I × site I activity is correlated with increased stability of a site I synapse, formation of which is much faster than the subsequent DNA cleavage and strand exchange steps of the recombination reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We show that one very active resolvase variant is predominantly monomeric in solution, whereas it forms a stable tetramer within the site I synapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with synapsis by docking of two site I-bound dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The site I synapse component of the wild-type res × res synaptic complex might be formed by a similar pathway, promoted by contacts between resolvase subunits at site I and the accessory sequences. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Another property of the activated mutants which is apparent in Figure 3 is their increased tendency to form species with double-strand breaks (DSBs) at site I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>It was shown previously that the DNA cleavage and rejoining activities of resolvase can be partially decoupled in reaction buffers containing high concentrations of glycerol or ethylene glycol (30,31). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>NM resolvase is the most activated variant of those studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In time course assays (Figure 4, and data not shown), NM resolvase-mediated site I × site I (pAL225) recombination was at least as fast as wild-type resolvase-mediated res × res (pMA21) recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Wild-type resolvase made exclusively a 2-noded catenane resolution product which accumulated to a high level at later time points, as expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the NM resolvase reaction products at early time points were mainly topologically complex, but recombinant free circles became more abundant over the time course. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This change is reflected in the restriction digest; at early time points, the ‘resolution’ and ‘inversion’ recombinant bands were observed in an approximate 1:1 ratio, whereas later time points show an increased proportion of ‘resolution’ products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The final (60 min) time point in Figure 4 corresponds to the data shown in Figure 3B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the changes in product topology and restriction digest pattern over the time course are due to multiple rounds of strand exchange (see Discussion section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>A substantial amount of ‘non-recombinant’ DNA is observed even at later time points in the pAL225/NM resolvase reaction, which is also consistent with multiple rounds of strand exchange that convert recombinants back to the non-recombinant configuration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Another surprising feature of the activated resolvase variants is their altered pH sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>SY, NSY, M and NM resolvases are all active on pMA21 (res × res) or pAL225 (site I × site I) over a wide pH range, from &lt;6.0 to &gt;10.0, whereas wild-type resolvase (33) and the single mutant D102Y are almost inactive on pMA21 at pH 7.0 and below (Figure 5 and data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this altered pH sensitivity are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The mutations might induce conformational changes of active site residues, which reduce the sensitivity of catalysis to low pH, or the effects might be due to loss of dependence on pH-sensitive regulatory interactions between the catalytic tetramer and subunits at the accessory sites.

<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The apparent selective formation of free circle site I × site I resolution products at later time points in NM resolvase reactions (Figure 4) can be accounted for by multiple rounds of recombination; under these circumstances products with simpler topology, and therefore lower free energy, will eventually accumulate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The activating mutations present in the resolvase variants studied here were identified in E. coli screens for res × site I or site I × site I recombination activity; that is, reactions where one or both partners lack the res ‘accessory’ binding sites II and III [Figure 1B; (12)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The properties of the mutants might therefore provide insights into the functions of the accessory binding sites in the wild-type system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="?"><plain>The accessory sites have an established role in bringing about topological selectivity by formation of an intertwined structure (29,38,39), but how do they then stimulate recombination at site I? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis would be that accessory site synapsis is necessary simply to enhance the overall rate of formation or stability of the complete two-res synapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>However, the activated mutant NM resolvase recombines a site I × site I substrate, with no accessory sites, faster than wild-type resolvase recombines a res × res substrate (Figure 4), suggesting that this is not a sufficient explanation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>A more appealing hypothesis is that resolvase subunits at the synapsed, intertwined accessory sites somehow promote the site I-bound resolvase subunits from a catalytically inactive configuration to an active one. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The 2–3′ interface is essential for in vitro catalytic activity of wild-type resolvase (see Introduction section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to be involved in contacts between subunits at site I and the accessory sites (5,10), and site I-accessory site 2–3′ interactions have been built into structure-based models for the res × res synapse (10,14,19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, the 2–3′ interface is dispensable for site I × site I recombination by activated resolvase mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>A site I synapse made by wild-type resolvase was not observed in our gel-based assays; either it is not formed, or it is too unstable to survive electrophoresis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Site I synapse formation leading to catalysis by wild-type resolvase might require 2–3′ contacts from subunits at the accessory sites, whereas activating mutations allow site I synapse formation without 2–3′ contacts (Figure 6B), bypassing this regulatory mechanism. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Formation of a synapse of two site I oligonucleotides by NM resolvase is fast (Figure 6C), but subsequent DNA cleavage is much slower (Figure 6E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The synapse bands seen on our gels contain largely uncleaved site I DNA (Figure 6F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The site I synapse is held together by a tetramer of resolvase (Figure 6D; 14), which is stable whilst it is in the synapse but is not present as a long-lived species in solution or bound to a single site I (Figure 6B, Figure 6D and gel filtration results). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and previous evidence (5,15,34), our favoured model for assembly of the site I synapse is that resolvase monomers bind cooperatively to site I to form dimers, and two site I-dimer complexes then interact with each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This pathway might be advantageous in the context of the biology of the wild-type resolution system because it can fully exploit the potential for cooperativity in synapse formation, though mutants other than NM, or other related resolvases, might well behave differently (e.g., see 14,17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>A similar pathway for synapsis was deduced by Sanders and Johnson (40) from an elegant study of synaptic complexes and strand exchange intermediates formed by an activated H107Y mutant of Hin, a DNA invertase related to resolvase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Hin H107Y forms a synapse comprising two hix recombination sites and four Hin subunits which can be observed by gel electrophoresis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The hix DNA in the synapse has been cleaved by Hin H107Y to give DSBs, and this cleavage is required for the stability of the complex, in contrast to the Tn3 resolvase site I synapse (Figure 6F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Further studies on the Hin H107Y synapse showed that the Hin subunits translocate with the DNA half-sites during strand exchange, supporting a subunit rotation model for the mechanism of catalysis (41). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The activating mutations in the resolvase variants studied here were identified as conferring a ‘gain of function’ phenotype; that is, ability to recombine substrates lacking one or both sets of res accessory sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However, mutations in general are most likely to result in loss of function, so it might be better to regard the effect of activating mutations as loss of a regulatory function of wild-type resolvase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>That is, wild-type resolvase has evolved so that its catalytic activity is strictly dependent on formation of a synapse involving two complete res sites, and the mutants have lost this dependence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro experiments show that the mutations have various additional effects on resolvase activity (see above). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The crystal structures of wild-type γδ resolvase and activated γδ resolvase mutants (both unbound and in complexes with site I) should provide clues to the nature of the regulation, and why it is defective in the activated mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The structures of the site I synaptic intermediates [1ZR2, 1ZR4, 2GM4; (16,17)] and of an activated variant catalytic domain without DNA [2GM5; (17)] contain a tetrameric arrangement of the catalytic domains which is not found in any of the structures of wild-type resolvase [2RSL, 1GDR, 1GDT; (6,8,9,11)] (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>However, the structures do not provide an obvious explanation of how the mutations stabilize the tetramer, or why it is not formed by wild-type resolvase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Li et al. (16) make two hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>First, the observed bond angles for the wild-type resolvase residue G101 are allowed only for glycine, so substitution of this residue by serine in the activated mutants might destabilize the dimer by forcing a change in the conformation of this part of the protein, the ‘hinge’ connecting the globular N-terminus of the catalytic domain to the E-helix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Second, some of the mutated residues (e.g. Y102) make new hydrophobic contacts in the tetrameric structures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>To relate the properties of the activated mutants to the mechanism of the wild-type resolution system, it is important to establish whether the changes in resolvase conformation between the crystal structures of the (wild-type) dimer bound to site I and the (activated mutant) tetramer in a cleaved site I synapse occur before or after initial synapsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>An ‘early’ synaptic interface between two resolvase dimers in approximately wild-type conformation has been proposed (13,14,16), involving residues near the N-terminus of the E-helix including G101, D102 and M103, which are mutated in the activated variants studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothetical interface has not been observed by crystallography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The rapidly formed, uncleaved site I synapses observed in this study (and in previous studies using catalytically defective resolvase mutants or chemically modified DNA; 14,15) are distinct from all the current crystallographic structures which contain cleaved site I DNA, and therefore might contain the hypothetical early synaptic interface, stabilized by the activating mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the activating mutations might promote pre-synapsis conversion of the dimer into a conformation resembling that seen in the crystallographic tetramer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In this latter scenario, there would be no equivalent of the hypothetical early synaptic interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Further work will be needed to distinguish between these two models, and to determine whether either of them is applicable to the natural res × res recombination system. </plain></SENT>
