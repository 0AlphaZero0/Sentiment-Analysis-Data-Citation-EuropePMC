</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Since its introduction in 1991, glucocerebrosidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has become the standard of care for patients with symptomatic Gaucher disease due to its safety and efficacy profile [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The success of ERT in Gaucher disease ultimately led to the development of recombinant enzyme treatments for other lysosomal storage diseases such as Fabry, MPS-I, MPS-II, MPS-IV, Pompe and other lysosomal storage disorders [5]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Currently, the enzymes used for treating lysosomal storage disorders in general and in Gauchers disease in particular are expressed in mammalian, Chinese Hamster ovary cells (CHO)[1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, production of this enzyme in mammalian cells is expensive, and the high cost of the approved recombinant glucocerebrosidase for treating Gaucher's disease, is raising public concern [3], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to offer an alternative source for the production of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme, we have developed a biotechnological expression platform which is based on the industrial scale expression of human recombinant proteins in genetically engineered plant cells [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The plant cell technology allows for a cost efficient production system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, the entire manufacturing process is free from any animal-derived components, complementing processing safety advantages as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>prGCD, is the most clinically advanced recombinant plant system expressed protein to undergo phase III clinical trials [15] and its chemical, functional and genetic characterization, including the full amino-acid sequence and its three dimensional crystal structure have recently been described [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Following the successful completion of non-clinical safety toxicology studies, which included a single dose study in rodents [14] and a 28-day acute safety toxicology study in primates (Cynomolgus monkeys) with daily dosing of prGCD, regulatory approval for conducting a Phase I clinical trial was allowed by the FDA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The clinical study in healthy human volunteers was designed to evaluate the safety of three escalating doses of prGCD and to determine the pharmacokinetics profile of the drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition, a nine-month chronic safety toxicology study in primates (Cynomolgus monkeys) with dosing once every two weeks, mimicking the proposed clinical regime of prGCD, was also performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This study was a prerequisite for the initiation of an advanced Phase III clinical trial, which will address the continuing safety of chronic administration of prGCD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this Phase I clinical trial was to determine the safety of recombinant plant cell expressed glucocerebrosidase (prGCD) in healthy volunteers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The safety results confirmed that there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of any significant innate or humoral immune reactions of this investigational drug with any clinically significant adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>prGCD administered IV once a week up to 60 mg/kg was shown to be safe and non immunogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>This data was strongly supported by pre-clinical toxicological studies in animals including primates, performed with prGCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed prGCD to proceed to a Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial, which is currently ongoing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>An interesting finding in this study comes from the pharmacokinetic results, wherein the half life of prGCD was prolonged relative to that of Cerezyme® (Genzyme Corporation, MA, USA), the commercially available enzyme, reported as 3.6–10.4 min [16](Genzyme website). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>While these data are based on a relatively small number of human subjects, these findings have been corroborated in the primate studies as well, and therefore probably reflect a truly prolonged half life of the prGCD enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>At this stage, it is impossible to predict whether this longer circulation time in the blood would have any clinical advantage based on a longer time of exposure to the mannose receptors on the macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Given the great similarity between the prGCD and Cerezyme® proteins, already reported at the level of their 3-D structure [14], and based on the increased uptake of prGCD by the tissue macrophages [14], it will be interesting to compare the clinical outcome of prGCD treatment with the reported outcome Cerezyme® treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Development of antibodies to the current commercially available recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, expressed in CHO cells, has been reported in approximately 15% of the treated patients tested and antibody formation was reported following 3–12 months of treatment [17], [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Considering the relatively small group size and the short duration of treatment (total of 4 weeks) in the human study, the lack of of antibodies to prGCD formation is not surprising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This may also attributed to the high homology with the endogenous protein [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The differences between the reactions of the primates and human subjects has also to do with the differences in the amount of prGCD given and the frequency and duration of dosing (up to 27.8 mg/ml for 9 months in primates and only up to 1.8 mg/ml in humans over a 4 week period). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The formation of antibodies to prGCD in Gaucher patients will be further evaluated in the Phase 3 clinical study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>There is a public concern regarding the high cost of the recombinant GCD enzyme approved for Gaucher's disease [3], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The plant cell system used for the expression of prGCD has the potential to be highly advantageous due to the safe and cost effective production of therapeutic recombinant glycoproteins that are not suitable for production in bacterial hosts, and are currently being expressed in costly mammalian expression systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>prGCD is produced in carrot cells, naturally possesses terminal Mannose residues and therefore, prGCD production does not require costly enzymatic deglycosylation as would be required for the production of recombinant GCD in mammalian cells [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it provides high batch-to-batch reproducibility of its glycan structures, which represents another important advantage of plant cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>An additional advantage over mammalian cells is the fact they do not involve mammalian-derived components in the manufacturing process, making the purified biopharmaceutical products less expensive and potentially safer [3], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined in larger scale clinical studies, as required in any new protein drug development process, whether plant-derived biopharmaceutical glycoproteins are associated with any excessive immunogenicity effects or excessive neutralizing antibody formation, beyond the standard rate seen for recombinant therapeutic proteins, which may limit their use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>However, the current regulatory viewpoint, based on data accumulated in a number of clinical trials involving different plant-expressed proteins, is quite promising in this regard [15], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The clinical and preclinical data presented herein and reported previously [14], demonstrated that there were no obvious treatment-related adverse reactions or clinical findings, indicating the potential safety of plant cell-expressed GCD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Currently, several biotechnology companies have used plant biotechnology to produce protein pharmaceuticals, such as glucocerebrosidase to treat Gaucher disease in our case, lipase to treat cystic fibrosis, alpha-interferon, lactoferrin, and others, which are under evaluation in human studies [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The value and impact of plant biotechnology on global health should not be dismissed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Protein drugs, although quite costly, are widely used in the developed world, but economic barriers make most of these new biotechnology products inaccessible to the general public, but the very wealthiest inhabitants of the developing world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>It is likely that another opportunity for plant-made biopharmaceuticals will take place in the field of new versions of biopharmaceutical products or “biosimilar” versions of existing protein drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>This is especially true as patents on current drugs expire [22] or in those cases where the patents do not protect the expression method of such proteins in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The ongoing clinical trials evaluating these different plant biotechnology produced protein-based pharmaceuticals will enable to determine the merit of using these novel and highly promising technologies. </plain></SENT>
