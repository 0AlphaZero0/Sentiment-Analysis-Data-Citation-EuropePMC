</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are structurally diverse small proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They constitute an important component of the innate immune defense system in many species across the evolutionary spectrum, ranging from bacteria to mammals [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Many of these peptides are cationic and likely to kill pathogens through nonspecifically targeting the overall anionic bacterial lipid membranes [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Protegrin-1 (PG-1, RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR-CONH2) is a cysteine-arginine rich 18 amino acid long AMP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>PG-1 was originally isolated from porcine neutrophils (white blood cells) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The broad strong antimicrobial, antiviral and antifungal activities of PG-1 have made it a focus of consideration as a potential starting point for designing attractive candidate antimicrobial drugs [6]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Notably, it is demonstrated that it could be administered as a topical or intradermal treatment against antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria causing skin and oral cavity infections [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>PG-1 has a β-hairpin structure that is stabilized by two disulfide bridges among its four cysteine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The removal of these two disulfide bridges is found to appreciably reduce the antimicrobial activity of PG-1 [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that PG-1 acts through rapid osmotic lysis by altering the permeability of susceptible bacterial membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The intensity of such lysis is probably influenced by its ability to form pore-like oligomeric structures [13] which are induced through its cationic and hydrophobic content [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The detailed mechanism of action of PG-1 and other AMPs is relatively poorly characterized due to inherent experimental limitations on obtaining atomic resolution description of the three-dimensional structure of peptides in model membrane environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, theoretical and simulation methods [14]–[17] could provide valuable tools that potentially can be utilized to complement experimental techniques in elucidating the mechanism of action of AMPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest are methods based on a continuum (or implicit) description of the model membrane and the solvent molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Examples of these methods are the Poisson-Boltzmann [18]–[22] and Generalized-Born [23]–[25] based approaches, which have been extensively utilized to determine the orientation and the degree of insertion of AMPs and other membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Another computationally cost-effective emerging approach is based on coarse grained modeling, whereby two or more atoms are described by a single interaction site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This cutback usually leads into a substantial reduction in the degrees of freedom of the system, thus rendering it feasible for coarse-grained models to simulate protein-membrane systems for significantly longer time scales than the ones achievable using all-atom MD simulation techniques [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Methods which rely on the development of residue-based or atom-based empirical potentials have been also used to predict the extent of insertion and/or the orientation of peptides in membranes [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These methods, however, are not sensitive to variations in the local environment of the peptide and they neglect explicit electrostatic interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they depend on many adjustable parameters that are not universally optimized for all lipid bilayers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In summary, all of the aforementioned approaches may capture some features of the hydrophobicity of the lipid bilayer hydrocarbon core and the hydrophilicity of the head group region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, they certainly neglect specific interactions, such as hydrogen bond formations and provide no relevant atomistic details regarding the solvent and membrane molecules when compared to the details that can be obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Resolving the positioning of AMPs in model membranes represents a crucial step in understanding the structure and behavior of these peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Two examples of important structural aspects of AMPs in lipid bilayers are their orientation and degree of insertion, which if elucidated, could help in determining their biological activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although α-helical peptides in peptide-membrane model systems have been extensively studied using approaches based on continuum description of solvent-membrane systems [18]–[20], very limited or virtually no similar investigations have been directed to study β-sheet peptides in peptide-membrane model systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we utilize a five slab continuum membrane-solvent model to obtain the most probable orientation of the β-hairpin AMP, PG-1, in DLPC bilayers by computing the relative transfer free energy of the peptide from solution to a given orientation in the lipid bilayer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In the reported model, the transfer free energy is written as a sum of two terms, electrostatic and non-polar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The electrostatic contribution to the transfer free energy is calculated using the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation [29]–[32], while the non-polar contribution is evaluated by assuming that it is proportional to the solvent and membrane accessible surface areas of the peptide [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Despite the simplicity of the model used in the current study, the preferential orientation obtained using our model is found to be in good qualitative agreement with the suggested tilted transmembrane orientation observed in both widely used solid-state NMR experiments [34] and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>It is worth mentioning here that long MD simulations of peptide-membrane model systems produce results and equilibrium configurations that are dependent on the initial conditions [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Therefore, results obtained from an implicit model can be used to systematically provide starting configurations for full atomistic MD simulations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The orientation of the helix axis for α-helical membrane peptides can be adequately determined by measuring solid-state 15N NMR spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, the case is more complex for β-sheet peptides because the N-H bonds unlike α-helical peptides are perpendicular to the principal strand axis in both transmembrane and in-plane (horizontal) membrane orientations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Both, the principal strand axis and the β-sheet plane orientations are required to resolve the orientation of β-sheet peptide in a model membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Yamaguchi and coworkers [34] determined the orientation of PG-1 in DLPC bilayer using solid-state 13C and 15N NMR chemical shift measurements on Val-16 13CO or amid labeled peptides and the solution structure of PG-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The reason for choosing Val-16 was because of its location in the relatively rigid part of the peptide between the between the β-turn and C-terminal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Since the orientation of the peptide relative to the bilayer normal is dependent on the definition of the β-hairpin axis and the β-sheet plane, we determine the peptide orientation by two orthogonal angles as demonstrated in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The first angle is the tilt angle (τ) which is defined as the angle between the principal axis of the peptide backbone and the normal to the plane of the lipid bilayer, while the second angle is the azimuthal rotation angle (φ) which is defined as the angle between the normal to the β-sheet plane and the vector normal to the lipid bilayer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The C and N terminal and nearby residues of PG-1 sample multiple conformations in the solution NMR structures[36] and the DLPC bilayer MD simulation [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the β-sheet plane was determined by a least square fitting through all Cα atoms of the relatively rigid core of the peptide (residues 4 to 16). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>However, calculations of relative transfer free energy of different orientations as compared to a reference orientation are expected to be more accurate since it is presumed that most systematic errors in the model and calculations will cancel out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Based on previous MD-simulations and experimental evidence, PG-1 is assumed to penetrate the DLPC bilayer and reside in the membrane [15], [34]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The positively charged arginine residues located at the β-turn and termini regions, as well as the significant hydrophobic patch at the center of PG-1 give it an amphipathic nature that may contribute to its biological properties and allow it to interact with both the non-polar hydrocarbon core of the membrane and the polar head group region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The transfer free energy is therefore dependent on the dielectric property and the thickness of the lipid bilayer regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The membrane environment as we mentioned earlier is described by multiple slabs of dielectric environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The thickness of the hydrocarbon core slab depends on the type of the bilayer modeled and the other physicochemical conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In this study for a DLPC bilayer, we assigned its hydrocarbon core region with a 30 Å thick low dielectric region. Figure 2 shows the relative transfer free energy between a tilt of 15° and 0° as a function of the head group region thickness in Å. The difference in the transfer free energy stabilizes beyond the thickness of 5 Å, which is the value used in this study to determine the most favorable orientation of PG-1 in the DLPC bilayer. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The value for the relative dielectric constant for the head group region is not well characterized, thus it is questionable whether the head group region can be assigned with a uniform relative dielectric constant [33], or even by multiple layers with different relative dielectric constants as adopted by Tanizaki and Feig [40]. Figure 3 indicates the transfer free energy of PG-1 conformation with a tilt angle of 15° relative to the conformation with a tilt angle of 0° as function of the relative dielectric constant of the head group region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>It clearly shows that the effect of change in the relative dielectric constant of the head group region on the relative transfer free energy diminishes beyond the value of 10. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Here, we adopt an implicit membrane model structure similar to the one used by Sengupta and coworkers [18] to capture these essential aspects of model membrane bilayers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The biological membrane in this model is represented by a simplified description using three structureless homogeneous slabs of dielectric continuum with a low relative dielectric constant assigned to the hydrocarbon region due to its low molecular polarizability [37], whereas the polar head group region is assigned with a higher relative dielectric constant [41] that depends on many factors such as the composition of the head group and its packing density. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The numerical solution of the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation provides an approximation to the electrostatic contribution to the change in the free energy upon transferring the peptide from the aqueous solution to the membrane environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In the Poisson-Boltzmann approach, the atoms of the AMP can be represented by a dielectric cavity with explicit fixed charges on the center of its atoms, while the solvent and the model membrane can be described by homogeneous continuum dielectric slabs as schematically indicated in Figure 6. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The non-polar contribution to the transfer free energy is essentially important in determining the most probable orientation in heterogeneous environment like lipid bilayers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The extent of non-polar contributions associated with the insertion of a peptide in the head group region is expected to be smaller than the one associated with similar insertion in the hydrocarbon core due to the polar nature of the head group region. </plain></SENT>
