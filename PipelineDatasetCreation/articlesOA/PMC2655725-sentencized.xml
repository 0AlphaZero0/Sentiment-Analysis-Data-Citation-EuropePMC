<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It performs the vital role of helping animals to identify favorable nutrition sources, as well as to avoid toxic substances, making taste a fundamental sensory recognition system that is required for survival [1],[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While the ontogeny of the other special sense organs has been studied in depth at a molecular level [3]–[5], the development of taste remains to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Taste buds are the sensory end organs for gustation, and are located on the epithelium of the tongue and palate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On the tongue, they reside on three types of papillae, i.e., fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate [2],[6],[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In adult mammals, each taste bud comprises groups of 50–100 spindle-shaped epithelial cells and a small number of proliferative cells [8],[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Taste bud cells are heterogeneous in terms of gene expression profiling of individual taste cells, as well as in their ultrastructural characteristics. [8], [10]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructual studies have revealed three distinct anatomical types of spindle-shaped epithelial cells within each taste bud: type I (dark), type II (light), and type III (intermediate) cells [8],[10],[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Type II cells have a characteristic large round nucleus and are responsible for the sweet, bitter, and umami taste sensations [2], [6]–[8],[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These cells express a number of G protein–coupled receptors and common downstream transduction components called taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRCSMs; e.g., PLCβ2, gustducin [GNAT3], and IP3R3 [ITPR3]) [2],[6],[7],[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have examined the lineage of taste cells [8],[10],[15],[16], the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation in developing taste buds have remained elusive. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Despite its importance, research regarding the molecular mechanisms of the development of the taste system has lagged behind that of the other special sense organs [3]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In our investigation of the molecular regulation of taste cell differentiation, we isolated key regulators of taste cell differentiation in early development by combining computational and experimental biology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Sharing gene expression regulatory components is an efficient way of regulating molecules within the same signal transduction pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>TRCSMs are indeed expressed in the same population of cells, at least during the course of early taste system development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>We performed in silico analysis of stretches of sequence up to 5 kb upstream of TCRSMs, some of which had been shown previously to drive TCRSM expression in taste cells in transgenic mice [25],[26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Using computational analysis to determine which transcription factor binding sites were commonly found in the promoters of genes involved in the same regulatory network, we identified a number of putative transcription regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Similar procedures could be applied to analyses of other systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the development of taste buds is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions involving several different signaling pathways, such as Notch, Shh, Wnt, and BMP [23], [27]–[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Recent analyses of β-catenin and Sox2 suggest that they are involved in taste cell development, although the steps involved in differentiation have yet to be clarified [27]–[29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The expression patterns of Notch signaling pathway–related genes indicate that the Notch signaling cascade may have a role during morphological differentiation of CVP [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the number of TRCSM-positive cells is more than 5-fold greater in Hes1 −/− embryos than in their wild-type littermates at stages E18 and P0 (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Although we believe that the increase in TRCSM-positive cells observed in Hes1 −/− mutants is due to premature expression of these marker proteins in the taste cell lineage, we cannot not exclude other possibilities, such as an increase in the total number of cells in CVP, or ectopic expression in cell types other than taste cells, in which expression of TRCSMs is normally repressed by HES1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have proposed that a precursor population in the developing central nervous and hematopoietic systems expresses Hes1 to maintain its undifferentiated state, and that downregulation of Hes1 leads to differentiation [33]–[37]. Hes1 may have a similar function in the taste cell lineage, and a reduction in nuclear HES1 would thus trigger taste cell differentiation in CVP epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed a reduction in nuclear HES1 in blood type H antigen– and SNAP25-positive cells (corresponding to type I and type III taste bud cells, respectively) in older animals (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>These observations support the possibility that Hes1 is indeed a common regulator of taste bud cell differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Our computational analysis yielded several transcription factors that may be involved in the TRCSM regulatory network (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
