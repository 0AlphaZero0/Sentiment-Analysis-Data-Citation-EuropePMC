</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Protein chains are often non-contiguously encoded on the DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This is best known in eukaryotic genes which are interrupted by spliceosomal introns, and also in microbial and organellar genomes that include group-I and -II self-splicing introns (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These genetic elements are removed from the transcribed RNA, yielding a contiguous RNA message and subsequent protein molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An additional type of intervening sequences, termed ‘intein’, is processed at the protein level (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Inteins are selfish genetic elements which are inserted in-frame in protein coding regions of diverse prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and organelles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Inteins and intein-like domains are translated with their host proteins and then post-translationally catalyze their removal from the protein precursor by a protein-splicing reaction (3,4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Protein-coding genes of one species are sometimes broken into two (or more) separate genes in other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The broken genes code for separate protein chains that typically interact with each other to form the mature protein molecule (5–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, Nanoarchaeum equitans contains a dozen broken enzymes, whose break sites lie between functional domains of the encoded proteins (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the B-type DNA polymerase of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, is encoded on two different genes (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In other cases, transcripts of broken genes can undergo trans-RNA splicing into one mRNA molecule, which is then translated into a contiguous protein molecule (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This splicing process might represent an intermediate step in the breaking of genes (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Intein-containing genes can be broken into two fragments within the intein domain, and still create the mature protein product by a trans-protein splicing reaction (i.e. protein ligation) (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Each of the broken genes codes for a separate polypeptide: one consisting of the N-terminal part of the host followed by the N-terminal part of the intein, and the other consisting of the C-terminal part of the intein followed by the C-terminal part of the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The two intein parts, termed ‘split-intein’ (13), associate tightly and specifically with each other leading to a protein-splicing reaction, which ligates the two host protein parts in trans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Protein-splicing is typically a robust and rapid reaction, needing no cofactors or external energy sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Split-inteins can be engineered synthetically, but also occur naturally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Split-inteins were readily created in the lab from different natural contiguous inteins, with several different breaking points (14–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Naturally split-inteins have been identified in only two contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In the first, the alpha catalytic subunit of replicative DNA polymerase (dnaE) in a large number of diverse cyanobacteria species is coded on different genes that each includes one part of a split-intein (12,17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the B-type DNA polymerase of N. equitans is coded on two genes, each includes a split-intein part (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>All the cyanobacterial broken dnaE genes include very similar split-inteins at the same integration point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This, and the phylogenetic analysis of the DnaE and intein sequences, suggest that these broken genes originated from a single, irreversible breaking event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This breaking event should be a complex process—to avoid dysfunctional intermediates it needs to create stable protein products, a new transcription termination site and a functional promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how cells can survive with dysfunctional intermediates, since the replicative DNA polymerase is an essential protein needed in each cell cycle (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Recently, two types of proteins were found to be broken into a two genes arrangement with an intervening probable homing endonuclease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Karam, Petrov and co-workers found the gp43 B-type DNA polymerases of several T4-like phages to be broken into two genes separated by 2–3000 bases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In one case the intervening region includes a GIY-YIG putative homing endonuclease (20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Edgell and co-workers described a novel broken gene organization, regulation and function (22,23), where the alpha catalytic subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (NrdA) in the Aeh1 T-even bacteriophage is coded on two separate genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The genes are located within one operon, with the gene coding for the nrdA 5′ region present upstream of the gene for the 3′ region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Between these two genes is a third gene coding for a HNH-type putative homing endonuclease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The genes are co-transcribed but each has different regulatory regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The homing endonuclease gene is regulated on both transcription and translation levels, limiting its translation to late phage-infection time points. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The two nrdA genes are under separate control and generate two protein chains that form an active ribonucleotide reductase together with the NrdB subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Comparison with other T-even phages showed that this arrangement is likely to have been formed by an invasion of a free standing homing endonuclease into a nrdA gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Homing endonucleases occur in different prokaryotes, phages, and organelles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>They are encoded within both group I and group II introns, as auxiliary protein domains incorporated within intein scaffolds, and as free standing genes (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In all cases they have been shown to promote the duplication of their genes and their surrounding mobile elements into specific integration points (homing). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Most often the integration point of a homing endonuclease is also its recognition and cleavage sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Homing endonucleases mediate the invasion of their coding regions into unoccupied alleles, spreading the elements they are present in by horizontal gene transfers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Most inteins have a homing endonuclease domain of one of a few types, but some are missing them altogether. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems that inteins acquired homing endonuclease domains several times in evolution, possibly by invasions of the intein coding regions by homing endonuclease genes (25). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The creation of broken genes is not well understood, but probably involves different mechanisms of gene fission and duplication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Gene breaking ultimately creates separately encoded protein chains, which must associate into one functional protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Complementation of the protein's function by these individually translated peptides should satisfy a number of key requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Foremost is their assembly to reconstitute the original protein function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>However, the proper transcription, translation, solubility, cellular targeting and correct folding of the intermediate protein chains are also crucial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Since dysfunctional intermediates of proteins might be lethal to the organism, broken genes should also be efficiently co-regulated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In this work, we describe the discovery and analysis of a novel genomic arrangement of broken genes from microbial environmental metagenomic data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Each pair of gene parts is located in one locus, with a split-intein and a free-standing homing-endonuclease gene occurring in between the broken gene coding regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We term this organization ‘fractured genes’, since a gene is broken into two genes that are still retained in the original orientation and locus of the parent gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six examples of this arrangement, with different types of fractured host genes, split-inteins and homing-endonucleases were identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In two other examples either the split-intein or the homing endonuclease was absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We describe the identification of these loci, and analyze both the global features of this arrangement, and the nature of fractured proteins, split-inteins and the endonucleases [including a predicted new structural homing endonuclease family, similar to very short patch repair (Vsr) endonucleases]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Finally, we discuss why this arrangement seems most common in phages and present an evolutionary model for this type of gene fracturing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This initial screen identified hundreds of reads coding for potential inteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>These initial models were subsequently refined with the standard Rosetta interface refinement protocol [The same protocol was used in (37), a review of the underlying mechanism can be found in (38)] that minimizes all degrees of freedom at the interface (rigid body orientation, backbone and side-chain dihedral angle) to remove clashes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate additional possibilities for salt bridges across the interface, we further repacked the interface side chains, using the existing side chains and an extended rotamer library for all side chains with at least 10 neighbors (Rosetta option—ex1 -ex2 -ex3 -ex4 -use_input_sc -extra_chi_cutoff 10). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This is a remarkable scenario, where one disrupted gene locus produces two transcripts translated into two protein precursors, that are finally joined to create the exact product of the parent gene (and of its intein-less gene predecessor). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The key for enabling this is the flexibility of inteins to carry out protein splicing reactions either in cis as one molecule, or in trans when present as two separate intein halves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>A possible alternative explanation is translational bypassing where internal RNA regions between two translated stretches are untranslated by the ribosome (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, known untranslated regions are tens of bases long while the intervening regions we observed are hundreds of bases long. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that gene fracturing by intein-targeted homing endonuclease invasions is a highly modular process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The fractured genes final product, split-inteins, and invading homing endonucleases, can each be of different kinds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This shows the generality of the process and hints at its ubiquity, at least in some species or ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Perhaps this process has not been observed in previously determined sequence data because of insufficient sequencing coverage and/or sequencing that was limited to organisms from a very small fraction of environments (ecosystems). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Supporting the first possibility is our identification of the process in the massive amount of Global Ocean Sampling data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The second possibility is supported by the origin of this data from certain aquatic environments, and its relative high enrichment in viral sequences (52). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The tremendous diversity of the Global Ocean Sampling data is coupled to its extreme fragmentary coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Most of our observed fractured gene loci are thus missing parts of their genes and other fractured gene loci that we did not observe are likely to exist, perhaps with different settings such as other host genes and homing endonuclease types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that some of the other hundreds of partial intein-loci we observed in the data (not shown) are parts of fractured genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>These possibilities could be resolved with re-sequencing and re-sampling of Global Ocean Sampling and other environmental sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Homing endonuclease invasions also fracture genes without inteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Edgell and co-workers reported an invasion of an HNH-type putative homing endonuclease into the nrdA gene of Aeh1 bacteriophage, and showed that the two formed NrdA parts can create a functional ribonucleotide reductase (22,23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Karam, Petrov and coworkers reported a case where the a GIY-YIG type putative homing endonuclease is in between two parts of a fractured gp43 B-type DNA polymerase of Aeromonas bacteriophage 25 (20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>We also found an example where a putative homing endonuclease fractured an intein-less gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The homing endonucleases in these two examples are of different kinds, HNH, GIY-YIG and Vsr-like types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The latter is a new type, first described here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>It is related to the well studied Vsr short-patch DNA repair enzymes (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>We show that Vsr-like putative homing endonucleases are also found in group-I introns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>All this further illustrates the duality of several nuclease domains that are present in DNA repair and maintenance enzymes, and in homing or restriction endonucleases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>This protein domain modularity was previously observed for GIY-YIG domains in UvrC subunits of (A) BC exonucleases (53) and HNH in certain MutS subunits of DNA mismatch repair enzymes (54). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Protein–protein interaction between the two broken parts of split-inteins was suggested to be tuned by electrostatics of their two longest beta-strands (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The previously known cyanobacterial naturally split-inteins have opposite charges on these strands (the N-intein is negative and the C-intein is positive). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The new split-intein pairs in this work further support our previous suggestion of split-intein parts protein–protein interaction by complementary local charge distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This includes their breaking in the same region, between motifs N4 and C2, and the charge distribution of each split-intein part. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Such electrostatic patches may be of use for designing proteins, and to increase the binding affinity between protein fragments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>All split-inteins found in this work, except the terminase, and all previously described natural split-inteins are broken at the same region, where all known homing endonuclease domains are also present (55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Thus, although inteins can be synthetically broken in other regions (56), the homing endonuclease insertion region seems to have some advantage for successful intein breaking and homing endonuclease domain recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The one exception we found shows another break point. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The new Vsr-like type of putative homing endonuclease is another example of the remarkable modularity of nuclease domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Many such domains are present in nucleases, restriction endonucleases and homing endonucleases (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Most inteins have a homing endonuclease domain of different types (i.e. LAGLI-DADG and HNH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The two types of likely homing endonuclease that we observed in the fractured gene loci (GIY-YIG and Vsr-like) are not known to be present in inteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our findings suggest that LAGLI-DADG and HNH could fracture genes, and a way that inteins could acquire such, and other, endonuclease domains (see below). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The genomic arrangement described in this work provides missing intermediates in the evolution of split-inteins from typical contiguous inteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Gene breaking may have evolved stepwise as shown in Figure 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Ancestral inteins are assumed to have transposed into, or otherwise be present in, protein coding regions, without requiring an intein endonuclease domain (step I) (57,58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Invasion of a free standing endonuclease, another kind of mobile element, into an intein containing gene (step II) would result in fractured loci such as those observed in this work (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Note that the endonuclease integration point is within the intein-coding region, which is distinct from the intein insertion point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the endonuclease would have been integrated in frame inside the intein to create the endonuclease domains observed within most inteins [steps IIa or IIIa; e.g. (57)], either directly in the invasion step or subsequently by loss of the free-standing endonuclease flanks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The entire free standing endonuclease gene could also be lost leading to a gene arrangement which we also observed (step III; Figure 1 locus gp41-7; note that the hairpin structure found upstream of the putative homing endonucleases in all loci is present in that locus upstream of the C-terminal gene part). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Loss of the free-standing endonuclease could eventually lead to genomic uncoupling of the N- and C-host gene parts (step IV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>This situation, with each gene part in a different locus was previously described in the broken cyanobacterial DnaE and N. equitans DNA polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Free standing endonucleases could also invade intein-less genes (step Ia), as observed by Edgell and co-workers and by us, and invade group I introns (step Ib), as previously observed for various known homing endonucleases (24) and as observed here for the new Vsr-like putative homing endonucleases.

<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Observed genomic organizations are numbered in Arabic numbers, and putative evolutionary processes are marked with arrows and Roman numbers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Protein coding genes can be invaded by an in-frame intein domain (I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Invasion of the intein domain gene by an endonuclease gene can fracture the gene in two (II), or insert the endonuclease gene in frame within the intein (IIa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Invasion of an endonuclease gene into an intein-less gene can fracture that gene (Ia). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Such an invasion can also insert the endonuclease gene into a group I intron (Ib). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Loss of the endonuclease gene from the split-intein locus (III) may be followed by dislocation of the two fractured gene parts into two separate loci (IV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Loss of the flanks of an endonuclease gene in a fractured gene locus could insert the endonuclease coding region in-frame into the intein, recreating a contiguous gene (IIIa). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In our model the invading endonuclease gene brings along not only its own gene control regions but also ones required by the fractured genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>The translation stop codon and transcription stop signals of the upstream gene are created by the 5′ end of the invading element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The initiator Met codon of the downstream gene is created by the 3′ end of the invading element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Supporting this last suggestion is the overlap between the coding sequences of endonucleases and their downstream gene (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>This coupling would reduce the amount of acceptable mutations in the overlap region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Preserving a protein coding start site at its 3′ end is likely to enhance the invasion success of the endonuclease element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>The transcription signals for the downstream gene could be present in the 3′ end of the invading element or be in the endonuclease gene promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In this last scheme a multiple-genes transcript would include the coding region of the endonuclease, followed by that of the downstream gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>The hairpins immediately upstream of endonuclease coding regions (Figure 4A) are similar to the one found to attenuate the translation of the Aeh1 nrdA endonuclease (22), and thus they could control the translation of their downstream genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>In contrast to endonuclease fracturing of protein-coding genes, homing endonuclease invasions into group I introns often utilize the conserved sequences of the introns as contiguous regions of their distal coding regions [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp095/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>; (59–62)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>This difference is likely due to the distinct outcomes of the invasion events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In gene breaking events several control elements and coding regions must be inserted for the invasion to succeed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>When a homing endonuclease invasion results in an additional domain in a self-processing intron or intein, there is no additional transcript of the host gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>The endonuclease ORFs will just require an upstream element to control their translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in non-split inteins and in some introns the endonuclease is transcribed and translated with the host (60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Thus, such successful invasions do not require sequences beyond the coding regions of the invading endonuclease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>The split-inteins loci that we identified are likely to be of phage and virus (viral) origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>This is supported by sequences closely related to viral ones (e.g. the gp41 helicases), by gene organizations that appear in phages (e.g. the DNA ligase and exonuclease locus), and by occurrence of phage gene types (e.g. DNA packaging large subunit terminase). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>This could partially explain the occurrences of split-inteins in DNA synthesis and repair enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Phage proteins are extremely diverse and usually not well conserved (63). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>This impedes the propagation and survival of intein elements that invade and survive best in highly conserved integration points (57,64,65). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Phage DNA synthesis and repair enzymes are better conserved and offer ‘safe havens’ and more constant targets for inteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Another explanation is the one proposed by Liu (58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Activity of mature DNA synthesis and repair enzymes can counteract the detrimental effects of gene homing by the inteins that were expressed with these enzymes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Broken genes are more likely to arise in phages and viruses relative to cellular organisms due to several reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>First, viral broken genes can function sub-optimally or even marginally at first, since the phages and viruses replicate within other cells that can complement suboptimal or missing protein functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Second, the very large progeny of viruses and phages allow accelerated evolution that eases the formation of novel gene combinations and features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Third, viruses and phages readily exchange gene and gene parts with their hosts and with each other (66). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>More specific to our case is the ubiquity of homing endonucleases in some phages [e.g. (67,68)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>All this, and enrichment of GOS dataset in viral sequences, lead us to propose that most if not all of homing-endonculease split-intein loci we found originated in phages and viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Some are probably still found in these type of organisms and other might have been transferred to cellular species. </plain></SENT>
