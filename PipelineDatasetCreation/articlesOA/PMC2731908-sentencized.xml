</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RNA turnover is an essential process associated with the regulation of gene expression in all organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria employ different principal mechanisms of RNA degradation and are equipped with different sets of ribonucleases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This can be exemplified by the fact that two essential RNases in the model bacterium E. coli, RNase E and oligoribonuclease (Orn), are absent in Bacillus subtilis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In E. coli, RNase E often initiates the degradation of mRNA endonucleolytically, which is followed by exonucleolytic degradation in a 3′ to 5′ direction catalyzed by several other enzymes (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These exonucleases are unable to complete the degradation of RNA due to their inability to degrade RNA in the size range of 2–5 nt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For example, the end products of degradation catalyzed by RNase II and RNase R were found to be 3- to 5-mers (2) or 4- to 6-mers (3,4) and 2- to 3-mers (2,5) or 1- to 2-mers (4), respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We had recently introduced the term ‘nanoRNA’ in order to distinguish these extremely short oligonucleotides from the longer microRNAs (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We had chosen the term nano in reference to its roots: Nano originates from the Greek word nanos, which means dwarf. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Micro on the other hand descends from the Greek word mikros, which means small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Nano is therefore used in this context simply to articulate ‘smaller than’ micro. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The fact that most exonucleases present in E. coli cannot complete the degradation of RNA gives importance to the only exoribonuclease capable of degrading nanoRNA: Orn (7–9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In B. subtilis, the situation is less well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here, RNase J1, an essential enzyme with no E. coli homolog, was originally identified as an endonuclease functionally analogous to E. coli RNase E, but was later shown to also have 5′–3′ exonuclease activity (10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In a previous attempt to find a functional analog of Orn in B. subtilis, we had identified YtqI (NrnA) as an enzyme that has nanoRNase activity in vitro and can complement an E. coli orn mutant when expressed at low levels (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This identification was done through the binding of NrnA to 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (pAp), exploiting the conserved strong interaction between pAp and oligoribonucleases, which was shown for Orn (E. coli) and the human homolog Sfn (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition to its nanoRNase activity, NrnA has pAp-phosphatase activity, as demonstrated by the ability to complement a mutation in the E. coli gene coding for pAp-phosphatase, cysQ and to degrade pAp to AMP in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this second activity of NrnA, the phenotype of a ytqI (nrnA) mutant in B. subtilis resembles that of an E. coli cysQ mutant, namely its growth in the absence of cysteine is impaired. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The non-essentiality of nrnA implied the existence of at least one more enzyme with an ability to degrade nanoRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that, unlike in E. coli, enzymes with nanoRNase activity are redundantly present in B. subtilis; in particular, we identify a protein of previously unknown function, YngD (now named NrnB), as a nanoRNase and we test the activity of YhaM and RNase J1 on nanoRNA. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to search for enzymes that allow B. subtilis to degrade nanoRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>We identify here one new nanoRNase, NrnB (previously YngD) and we tested nanoRNase activity of two known RNases, YhaM and RNase J1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>All three enzymes are able to degrade nanoRNA in vitro to various extents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>NrnB, however, is the only one of these three enzymes that allows full complementation of an E. coli orn mutant when expressed at low levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nanoRNA might not be the preferred or physiological substrate for YhaM or RNase J1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>YhaM </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that a genomic library clone (pBSL10) containing most of the CDS for YhaM was found among the clones complementing the E. coli orn mutant, when subcloned, yhaM could only partially complement this mutant, even when expressed from a high copy number plasmid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for this discrepancy that one could consider are: (i) the changed protein sequence of the protein expressed from pBSL10 (16 N-terminal amino acids replaced by 24 amino acids encoded by the vector) could affect substrate specificity of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>(ii) Expression of yhaL, another CDS present in pBSL10, might be necessary for YhaM in vivo in order to complement the orn mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis could not be tested as we were unable to obtain any viable clones coding for YhaM and YhaL (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The few clones that we obtained carried mutations and formed very small colonies suggesting that expression of those two genes together might be toxic in E. coli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>(iii) High expression levels of YhaM are necessary for complementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>We consider the latter explanation the most likely due to the fact that the library clone allowing complementation indeed showed very high expression levels of YhaM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>All other YhaM constructs did not allow detection of the expressed protein on a coomassie-stained protein gel due to its overlap with a strong band on the gel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The expression of his-tagged YhaM constructs that did not allow complementation was however detectable using Anti-His6 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the expression of other nanoRNases, NrnB and NrnA, in the absence of inducer was not detectable by Anti-His6 antibodies and yet allowed complementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>However, a note of caution is warranted due to the fact that direct comparison between protein levels of NrnB, NrnA and YhaM might not be possible as the his-tag of different proteins could react differently with the Anti-His6 antibody due to different accessibility of the epitope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Consequently we are left with some uncertainty concerning the amount of YhaM present in constructs that did not allow complementation and cannot completely exclude that nanoRNA is a physiological substrate for YhaM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The strong preference of DNA over RNA 5-mers that we observed in vitro could be another argument against nanoRNase being the main activity of YhaM in bacterial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In addition, this preference for DNA could point to a potential role of YhaM in DNA metabolism. yhaM is located in an operon containing yhaO, yhaN and yhaM that was identified as a part of the SOS LexA regulon in B. subtilis (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The LexA-binding site is located upstream of the promoter region of the operon preceding yhaO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>The corresponding sequence (aGAACgTgcaTTCG) differs in five positions from the consensus sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Global transcriptome analysis by microarrays shows that YhaO and YhaM are induced in a RecA-dependent manner when the SOS response is induced by mitomycin C or UV radiation (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Although the functions of YhaO and YhaN are unknown, YhaO is annotated as a member of the SbcD protein family containing metallophosphoesterases involved in DNA repair, recombination and replication (24) and YhaN contains a domain with homology to this protein family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Thus, both YhaO and YhaN likely play a role in DNA metabolism, and our enzymatic assays suggest that YhaM might as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, all three proteins were linked in an interaction network that connects DNA repair, recombination and replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Direct interaction between YhaM and DnaC, as well as between DnaG and YhaN was shown by yeast two hybrids screens (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>YhaO was linked indirectly through interaction with YhaN (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Altogether, this demonstrates that the role of YhaM in nucleic acid metabolism still needs to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>RNase J1 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Despite the in vitro activity of RNase J1 on nanoRNA, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not nanoRNA is a physiological substrate of this enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This is because expression of RNase J1 seems to be detrimental to growth in E. coli, at least in the orn mutant strain we used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>According to in vitro evidence (10,26), it is likely that RNase J1 degrades RNA completely and does not leave 2- to 5-mers in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>As this essential enzyme does have many other substrates (27), nanoRNA may not be a preferred substrate and therefore despite the ability of RNase J1 to finish degradation once started on a longer substrate, it might not pick up 2- to 5-mers that arise from incomplete degradation catalyzed by other enzymes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>NrnB </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>NrnB degrades nanoRNA 5-mers in vitro in a manganese- or cobalt-dependent 3′–5′ directed reaction and can complement an E. coli orn– mutant when expressed at low levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo evidence presented here allow annotation of NrnB as a nanoRNase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The large activity difference in favor of 5-mer as compared to 24-mer substrate implies that nanoRNA is a preferred substrate of NrnB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>After NrnA, NrnB is the second protein in B. subtilis that we have identified as a nanoRNase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We therefore proposed to rename YtqI and YngD as NrnA and NrnB, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Both proteins are members of the DHH/DHHA1 protein family of phosphoesterases, it is therefore likely that one can find other nanoRNases among the DHH proteins of unknown function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>As in the case of NrnA and NrnB, these proteins may differ in their substrate specificity: the substrate specificity of NrnA is not restricted to nanoRNA but extends to pAp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>We show here that this is not the case for NrnB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Although NrnA has a strong preference for 3-mers in vitro, NrnB does not show such a preference and has in fact lower activity on 3-mers than on 5-mers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Thus, the two nanoRNases present in B. subtilis have different but overlapping substrate specificities, which could add some functional redundancy and/or specialization in this organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the specific activity of NrnA on 5-mer C's is considerably lower in vitro than that of NrnB (0.2 pmol/μg/min versus 1 nmol/μg/min, respectively) [data extracted from ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>(6)], both enzymes are able to complement the E. coli orn mutant when expressed at low levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Due to the preference of NrnA for 3-mers, the difference between the specific activity of NrnA and NrnB is much smaller when considering activities on 3-mers (&lt;6-fold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, even with 3-mers, NrnB is more active than NrnA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that conditions for activity assays of NrnA were not optimal and therefore, direct comparison of specific activities of the two enzymes should not be over interpreted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Also, the fact that many bacterial species that do not carry Orn, have only NrnA and not NrnB supports the importance of NrnA as a nanoRNase under physiological conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>NrnB is present in a smaller number of genomes as compared to NrnA, and several of those species are closely related to B. subtilis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>However, we also found NrnB orthologs in ε-proteobacteria, namely Helicobacter sp. and Campylobacter sp. and in some Archaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, ε-proteobacteria possesses neither Orn- nor NrnA-orthologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>NrnB might therefore play a more important role in the degradation of nanoRNA in these organisms, although the simultaneous presence of RNase J1 homologs in these species might contribute as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous deletion of nrnA, nrnB and yhaM in B. subtilis has a minor effect, if any, on growth in complex medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This result could be interpreted in two ways: (i) RNase J1/J2 can take over this essential function in the absence of these three genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis cannot be tested easily due to essentiality of RNase J1 itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>(ii) Yet another protein exists in B. subtilis that has nanoRNase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>We cannot exclude this possibility, as our genomic library screen for the orn– complementing genes was not saturated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Candidates might be among the DHH proteins of unknown function in Bacillus: YorK and YybT, for example. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>With the identification of NrnA and NrnB, however, our work demonstrates that the degradation of nanoRNA catalyzed by a single protein Orn in E. coli is performed by redundant proteins in B. subtilis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>This is a remarkable example of xenologous gene replacement (28) in the case of coding for ubiquitous functions. </plain></SENT>
