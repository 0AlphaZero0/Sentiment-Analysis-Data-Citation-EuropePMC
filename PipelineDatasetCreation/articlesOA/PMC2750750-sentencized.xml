</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A Phase II, partially-blind randomized controlled study (blind to vaccine, not to schedule), of 19 months duration was conducted in two (2) centres in Ghana between August 2006 and May 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects were allocated randomly (1∶1∶1∶1∶1∶1) to one of six study groups at each study site, each defining which vaccine should be given and by which schedule (0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-months). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major cause of human suffering and represents an important economic burden to sub-Saharan African countries [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A safe and effective vaccine that prevents P. falciparum malaria would be an important addition to current control methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium), is formulated with proprietary Adjuvant Systems which enhance the ability of the vaccine to induce a strong immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The AS02 Adjuvant System contains an oil-in-water emulsion with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS21, a natural saponin molecule purified from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja saponaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The AS01 Adjuvant System is based on liposomes and contains the same amounts of MPL and QS21 as AS02. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both preclinical studies and field studies in adults have suggested that the AS01 formulation is more immunogenic than the AS02 formulation [3]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>AS01 and AS02 were initially developed as the adult formulations AS02A and AS01B (0.5 mL dose). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For compatibility with standard auto-disable Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) syringes, a 0.5 mL variant of the paediatric 0.25 mL dose of RTS,S/AS02A (RTS,S/AS02D) and of RTS,S/AS01B (RTS,S/AS01E) were developed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A large study with the paediatric dose (0.25 mL) of the adult formulation RTS,S/AS02A, conducted in Mozambican children aged 1–4 years, demonstrated the vaccine to have an acceptable safety profile and to be efficacious against clinical malaria (vaccine efficacy of 35%) and severe malaria disease (vaccine efficacy of 49%) over a period of 18 months [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, non-inferiority of the RTS,S/AS02D formulation compared to a paediatric dose of RTS,S/AS02A was demonstrated with respect to anti-circumsporozoite (CS) and anti-Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen (HBs) antibodies in children aged 3 to 5 years from Mozambique [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Both vaccines were shown to have a similar safety profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>More recently, a similar safety profile of RTS,S/AS02D and RTS,S/AS01E was demonstrated in children aged 18 months to 4 years in Gabon [8]; a trend towards better anti-CS and anti-HBs responses with RTS,S/AS01E was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Following administration of RTS,S/AS02D at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to infants in Tanzania, RTS,S/AS02D had a promising safety profile, met pre-specified non-inferiority seroconversion rates for co-administered EPI antigens, and reduced the incidence of malaria infection (vaccine efficacy 65% over 6 months) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In children aged 5 to 17 months in Kenya and Tanzania, proof-of-concept of the RTS,S/AS01E candidate vaccine was recently demonstrated in a trial in which vaccine efficacy against malaria disease was 53%, over an average follow up period of 8 months [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The trial reported here is one of several age de-escalation, Adjuvant System and schedule selection steps undertaken prior to the conduct of a phase 3 RTS,S trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The schedules under investigation were selected on the basis that they can be integrated into the existing EPI vaccination programme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Two or three vaccine doses one month apart (0,1- and 0,1,2-month schedule) could be administered together with two or three doses of DTP respectively, while a third delayed dose could be administered together with measles and yellow fever vaccines at 9 months of age (0,1,7-month schedule). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The trial was conducted at two study centres in Ghana: a collaboration between the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research (KCCR), Kumasi and the School of Medical Sciences (SMS), Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi hosted at the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital and the Kintampo Health Research Centre (KHRC), Ghana Health Service, Ministry of Health, Kintampo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The two centers are about 200 km away from each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The recruitment area for the KCCR/SMS center was the Agogo town, while a more rural population was recruited at KHRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Literacy rates are similar in both populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The main activity is farming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The main population groups around KHRC comprise people from the Bono and Mo tribes and there is a large population from northern Ghana that have permanently migrated into Kintampo District. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The study was overseen by a formally constituted Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) operating under a charter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The DSMB reviewed safety data from a RTS,S/AS trial in older children [8] prior to authorising the start of this study, and from a subset of children post dose 1 and post dose 2, prior to progression to the next vaccination dose within this trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A Local Safety Monitor was designated at each site whose overall role was to support the clinical investigator and to act as a link between the investigator and the DSMB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>At the KCCR/SMS a register of potentially eligible subjects was made from children attending the immunisation clinics in the town of Agogo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>KHRC has a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) in place that registers births, deaths and migrations to and from the area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The KHDSS was used to compile a list of potentially eligible children from an electronic database held at KHRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In both study sites information was distributed to parents/legally accepted representatives of potential participants through meetings organized in the community, followed by several steps of family and individual based information sessions, with supporting information material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Reinforcement and checking of understanding was done with the support of pre-established documents addressing frequently asked questions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The whole process happened in the potential participant's own language, in the presence of an impartial literate member of the potential participant's community if parents/legally accepted representatives could not read or write. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>The development of a safe, effective malaria vaccine accessible to those who need it most is a critical global public health priority [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>Evidence of immunogenicity, efficacy and a favourable safety profile of the RTS,S/AS02 candidate malaria vaccine has been demonstrated in adults [13]–[16] and subsequently in children and infants [7], [17]–[21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>Pre-clinical data suggested that the liposomal Adjuvant System formulation RTS,S/AS01 induces stronger immune responses as compared to RTS,S/AS02 [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>In healthy human adults RTS,S/AS01, as compared to RTS,S/AS02, induced higher levels of anti-CS antibodies and CS-specific CD4 positive helper T cells expressing markers of activation and/or effector cytokines, and a trend towards higher protection against infection following experimental sporozoite challenge [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>The good safety profile and high immunogenicity of the RTS,S/AS01 formulation was confirmed in malaria-exposed adults in Kenya [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>Recently completed trials have compared the paediatric formulations of the candidate vaccines RTS,S/AS02D and RTS,S/AS01E in children aged 18 months to 4 years from Gabon [8], assessed RTS,S/AS02D when coadministered with EPI antigens in infants from Tanzania [9] and established proof-of-concept of RTS,S/AS01E in children aged 5 to 17 months from Kenya and Tanzania [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>The trial reported here is the next in a series of age de-escalation steps towards the EPI age range, contributing to adjuvant and schedule selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="521" pm="."><plain>This study is the first comparative assessment of both candidate vaccines in young children aged 5 to 17 months and assessed three different vaccination schedules (0,1-, 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-months). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="522" pm="."><plain>Overall, both the RTS,S/AS02D and RTS,S/AS01E formulations were shown to have a good safety profile and were well tolerated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="524" pm="."><plain>In the RTS,S program to date 5315 doses of RTS,S/AS02 and 3149 doses of RTS,S/AS01 have been administered to 1864 and 1145 children under 6 years of age, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="525" pm="."><plain>Out of these one other case of simple febrile seizure related to vaccination has occurred [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="526" pm="."><plain>Post vaccination febrile seizures are a well described complication of vaccine-related fever [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="527" pm="."><plain>In the great majority of the cases, such as in these that have occurred in the RTS,S programme, it is benign, and resolves without sequelae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="528" pm="."><plain>Two cases of intussusception (one in a RTS,S/AS02D vaccinated child, one in a RTS,S/AS01E vaccinated child) were reported in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="529" pm="."><plain>Intussusception is a condition known to occur in this age group, including in Ghana, although precise incidence rates are unknown [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="530" pm="."><plain>No other case of intussusception has been described in the RTS,S program to date. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="531" pm="."><plain>The analysis of reactogenicity data indicated that although recipients of the malaria vaccine candidates reported more local and general symptoms than recipients of the rabies vaccine, grade 3 reactions were infrequent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="532" pm="."><plain>A trend towards less local reactogenicity in recipients of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine formulation as compared to RTS,S/AS02D recipients was found. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="533" pm="."><plain>In a previous study in children aged 18 months to 4 years from Gabon, both candidate vaccines were shown to have a good safety profile and to be well tolerated [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="534" pm="."><plain>In the study in Gabon, an increase in solicited local symptoms of pain and swelling at the injection site with subsequent doses of either vaccine was observed; this was not seen in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="535" pm="."><plain>More recently, the RTS,S/AS02D formulation coadministered to infants with other routinely delivered EPI immunisations, and RTS,S/AS01E administered to children aged 5 to 17 months from Kenya and Tanzania, had favourable safety profiles [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="536" pm="."><plain>Both candidate vaccines were highly immunogenic for anti-CS antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>Following two doses of either RTS,S/AS01E or RTS,S/AS02D, all subjects had seropositive levels of anti-CS antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>The peak anti-CS titres were higher than those observed in previous studies in children with RTS,S candidate vaccines [6], [7], [8], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>This may be related to the fact that in this study all children had been previously immunised against hepatitis B. Indeed, it has previously been observed that prior HBV vaccination appears to promote the immune response to both HBs and CS antigen components of RTS,S/AS02 and RTS,S/AS01 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>Such high anti-CS and –HBs titres were also observed following administration of RTS,S/AS01E to young children previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine in another study [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>The antibody response to the CS protein is believed to be an important component or marker of protective immunity although, to date, no protective threshold of CS antibody response has been determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>Future studies with the RTS,S candidate vaccines will investigate the priming effect of a neonatal dose of hepatitis B vaccine on the evolution of CS titres induced by the malaria vaccine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="544" pm="."><plain>Recipients of RTS,S/AS01E consistently had higher peak anti-CS responses compared to recipients of RTS,S/AS02D, irrespective of vaccination schedule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>Although responses in subjects who received just 2 doses (i.e. 0,1-month schedule) were high, the decline from peak GMTs was more important than in subjects on a 3 dose regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>Anti-CS titres were higher at month 10 in children on the 0,1,7-month schedule as compared to the 0,1,2-month schedule, for both RTS,S vaccine groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>At month 19 this was still apparent in children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS02D but in children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E they were similar. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to estimate antibody response over the whole timeframe of the study, while acknowledging the variation in the responses over time, AUCs standardised over time were evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>The evaluation over the whole study duration (AUC19) showed that mean responses with the RTS,S/AS01E formulation were similar for both the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month schedules, which were higher than those seen with the two doses schedule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>Although the anti-CS response following two doses was high, the peak, AUC7 and AUC19 in the 0,1,2-month schedules were higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>A two doses schedule is therefore probably not optimal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>Peak responses for anti-CS GMTs were observed in the 0,1,2-month schedules, which was an unexpected result as, in line with licensed Hepatitis B vaccine schedules, trials with a hepatitis B vaccine have shown that increasing the interval between the second and third dose enhances humoral response [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the highest peak responses for anti-HBs GMTs were observed in the 0,1,7-month schedules as compared to the 0,1,2-month schedule when considering the peak (one month post last dose) responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>It is not clear why the delayed third dose is associated with a marked increase in HBs response but not CS response and will need to be investigated further in delayed booster studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed the previously demonstrated high immunogenicity of RTS,S based vaccines for anti-HBs antibodies, and that this is true also in subjects primed with hepatitis B vaccine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>In two similar Ghanaian populations, antibody responses were high though there was some variability between the two centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>Slightly higher antibody levels were found in KHRC participants, as compared to KCCR/SMS participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>Some variability magnitude of anti CS response between centers has previously been observed and the precise source of this heterogeneity is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>Future multicenter Phase 3 RTS,S studies will further characterize heterogeneity in vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in different geographical locations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>This trial demonstrated that both formulations of the candidate malaria vaccines, RTS,S/AS01E and RTS,S/AS02D, were well tolerated and highly immunogenic for anti-CS and anti-HBs antibodies in young children aged 5–17 months living in a malaria-endemic area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>RTS,S based vaccines were well tolerated in children having previously received a full course of anti-HBs vaccine in infancy as part of EPI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>The RTS,S/AS01E formulation showed a trend towards less local reactogenicity and demonstrated higher immunogenicity for anti-CS antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>The 3 dose schedules were more immunogenic than 2 dose schedules with AUC analyses for anti-CS antibody levels and were comparable between the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01E schedules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study supports further evaluation of the RTS,S/AS01E candidate vaccine with both 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month schedules in infants, and when co-administered with standard EPI antigens. </plain></SENT>
