The regulation of Gb3 is important to prevent tissue damage causing shiga like toxin. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been studied as anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic, and anti-viral activities, and anti-diabetic. However, little is known between the expressions of Gb3 on IECs. The aim of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of EGCG, a major ingredient of green tea, on Gb3 production via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) in the TNF-&#x003b1; stimulated human colon epithelial cells, HT29. To investigate how Gb3 is regulated, ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT), lactosylceramide synthase (GalT2), and Gb3 synthase (GalT6) were analyzed by RT-PCR in HT 29 cells exposed to TNF-&#x003b1; in the presence or absence of EGCG. EGCG dose-dependently manner, inhibits TNF-&#x003b1; induced Gb3 expression by blocking in both the MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in HT29 cells. TNF-&#x003b1; enhanced CGT, GalT2 and GalT6 mRNA levels and EGCG suppressed the level of these enzymes enhanced by TNF-&#x003b1; treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epigallocatechin gallate</kwd><kwd>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</kwd><kwd>NF-kappa B</kwd><kwd>globotriaosylceramide</kwd><kwd>Enterocytes</kwd><kwd>Intestinal Mucosa</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can cause a range of illnesses from self-limiting watery diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis to severe conditions such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Stx binds to cell-surface glycosphingolipids, terminating in galactose-&#x003b1;1,4-galactose, whereupon the complex is internalized, with resultant inhibition of peptide elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The major glycosphingolipid that binds Stx is galactose-&#x003b1;1,4-galactose-&#x003b2;1,4-glucose ceramide (globotriaosylceramide: Gb3) in the case of Stx-1 and Stx-2, and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4) for Stx-2e. These toxins are structurally similar heterodimers composed of one enzymatically active A subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis by means of its N-glycosidase activity on ribosomal subunit and B subunit pentamer that binds Gb3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major ingredient of green tea, has been known to have a variety of physiological functions, such as anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic, anti-viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and anti-bacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recently, others and we have showed that EGCG suppresses mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), and NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and lipooxygenase and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and arrest the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) in tumor cells.</p><p>Differentiated intestinal epithelial cells express Gb3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and are sensitive to toxin-mediated cytotoxicity. Stx produced in the intestine can be translocated to the bloodstream without cellular damage and can reach renal endothelial cells causing HUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Several studies support the idea that Stx is important in the pathogenesis of bloody diarrhea that is caused by damage of the intestinal epithelium. And recent study has also demonstrated that invasion of the intestine in vivo or of intestinal cells in vitro by Stx produces augmented release of intestinal cytokines including IL-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-4, and IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines may be important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diarrheal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Especially, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 have been known to be important cytokines to induce Gb3 and we here confirmed that TNF-&#x003b1; increases Gb3 synthesis through the upregulation of ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT), lactosylceramide synthase (GalT2), and Gb3 synthase (GalT6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether EGCG can suppress TNF-&#x003b1; induced Gb3 production, and EGCG has the potential to modulate Gb3 production through MAPKs (p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, and ERK1/2), NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and transcription of Gb3 synthesis enzymes in human colon epithelial HT29 cells. To accomplish this, we exposed intestinal cell lines to EGCG in vitro and analyzed the expression of Gb3. We found that EGCG inhibits TNF-&#x003b1; induced Gb3 synthesis by interfering with the MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in HT29 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>A HT29 cell line was obtained from Korean Collection of Cell Cultures (Seoul, Korea). HT29 cells were grown in RPMI Medium 1640 (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A.) supplemented with-glutamine, 25 mmol/L of HEPES buffer, and sodium bicarbonate containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin sulfate, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. The cells were incubated in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#x02103;. EGCG was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO (0.01%), used as vehicle alone, did not affect HT29 cells. Recombinant human TNF-&#x003b1; (R&#x00026;D Systems Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.) was used as a stimulator of HT29 cells. For all the studies carried out, cells were seeded at a low density (5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) in 12 well or 100 mm dishes. The cells were allowed to attach overnight and rendered quiescent through removal of feeding medium and its subsequent replacement with a serum-free medium 24 hr before the addition of experimental media. And after the treatment of EGCG, the media was changed daily to maintain the EGCG effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis assay</title><p>Annexin V/PI staining was used to evaluate the survival of the HT29 cells. Following specified treatments, the cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;L of annexin binding buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Then, 5 &#x000b5;L of annexin V-FITC conjugate (Biosource International, Ridlington, Oxford, U.K.) and 2 &#x000b5;L of propidium iodide (1 mg/mL) were added, and this suspension was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were then further diluted with 400 &#x000b5;L of annexin binding buffer. The cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.). All of the annexin V-positive cells were considered apoptotic (early and late), and their percentage among the total number of cells was calculated. PI<sup>+</sup> Annexin V<sup>-</sup> cells were considered necrotic.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis</title><p>The pure Stx-IB subunit was dialyzed in a 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 hr. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was added to 50 &#x000b5;g/mg of the B subunit. The complexes were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The unreacted FITC was removed by a process of gel filtration (Sephadex G25). After 24 hr, the culture in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% FBS, HT29 cells were incubated with 0.5 &#x000b5;L of Stx-IB-FITC on ice for 30 min.

The total RNA (2 &#x000b5;g) was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase at 37&#x02103; for 90 min using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, NJ, U.S.A.). The PCR profile included a 94&#x02103; denaturalization for 5 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturalization at 94&#x02103; for 30 sec, annealing at 50&#x02103; for 30 sec, extension at 72&#x02103; for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72&#x02103; for 10 min. The primers used in this study were as follows: for &#x003b2;-actin (GenBank accession no. NM001101), forward primer 5'-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGC-3'and reverse primer 5'-GCCAGTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3', 251 bps, which yields a product size of 274 bps; for ceramide glucosyltransferase (GenBank accession no.

We experimented the effect of EGCG and TNF-&#x003b1; to prove whether Gb3 inhibition by EGCG is associated with cell apoptosis in cultured HT29 cells. Subconfluent dishes of HT29 cells were treated with EGCG (25 &#x000b5;M), TNF-&#x003b1; (50 ng/mL) and EGCG with TNF-&#x003b1; for 48 hr, and apoptosis was measured by FACS.

The HT29 cells were pretreated with four doses of EGCG (10, 25, and 50 &#x000b5;M) for 2 hr and then stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1; for 2 days, and Gb3 expression was examined by FACS. Gb3 induction was derived by TNF-&#x003b1; (50 ng/mL) and significantly decreased in cells treated with EGCG 25 and 50 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

Each of the three enzymes involved in Gb3 synthesis (CGT, GalT2, and GalT6), as well as the enzyme involved in Gb3 degradation (&#x003b1;-galactosidase), was evaluated. This set of experiments investigated the mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;-stimulated Gb3 expression in HT29 cells. CGT, GalT2, and GalT6 mRNA in-EGCG (25 &#x000b5;M) pretreated HT29 cells were analyzed by RT-PCR.

We have demonstrated here that the incubation of HT29 cells with TNF-&#x003b1; markedly enhances the Gb3 contents in the cells.</p><p>The effects of EGCG on the activation of MAPK members in selected cell lines have also been reported. It was shown that treatment with EGCG inhibited the ultraviolet-B-induced activation of p38-MAPK in the human keratinocyte cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), whereas other studies showed have shown that EGCG activated all three MAPK families including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), JNK, and p38 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In vascular smooth muscle cells, EGCG inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor-&#x003b2;-induced activation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition, EGCG selectively inhibited the interleukin-1&#x003b2;-induced activation of JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK, in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, it appears that the MAPK-activating or inhibitory effects of EGCG may be stimulus- and/or cell type-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>EGCG has been studied to make use of its biological effects including anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and anti-bacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Interestingly, EGCG has the potency to inhibit production and/or release of Stx from EHEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In this study, we examined the effect of EGCG on Gb3 production and its mechanism of action in regulating the MAPKs and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in HT29 cells. We observed that the pretreatment of EGCG resulted in the inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated MAPK phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>Also, TNF-&#x003b1; has been known to increase the transcription of CGT and GalT2,6 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) that are related to the Gb3 production pathway in eukaryotic cells. The promoters of these three enzymes contain an NF-&#x003ba;B-recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). EGCG also decreased the enzymes related to the Gb3 synthesis pathway via the transcription level regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Based on our results, we proposed a hypothetical scheme explaining EGCG actions on Gb3 production in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, our data clearly indicates that EGCG inhibits TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated Gb3 synthesis by blocking both the MAPKs and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathways in HT29 cells. Thus, it is plausible to propose that EGCG regulates the Gb3 expression of host colonic cells in situ and that consumption of EGCG may alter the interaction of Stx family toxins with the mucosa and reduce disease expression in humans, especially during seasonal food-poisoning periods.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We express our thanks to Dr. James L.
