<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stx binds to cell-surface glycosphingolipids, terminating in galactose-α1,4-galactose, whereupon the complex is internalized, with resultant inhibition of peptide elongation (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The major glycosphingolipid that binds Stx is galactose-α1,4-galactose-β1,4-glucose ceramide (globotriaosylceramide: Gb3) in the case of Stx-1 and Stx-2, and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4) for Stx-2e. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These toxins are structurally similar heterodimers composed of one enzymatically active A subunit (4) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis by means of its N-glycosidase activity on ribosomal subunit and B subunit pentamer that binds Gb3 (5, 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Stx produced in the intestine can be translocated to the bloodstream without cellular damage and can reach renal endothelial cells causing HUS (17, 18). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Especially, TNF-α and IL-1 have been known to be important cytokines to induce Gb3 and we here confirmed that TNF-α increases Gb3 synthesis through the upregulation of ceramide glucosyltransferase (CGT), lactosylceramide synthase (GalT2), and Gb3 synthase (GalT6) (23-26). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>And during the development of HUS, Stx may work cooperate with LPS and the LPS-induced cytokines TNF-α and IL-1 to damage vascular endothelial cells and intestinal epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that TNF-α, IL-1β, and bacterial LPS require 24 to 48 hr to maximally sensitize endothelial cells to the Stx, but intestinal glycoconjugates have not been clearly demonstrated to be involved in Gb3 induction by these cytokines or LPS (25, 26). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, our first set of experiments was designed to confirm that the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α can induce Gb3 production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated here that the incubation of HT29 cells with TNF-α markedly enhances the Gb3 contents in the cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The effects of EGCG on the activation of MAPK members in selected cell lines have also been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It was shown that treatment with EGCG inhibited the ultraviolet-B-induced activation of p38-MAPK in the human keratinocyte cell line (29), whereas other studies showed have shown that EGCG activated all three MAPK families including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), JNK, and p38 in HeLa cells (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In vascular smooth muscle cells, EGCG inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor-β-induced activation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In addition, EGCG selectively inhibited the interleukin-1β-induced activation of JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK, in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that the MAPK-activating or inhibitory effects of EGCG may be stimulus- and/or cell type-dependent (13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>EGCG has been studied to make use of its biological effects including anti-oxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-cancer (7-9), and anti-bacterial activities (10-12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, EGCG has the potency to inhibit production and/or release of Stx from EHEC cells (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of EGCG on Gb3 production and its mechanism of action in regulating the MAPKs and NF-κB pathways in HT29 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>We observed that the pretreatment of EGCG resulted in the inhibition of TNF-α-mediated MAPK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Also, TNF-α has been known to increase the transcription of CGT and GalT2,6 enzymes (23) that are related to the Gb3 production pathway in eukaryotic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The promoters of these three enzymes contain an NF-κB-recognition site (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>EGCG also decreased the enzymes related to the Gb3 synthesis pathway via the transcription level regulation of NF-κB activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we proposed a hypothetical scheme explaining EGCG actions on Gb3 production in Fig. 8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data clearly indicates that EGCG inhibits TNF-α-mediated Gb3 synthesis by blocking both the MAPKs and the NF-κB pathways in HT29 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is plausible to propose that EGCG regulates the Gb3 expression of host colonic cells in situ and that consumption of EGCG may alter the interaction of Stx family toxins with the mucosa and reduce disease expression in humans, especially during seasonal food-poisoning periods. </plain></SENT>
