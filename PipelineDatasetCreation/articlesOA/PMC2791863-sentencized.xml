<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although major progress has recently been made in understanding the functions of the viral replication proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and auxiliary replication proteins, the contribution of host proteins is poorly documented [1],[2],[3],[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide screens to identify host factors affecting (+)RNA virus infections, such as Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), West Nile virus and Droshophila virus C, in yeast and animal model hosts led to the identification of host proteins including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, RNA-modifying enzymes, proteins of lipid biosynthesis and others [2],[3],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The functions of the majority of the identified host proteins in (+)RNA virus replication have not been fully revealed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>TBSV is a small (+)RNA virus that infects a wide range of host plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TBSV has recently emerged as a model virus to study virus replication, recombination, and virus - host interactions due to the development of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host [10],[11],[12],[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Systematic genome-wide screens covering 95% of yeast genes have led to the identification of over 100 host genes that affected either TBSV replication or recombination [5],[7],[14],[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Moreover, proteomics analysis of the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex revealed the presence of the two viral replication proteins (i.e., p33 and p92pol) and 6–10 host proteins in the replicase complex [16],[17],[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These host proteins have been shown to bind to the viral RNA and the viral replication proteins [1],[17],[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The auxiliary p33 replication protein has been shown to recruit the TBSV (+)RNA to the site of replication, which is the cytosolic surface of peroxisomal membranes [20],[21],[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The RdRp protein p92pol binds to the essential p33 replication protein that is required for assembling the functional replicase complex [12],[22],[23],[24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide screens for host factors affecting TBSV replication in yeast [5],[7] has led to the identification of seven ESCRT proteins involved in multivesicular body (MVB)/endosome pathway [25],[26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The identified host proteins included Vps23p and Vps28p (ESCRT-I complex), Snf7p and Vps24p (ESCRT-III complex); Doa4p ubiquitin isopeptidase, Did2p having Doa4p-related function; and Vps4p AAA-type ATPase [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The identification of ESCRT proteins supports the idea that tombusvirus replication could depend on hijacking of ESCRT proteins, thus promoting efforts to test their roles in TBSV replication in this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of ESCRT proteins for TBSV replication might facilitate the assembly of the replicase complex, including the formation of TBSV-induced spherules and vesicles in infected cells [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Induction of membranous spherule-like replication structures in infected cells might be common for many plus-stranded RNA viruses [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The endosome pathway is a major protein-sorting pathway in eukaryotic cells, which down- regulates plasma membrane proteins via endocytosis; and sorts newly synthesized membrane proteins from trans-Golgi vesicles to the endosome, lysosome or the plasma membrane [29],[30],[31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The ESCRT proteins in particular have a major role in sorting of cargo proteins from the endosomal limiting membrane to the lumen via membrane invagination and vesicle formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Defects in the MVB pathway can cause serious diseases, including cancer, defect in growth control and early embryonic lethality [29],[30],[31],[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In addition, various viruses, such as enveloped retroviruses (HIV), (+) and (−)RNA viruses (such as filo-, arena-, rhabdo and paramyxoviruses) usurp the MVB pathway by redirecting ESCRT proteins to the plasma membrane, leading to budding and fission of the viral particles from infected cells [25],[26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The first step in the endosome pathway is the monoubiquitination of cargo proteins, which serves as a signal for proteins to be sorted into membrane microdomains of late endosomes [30],[31],[32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitinated cargo protein is bound by Vps27p (Hrs protein in mammals), which in turn recruits Vps23-containing ESCRT-I complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Then, the ESCRT-I-complex recruits ESCRT-II complex, which in turn recruits the large ESCRT-III complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The proposed role of the ESCRT-III complex is grouping the cargo proteins together in the limiting membranes of late endosomes and deforming the membranes that leads to membrane invagination into the lumen [33],[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Then, Vps4p recycles the ESCRT proteins, whereas Doa4p recycles the ubiquitin, leading to budding of multiple small vesicles into the lumen of endosome and to MVB formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Fusion of the limiting membrane of MVB with the lysosome/vacuole will release the lipid/protein content of MVB into the lysosome, or alternatively, by fusing to the plasma membrane (exocytosis), it releases its content outside the cell [30],[31],[32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we show that ESCRT proteins previously identified in a genome-wide screen in yeast for affecting TBSV replication are involved in tombusvirus replication in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that Vps23p, which is a key ESCRT-I adaptor protein recognizing ubiquitinated cargo proteins, and Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein bind to the TBSV p33 replication protein, which could be critical for p33 replication protein to recruit Vps23p and Bro1p, allowing TBSV to usurp additional ESCRT proteins for replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We also show that functional ESCRT proteins are needed for optimal replicase activity and protection of the viral RNA template within the tombusvirus replicase from a ribonuclease in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the model that TBSV co-opts ESCRT proteins for its replication. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We have found that co-expression of CNV with AtVPS4(K178A) in N. benthamiana leaves led to dramatic inhibition of CNV gRNA replication in the infiltrated leaves (down to 4%, Fig. 1B, lanes 5–6), whereas expression of the wt AtVPS4 in N. benthamiana inhibited CNV RNA accumulation only by 21% (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–4). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>We also show that the recruitment of the ESCRT factors for virus replication is likely driven by interaction between the auxiliary p33 replication cofactor and Vps23p ESCRT-I protein and Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Tsg101 and Alix play redundant roles in this process [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>HIV gag protein also interacts with Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that could complement Tsg101 or Alix during HIV budding [42]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ESCRT machinery is also recruited for cell division to separate the daughter cells from the mother cells through the process of cytokinesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these cellular processes, such as MVB biogenesis, cytokinesis and HIV virion budding as well as the spherule formation during the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, are based on topologically similar membrane invaginations (membrane deformation occurring away from the cytosol). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Co-opting ESCRT proteins for these processes could be critical, since Snf7p and other ESCRT-III proteins have been shown to be involved in membrane deformation in vivo and in vitro as well [33],[34]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Another novel feature is that Vps23p, in the presence of p33 replication co-factor, is shown to re-localize temporarily to the peroxisomal membrane, which represents the place of tombusvirus replicase assembly [20],[22],[27] (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>After brief recruitment, Vps23p seems to be released from the replicase, because we did not find Vps23p in the highly-purified functional replicase complex [17] and it was not co-localized with a peroxisomal marker at latter time points after induction of p33 expression (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The relatively weak interaction between Vps23p and p33 as well as the low percentage of ubiquitinated p33 [18] could be useful during virus replication to optimize the number of Vps23p recruited into each replicase complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Indeed, based on replicases of other plus-strand RNA viruses [28], it is predicted that 100-to-200 p33 molecules are likely needed for the formation of a single replicase complex, whereas only a few Vps23p molecules should be recruited temporarily for each replicase complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is likely that Vsp23p and Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p could play complementary roles in recruiting additional ESCRT factors as shown in case of HIV gag for virion budding [33],[34]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We found that the viral (−)repRNA within the replicase complex obtained from vps23Δ yeast was more sensitive to RNase treatment than the replicase preparation obtained from wt yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Thus, similar to vps24Δ yeast discussed above, the viral replicase, which is located inside the spherules, assembles less precisely in vps23Δ than in wt yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data are compatible with the model that p33 - Vps23p interaction could be important during the replicase assembly process and/or affect the structure of the replicase complexes, which could determine the accessibility of the repRNA to RNases during replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of VPS23 deletion (Fig. 3) or over-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Vps23 homologue in N. benthamiana plants (Fig. 1) was not as detrimental to virus replication as deletion of ESCRT-III or VPS4 in yeast or over-expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III or Vps4p homologues in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the redundant roles likely played by Vps23p, Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p in recruitment of ESCRT-III/Vps4p factors, based on the similar redundancy documented for subversion of ESCRT-III/Vps4p by HIV gag's interaction with Tsg101/Alix/Nedd4 [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Also, we do not know if the dominant negative mutants were able to block completely the function of every VPS23 gene, since the number of VPS23 genes is yet not known in N. benthamiana. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the most important aspect of recruitment of Vps23p and Bro1p for tombusvirus replication is the possibility to co-opt additional ESCRT proteins, including the ESCRT-III factors and Vps4p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the in vitro activity of the tombusvirus replicase is 3-5-fold lower when obtained from plants expressing dominant negative ESCRT-III/Vps4p (Fig. 2) or from vps24Δ, snf7Δ, or vps4Δ yeast strains (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Since the ESCRT-III factors are involved in grouping the cargo proteins together in the membrane and they have been shown to deform the membrane [33],[34], we propose that these proteins could be useful to affect the formation/structures of the spherules for virus RNA replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Indeed, TBSV replication induces the formation of spherules (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>S1) [27], which are topologically related to multivesicular bodies (MVB), since both require membrane invagination into the lumen, away from the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>This is opposite to the regular intracellular vesicle formation, which buds into the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Collectively, usurping a partial set of ESCRT factors by tombusvirus replication proteins might facilitate the optimal formation of active viral replicase complexes within the membranous spherules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recruitment of Vps4p AAA ATPase [25],[35], could help re-cycling of the ESCRT factors from the replicase after the assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that the expression of dominant negative mutants of Vps24p and Snf7p ESCRT-III or Vps4p factors inhibit tombusvirus replication in plants by interfering with the proper assembly of the replicase complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the (−)repRNA located within the viral replicase complex became more accessible to targeted ribonuclease cleavage when the replicase was assembled in the presence of dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants in plant leaves (Fig. 4B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Based on the data presented here, we propose that the ESCRT machinery is recruited for tombusvirus replication in a unique way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The first step in recruitment of Vps23p is the ubiquitination of small percentage of p33 (Ub-p33) (Fig. 8, step 1) [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Then, the ubiquitinated p33 (Ub-p33) binds to the adaptor protein Vps23p (step 2) or to Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein, followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7p and Vps24p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The ESCRT-III proteins could then help the optimal assembly of the replicase complex, facilitate the grouping of p33 molecules together in the membrane and/or promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membrane (membrane invagination) (step 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Then, Doa4p deubiquitination enzyme is predicted to remove ubiquitin from Ub-p33, whereas Vps4p AAA ATPase could recycle the ESCRT proteins (step 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Altogether, we suggest that these events could promote the optimal and precise assembly of the TBSV replicase complex, resulting in TBSV RNA replication, including (−) and (+)RNA syntheses, in a protected microenvironment and then the regulated release of the progeny (+)RNAs into the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the precisely assembled replicase complex provides protection from recognition by the host defense surveillance system and/or viral RNA destruction by the gene silencing/RNAi machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Similar events might also take place in case of other (+)RNA viruses, which are also known to deform membranes and/or form spherules during replication. </plain></SENT>
