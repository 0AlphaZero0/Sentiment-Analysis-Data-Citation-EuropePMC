</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is one of the most widely used molecules for studying diverse evolutionary processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrial genomes of most animal species are maternally inherited, encode the same set of genes, and mutate at rates ∼10 times higher than nuclear DNA (Lightowlers et al. 1997; Baer et al. 2007; Gissi et al. 2008)—these features have made mtDNA a favorite target for numerous phylogenetic studies of closely related species and within-species analyses at the population level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A segment of the cytochrome oxidase I mtDNA protein-coding gene was selected by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life to serve as the focal “barcode” DNA region for global species identification (Savolainen et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>mtDNA mutations also underlie many mitochondrial myopathies in humans and have been associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Howell et al. 2005; Wallace 2005; Biskup and Moore 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Large heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions are observed to accumulate to high levels in aging somatic tissue from a variety of animal species from humans to Caenorhabditis elegans (Holt et al. 1988; Melov et al. 1994; Arai et al. 2003) and are implicated as potential causative agents in the degenerative aging process (Barazzoni et al. 2000; Wei and Lee 2002; Biskup and Moore 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These large deletion events are usually associated with flanking direct repeat sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In nematodes, repeat-associated deletions have been attributed to intragenomic recombination events (Lunt and Hyman 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Electron transport chain dysfunction associated with deletions involving mtDNA protein-coding genes is thought to be a major underlying cause of the degenerative phenotypes associated with aging, mitochondrial myopathies, and other human disorders (Conley et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Between- and within-species variation in the rate and spectrum of mitochondrial genome mutations has the potential to confound evolutionary analyses where the mitochondrial mutation process is presumed to be constant (Baer et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, extensive mtDNA mutational variation in humans has the potential to render some individuals or lineages more susceptible to mitochondrial disease and earlier onset of degenerative aging-related phenotypes than others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge on mitochondrial mutational variation has increased over the last decade with the analysis of mtDNA from model organism mutation-accumulation (MA) line experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In MA line studies, organisms are bottlenecked to one (for self-fertile species) or two (for obligate outcrossing species) individuals across many generations to allow for the essentially neutral accumulation of mutations over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Results from C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster MA experiments (Denver et al. 2000; Haag-Liautard et al. 2008) revealed highly similar per-generation mtDNA mutation rate estimates but different base substitution mutation spectra. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, between-species mtDNA mutation pattern variation became evident (Montooth and Rand 2008) with results from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae MA experiment (Lynch et al. 2008) and an analysis of mtDNA mutator mice (Stewart et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Although these combined studies have provided an important step in understanding between-species mtDNA mutational variation, the model organisms used in these studies are all very distantly related from one another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The extent to which mtDNA mutation processes vary between more closely related species and within species remains enigmatic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The mtDNA mutation process is a complicated one in that many mitochondrial genomes are present inside an individual mitochondrion and many mitochondria are present inside an individual cell (Upholt and Dawid 1977; Rand 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Thus, a mitochondrial mutation originates on a single mtDNA molecule and then must traverse a complex path of heteroplasmy (condition where more than one nucleotide sequence is present at a given site in the pool of mitochondrial genomes within an individual) to become a fixed difference between species or between individuals within a species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>mtDNA heteroplasmy has proven a difficult challenge in a variety of contexts, from diagnosing the conditions under which mitochondrial disorder symptoms are manifested (Wong 2007) to its complicating effects on molecular evolutionary and ecological studies (White et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In mammals, mtDNA sequence variants are observed to turn over rapidly between generations despite the high mtDNA copy number in the oocyte, leading to the interpretation that there is a very narrow “mtDNA bottleneck” in the female germ line (Jenuth et al. 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The extent to which the mtDNA bottleneck width varies in different species, however, remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Although most naturally occurring gene function–disrupting mtDNA deletions that have been studied occur as nonheritable and sporadic somatic events (Chinnery et al. 2004), Caenorhabditis briggsae natural populations are known to suffer varying levels of a large, heteroplasmic, and heritable deletion of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) protein-coding gene (Howe and Denver 2008)—the deletion is associated with 21-bp direct repeats, one copy in the ND5 gene itself and the second ∼880 bp upstream in a pseudogene region named ΨND5-2. Howe and Denver (2008) showed that different C. briggsae natural isolates harbor varying levels of this ΨND5-2/ND5 boundary deletion, ranging from 0% to ∼50% of the total mtDNA pool within an individual L1 larval-stage nematode, and that there was a significant negative correlation between isolate-specific ND5 deletion level and lifetime fecundity, suggesting that the deletion has a negative impact on C. briggsae fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, certain C. briggsae natural isolates were discovered to have fixed ΨND5-2 direct repeat substitutions that result in imperfect matches to the downstream ND5 repeat and are associated with reduced ND5 deletion levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The unusual ND5 deletion dynamics observed in C. briggsae populations suggests that mtDNA mutation processes might differ between this species and its congener C. elegans in which no mtDNA pseudogenes or associated deletion events have been observed in mitogenomic analyses of natural isolates (Denver et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterize the mtDNA mutational spectrum of two sets of C. briggsae MA lines—one set derived from natural isolate HK104 from Okayama, Japan, and the second set derived from natural isolate PB800 from Ohio, United States—that were previously shown to experience significantly higher per-generation rates of fitness decline and higher rates of mutation at nuclear microsatellite loci as compared with C. elegans MA lines (Baer et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We observed substantial mtDNA mutational differences between C. briggsae and its congener C. elegans, providing evidence that mtDNA mutation processes can vary between related animal species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>For homopolymer loci changes at smaller (6–10 bp) runs, mutations were defined as fixed if a clean chromatogram resulted from the sequencing reaction that clearly showed uniform evidence of the homopolymer mutation—that is, no “stutter” sequence after the homopolymer in the chromatogram. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>To investigate mtDNA mutational variation in Caenorhabditis, we sequenced nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from a set of 250-generation C. briggsae MA lines: 21 MA lines derived from natural isolate HK104 (Okayama, Japan) and 18 MA lines derived from natural isolate PB800 (Dayton, OH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with a previous mtDNA analysis of 214-generation C. elegans N2 (laboratory strain) MA lines (Denver et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the HK104 MA lines, 13,900 bp of sequence was collected; in the PB800 MA lines, 13,894 bp was collected (entire mitochondrial genomes except the AT region for both sets). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Although these two isolates have very different geographic origins, a previous analysis of natural mtDNA variation in C. briggsae (Howe and Denver 2008) showed that they are closely related to one another at the mtDNA level (0.4% pairwise mtDNA sequence divergence). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>mtDNA was PCR amplified in each MA line (products ranging in size from ∼2,800 to ∼4,900 bp) and then directly sequenced using PCR and internal primers (see Materials and Methods)—the same strategy employed for a previous analysis of C. briggsae natural isolate mtDNA variation (Howe and Denver 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This strategy was also highly similar to the previous analysis of C. elegans MA line mtDNA mutation (Denver et al. 2000), though in the C. elegans study more overlapping individual PCR products of smaller size (19 amplicons, 821 bp average size) were generated for the analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Sequence differences between progenitor and MA line mtDNA were identified in DNA sequence alignments and by evaluating DNA sequence chromatogram data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Heteroplasmy was found to be a significant variable in our analysis, requiring the establishment of careful criteria for subcategorizing different mutation types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>mtDNA mutations originating along a specific MA line lineage might still be in a heteroplasmic state at the particular generation analyzed or be a fixed difference (no heteroplasmy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>There is also the possibility that preexisting heteroplasmies in the progenitor strain, or their origination in the expansion phase leading up the establishment of MA lines, might differentially segregate in different MA lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Our approaches to distinguishing fixed-difference mutations from heteroplasmic changes for different mutation types are described in the Materials and Methods. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>We identified large mtDNA deletion mutations in the C. briggsae MA lines through visual analysis of PCR amplicons on agarose gels and subsequent direct DNA sequencing analysis of PCR amplicons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Where possible, we confirmed that the deletions were in a heteroplasmic state, though it is likely that all of them are heteroplasmic because in nematodes such deletions have never been observed to accumulate to &gt;60% levels (Liau et al. 2007; Howe and Denver 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Although the two C. briggsae natural genotypes used as the MA line progenitors showed only 0.4% pairwise sequence divergence across all mtDNA sequences, the MA line progenitors differed dramatically in terms of starting ΨND5-2/ND5 boundary deletion levels: the inbred HK104 progenitor produced a PCR result suggesting high (∼30–50%) ΨND5-2/ND5 deletion levels, whereas analysis of the inbred PB800 progenitor revealed much lower (∼0–5%) deletion levels (Howe and Denver 2008)—see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig.

<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In the HK104 MA lines, multiple different specific base substitution types were observed, 4/9 were in a heteroplasmic state, all substitutions were at different sites in the mitochondrial genome, and all occurred in different specific MA lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Thus, each of these nine differences most likely constitutes de novo mutation events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent base substitution type in the HK104 MA lines was G:C → T:A transversions (3/9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 10/10 base substitution polymorphisms observed in the PB800 MA lines were C:G → T:A transitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the 10 PB800 substitution differences were observed across only 5 nucleotide sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>At position 7549, two PB800 MA lines were observed to carry fixed substitutions and two other lines were observed to carry heteroplasmic substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Although no clear evidence of a preexisting T:A heteroplasmic variant was discernable from the PB800 progenitor chromatogram data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">supplementary fig. S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp055/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), the fact that this substitution was discernible in 4/18 MA lines suggests that it might have originated as a single event in the expansion phase of the MA line experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Position 10460 in PB800 was a similar case: 3/18 MA lines analyzed had a heteroplasmic T:A at the position, whereas the progenitor and all other PB800 MA lines only showed evidence of the progenitor C:G at that position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>One conclusion is that there were five de novo base substitution events in the PB800 MA lines under the conservative assumption that those observed in &gt;1 line resulted from single mutations in the MA line expansion phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that positions 7549 and 10460 are mutational hot spots. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>First, for the PB800 MA lines, we are unable to pinpoint the precise origins of certain base substitution events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>For both sets of lines, many mutations were in a heteroplasmic state and detected using direct DNA sequencing alone; thus, we were unable to effectively identify and account for low-frequency variants (Hancock et al. 2005; Theves et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Our analyses were also based on bulk DNA prepared from many thousands of nematodes—it is possible that there is variation among individual MA line nematodes and/or among somatic cells within an individual nematode for which we are unable to account. μbs Values can be estimated for the C. briggsae MA line mtDNA, with the preceding caveats in mind and under the assumption that all base substitution differences shared by more than one MA line of a common progenitor genotype resulted from a single mutational event in the expansion phase prior to MA line bottlenecking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, we estimate μbs = 1.1 × 10−7 (standard error of mean [SEM] = 3.8 × 10−8) for HK104 mtDNA and μbs = 7.2 × 10−8 (SEM = 3.4 × 10−8) for PB800 mtDNA (see Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>These values are very close to the μbs estimate for C. elegans mtDNA (Denver et al. 2000), 9.7 × 10−8 (SEM = 2.7 × 10−8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Approximate 95% confidence intervals overlap all three estimates (fig. 2B), and application of Fisher’s Exact test revealed no significant μbs differences (P &gt; 0.8 for both between- and within-species comparisons). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that the rates of base substitution events are likely highly similar between C. elegans and C. briggsae and between the two C. briggsae natural isolate genotypes analyzed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>Despite the similarities in μbs estimates between species and between C. briggsae strains, marked differences were observed among all three sets of MA lines in terms of the spectrum of base substitution types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>We tested for significance in the base substitution spectrum, under the same assumptions and caveats applied to the μbs analysis and including all heteroplasmic changes, in terms of the numbers of observed nonstrand-specific base substitution types (six categories). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>We found a significant difference between C. briggsae (HK104 and PB800 data combined) and C. elegans (P = 0.012, Fisher's Exact test), though the difference between the two C. briggsae strains was just outside of the conventional cutoff for statistical significance (P = 0.082, Fisher's Exact test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that the spectrum of mtDNA base substitution types differs between Caenorhabditis species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>The spectrum might also vary within C. briggsae; a larger scale of mtDNA mutational analysis will be required to effectively address this possibility. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>This study shows that the mitochondrial mutation process can vary in a variety of ways between animal species of the same genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Both sets of C. briggsae MA lines were observed to accumulate large heteroplasmic deletions at &gt;10-fold higher average rates than C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>The ΨND5-2/ND5 region is prone to deletions in both the HK104 and the PB800 MA lines, and one deletion type (the ΨND5-2/ND5 boundary deletion) persists in multiple genetically diverse C. briggsae natural isolates at varying levels in nature (Howe and Denver 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>The ND1/ATP6/ND2 region, however, was only observed to accumulate large deletions in the PB800 MA lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>A previous analysis of C. elegans MA line mtDNA (Denver et al. 2000) revealed the presence of only one large heteroplasmic deletion out of 74 MA line mitochondrial genomes analyzed at 214 generations; the C. elegans deletion involved the cytochrome b region rather than the ΨND5-2/ND5 and ND1/ATP6/ND2 regions observed here to be deletion hot spots in C. briggsae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>No large heteroplasmic deletions were observed in D. melanogaster MA line mitochondrial genomes (Haag-Liautard et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>The previous C. elegans MA line mtDNA analysis (Denver et al. 2000), however, used an approach whereby 19 small PCR products were used to probe for mutations around the mitochondrial genome rather than 4 large overlapping amplicons as applied here to C. briggsae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that the C. elegans large deletion rate is an underestimate because some large deletion events, involving sequences outside the PCR primer boundaries, were missed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, a very large deletion (416 bp) was detected in the C. elegans study and 5/10 large mtDNA deletion types observed here in the C. briggsae MA lines were smaller than the mean amplicon size in the C. elegans study of Denver et al. (2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>These observations, combined with the fact that C. briggsae nematodes are known to experience large mtDNA deletions in natural populations (Howe and Denver 2008), suggest that C. briggsae mtDNA is inherently more susceptible to large deletion events than is C. elegans mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>It is also noteworthy that the C. briggsae mitochondrial genomes analyzed here harbor two pseudogene regions (ΨND5-1 and ΨND5-2) that are not present in C. elegans (Howe and Denver 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>These combined observations suggest that there are differences between C. briggsae and its congener C. elegans in terms of their susceptibilities to large mtDNA insertion events, as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot pinpoint the underlying reasons why C. briggsae is much more prone to large mtDNA deletions than C. elegans, we speculate that between-species variation in the frequency of intra/intergenomic recombination processes, known to occur in nematodes (Lunt and Hyman 1997), might be responsible for both the high deletion rate and the presence of ND5-derived mtDNA pseudogenes in C. briggsae. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>The pattern of mtDNA base substitution also differed between C. briggsae and C. elegans MA lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>The previous study of C. elegans MA line mtDNA mutation processes revealed 16 base substitution events, all of which were in a fixed state (Denver et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>The majority of base substitutions observed in the C. elegans MA lines were T:A → C:G transitions (8/16), which deviates from patterns observed in both C. briggsae MA line sets analyzed here, though especially in the PB800 MA lines where C:G → T:A transitions were the only type of base substitution observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Although the small numbers of observed base substitution mutation events specific to a set of MA lines likely preclude a meaningful statistical analysis of within-species variation in mtDNA base substitution mutation processes, the observed pattern of variation between HK104 and PB800 (table 2) suggests that there might be large differences among different C. briggsae natural isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>Multiple MA line base substitution polymorphisms were observed to be in a heteroplasmic state in both sets of 250-generation C. briggsae MA lines, whereas all base substitutions previously identified in 214-generation C. elegans MA lines were fixed differences, possibly reflecting a wider mtDNA bottleneck in C. briggsae relative to C. elegans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Although our analysis approach successfully revealed some aspects of the heteroplasmic nature of the mtDNA mutation process, many features of nematode mtDNA heteroplasmy remain mysterious—in particular, the abundance and persistence patterns of low-frequency variants and the linkage relationships between different variants in the population of mitochondrial genomes within an individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>We are optimistic, however, that the application of new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to larger numbers of MA lines will provide an avenue for better understanding the enigma of heteroplasmy and natural variation in mitochondrial mutation processes. </plain></SENT>
