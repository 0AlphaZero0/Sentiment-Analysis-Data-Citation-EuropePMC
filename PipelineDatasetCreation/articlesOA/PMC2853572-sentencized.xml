<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, we cloned the soluble trehalase gene (SeTre-1) and investigated the tissue distribution and developmental expression pattern of the two trehalase genes.

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The RNA interference (RNAi) of either SeTre-1 or SeTre-2 was gene-specific and effective, with efficiency rates up to 83% at 72 h post injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After RNAi of SeTre-1 and SeTre-2, significant higher mortality rates were observed during the larva-pupa stage and pupa-adult stage, and the lethal phenotypes were classified and analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the change trends of concentration of trehalose and glucose appeared reciprocally in RNAi-mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Moreover, knockdown of SeTre-1 gene largely inhibited the expression of chitin synthase gene A (CHSA) and reduced the chitin content in the cuticle to two-thirds relative to the control insects. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Trehalase (α-glucoside-1-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.28) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes trehalose to yield two glucose molecules, and it is present in almost all tissues in different forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Trehalase plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including flight metabolism[1], chitin synthesis during molting [2], and cold tolerance[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In insects, all these function of trehalase are achieved through the hydrolysis of trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside), the principal hemolymph sugar in insects that acts as an indispensable substrate for energy production and macromolecular biosynthesis[4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The chitin biosynthesis pathway starts with trehalose[5], and the first enzyme involved in the pathway is trehalase, and the last one is chitin synthase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Other enzymes involved include hexokinase, Glucose-6-P isomerase (G-6-P-I), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) and so on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The activity of enzymes involved in chitin metabolism were affected by temperature, especially at elevated temperature[6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To date, trehalase proteins have been purified from various insect species and are divided into the soluble (Tre-1) and the membrane-bound (Tre-2) trehalases [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first insect trehalase gene, a soluble trehalase gene, was reported in 1992[13], and a membrane-bound trehalase gene was not reported until 2005[14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The number of genes encoding a family of proteins in insects varies widely among species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For example, two trehalase genes, two chitin synthase genes, and 13 to 16 chitinase-related genes have been identified thus far in insects[15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Different genes in a family often have different functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The chitin synthase gene A of Tribolium castaneum (TcCHSA) is the sole contributor to cuticular chitin synthesis, and chitin synthase gene B (TcCHSB) is the major/sole contributor to the chitin synthesis in peritrophic matrix chitin synthesis[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The chitinase genes in Tribolium castaneum differ in their expression patterns during development and in different tissues, and genes in different groups have different functions[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In some situations, isoforms of a gene are functionally redundant[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, the functions of the two trehalases in insect chitin biosynthesis have not yet been reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua is a serious lepidopteran pest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Its membrane-bound trehalase gene was previously characterized in our laboratory[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Here we cloned the soluble trehalase gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Different expression pattern of the two trehalase genes suggest that they may have different functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The transcript levels of the two genes were substantially down-regulated by injection of gene-specific dsRNAs of the two trehalases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The results above revealed that the two genes have different functions in insect chitin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The specific down-regulation of the target gene transcript level within at least 24 hours post-injection was clearly observed (Figure 5C), which makes it possible to differentiate the functions of the two trehalase genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Such specificity is in agreement with the gene-specific interference of several genes, such as the chitin synthase genes[18], chitinase-related genes[19], and nuclear receptor HR3 genes[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The decrease of SeTre-2 after 24 hours in response to dsSeTre-1 injection and the decrease of SeTre-1 at 24 hours in response to dsSeTre-2 injection, on the other hand, represents another mechanism of feedback or self-regulation other than non-specific RNAi (Figure 5C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>As reported, the transcriptional level of SeTre-2 is down-regulated followed by decreasing activity when the activity of SeTre-1 is inhibited and endogenous glucose is lacking; and SeTre-1 mRNA level dropped when endogenous glucose is excess and trehalose synthesis is activated [24]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>As reported in a coleopteran insect T. castaneum, the two chitin synthase genes and chitinase family genes have distinctly different functions[18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the different functions of the two trehalase genes from a lepidopteran insect, S. exigua, in chitin biosynthesis for the first time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>First, the two trehalases use different resources of trehalose in insects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Treh-1 is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous trehalose, while Treh-2 is an extracellular enzyme proposed to have a role in the assimilation of exogenous trehalose as a carbon source[25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>After RNAi for SeTre-1, the expression level of SeTre-2 dropped significantly in the prepupal stage, leading to a severe shortage of glucose that caused a pupation malformation (Figure 5C, Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This result demonstrates that the activity of SeTre-2 dropped when trehalose synthesis was stopped[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>After RNAi of SeTre-2, however, the reducation of SeTre-1 expression led to an abundance of trehalose and a shortage of glucose after 24 hours that caused a reduced body size(Figure 5C, Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In the puapl stage, there was sufficient glucose for the larva-pupa stage, but a severe shortage of trehalose that led to eclosion malformation (Figure 5C, Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In other words, SeTre-1 and SeTre-2 have different effects on the concentrations of glucose and trehalose, which implies that they may have different functions in insect chitin biosynthesis through the chitin biosynthesis pathway and the glycometabolism pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Second, the interference of the SeTre-1 and SeTre-2 caused decrease in the survival rates at different times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The remarkable reduction of transcriptional levels of SeTre-1 and SeTre-2 at 72 hours post-injection caused by RNAi of SeTre-1 resulted in high mortality during the larva-pupa stage, while the severe shortage of trehalose before pupal stage owing to RNAi of SeTre-2 caused high mortality during the pupa-adult stage (Figure 6) and a high percentage of failure in eclosion (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes caused by RNAi are due to combined effects of RNAi action and feedback mechanism of the two trehalases as discussed above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Eight enzymes are involved in the insect chitin biosynthesis pathway, starting with trehalase[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>After the gene-specific interference of SeTre-1 and SeTre-2, the UAP gene expression was affected only by the injection of dsRNA to SeTre-2, and the expression of the CHSA and CHSB genes were affected by RNAi for both dsSeTre-1 and dsSeTre-2 (Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The possible reason is that CHSA mainly exists in cuticle, the primary location for slough[27], and Tre-1 is regulated by 20E to participate in slough during the larva-pupa transformation[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Treh-2 was involved in incorporating trehalose from the blood into muscular cells and then providing the energy required for the visceral muscles to strongly support the peristaltic movement of the midgut during active feeding[23], SeTre-2 appeared to be involved in food intake and the muscle movement of midgut, thus it may have a greater effect on CHSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Besides downregulation of trehalase expression, the overexpress of trehalase genes by injection of trehalose increased the mRNA levels of key genes in the chitin biosynthesis pathway (Figure 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>These further confirmed that expressions of the genes in the chitin biosynthesis pathway are affected by changes in expressions of trehalase genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The two trehalase genes have different effects on CHSA and CHSB, which was supported by the chitin content measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The chitin content in the epidermis was mainly affected by dsSeTre-1, and that in midgut was only affected by dsSeTre-2 (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Because CHSA is responsible for chitin synthesis in the cuticle and trachea and CHSB mainly for chitin synthesis in the peritrophic matrix in the gut[15], [18], it can be concluded that SeTre-1 affected the expression of CHSA and chitin synthesis in the cuticle more significantly. SeTre-2, however, has a major effect on the expression of CHSB and chitin synthesis in the midgut. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In the present study, RNAi of the two trehalase genes decreased their transcription levels (Figure 5C), and their enzyme activities dropped accordingly (Figure 5E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In this way, chitin, the last product in the chitin biosynthesis pathway, is affected through changes in the substrates, products and activities of a series of enzymes in the pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the interference of the two trehalase genes resulted in a shortage of glucose (Figure 8) and decreased the transcription level of a signal molecule, ecdysone receptor (EcR) gene (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the transcription levels of the pathway genes such as SeTre-1, G-6-P-I, UAP, CHSA and CHSB were affected at different times after RNAi of SeEcR gene (Yao, et al, unpublished data in the laboratory). </plain></SENT>
