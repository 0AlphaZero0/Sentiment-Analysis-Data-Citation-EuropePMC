</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), such as human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, sheep scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and chronic wasting disease of cervidae, are infectious, fatal, neurodegenerative disorders caused by prions [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Prions are unconventional pathogens primarily composed of PrPSc, a rearranged conformer of the ubiquitously expressed prion protein (PrPC), whose precise physiological function is largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Upon infection, PrPSc dictates the self-perpetuating conformational conversion of PrPC into nascent PrPSc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This conversion involves – without any apparent post-translational modification – the refolding of soluble, alpha-helix-rich PrPC molecules into beta-sheet enriched PrPSc polymers that form deposits in TSE-infected brains [2], [3] and are assumed to be responsible for the observed neurodegenerative disorders [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The conversion reaction may proceed through a nucleated polymerization mechanism in which PrPSc multimers recruit PrPC molecules and trigger their conformational conversion into PrPSc (for review [5]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The refolding/multimerisation process confers distinct physico-chemical properties to PrPSc, such as insolubility in non-denaturing detergents and partial resistance to proteolysis [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Distinct prion entities, referred to as strains, are known to self-propagate in the same host and exhibit distinguishable phenotypic traits that are heritable, such as incubation time, neuropathological and biochemical properties (for reviews: [7], [8], [9]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Accumulating experimental evidence indicates that strain-specified properties are encoded within structural differences in the conformation of the PrPSc molecules, which are faithfully imparted to host PrPC during the conversion process [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, the extent to which the aggregation state varies between different stains, and participates to strain-specific prion biology is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The various fractionation methods and preparative procedures previously employed to estimate the size of the infectious particles [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] have led to a vast range of measured sizes, making it difficult to relate any variation to potential strain differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Of note, almost all of these studies used substantially purified PrPSc as a starting material. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a specific protocol to fractionate PrP particles according to their sedimentation velocity properties in a viscous medium, characterized their relative levels of infectivity and looked for strain-specific variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, experiments were performed on crude brain homogenates, which a priori contain all TSE infectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We worked with a panel of strains that were biologically cloned on homogeneous genetic backgrounds, obtained after transmission of either classical and atypical (Nor98) sheep scrapie and BSE, or hamster scrapie infectious sources in transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP (VRQ allele; tg338 mice) and hamster PrP (tg7 line), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the sedimentation profile of the infectious component dramatically varies with the strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We further show that the predominance of slowly sedimenting infectious particles that segregate from the bulk of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc particles may be a distinctive feature of strains able to induce a rapidly lethal disease. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>PrPSc aggregates present in detergent-solubilised brain tissue homogenates were fractionated by sedimentation velocity centrifugation in an iodixanol gradient (Optiprep). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The experimental conditions were established with brain material from tg338 mice that were infected or not with LA21K fast strain (referred to as LA21K), a prototypal, rapid strain that kills the mice within ∼2 months (see  Table 1  for information on the strains used in this study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>As a first step, we tested a variety of detergents for solubilization, which showed variable efficacy in terms of partition of PrPC and PrPSc species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For example, the use of standard solubilization buffers containing Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate or sarkosyl led to sedimentation of both isoforms throughout the gradient (Figure S1), indicating an incomplete release of total PrP from cellular constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the sequential use of dodecyl maltoside and sarkosyl resulted in more efficient separation of the two PrP isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the conditions eventually employed (see  Figure 1  for a summarizing flow diagram), the bulk of PrPC molecules remained in the upper fractions 1–4 ( Figure 2A and D , green line), while both PrPSc ( Figure 2B ) and proteinase K (PK) resistant PrPSc species ( Figure 2C–D , black line) were mainly detected in fractions 6–20 of the gradient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no pelleted PrP material was observed in the selected conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Increasing the ultracentrifugation time caused the majority of PrPSc to sediment toward the heaviest fractions of the gradient, indicating that this material had not reached its density equilibrium (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Both dodecyl maltoside and sarkosyl are known to efficiently solubilize membrane structures, including rafts [26], [27], [28], yet PrPSc could be attached to abnormal, prion-induced structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To address this point, brain homogenates were solubilized using these detergents in more stringent conditions, i.e. at 37°C instead of 4°C [29], however the sedimentation profile of PrPSc was affected only marginally (Figure S2A). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Fractionation of five tg338 mouse-passaged ovine prions revealed a major PK-resistant PrPSc population, which peaked at the same position of the gradient regardless of the strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>By comparison with standard molecular mass markers and recombinant ovine PrP oligomers [30], we estimated that this population might correspond to approximately 12–30 PrP monomers averaging ∼30 kDa each, if constituted of PrP only, with the caveat that great caution must be exercised when attributing a size to a polymer by comparing its velocity to that of molecular mass markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that PrPSc is not a collection of multimers with a regular continuum of size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, the overall sedimentation profiles were not uniform among the strains, indicating that the size distribution of PrPSc aggregates is strain-dependent. tg7 mouse-passaged hamster prions showed PrPSc sedimentation characteristics resembling that of ovine strains, with the same position of the major peak and limited variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Greater differences in the size distribution of PrPSc aggregates may however exist depending on strain and/or PrP sequence, since one amyloid-forming ovine prion (Italian scrapie; Figure S3) showed a clear shift of PrPSc toward heavier fractions of the gradient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In two studies, larger polymers were shown to be more PK-resistant than smaller ones [28], [35], indicating that the resistance to proteolysis of PrPSc largely depends on its quaternary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The PrPSc associated with Nor98 agent, a newly discovered strain responsible for an atypical form of field scrapie, is highly sensitive to PK digestion, when compared to the other ovine strains studied here [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding, Nor98 PrPSc exhibited not only the same predominant peak as the other strains, but also the highest proportion of faster sedimenting PrPSc species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>This argues that the pronounced PK sensitivity of Nor98 PrPSc is not due to low size aggregates, but rather to its tertiary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Supporting this view, its C-terminal region is accessible to PK, in contrast to classical scrapie agents [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The infectivity sedimentation profiles unexpectedly contrast with that of the PrPSc aggregates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>While infectivity and PK-resistant PrPSc roughly co-fractionated for LA19K, Nor98 and sheep BSE, their respective distribution was mostly decoupled for LA21K and 127S: with these two fast strains, infectivity essentially partitioned in the upper fractions, which were 2–3 logs more infectious than the PK-resistant PrPSc–richest fractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>LA21K, 127S and Nor98 are three strains exhibiting similarly high infectious titers in tg338 mice, making the observed differences particularly striking. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that it consists essentially of PK-resistant aggregates, with high specific infectivity [24], [45], [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>If so, then ≥99% of LA21K or 127S infectivity would be supported by ≤10% of PK-resistant PrPSc molecules. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>While a variable, strain-dependent proportion of abnormal PrP seems fairly PK-sensitive [28], [35], [36], [48], [49], little is known about its specific infectivity, with two recent studies suggesting that it could be minimal [37], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>However, a PK-sensitive and soluble form of PrPSc has been shown to support a substantial fraction of infectivity [51] and to have a good in vitro converting activity [35]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It is still possible that a tightly bound cellular component of low density, such as lipid molecule [45], or low-density lipoprotein [57], remains part of the prion particles in the most infectious fractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This would imply that the tightness of such an interaction specifically differs between strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the low sedimenting infectivity component could involve truly small size PrPSc particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In this hypothesis, the data would indicate a size smaller than a PrP pentamer, which is compatible with that reported for PK-sensitive PrPSc aggregates [28], [35]. </plain></SENT>
