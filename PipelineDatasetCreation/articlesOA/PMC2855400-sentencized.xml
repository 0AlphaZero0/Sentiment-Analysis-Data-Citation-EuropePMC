<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Biophysical studies suggest that this system is exquisitely sensitive, such that vipers can detect prey at distances up to 1 meter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Infrared sensation may also be important for predator avoidance and thermoregulatory behavior 1–3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Western Diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) is a highly evolved viper whose ability to detect infrared radiation (IR) is unmatched by other snakes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>IR detection is mediated by specialized loreal pit organs located between the eye and nostril on either side of the viper’s face (Fig. 1a) 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Suspended within each of these hollow chambers is a thin membrane that serves as an infrared antenna (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The membrane is rich in mitochondria, highly vascularized, and densely innervated by primary afferent nerve fibers from the trigeminal branch of the somatosensory system (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>1a) 5–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These fibers convey infrared signals from the pit organ to the optic tectum of the brain, where they converge with input from other sensory modalities 9–11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some members of the non-venomous Pythonidae and Boidae families (pythons and boas, respectively) also detect IR, albeit with 5–10 fold lower sensitivity compared to Crotalinae vipers 3,12,13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Pythons and boas possess labial pit organs, which are distributed over the snout and lack the complex architecture seen in loreal pits of vipers (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, they are similarly vascularized and innervated by trigeminal fibers, but at lower density 14–16, 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, relative sensitivities of these snake species to IR likely reflect molecular and anatomical differences of this specialized sensory system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While the role of the pit organ as an infrared sensor is well established, fundamental questions remain regarding its mechanism of stimulus detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="?"><plain>For example, does the membrane, itself, contain the infrared sensor, or is the sensor expressed by the closely apposed nerve fibers? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="?"><plain>What is the molecular identity of the infrared sensor, and can its intrinsic biophysical characteristics account for the physiological properties of the pit organ? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="?"><plain>Do Crotalinae, Pythonidae, and Boidae snakes use similar molecular strategies for sensing IR? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In principle, an infrared receptor could detect photons directly, similar to photochemical activation of opsins in the eye, or indirectly through heating of tissue within the pit, leading to activation of a thermoreceptor 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Because the pit receives direct input from the somatosensory, rather than the visual system 9, it seems likely that infrared signals are detected through a thermotransduction, rather than phototransduction mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, heat-activated membrane currents from rattlesnake trigeminal neurons have been described, although their functional properties have not been extensively characterized 17, 6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Snakes - particularly pit vipers - are inconvenient subjects for physiological and behavioral studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>They are also genetically intractable organisms for which annotated genomic information is scarce, limiting molecular studies of IR detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We therefore used transcriptome profiling to identify pit-enriched sensory transducers, yielding the snake orthologue of the ‘wasabi receptor’, TRPA1, as a candidate IR detector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This channel is highly enriched in trigeminal neurons that innervate the pit and, when heterologously expressed, exhibits robust heat sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Thus, TRPA1 has been evolutionarily selected to function as a specialized and highly sensitive heat receptor in the pit, whereas in mammals it functions primarily as a detector of chemical irritants and inflammatory agents 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the pit membrane serves as a passive antenna for radiant heat, transducing thermal energy to heat-sensitive channels on embedded nerve fibers. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In most sensory systems, specialized receptor cells detect relevant stimuli and transmit signals to adjacent nerve fibers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the somatosensory system, however, bare nerve endings are themselves detectors of thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Indeed, trigeminal ganglia (TG) of pit bearing snakes are unusually large compared to those of mammals and send a thick bundle of afferents directly to the pit on the ipsilateral side of the face (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>1a) 20,21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We therefore reasoned that snake TG should express proteins dedicated to pit function, and that such proteins should be less abundant in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which provide somatosensory input to the trunk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Because mammalian TG and DRG gene expression profiles are more-or-less equivalent 22,23, marked differences in snakes should reflect functional specialization associated with IR detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, a pair-wise comparison of transcriptomes from rattlesnake TG versus DRG revealed a single gene encoding an orthologue of the TRPA1 ion channel (Fig.1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Whereas other members of the TRP channel family (e.g. the capsaicin- and heat-activated receptor, TRPV1) showed equivalent expression in these ganglia, TRPA1 was enriched 400-fold in TG. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>If TRPA1 is of unique functional importance to infrared sensing, then snakes lacking pit organs (non-pit species) should not show a disparity in TRPA1 expression between TG and DRG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Indeed, transcriptomes from two non-pit species, Texas Rat and Western Coachwhip snakes, showed no obvious outliers for either ganglion (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, transcriptome comparison from TG of rattlesnake versus non-pit snakes again identified TRPA1 as the only differentially expressed gene (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In striking contrast to non-pit snakes and other vertebrates, TRPA1 was absent from rattlesnake DRG (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>1d), further supporting a specific role for this channel in TG/pit function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we did not detect opsin-like sequences in TG of any snake species examined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In general, neurons having the largest soma diameters are involved in detection of innocuous sensations, such as light touch, whereas small to medium diameter neurons constitute the majority of nociceptors that detect noxious stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In mammals, TRPA1 is expressed by ~25% of all somatosensory neurons, preferentially nociceptors that also express TRPV1 25,26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We observed a very different anatomical profile in rattlesnakes, where most TG neurons were medium-to-large diameter, the majority (59.9±9.7%) of which expressed TRPA1 (Fig. 2a,b) (also see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our transcriptome analysis, no TRPA1 signal was observed in rattlesnake DRG (Fig. 2a,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We also examined the distribution of TRPV1, which in rodent TG or DRG is expressed by 40–60% of neurons, predominantly nociceptors 26,27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In rattlesnake TG or DRG, TRPV1 was expressed by only 13±4.1% and 14.5±5.7% of neurons, respectively, most with small diameters (Fig. 2a,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Thus, pit viper TG is unique among vertebrates, reflecting adaptation for IR detection. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Mammalian TRPA1 is activated by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), the pungent agent from wasabi and other mustard plants 25,28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>AITC and other electrophilic irritants gate the channel through an unusual mechanism involving covalent modification of cysteine residues within the cytoplasmic N-terminus 29,30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Rattlesnake and rat snake TRPA1 exhibit 81% identity with one another and 63% identity with human TRPA1 and contain three conserved N-terminal cysteines required for activation by electrophiles (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when expressed in HEK293 cells, TRPA1 from either snake species responded to AITC, demonstrating functionality of the cloned channels (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>If TRPA1 is important for infrared sensing, then it should respond to thermal stimuli in a temperature range consistent with sensitivity of the pit, which detects changes in ambient temperature above ~30°C (ref 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Indeed, rattlesnake TRPA1 was inactive at room temperature, but robustly activated above 28.0 ± 2.5°C (Fig. 3a and SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, rat snake TRPA1 was also heat sensitive, albeit with a substantially higher threshold of 36.3 ± 0.6°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To assess thermal response profiles in greater detail, we measured heat-evoked membrane currents in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing snake channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Consistent with calcium imaging data, rattlesnake TRPA1 showed extremely robust and steep responses to heat with a threshold of 27.6 ± 0.9°C (Q10 = 13.7), whereas the rat snake channel responded with a higher threshold of 37.2 ± 0.7°C (Q10 = 8.8) (Fig. 3b,c and SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the rat snake channel is heat sensitive, its thermal response properties make it less well suited to act as an infrared sensor compared to the pit viper channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Instead, TRPA1, in conjunction with TRPV1, may contribute to cutaneous and somatic thermosensation in non-pit snakes, consistent with the higher activation thresholds of rat snake versus rattlesnake TRPA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The rattlesnake channel did not respond to cold (12°C) (not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>TRPA1 channels have been characterized from a number of vertebrate species, including fish 31, all of which are activated by AITC, but not heat (SFig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>TRPA1-like channels are also found in invertebrate organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, whose genome contains three TRPA1 orthologues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Relative to rat TRPA1, which responds to AITC with an EC50 of 11 µM, the rattlesnake and rat snake orthologues are less sensitive, showing robust responses at concentrations ≥ 500 µM and with significantly slower activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The relative sensitivities of these channels to heat versus AITC are clearly shown by comparing current-voltage profiles (SFig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>3b). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Four vertebrate families possess specialized sensory organs devoted to IR detection: pit viper, python, and boa families of snakes, as well as vampire bats 2,36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Here we delineate the mechanism whereby three of these families sense IR, starting with the pit viper as the paragon of this unique sensory modality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>We accomplished this by taking an unbiased transcriptome profiling approach in which minimal assumptions were made in regard to the molecular specialization of the pit and associated neural structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>This represents a powerful, sensitive, and quantitative version of the classic plus-minus screen for identifying organ-specific genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We exploited this technology to address a problem vexed by a paucity of tissue and lack of genomic information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In vertebrates, temperature sensation is mediated through activation of TRP channels that detect heat or cold 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In invertebrate organisms, such as flies (Drosophila), activation of TRP channels also contributes to temperature detection 32,33, whereas in worms (C. elegans), thermosensation is suggested to involve a phototransduction-like pathway involving activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels 38,39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that the pit organ detects IR through a TRP channel-based process, rather than an opsin-like pathway, consistent with thermal, rather than photochemical signal transduction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Identification of snake TRPA1 as an infrared sensor is interesting from an evolutionary perspective because previously identified vertebrate TRPA1 orthologues function primarily as detectors of chemical irritants 18, and possibly cold 40,41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Thus, snake TRPA1 is functionally more like its invertebrate counterparts, despite their greater sequence diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Recent observations suggest that among TRP channels, TRPA1 orthologues show particularly rapid evolution in invertebrate species, where they display a range of heat sensitivities and contribute differentially to thermosensation 42,43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that this functional diversification extends to vertebrate channels, as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>While the evolutionary relationship among snake species is a subject of ongoing study and debate 34,44, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that ancient and modern snakes have independently adapted TRPA1 as an infrared sensor through convergent evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The cloned rattlesnake channel is the most heat-sensitive (i.e. lowest thermal activation threshold and highest Q10), in keeping with the greater infrared acuity of pit vipers compared to pythons or boas 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>At the same time, differences in thermosensitivity among snake TRPA1 channels can differ by as little as 2°C (e.g. rattlesnake versus boa), suggesting that other cellular or anatomical factors contribute to physiologic and behavioral differences in stimulus detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Finally, the relative contributions of TRPA1 and other heat sensitive channels (such as TRPV1) to somatic thermosensation likely differ among snake species, depending on thermal thresholds and expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Sensory systems evolve rapidly to accommodate variations in environmental niche, such as those affecting climate and predator-prey relationships 45,46. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>TRPA1 channels have undergone particularly fascinating evolutionary perturbation and selection to function as thermo- or chemoreceptors in organisms of very different lineage, indicative of their unique physiological plasticity throughout the animal kingdom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Thus, TRPA1 and other TRP channels provide new genetic and physiologic markers with which to delineate evolutionary relationships among vertebrate and invertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
