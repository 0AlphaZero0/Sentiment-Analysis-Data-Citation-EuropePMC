<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The clinical features include low visual acuity, nystagmus, photophobia, severe color vision defects, and no recordable or only residual cone function on electroretinography (ERG) with normal rod functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Fundoscopy is usually normal, although macular pigmentary changes and atrophy have been described in the literature [2-5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ACHM is characterized by progressive cone loss, which has been described in a large proportion of patients in terms of the worsening of the macular appearance and deterioration of the central vision irrespective of the genetic cause [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the use of red contact lenses or red tinted glasses can alleviate photophobia in patients with ACHM or cone dystrophy [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To date, ACHM has been described as being caused by mutations in four genes: cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha-3 (CNGA3), cyclic nucleotide-gated channel beta-3 (CNGB3), guanine nucleotide-binding protein, alpha-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2), and phosphodiesterase 6C (PDE6C) [9-14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The proteins encoded by these four genes are specifically expressed in cone photoreceptor cells, where they have been shown to be involved in the cone phototransduction cascade. CNGA3 encodes the α-subunit and CNGB3 the β-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel that has a central function in signal transduction of the visual pathway [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>25% of all ACHM patients carry mutations in CNGA3, and 45%–50% carry CNGB3 mutations, whereas only a few families have been reported to have GNAT2 or PDE6C mutations [14-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Mutations in CNGA3, CNGB3, and PDE6C have also been associated with cone dystrophy in a small proportion of patients [10,14]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified two Pakistani families with autosomal recessive ACHM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>All affected individuals had an early onset of nystagmus, photophobia and low visual acuity with color blindness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In these two families, novel mutations were identified in CNGA3 (c.822G&gt;T, p.R274S) and CNGB3 (c.1825delG, p.V609WfsX9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>There are six cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels present in mammals, and these are divided in two subfamilies, the A subunits (CNGA1–4) and the B subunits (CNGB1 and CNGB3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The CNGA3 and CNGB3 channels play a critical role in cone-mediated vision, which is required for central and color vision, as well as visual acuity. CNGA3 and CNGB3 encode the cone CNG channel subunits [22] that are able to form heterotetramers [23], although CNGA3 subunits may also form homotetramers [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Mutations in these two genes have been shown to result in different forms of ACHM and cone dystrophy [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In CNGA3, the p.R274S mutation is located in a conserved region (Figure 2B), which is part of the fourth transmembrane helix (S4) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The arginine residue at this position is conserved among the CNG alpha subunits of rods (CNGA1) and olfactory neurons (CNGA2), Shaker K+ channels and HCN channels [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the S4 domain have been shown to cause failure in cellular channel processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Mutant channel proteins are not glycosylated, and do not reach the surface plasma membrane; they remain trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum, and are most likely misfolded [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The c.1825delG mutation in exon 16 of CNGB3 should in theory give rise to nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant RNA, and can, therefore, be considered a loss-of-function mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In case there is residual CNGB3 mRNA, the predicted truncated protein (p.V609WfsX9) lacks the conserved cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate (cNMP) domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The cNMP domain is the binding site for cyclic nucleotides, and is involved in the cyclic nucleotide mediated activation of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that both putative effects of this variant will lead to the loss-of-function of CNGB3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Identification of causative mutations aided in the correct diagnosis of ACHM in these two Pakistani families, which had previously been diagnosed to suffer from retinal dystrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>After the correct re-diagnosis of the disease, the use of pink glasses reduced the photophobia to some extent in the affected individuals of family RP26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Due to the use of these dark colored pink glasses, the light exposure was reduced, resulting in increased scotopic vision that helped the patients to see objects at a distance, even during the day time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the first genetic screening and use of dark glasses as supportive therapy for ACHM in Pakistan, a disease that is often misdiagnosed. </plain></SENT>
