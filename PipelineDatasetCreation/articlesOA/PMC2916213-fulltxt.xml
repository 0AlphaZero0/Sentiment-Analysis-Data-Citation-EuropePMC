We tested these hypotheses by weekly sampling (January&#x02013;March 2004) of first-year winter sea ice (Franklin Bay, Western Arctic) that experienced temperatures from &#x02212;9&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;26&#x000b0;C, generating community fingerprints and clone libraries for <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic>. Despite severe conditions and significant decreases in microbial abundance, no significant changes in richness or community structure were detected in the ice. Communities of <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> in the ice, as in under-ice seawater, were dominated by SAR11 clade <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and Marine Group I <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic>, neither of which is known from later season sea ice. The bacterial ice library contained clones of <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> from oligotrophic seawater clades (e.g. OM60, OM182) but no clones from gammaproteobacterial genera commonly detected in later season sea ice by similar methods (e.g. <italic>Colwellia</italic>, <italic>Psychrobacter</italic>). The only common sea ice bacterial genus detected in winter ice was <italic>Polaribacter</italic>. Overall, selection during ice formation and mortality during winter appear to play minor roles in the process of microbial succession that leads to distinctive spring and summer sea ice communities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Arctic sea ice covers an area of about 15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> at its maximal extent during winter (Antarctic 18 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Fetterer and Knowles, 2002</xref>), providing an extensive (albeit shrinking; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Serreze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) habitat for microorganisms. During the annual lifetime of polar sea ice, it experiences wide ranges in environmental conditions, yet changes in its microbial (bacterial and archaeal) communities through the seasons are not well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Mock and Thomas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Deming, 2009</xref>). Winter sea ice in the Arctic is an extreme environment characterized by limited light, very cold temperatures in its upper horizons (to &#x02212;35&#x000b0;C) and correspondingly high salinity (37&#x02013;237&#x02030;) in its brine inclusions, where the organisms have been observed to reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The assumption that these microbial inhabitants are largely inactive during the winter has been tested infrequently. Working with first-year sea ice north of Barrow (Alaska) during the coldest month of the year (March), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Junge and colleagues (2004</xref>) observed that a small percentage of cells (0.5&#x02013;4.0% by CTC staining) were metabolically active to &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, the coldest ice horizon examined. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wells and Deming (2006b</xref>), working with landfast sea ice in Franklin Bay (Western Arctic, also in March), detected an increase in bacterial numbers (doubling time &#x0003e; 4 days) in one of the three ice-brine samples they incubated at &#x02212;12&#x000b0;C (salinity of 160&#x02030;).</p><p>Relative to other marine environments, bacteria in sea ice have proven highly amenable to cultivation: up to 50% of total counts from Antarctic ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Helmke and Weyland, 1995</xref>) and 62% from Arctic ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The bacterial groups that have been cultured from polar sea ice consist primarily of <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> of the orders <italic>Oceanospirillales</italic> and <italic>Alteromonadales</italic>, the marine <italic>Roseobacter</italic> clade of <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bowman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Brown and Bowman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buchan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (also known as <italic>Cytophaga</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Flavobacter</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Bacteroides</italic>). <italic>Betaproteobacteria</italic> and high G+C Gram-positives (<italic>Actinobacteria</italic>) have also been obtained in culture from Antarctic sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and Baltic Sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Kaartokallio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Results from culture-independent methods, including cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), overlap remarkably well with culture-based results, confirming the prevalence of these bacterial groups in spring and summer sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Brown and Bowman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Archaea</italic> were not known from sea ice until recently, even though they are prevalent members of Arctic pelagic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wells <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and comprise a sizable fraction of the biomass in Antarcticfrazil ice in late winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Delong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). To date, <italic>Archaea</italic> have only been detected in Arctic winter sea ice using domain-level probes, where they comprised &#x02264; 3.4% of the total assemblage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). They appear absent in sea ice of later seasons by both culture-based and culture-independent methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Brown and Bowman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Possible shifts in community composition and richness in Arctic winter ice over time and increasingly severe conditions are not known. From cultivation studies of Antarctic sea ice, psychrophilic bacteria are thought to outlive psychrotolerant species during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Helmke and Weyland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Delille and Rosiers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Helmke and Weyland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Fiala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), leaving them positioned to dominate during the biologically productive spring and summer months. Such common heterotrophic microorganisms may also begin their habitation of sea ice in relative abundance if attached to larger phytoplankton known to entrain selectively into ice by frazil ice scavenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Grossmann, 1994</xref>). The dynamics of microbial communities in polar sea ice, whether during or after ice entrapment, have not been examined using phylogenetic approaches, although these techniques have been used to study winter succession of bacterial and archaeal communities in polar waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Murray and Grzymski, 2007</xref>), including surface waters at our study site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The only ice examined by a PCR-based &#x02018;fingerprinting&#x02019; technique for high-throughput analysis of microbial community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Osborn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Hewson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Fuhrman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) is the warm (&#x0003e; &#x02212;5&#x000b0;C) and thin (&#x0003c; 30 cm) ice of the brackish (5&#x02013;6&#x02030;) Baltic Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Kaartokallio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). There the dynamics of <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> over the short (2 month) lifetime of this &#x02018;mild&#x02019; ice were linked to exchange processes at the ice&#x02013;water interface and progression of the ice-algal bloom. These features do not pertain to upper horizons of much colder, thicker and light-limited Arctic winter sea ice, the subject of this study.</p><p>During the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES), when the CCGS <italic>Amundsen</italic> was immobilized in landfast sea ice of Franklin Bay (Western Arctic) through the winter, we first investigated the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of particulate matter, including microorganisms and particulate extracellular polymeric substances (pEPS), within the ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The same ice field was cored repeatedly each week from January through March, a period when ice thickness increased from 90 to 200 cm and upper ice temperatures were well below &#x02212;5&#x000b0;C, leaving the ice impermeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Golden <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and the microbial communities entrapped. We focused on the upper 70 cm of the ice, analysing three 10 cm horizons centred at 25, 45 and 65 cm below the ice surface (reserving subsamples for later phylogenetic analyses). The results indicated winter losses of 38% and 49% of the total number of bacteria in the two coldest ice horizons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), where <italic>in situ</italic> temperatures had ranged from &#x02212;15&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;26&#x000b0;C (25 cm) and &#x02212;12&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;22&#x000b0;C (45 cm; the range at 65 cm was &#x02212;9&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;18&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). At these temperatures brine salinities are also extreme, from 130&#x02030; to 230&#x02030;. We attributed some of the bacterial losses to virally mediated mortality, given measurements of viral production in ice brines from the same ice field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wells and Deming, 2006b</xref>). We attributed the persistence of the majority of bacteria throughout the ice to the generic cryoprotective effects of pEPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Krembs and Deming, 2008</xref>), which had increased significantly in all three horizons during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate effects of the increasingly severe conditions in the aforementioned sea ice on the structure and richness of the natural microbial communities found within it, beginning several weeks after ice formation. Because bacterial communities that thrive within spring and summer sea ice differ substantially from pelagic communities prior to freeze-up, we hypothesized that extreme conditions in winter sea ice would exert selective pressure on the microbial community, favouring survival and subsequent dominance of the easily cultured psychrophilic <italic>Bacteria</italic> already known from spring and summer sea ice. To test this hypothesis we performed community fingerprinting of <italic>Bacteria</italic> (by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, ARISA) and <italic>Archaea</italic> (by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) on the entire sample set collected during the CASES overwintering expedition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), also generating complementary clone libraries of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes from selected samples of winter sea ice and under-ice seawater. Although we were unable to test directly for selection during the autumn freezing process, our results also bear upon this concept.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Community dynamics</title><sec><title>Bacterial ARISA</title><p>Contrary to expectation, no changes in the community structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) or richness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) of the sea ice bacterial community were detected through the winter.

Although both bacterial growth and mortality had been inferred from changes in total bacterial counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wells and Deming, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), microbial community succession was not detectable in the upper ice horizons we sampled.

Persistence of the dominant members of the sea ice microbial community through winter was also evidenced by the high proportion of total signal associated with members present in every sea ice sample analysed by ARISA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and T-RFLP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Whereas culture-based studies of heterotrophic microbes had suggested forces at work in sea ice to select for psychrophilic over psychrotolerant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Kaneko <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Delille and Rosiers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Delille <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Fiala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), not even the extreme conditions of the winter sea ice we studied exerted any more than very limited (statistically undetectable) selective pressure at the taxonomic level on the bacterial and archaeal communities entrapped in this ice. Techniques used with polar seawater to quantify differences in relative abundance of specific groups of microorganisms, like FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA and functional genes like <italic>amoA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>), or massively parallel hypervariable tag sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Huse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>), have not yet been applied to sea ice. Their use on winter sea ice might reveal subtle patterns of succession in bacterial and archaeal communities that escaped the sensitivity limits of our methods.</p><p>Many <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> may lie dormant in winter sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Kaneko <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Helmke and Weyland, 1995</xref>), surviving without reproducing and thus limiting the possible mechanisms of selection. Although <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> were presumed to &#x02018;survive&#x02019; if their DNA was present on our membrane filters, we have no data to demonstrate their continued viability <italic>in situ</italic>. Protistan bacterivores, which can selectively graze bacteria based on size and biochemical cues, are essentially absent from very cold Arctic winter ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Krembs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) and so are unlikely to contribute a selective effect, even if they may play a role in shaping the microbial community in warmer ice. The persistence of the ice microbial communities that we measured through winter is consistent with cells being relatively inactive in very cold sea ice and surviving in the absence of bacterivores, whereas more active under-ice seawater communities are subject to predation and do change over the course of winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Murray and Grzymski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Complete preservation in the ice, however, is inconsistent with reports of actively respiring cells in Arctic winter sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and, from the same ice we sampled, examples of bacterial mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and viral and bacterial production in experimental ice brines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wells and Deming, 2006b</xref>). To reconcile the general absence of species-specific mortality reported here with the presumed presence of a mixture of active and inactive populations (whether taxonomically similar or not), both populations must share similar mortality rates. This assumption can be fulfilled if the primary mechanisms of mortality in the ice are taxonomically non-selective, despite the possibility that they may each affect active and inactive cells differently.</p><p>Two mechanisms to consider for non-selective mortality are virally mediated lysis and cell damage from co-occurring extremes in temperature and salinity. Modelled contact rates between viruses and bacteria in sea ice brines are extremely high (up to 600 times that in seawater; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wells and Deming, 2006b</xref>) and, under environmental stress, host specificity may give way to a broad range of infectable hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Wells and Deming, 2006a</xref>), linking both mechanisms under consideration. Viral production (whether by species-specific or generalist phages) may play a role in mortality of any taxonomic group that remains active in the ice, whereas dormant populations might be affected not by viral reproduction from within but &#x02018;lysis from without&#x02019; due to a large number of attached viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Delbr&#x000fc;ck, 1940</xref>).</p><p>For a generalized protective mechanism for cells within sea ice, hydrated coatings of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that simultaneously buffer against external ice-crystal damage, osmotic shock and viral attack has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Krembs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Krembs and Deming, 2008</xref>). EPS are produced by many sea ice bacteria in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Mancuso Nichols <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Marx <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), colonized by bacteria in sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Meiners <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and increased in abundance during winter in the ice we studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Production of EPS by a subset of microorganisms entrained into sea ice might serve all entrapped within it, including common seawater species not adapted to life in ice, thereby limiting species-specific mortality.</p><p>The structure of these persistent winter sea ice communities is unique in resembling that of communities in autumn and winter seawater, measured in this study and reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez and colleagues (2008</xref>) for our study site, rather than previously observed communities in spring and summer sea ice. For the first time, sea ice bacterial communities were observed (by both clone library and fingerprinting results) to be dominated by the common pelagic SAR11 clade <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, with only much smaller complements of the <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> well known from sea ice. While studies of later season sea ice have failed to detect <italic>Archaea</italic>, all of our winter ice (and seawater) samples contained them, with the dominant archaeon belonging to Marine Group I.1a <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic>. Clearly, these pelagic <italic>Bacteria</italic> and <italic>Archaea</italic> entrained into sea ice upon its formation and persisted through the winter. Our community structure results also indicate that microorganisms from other habitats, including terrestrial soil, riverine waters and marine sediment, entrain into sea ice and persist through the winter. Likely sources of the non-marine microorganisms include freshwater from the nearby Horton River, eroded soils from the Smoking Hills, and terrestrial organic matter from the Mackenzie River, the largest source of suspended particulates to the Beaufort Shelf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Macdonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>All of the dominant SAR11 phylotypes detected in our winter ice samples were highly similar to sequences from the coastal Beaufort Sea. Regarding the dominant SAR11 phylotypes detected in our winter ice samples, all were highly similar to sequences from the coastal Beaufort Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>), central Arctic Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Malmstrom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and Antarctic surface waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Murray and Grzymski, 2007</xref>), even though absent from summer sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Brown and Bowman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and highly productive autumn sea ice near Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The only cultured representative of the SAR11 clade is &#x02018;<italic>Candidatus</italic> Pelagibacter ubique&#x02019;, an obligately oligotrophic alphaproteobacterium distributed widely throughout the waters of the global ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Morris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Although we detected two clades of SAR11 ITS sequences, no evidence was found to indicate ecotype differentiation (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Garc&#x000ed;a-Mart&#x000ed;nez and Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Valera, 2000</xref>) between sea ice and seawater environments. Because sequences within the SAR11 clade made up a larger fraction of the late winter sea ice library (70%) than the under-ice seawater library (48%), SAR11 may nevertheless overwinter more successfully in ice than in seawater. This inference is consistent with quantitative FISH studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez and colleagues (2008</xref>), who detected a seasonal decrease in the relative abundance of SAR11 in Franklin Bay surface waters from 36% of total DAPI counts at the time of freeze-up (December) to 18% by late winter (March).</p><p>The dominant archaeal phylotypes in our sea ice and seawater libraries, Marine Group I <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>) have been identified from central Arctic seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), Beaufort shelf nepheloid layers and riverine particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2008b</xref>;), and Antarctic seawater growing frazil ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Delong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), yet were absent from summer sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Brown and Bowman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and highly productive autumn sea ice near Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). These phylotypes clustered with the &#x02018;Marine&#x02019; Group I <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> rather than the &#x02018;Freshwater&#x02019; Group I which are prominent in the Mackenzie River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Galand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">b</xref>;). The seasonally high relative abundance of the Marine Group I <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> that we detected both by T-RFLP (45% of total signal intensity) and clone library sequencing (91% of sequences in both libraries) in Franklin Bay is consistent with FISH counts in surface waters at the same site, showing a winter high for this group (to 16% of DAPI counts) that decreased to undetectable levels by late summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso-S&#x000e1;ez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This trend is also consistent with results from Antarctic waters showing that the relative abundance of Marine Group I <italic>Crenarchaeota</italic> was highest during winter and inversely correlated with algal biomass (chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>) on seasonal time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Church <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).

Although <italic>Archaea</italic> were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Junge and colleagues (2004</xref>) in winter sea ice, their FISH probes were generic for the domain <italic>Archaea</italic> so no further taxonomic assignment was possible.</p><p>Bacterial sequences from several frequently cultured groups of copiotrophic sea ice bacteria were absent from our winter clone libraries.

Instead, the majority of gammaproteobacterial phylotypes were related to recently cultured oligotrophic seawater clades OM60 and OM182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cho and Giovannoni, 2004</xref>). The OM60 clade is prominent in Arctic seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Kellogg and Deming, 2009</xref>) while the OM182 clade is seasonally abundant in Antarctic surface waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Grzymski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Murray and Grzymski, 2007</xref>). A representative from the OM60 clade was reported in Arctic pack ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brinkmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), but no members of the OM182 clade have previously been identified from sea ice.

The recent genome sequence of Antarctic seawater isolate <italic>Polaribacter irgensii</italic> strain 23-P (GenBank accession: AAOG00000000) may help elucidate their adaptations to sea ice, just as the genome sequence analysis of <italic>Polaribacter</italic> MED152 has revealed their adaptations to sunlit surface waters (e.g. rhodopsins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this study, preferential entrainment of <italic>Polaribacter</italic> spp. into sea ice was inconclusive, because they were also detected in under-ice seawater by both cloning and ARISA, but the high intra-specific ITS variability we observed may prove useful in future tests of ecotype differentiation by these successful sea ice colonizing bacteria.</p><p>Overall, the dominant presence of common seawater microorganisms and the absence of many known sea ice microorganisms in the Arctic winter ice we studied indicate that species-specific mortality during the winter was rare. The degree of similarity between winter ice and seawater communities also implies that selection during the freezing process must have been relatively minor. The distinctive nature of well-known microbial communities in sea ice of the warmer biologically productive seasons must not be predetermined by selective survival of community members exposed to freezing and severe winter conditions, but rather as a result of competitive outgrowth by copiotrophs that overwinter below detection limit or arrive as immigrants once the warming ice becomes permeable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Ice core and seawater sampling</title><p>Sampling location and procedures have been reported in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins and colleagues (2008</xref>), along with measurements of air and ice temperature, bulk ice and brine salinity, brine volume fraction, and content of total particulate matter, bacterial abundance and pEPS in the ice.

After subsampling for other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), the remainder of each melted sample was gently filtered onto a 47 mm diameter 0.22-&#x000b5;m-nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for later DNA extraction.</p><p>Under-ice seawater samples were collected on calendar days 35 and 88 by lowering a hand-held 2 l Niskin bottle through a hole in the ice to the base of the ice sheet. Designated 35-SW and 88-SW, the seawater samples, each with a salinity of 30, were returned to the ship, filtered immediately, and the filters stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, as for fully melted sea ice samples.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction</title><p>Within 2 years of collection, each filter was removed from storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and cut into small fragments with sterilized scissors. For horizons II and III, all three filters (one from each of the three ice cores) from each sampling day were combined in a single tube. In horizon I, due to low DNA yields, six filters &#x02013; three from each of two sampling days in adjacent weeks &#x02013; were combined in a single tube, i.e. from the following pairs of calendar sampling days: 10 and 17, 24 and 31, 60 and 67, and 74 and 81. Each tube then received, per filter, 800 &#x000b5;l of STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and 40 &#x000b5;l of 20% SDS. After incubation at 65&#x000b0;C for 20 min, each tube was vortexed, then centrifuged at 1400 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The supernate was transferred to a Centricon YM-100 centrifugal filtration device (Millipore) to concentrate and de-salt the genomic DNA, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The recovered volume was increased to 600 &#x000b5;l with TE buffer before three rounds of phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation and re-suspension in 50 &#x000b5;l of TE buffer. Total DNA concentration was measured in a SpectraMaxM2 plate reader (Molecular Devices) using PicoGreen fluorescence (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Recovery of genomic DNA was &#x0003c; 1&#x02013;33% based on cell counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), assuming 2.5 fg of DNA per bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Button and Robertson, 2001</xref>). No attempt was made to separate the DNA of viable cells from that of dead cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Community fingerprinting</title><p>Bacterial DNA fragments were PCR-amplified for ARISA using fluorescently labelled (6-HEX) forward primer Uni1392F, and unlabelled reverse primer R23S-125R (sequences located in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Amplified bacterial DNA was pooled from two PCR amplifications, each containing 3&#x02013;117 ng of total DNA. Partial archaeal 16S rRNA genes were PCR-amplified for T-RFLP using fluorescently labelled (6-FAM) forward primer Arch109F, and unlabelled reverse primer Arch915R. Amplified archaeal DNA from four PCR amplifications was pooled, then digested with restriction enzyme HpyCH4III at 37&#x000b0;C for 6 h, which was determined empirically to enable complete digestion without overdigestion. PCR amplifications using archaeal primers were generally more robust than with bacterial primers, even though archaeal abundance was likely only a few per cent of the bacterial abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Junge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), a phenomenon which has also been observed in a highly saline Arctic spring system (T. Niederberger, pers. comm.). All DNA fragments were analysed on a MegaBACE1000 capillary gel electrophoresis instrument (Molecular Dynamics).</p><p>Electropherograms were analysed using DAx analysis software (v8.0, Van Mierlo Software Consultancy). A low-pass Fourier transform was applied to ARISA electropherograms to reduce noise and increase peak calling efficiency. Heights of saturated peaks in several T-RFLP electropherograms were estimated by fitting a Gaussian function to the non-saturated points, using the open-source statistical package R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">R Development Core Team, 2008</xref>). For both ARISA and T-RFLP, a peak was called if its height was &#x0003e; 5&#x000d7; the baseline root-mean-square noise level (&#x0003c; 1.0% of the cumulative peak height for each profile). Profiles with cumulative peak heights less than 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> RFUs (ARISA) or 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> RFUs (T-RFLP) were removed from the analysis. The peaks in the remaining samples were binned using in-house software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rocaplab.ocean.washington.edu/cgi/dakster/index.html">http://rocaplab.ocean.washington.edu/cgi/dakster/index.html</ext-link>) and distance cut-offs of 1 bp for fragment lengths of 70&#x02013;700 bp, 2 bp for 700&#x02013;1200 bp and 4 bp for &#x0003e; 1200 bp. Each bin, representing a 16S-ITS-23S ribosomal DNA fragment (ARISA) or terminal restriction fragment (T-RFLP), was designated an OTU. The cumulative peaks heights of each OTU were used as gross measures of relative abundance to compare fingerprinting with clone libraries. A presence/absence matrix containing OTUs with at least one peak height greater than 1.0% (ARISA) or 0.25% (T-RFLP) of the sample's cumulative peak height was used for calculation of richness and pairwise similarity, and non-parametric multivariate analyses, performed with PRIMER v6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Clarke and Gorley, 2006</xref>). Pairwise distances were calculated as S&#x000f8;rensen's similarity coefficient (C_s = 2C/(A + B), where A and B are the number of OTUs in each of two samples, and C is the number of shared OTUs between the two samples; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Hughes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>); samples were then clustered by Group Average and the significance of each cluster was calculated by SIMPROF at the 95% confidence level. Pearson correlation coefficients for S&#x000f8;rensen's similarity with date were calculated in R, as were partial Pearson correlation coefficients for richness with date controlling for the cumulative peak height of each profile. A correlation function in the open-source plotting program Qtiplot was used to calculate the point of maximum covariance between ARISA RFUs and clone library phylotype frequencies to correct for different running rates of fluorescent labels 6-HEX and ROX (used for the ARISA ladder), resulting in an adjustment of ARISA OTU lengths by &#x02212;7 bp, near the &#x02212;5.5 bp difference determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Hahn and colleagues (2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clone library construction and sequencing</title><p>Four clone libraries were constructed for phylogenetic analysis, using the ribosomal RNA operon, from two samples: under-ice seawater from day 35, used to create libraries FB04bw and FB04aw; and winter sea ice from horizon I (combined days 74 and 81), used to create libraries FB04bi and FB04ai, where FB04 = Franklin Bay 2004, b = <italic>Bacteria</italic>, a = <italic>Archaea</italic>, w = water and i = ice. Bacterial 16S-ITS-23S ribosomal DNA was amplified using primer pair Uni515F/R23S-125R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Archaeal 16S ribosomal DNA was amplified using primer pair Arch21F/Arch958R. Four separate amplifications were performed for each sample and each was reconditioned using 1/10 of the PCR product as template for an additional four cycles with fresh reaction mix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The pooled reconditioned PCR product was cloned using the TOPO-TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Bacterial clone libraries were subjected to dye-termination sequencing at the High-Throughput Genomics Unit (HTGU), Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington. Archaeal clone libraries were sequenced on a MegaBACE1000 capillary gel electrophoresis instrument. Bi-directional double-stranded sequences were obtained for &#x0003e; 900 bp of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the complete ITS region for <italic>Bacteria</italic>. Sequencher software (v4.6, Gene Codes Corp.) was used to call bases and construct contigs which were checked and edited manually as necessary. Most of the bacterial sequences included the 16S&#x02013;23S ITS region, which we excluded from phylogenetic analyses but from which we calculated predicted ARISA fragment lengths and defined subtypes of 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. Seventeen sequences related to <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophila</italic> were removed from the bacterial sea ice library as probable contaminants. ARISA fragment lengths predicted from these sequences (777 and 779 bp) overlapped with those predicted from other clone library sequences, but these fragments were observed only rarely in the ARISA data set. Bacterial sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession No. EU836892&#x02013;EU837057 and FJ753995&#x02013;FB754002; archaeal sequences: EU486859&#x02013;EU486955; and eukaryotic sequences: FJ753982&#x02013;FJ753994.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Small-subunit ribosomal rRNA gene sequences were aligned using the NAST aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Desantis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) at Greengenes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://greengenes.lbl.gov">http://greengenes.lbl.gov</ext-link>). All sequences were checked for chimeras with Bellerophon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Huber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and Mallard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ashelford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); none were detected.

Bootstrapped phylogenetic trees were constructed in <sc>paup</sc>* v4.10beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Swofford, 2003</xref>). ModelTest was used to determine the optimal nucleotide substitution model for maximum likelihood tree construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Posada and Crandall, 1998</xref>). In ARB, partial sequences were added to the tree by parsimony and assigned phylotypes based on their location within the tree. Distance matrices calculated in <sc>paup</sc>* using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Tamura and Nei (1993</xref>) model of nucleotide substitution were used with WebLIBSHUFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Schloss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) to compare clone libraries statistically, and with <sc>dotur</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Schloss and Handelsman, 2005</xref>) to define phylotypes and calculate estimates of species richness and diversity using the Chao1 and Shannon indices respectively. Phylotypes were defined by &#x0003e; 98% similarity for bacterial sequences and &#x0003e; 99% for archaeal sequences. Subtypes were designated if multiple fingerprinting fragments were predicted within any single phylotype. The archaeal sequences were subsequently used to aid the choice of restriction enzymes for community profiling by T-RFLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Collins and Rocap, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the officers and crew of the CCGS Amundsen for logistical support, S.
