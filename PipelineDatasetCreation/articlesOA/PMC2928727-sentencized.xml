</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of known bacterial enteritis in Europe and in the US, and the second-most cause (following Salmonella infections) in many other countries [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Campylobacteriosis is often food-transmitted, and frequently attributed to the consumption and handling of poultry meat [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Chickens are commonly asymptomatically colonized with C. jejuni, and, depending on the season and country, 20% to 100% of flocks can be found positive at slaughter [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Contamination of carcasses occurs during processing, so that up to 80% of retail poultry meat is positive for Campylobacter in countries like the UK [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>There is considerable circumstantial evidence from epidemiological studies, like case control investigations, that poultry is a major attributable source of human infection with C. jejuni. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Molecular epidemiological investigations also provide supporting evidence in that the Campylobacter populations in the human and chicken hosts substantially overlap [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, there is a wide diversity of C. jejuni strains in poultry flocks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These strains vary in both ability to survive the environmental stresses during processing and in putative virulence properties, such as invasiveness and toxin expression [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Given this diversity it seems likely that many of these strains may be non-pathogenic i.e. not cause disease in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Either they lack virulence factors, do not colonize humans, or are not persistent during slaughter, processing and storage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the virulence pathway or pathways by which C. jejuni causes disease are still enigmatic, not least because of the lack of a reliable animal model of disease [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The first complete genome sequence of a C. jejuni strain was published in 2001 for C. jejuni strain 11168 [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This laboratory-adapted strain was originally isolated from a case of campylobacteriosis in 1977. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This strain displays a number of aberrant phenotypic characteristics, such as poor motility, an atypical straight body morphology, and poor colonization in chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In contrast a minimally-subcultured variant of the original clinical isolate displayed normal characteristics [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The virulence potential in humans of the sequenced variant is unknown, but other strains with impaired motility have been shown to have reduced virulence in a human volunteer study [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Genome sequences of other C. jejuni strains have since become publicly available, but for none of these sequenced organisms direct evidence exists of virulence in humans, or of transmissability from chicken to humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For example, the sequenced C. jejuni strain 81116 [16] was originally isolated from a human case during a outbreak of campylobacteriosis in a school [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This outbreak was hypothesized to be due to the fecal contamination of drinking water by wild birds, but this was unconfirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Strain CG8486 is a recent clinical isolate, but has no stated epidemiological association with poultry [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In contrast, strain RM1221 was isolated from chicken [19], but its virulence potential in humans remains untested. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Following a research visit to a poultry abattoir, one surveillance team member developed campylobacteriosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The strains isolated from the patient and from the poultry flock sampled at the abattoir were identical by serotyping, fla typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, amplified fragment polymorphism and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), thus providing evidence of the direct transmission of pathogenic Campylobacter from a poultry source to a human. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The complete genome sequence of this strain, laboratory number 99/308, but designated here by its common name of M1, was determined in anticipation that its gene content would contain both colonization factors for chicken and virulence factors for human disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>With rapid advances in sequencing technologies and the subsequent explosion in the amount of available sequence data, it is now possible to describe microbial genomes not only as individual entities, but also to analyze their collective pan- and core genomes [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>A core genome was first defined by Lan and Reeves (2000) [21] as comprising those genes present in almost all individuals of a species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The pan-genome was introduced by Tettelin and coworkers [22] as comprising any gene observed in the species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>For defining the core and pan-genome, genes are considered members of a gene family when they share significant homology, using specified criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In this work we describe the comparison of the complete genome of C. jejuni M1 with other complete C. jejuni genome sequences. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Additional characterization showed the strain to be without detectable plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Further the M1 strain displays a low invasiveness to INT407 and CaCO2 cell lines [24] and to express low CDT activity as measured by in vitro assays (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The genome sequence of strain M1 obtained from paired end reads, consisted of 18 contigs that were oriented using in-house perl scripts, and then assembled into a complete genome using directed PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To ensure the genome sequence corresponded with the human isolate, an in silico MLST was performed indicating Sequence Type 137 in accordance with the results obtained in vitro. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>A number of Campylobacter genes have been previously described as being related to chicken colonization and/or mediating adherence and invasion of human cells in vitro, on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis causing substantial loss of colonization or invasion potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes were present in strain M1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>For example, cadF, which encodes the Campylobacter adhesion to fibronectin protein and is important in chicken colonization [25], [26], [27], jlpA [28] and peb1A, which encodes a 27-kDa putative adhesin [29] were identified as CJM1_1423, CJM1_0958 and CJM1_0885, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In addition porA, which encodes the C. jejuni 43-kDa major outer membrane protein (MOMP), which is a porin and a potential adhesin [30], was identified as CJM1_1240. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>A putative adhesin Cj1279c, recently designated as fibronectin-like protein A coded by flpA, which has been shown as being required for efficient cell adherence and chicken colonization [31], was identified as CJM1_1260. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Another putative Campylobacter invasion-associated gene [33], tentatively named ciaC but otherwise known as Cj1242, is identical to CJM1_1224. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Completely absent is capA, an autotransporter protein reported to be associated with both adherence to human epithelial cells and the colonization of chickens [34]. </plain></SENT>
