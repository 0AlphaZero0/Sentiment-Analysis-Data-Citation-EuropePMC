Two gH/gL complexes are used for entry into cells. gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) shows no selectivity for its host cell, whereas formation of a gH/gL/gO complex only restricts the tropism mainly to fibroblasts. Here, we describe that depending on the cell type in which virus replication takes place, virus carrying the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex is either released or retained cell-associated. We observed that virus spread in fibroblast cultures was predominantly supernatant-driven, whereas spread in endothelial cell (EC) cultures was predominantly focal. This was due to properties of virus released from fibroblasts and EC. Fibroblasts released virus which could infect both fibroblasts and EC. In contrast, EC released virus which readily infected fibroblasts, but was barely able to infect EC. The EC infection capacities of virus released from fibroblasts or EC correlated with respectively high or low amounts of gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) in virus particles. Moreover, we found that focal spread in EC cultures could be attributed to EC-tropic virus tightly associated with EC and not released into the supernatant. Preincubation of fibroblast-derived virus progeny with EC or beads coated with pUL131A-specific antibodies depleted the fraction that could infect EC, and left a fraction that could predominantly infect fibroblasts. These data strongly suggest that HCMV progeny is composed of distinct virus populations. EC specifically retain the EC-tropic population, whereas fibroblasts release EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus. Our findings offer completely new views on how HCMV spread may be controlled by its host cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>gH/gL complexes of herpesviruses are supposed to promote fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The gH/gL core complex associates with additional proteins which define the tropism for certain cell types by promoting binding to specific receptors. Two alternative gH/gL complexes of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) define the cell tropism, the entry pathway and the spread of virus. Formation of a gH/gL/gO complex during infection determines release of infectious virus into the supernatant. The gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex determines the tropism for endothelial cells (EC) and promotes focal spread. Here, we could show that HCMV-infected cells produce EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus populations. While fibroblasts release both populations into the supernatant, EC predominantly release the non EC-tropic population. Different host cells of HCMV thus may direct the distribution of virus progeny.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is ubiquitously distributed in the human population. In immunocompetent adults infections are mainly asymptomatic, but in immunocompromised patients like transplant recipients or AIDS patients life threatening infections occur at a high rate. HCMV is also the leading cause of birth defects among congenitally transmitted viral infections. HCMV replicates <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in many different host cells including epithelial cells, connective tissue cells, hepatocytes, various leukocyte populations and vascular endothelial cells (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Sinzger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). The broad host cell range implicates that either an ubiquitous cellular receptor, recognized by one protein or protein complex in the viral envelope, mediates entry, or that HCMV uses elaborate combinations of different viral envelope proteins to employ different cellular receptors. More than 10 glycoproteins have been identified in HCMV particles <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Varnum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, including the essential glycoproteins gB, gH, gL, gM and gN, which all play a role in the virus entry process <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Britt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001256-Kinzler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

During virus production in B-cells, gp42 is intracellularly targeted to HLA-DR &#x000df;, where it is vulnerable for degradation. Consequently, B-cells release virus particles, which are low in gH/gL/gp42. This virus is directed towards epithelial cells. Epithelial cells on the other hand do not express HLA-DR &#x000df; and produce virus which is high in gH/gL/gp42 and is directed to B-cells <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Borza1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, the EBV host cell tropism is switched by alternate replication in B- or epithelial cells.

EC-tropism could be depleted from fibroblast-derived virus progeny, indicating that this progeny is composed of distinct populations of virus particles with different EC infection capacities.

Here, we infected fibroblasts and EC with the HCMV strains VR1814 and TB40/E, two clinical isolates passaged on endothelial cells, and vTB40-BAC4, a virus derived from TB40/E and cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Infections were performed at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), and 2 or 8 days after infection cells were stained for HCMV immediate early 1 (ie1) protein expression. Numbers of initially infected HFF or EC were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, VR1814, day 2 and data not shown).

HFF and EC equally released high amounts of virus into their supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). As spread of infection in EC cultures was focal although EC released virus in abundance, focal spread might be due to the inability of EC supernatant virus to infect EC. Indeed, although HFF and EC supernatants comparably infected fibroblasts, the capacities of EC-derived supernatants to infect EC were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

This correlated with the lower HUVEC infection capacity of EC-derived supernatants when compared to the TIME cell infection capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Quantification of HCMV infection capacities using a TB40-BAC4-derived virus expressing firefly luciferase</title><p>Infection capacities on different cell types are often compared by methods, which depend on counting infected cells which are either stained for viral antigen or GFP- expression. These methods reach their technical limits, when the infection capacities strongly differ on the cell types to be tested. It is very difficult to obtain reliable cell counts on the less permissive cell type, without at the same time saturating infection on the more permissive cells. Saturation yet, would lead to an overestimation of the infection capacity on the less permissive cells, when related to the more permissive cells.</p><p>To circumvent these problems and to simplify the analysis, we used a luciferase reporter virus to monitor infection. An SV40 promoter-driven luciferase expression cassette was inserted into BAC4-FRT5-9, a TB40-BAC4-derived BACmid lacking the genes UL5 to UL9 and carrying an FRT site at the position of the deleted locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001256.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>).

The luciferase signals obtained from HFF and TIME cell infections were related to each other and expressed as TIME/HFF infection ratios, and thus, represent relative EC infection capacities. After infection, phosphono acetic acid (PAA) was added to block the viral DNA replication and the further amplification of the luciferase signal. Thus, the luciferase activity evaluates infection of cells in a fashion analogous to staining cells for HCMV ie1 protein expression. Indeed, when infection with one and the same virus preparation was evaluated either by counting ie1-positive cells or by measuring the luciferase activity in cell lysates, both methods always gave comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and data not shown).

The amounts of gB and gH in virus pellets from HFF and EC supernatants always showed a constant relation (data not shown).

Remarkably, the pUL128/gB ratios mirror the TIME/HFF infection ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lower panel).

Cells were washed to remove loosely bound virus and then homogenized using cell douncers. Aliquots of the total homogenates, containing the disrupted cells and virus freed by cell disruption, were saved. Homogenates were then cleared by centrifugation at 3,500&#x000d7;g to separate supernatants containing virus, which can be released by physical disruption. The pellets of cell debris, containing virus which is not released from cells, were also resuspended. These four preparations were then tested on HFF and TIME cells by the luciferase assay. Virus supernatants from HFF and HUVEC showed a high and a low EC infection capacity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Virus released from HFF is highly EC-tropic and virus found in the particulate fraction of disrupted HFF rather shows a lower tropism for EC. One explanation would be that HCMV progeny is heterogeneous and consists of distinct virus populations with regard to their EC-tropism. EC show a propensity to retain EC-tropic virus and release non EC-tropic virus, whereas HFF readily release both, EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus. The hypothesis, that HFF progeny is a mixture of EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus is testable by separation of EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus. As HUVEC strongly retain EC-tropic virus, they might serve to specifically bind EC-tropic virus and deplete HFF virus progeny of its EC-tropic fraction. We preincubated HFF-derived supernatant virus with HUVEC or with HFF, pelleted the cells, and analysed the HFF and TIME cell infectivity of virus remaining in the supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Preincubation with HUVEC removed about 30 to 90&#x00025; and preincubation with HFF about 99&#x00025; of the infectious virus from supernatants, when tested on HFF (data not shown). The TIME/HFF infection ratios of the non-bound virus in supernatants preincubated with HUVEC was drastically and significantly reduced to the level observed in supernatants of HCMV-infected HUVEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Preincubation with HFF in contrast, although it removed the bulk of infectivity, only weakly reduced the EC infection propensity of the non-bound virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Thus, HUVEC, which retained EC-tropic virus in infection, were a good matrix for binding EC-tropic virus, whereas HFF, which readily released EC-tropic virus into the supernatant, were a weak matrix for EC-tropic virus. The depletion of EC-tropism strongly suggested that HFF virus progeny was heterogeneous and composed of distinct virus populations, which could be sorted. To find out whether the depletion of EC-tropism is based on removing virus particles expressing the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex, we coincubated HFF-derived virus progeny with protein G sepharose beads to which we had bound anti-pUL131A antibodies.

For EBV it has been described that in infected B-cells HLA-DR &#x000df; binds the gp42 protein of the gH/gL/gp42 complex, which promotes B-cell infection, holds it back intracellularly, and thus, makes it vulnerable for degradation. As a consequence, B-cells release mainly virions containing a two-part gH/gL complex, which cannot infect B-cells. Epithelial cells, which do not express HLA-DR &#x000df;, do not retain gp42 and thus, release virus, which contains more of the three-part gH/gL/gp42 complex. The mechanisms, by which the differences in the released populations of virions in HCMV are achieved, appear to be different. For HCMV, we found that EC and fibroblasts produce heterogeneous virus progenies. EC release a virus progeny, which is not EC-tropic, and retain a progeny, which is highly EC-tropic. HFF release an EC-tropic progeny. which can be depleted of its EC-tropism by using HUVEC or protein G sepharose beads coated with antibodies directed against pUL131A. This strongly suggested that HFF progeny is composed of distinct EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus populations, and that the EC-tropic population most likely is a population with a high gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) content. If HFF-derived virus progeny was homogeneous, a specific depletion only of EC-tropic virus would not be possible. Interestingly, HUVEC, which retain EC-tropic virus in infection experiments, were a good matrix to retain EC-tropic virus in the test tube, whereas HFF, which readily release EC-tropic virus in infections, were a bad matrix.</p><p>Thus, we propose that the difference in cell tropism of virus released from EC and fibroblasts is the result of a sorting process. EC strongly and specifically retain EC-tropic virus through the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex. HFF release EC-tropic and non EC-tropic virus. Thus, for HCMV, not protein components of gH/gL complexes are retained in a cell-type specific manner, but rather mature virions carrying the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex in their envelopes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g007">Figure 7</xref> depicts the EBV and HCMV models for virus spread side by side.</p><fig id="ppat-1001256-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1001256.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>HCMV and EBV models for virus spread in cell culture.</title><p>The EBV model proposes a switch of cell tropism through depletion of gp42 from B-cell derived virus progeny resulting in a gp42<sub>low</sub> progeny versus a gp42<sub>high</sub> progeny released from epithelial cells.

An attractive model would be a mechanism as described for MHV-68, for which it has been shown that virus particles attached to and moving on plasma membrane fronds are directly transferred to neighboring cells <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Assuming that gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complexes are incorporated into virus progeny at random, EC-tropism of a virus particle might be defined by a threshold level of gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complexes. Accordingly, high levels of gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complexes in turn could also block release from EC. Thus, the levels of gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complexes could define whether a particle is EC-tropic or not, whether it is retained by EC during infection, and whether it can be depleted from supernatants by EC-preincubation. This could also explain, why progeny of a &#x00394;gO virus, which expresses only the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex, readily spreads cell-associated and can barely be released from EC <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Wille1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. &#x00394;gO virus progeny can equally well infect EC and HFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Wildtype TB40-BAC4 virus progeny, in contrast, shows a higher propensity to infect HFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001256-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), which could be explained by being a mixture of EC-tropic and non EC-tropic particles.</p><p>For EBV, it has been observed that virus bound to the surface of resting B cells is 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> times more infectious for epithelial cells than cell-free virus <xref rid="ppat.1001256-ShannonLowe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. For HCMV it has not yet been tested whether surface-bound virus could promote a switch of cell tropism.</p><p>We restricted our experiments to endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells also strictly depend on the gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) complex for their infection. Whether their infection also follows the pattern of the EC infection shown here, will have to be investigated in the future. Recently, it has been published by Wang et al. <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> that HCMV progenies derived from epithelial cells and fibroblast also differ. They reported that both cell types release progenies which can readily infect epithelial cells and fibroblasts, but differ with respect to the pathway they use to enter epithelial cells. They found a twofold higher gH/gL/pUL(128,130,131A) content in epithelial cell-derived particles, which they considered as marginal. As they used an AD169 mutant, in which UL131A had been repaired, it will have to be clarified, whether their findings reflect that epitheliotropic virus produced in epithelial cells is, in contrast to our findings in EC, not retained, or whether the observed differences are due to differences of the HCMV strains used. It has recently been shown that AD169 incorporates gO into virions, whereas HCMV strain TR does not <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Ryckman2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This suggests that strain-specific differences may indeed affect gH/gL-dependent processes.</p><p>Whether our observations made in cell culture, reflect features valid for all HCMV strains, and what role a switch in tropism and spread patterns may play <italic>in vivo</italic>, will be the subject of future research. It will be of particular interest to find out whether the relative propensity of different cell types to release virus plays a crucial role in establishment of infection and transfer of virus to new hosts or the fetus. For HCMV, it has been shown that primary isolation of EC-tropic virus depends on infected cells as a source of virus, whereas fibroblast infection can also be achieved with cell-free virus sources like throat washes and amniotic fluid <xref rid="ppat.1001256-Gerna2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This might already be an indication that cells lining the compartments, where these fluids are produced, do not release EC-tropic virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) (PromoCell, Germany) were used from passage 12 to 22 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin.
