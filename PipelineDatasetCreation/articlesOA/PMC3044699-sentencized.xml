</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Aniridia (AN; OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/106210">106210</ext-link>) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>About two-thirds of AN cases are families with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the remaining third no family history is found. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The aniridia gene was first mapped on chromosome 11p13 by linkage analysis, and then isolated by positional cloning in 1991 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The PAX6 (paired box gene 6) gene spans 22 kilobases and contains 14 exons, including an alternatively splicing exon5a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there are two isoforms: PAX6 (−5a), comprising 422 amino acids, and PAX6 (+5a), comprising 436 amino acids [2,3]. PAX6 encodes a transcription factor that is involved in several development pathways and is expressed early in the development of the eye, numerous regions of the brain, and the pancreas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>PAX6 contains an NH2-terminal paired domain, a homeodomain separated by a glycine-rich linker sequence, and a COOH-terminal proline-serine-threonine rich transregulatory domain [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Most aniridia cases are caused by intragenic mutations of PAX6, which include nonsense mutations, splicing mutations, frame-shifting insertions or deletions, in-frame insertions or deletions, missense mutations, and run-on mutations [2-7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/194072">194072</ext-link>) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe the clinical findings in two Chinese families with two different large deletions in the region of PAX6. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>In this study, we described two Chinese families with aniridia and other ocular abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>Using MLPA, a large deletion, including PAX6, DKFZ p686k1684, and RCN1, was identified in family 85; a deletion of ELP4 and DCDC1, leaving PAX6 intact, was found in family 86. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>The two deletions were co- segregated with the phenotype in the families, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>Until now, almost 300 intragenic mutations of PAX6 have been documented in the PAX6 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lsdb.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/home.php?select_db=PAX6">allelic variation</ext-link> database [2-7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>Most of the intragenic mutations lead to premature protein truncation, which is likely to be acted on by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>By reviewing the literature on genotype-phenotype correlation studies, the mutations that introduce premature terminated codons (PTCs) are consistently associated with aniridia or closely related phenotypes [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="544" pm="."><plain>The patient carrying the complete deletion of PAX6, observed by Vincent et al. [15], did not present distinctive or more severe clinical manifestations than those associated with nonsense mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>However, more severe bilateral visual impairment was observed in all the patients of family 85. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>The proband’s father and brother totally lost their sight at the age of 40 due to glaucoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>Several patients showed foveal hypoplasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>The large deletion detected in family 85 was novel and contained not only the complete PAX6 gene but also DKFZ p686k1684 and RCN1, which are located about 300 kb upstream of PAX6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>RCN1 (reticulocalbin 1), resident in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a Ca2+ binding protein that participates in the secretory pathway and is expressed in the eye [20].Linkage between Pax6 and Rcn1 has been conserved in mice, humans, and fish [21]. Pax6 was originally isolated in the mouse and mutations in the gene are responsible for the small eye phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>The mouse small eye phenotype had already been suggested through homology mapping to be the mouse counterpart of human aniridia [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>Recently, Favel et al. [21] observed that the mouse, carrying a heterozygous Pax6 and Rcn1 contiguous deletion, presented an extreme microphthalmia phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>They inferred that Rcn1 might directly or indirectly contribute to the eye phenotype in Pax6 contiguous gene deletions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>The severe visual impairment observed in family 85 seemed to be consistent with the phenotypes found in the mouse described by Favel et al. [21]. DKFZ p686k1684, located between PAX6 and RCN1, is a non-coding RNA with its function unclear[23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>The 3′ deletion identified in family 86 contained ELP4 and DCD4, which are located downstream of PAX6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>The deletions in this region, which contains 3′ regulatory elements for PAX6, were documented in several earlier studies [12-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>Most patients harboring the 3′ deletions had only aniridia and other ocular abnormalities, which is similar to the phenotype observed in most nonsense mutations patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>The patients in family 86 showed mild vision impairments due to aniridia and congenital cataracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>Davis et al. [18] described a patient carrying a 1.3 Mb deletion, including several additional genes expressed in the brain, who also presented with autism and mental retardation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>In this study, the aniridia in both families was caused by large deletions in the PAX6 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>In general, patients with PAX6 contiguous deletion, including RCN1, may have relatively severe phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>Large deletions may account for several Chinese families and sporadic cases with aniridia and screening for these kinds of alterations should be included in the aniridia patient’s analysis. </plain></SENT>
