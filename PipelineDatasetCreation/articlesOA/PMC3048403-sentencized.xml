</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Ovarian cancer accounts for only 3% of diagnosed cancers, but is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among woman, with five-year survival rates of only 45% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The average age of diagnosis is 63 years of age, and most patients (62%) present with metastatic disease at time of diagnosis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease with various histo- or clinicopathological subtypes that develop and present differently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The conventional view is that approximately 90% of ovarian cancers are derived from the single-cell layer of surface epithelium that surrounds the ovary [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As the ovarian epithelium transforms into a malignant phenotype, it differentiates into several subtypes that have been categorized into serous, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma, based on their morphology rather than their genotype [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the origin of individual subtypes may vary and a higher contribution from fallopian tubes and the endometrium to more aggressive cancers is currently in discussion [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The origin of both ovarian and fallopian epithelial is the same, namely the coelomic epithelium [2] which may contribute to the controversy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Epithelial ovarian cancers show a high degree of genetic heterogeneity as a result of mutations, silencing, and deletions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Since changes in gene expression, either through mutation, epigenetic regulation, or differential splicing events, influence tumor development, progression, drug responsiveness and ultimately the survival of the patient, the identification of the tumor subtype and its genetic fingerprint is essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new classification of epithelial ovarian tumors into type I and type II cancers has been proposed: type 1 are benign to borderline tumors with relatively stable genotypes while type II includes aggressive and high grade tumors that are genetically instable and exhibit substantial genetic changes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Most epithelial cancers follow a progression scheme in which initiated cells progress to adenomas to adenocarcinomas and metastasis, accumulating genetic alterations in a stepwise manner during progression [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This sequence has also been described for low-grade ovarian carcinomas; it is, however, debated if all ovarian cancers follow this cancer development since precursor lesions for the most aggressive ovarian tumors (type II) have not been conclusively identified [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recently, Lee et al. have proposed that the fimbria of the fallopian tube may be the origin for “Type II” serous carcinomas cells [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>They propose that type II tumors arise from “p53 signature” precursor lesions originating from amplification of secretory epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Subsequent mutations then facilitate progression to serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma and ultimately to serous carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Currently, gene expression patterns have only been used successfully to distinguish between mucinous and clear cell from serous carcinomas [8] or between low-grade, low malignant potential and high-grade, metastatic tumors [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Reliable molecular or clinical markers to identify changes in the early stages of progression have not been established yet, and since the early stages of the disease are relatively asymptomatic the diagnosis often only occurs at late stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the characterization of gene expression profiles of early stage precursor lesions of ovarian cancer could provide new insights and identify novel targets for preventive and treatment efforts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We have previously developed and characterized a cell model of epithelial ovarian cancer progression to study the sequence of events that lead to epithelial ovarian cancer [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The syngeneic mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells, derived from the C57BL6 mice, have undergone spontaneous transformation in cell culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The heterogeneous MOSE cells undergo distinct phenotypical changes as they are continuously passaged in culture, with early passages representing a premalignant, non-tumorigenic phenotype, intermediate passages representing a transitional phenotype, and later passages progressing to a highly aggressive malignant phenotype when administered to immunocompetent mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Transitional states of progression were distinguishable by alterations in growth rates, cell size, loss of contact inhibition of growth, and the capacity to grow as spheroids under non-adherent conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Importantly, both the MOSE-I (intermediate passage) and MOSE-L (late passage) cells have also acquired the capacity to form tumors when injected into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic immunocompetent mice, albeit the former was less invasive [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we identified significant changes in gene expression patterns as non-transformed MOSE-derived cells transition to more aggressive phenotypes and used gene ontology tools to determine their functional categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The transitional states of this model allowed us to identify stage-dependent genes, gene products and signal transduction pathways involved in ovarian tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Here we highlight progressive changes that lead to a highly dysregulated cytoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Many of these changes were confirmed in archived human ovarian cancer microarray data sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we demonstrate that cytoskeleton disorganization can have profound effects on the subcellular localization of important signaling intermediates, which ultimately may lead to modulated signaling pathways contributing to ovarian cancer development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These genes, their gene products and the associated signaling pathways may represent novel targets for early intervention of neoplastic progression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To identify gene expression changes during the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer and determine potential stage-specific patterns, we used whole genome microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels in cells representing benign (MOSE-E), intermediate (MOSE-I), and malignant (MOSE-L) stages of mouse ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Three biological replicates were used to take into account variations within the heterogeneous cultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Of the 45,102 probe sets on the microarray (representing 18,136 annotated genes), 960 probe sets were found to be significantly up-regulated (701 annotated genes) and 1006 were significantly down-regulated (711 annotated genes) greater that 2 fold (p≤0.05) between MOSE-E and MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Of these 1966 changing probe sets, 58.9% exhibited no significant change in expression levels during the progression between MOSE-E and MOSE-I, indicating the majority of changes in gene expression are associated with later events in the malignant progression in our model, with 608 increasing and 549 decreasing as cells transition from MOSE-I to MOSE-L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 33.3% of the affected genes showed a progressive increase (272 probe sets) or decrease (382 probe sets) in expression as cells transition from MOSE-E to MOSE-I to MOSE-L cells (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A small number of affected probes sets, 3.9%, demonstrated MOSE-I/MOSE-E ratios that were within 0.4 fold of MOSE-L/MOSE-E ratios, indicating that these gene expression changes may be associated with very early events in malignant progression of our cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Together these data indicate that most of the changes in gene expression levels either occur continually, in a stepwise fashion, throughout the progression of our model or take place in later stages while only a limited subset change during early stages. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To detect pathways that may contribute to the promotion and progression of ovarian cancer, the Gene Trail program was used to identify the functional categories of genes that demonstrate statistically significant changes in their expression levels between MOSE-E and MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Gene Trail is an advanced gene set enrichment analysis tool that determines over-represented gene ontology categories in data sets [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The over-represented cellular component, biological process, and molecular function gene ontology categories found in the MOSE-L versus MOSE-E differentially expressed gene sets are listed in Table 1 (p&lt;0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Over-representation of genes in the cell cycle and cell proliferation categories was anticipated due to the previously reported increased growth rate of the MOSE-L cells [12] and the involvement of the uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the cytoskeleton and Metal Ion/Cation binding categories represented a significant number of the differentially expressed genes, with a substantial overlap of genes categorized in both of these ontology categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to the broad range of functions of the genes in the Metal Ion/Cation binding category, genes compiled in the cytoskeleton gene ontology category were functionally very specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Since it is thought that changes in the expression levels of cytoskeletal proteins and their regulators are associated with progression and metastasis [15], [16], [17], the changes in genes involved in the structure and regulation of the cytoskeleton during progression of our MOSE model were the subject of further investigation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1122" pm="."><plain>To determine the mechanisms of cytoskeletal deregulation during MOSE malignant progression, we investigated the expression levels and subcellular localization of several regulatory proteins, including α-actinin, vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1123" pm="."><plain>These proteins were chosen because of their involvement in cytoskeleton regulation, cell motility, and cancer progression/metastasis. α-actinin is involved in actin bundling by cross-linking actin filaments and is part of the focal adhesion complex that links the actin cytoskeleton to integrins [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1124" pm="."><plain>The microarray results indicated progressively decreasing α-actinin expression levels which were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Table 2). α-actinin protein levels were significantly decreased in both MOSE-I and MOSE-L cells compared to MOSE-E cells (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1125" pm="."><plain>A distinct co-localization of α-actinin (red) with actin filaments (green) running parallel to the leading edge was always readily apparent in MOSE-E cells (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1126" pm="."><plain>In MOSE-L cells, α-actinin appeared largely as diffuse staining in the cytoplasm with considerably less evident co-localiziation with actin filaments (Figure 3B, red). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1127" pm="."><plain>This was also observed in MOSE-I cells (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1128" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy indicated α-actinin did not co-localize to the very short actin filaments and disorganized actin found in MOSE-L cells (Figure 3B, confocal images and inset). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1129" pm="."><plain>In addition to actin filament bundling, α-actinin acts as a platform to mediate protein-protein interactions including those involved in forming and maintaining focal adhesions [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1130" pm="."><plain>MOSE cells had variable levels of gene products known to associate with or modulate focal adhesions (Table 2, Focal Adhesions). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1131" pm="."><plain>Also, a number of gene products directly associate with α-actinin to modulate focal adhesions (zyxin, vinculin, integrin b1 and b2) or regulate actin (palladin and syndecan). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1132" pm="."><plain>Changes in mRNA levels of several of these genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1133" pm="."><plain>Importantly, genes associated with cancer progression (i.e., Itgb2, Itgb5, paxillin, fyn) displayed increased expression, whereas those thought to suppress progression (i.e., vinculin, gravin) exhibited decreased levels of expression compared to MOSE-E cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1134" pm="."><plain>Vinculin, which binds actin and is part of the focal adhesion complex linking actin to integrins, exhibited both reduced mRNA (Table 2) and protein levels (Figure 2A) during malignant progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1135" pm="."><plain>To visualize potential alterations in subcellular localization, MOSE cells were immunostained for both F-actin and vinculin (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1136" pm="."><plain>In MOSE-E cells, vinculin co-localized to the ends of actin bundles, forming well-defined focal adhesion structures similar to that observed for non-transformed epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1137" pm="."><plain>In contrast, vinculin staining was largely diffuse and only marginally co-localized with actin fibers in the MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1138" pm="."><plain>Inherently, the focal adhesion-like structures in MOSE-L cells were less defined and more punctate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1139" pm="."><plain>Confocal microscopy revealed that vinculin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of MOSE-L cells and did not appear to associate directly with the disorganized actin, (Figure 2C, confocal images). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1140" pm="."><plain>Similar vinculin staining patterns were observed in 90% of the MOSE-I (data not shown), suggesting that aberrant vinculin subcellular localization is an early event as cells transition from MOSE-E to MOSE-I. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1141" pm="."><plain>The primary component of focal adhesions, FAK, did not exhibit significant changes in mRNA levels during MOSE progression (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1142" pm="."><plain>However, FAK protein levels were significantly elevated in both MOSE-I and –L cells compared to MOSE-E (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1143" pm="."><plain>To determine if there is also a change in FAK activity and localization, MOSE cells were immunofluorescently stained for total FAK (red) and FAK phosphorylated on tyrosine861 (FAK-PY861, green) (Figure 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1144" pm="."><plain>Of note, phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine Y861 by Src, one of two residues phosphorylated by Src, contributes to cell migration [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1145" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 3D, FAK was only marginally associated with the membranes of MOSE-L cells compared to the bright punctate staining at the cell periphery of MOSE-E, but was rather diffusively distributed throughout the cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1146" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was very little punctate staining of FAK at the periphery of MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1147" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the peripheral total FAK co-localized with the active FAK-Y861, suggesting that peripheral FAK is active in both MOSE-E and –L cells (Figure 3C, merge). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1148" pm="."><plain>Since FAK staining requires MeOH fixation, confocal microscopy did not provide conclusive results as to the co-localization of diffuse total FAK and pFAK-Y861 observed in MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1149" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is unclear whether diffuse pockets of disorganized actin and total FAK contribute to the reduced formation of focal adhesions observed in MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1151" pm="."><plain>The cytoskeleton plays an important role in tumor cell progression and events such as migration and invasion, allowing the cells to adapt and survive in different microenvironments; compounds that regulate cytoskeleton organization have been used as cancer therapeutics [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1152" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the organization of the cytoskeleton affects cellular organization, adhesion complexes and polarity, and vesicular transports. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1153" pm="."><plain>As noted above, the subcellular localization of proteins associated with focal adhesions displayed aberrations concomitant with the disorganized state of the cytoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1154" pm="."><plain>This may allow the tumor cells to bypass cellular homeostatic control mechanisms by diverting signaling proteins to different locations, thereby changing the availability of binding partners or substrates, which may modify signal transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1155" pm="."><plain>Since aberrant signaling is a sign of malignancy [28], immunostaining for global tyrosine and serine phosphorylated proteins was used as a general gauge of signal transduction pathway organization and function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1156" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine phosphorylation, an indicator of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, plays a critical role in cancer cells, regulating proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism; 51 of the 90 tyrosine kinases have been implied in cancer (see recent review [28]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1194" pm="."><plain>During the malignant progression of the MOSE cells, the microfilament, microtubule and intermediate filament systems became sequentially disorganized, highlighted by i) distinct protein level changes, ii) the significant loss of polymerized F-actin, and iii) the decreased capacity for formation of focal adhesions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1200" pm="."><plain>Changes affecting actin cytoskeleton architecture were early events in the transitional progression of our MOSE-derived cells as most of the changes in gene expression and protein levels were readily evident in the MOSE-I cells, an intermediate transitional stage that already has acquired limited tumor-forming capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1201" pm="."><plain>Microtubule organization, essential for cell division, cell migration, vesicle transport and cell polarization [37] was altered progressively during malignant progression culminating in a highly disorganized state in malignant MOSE-L cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1202" pm="."><plain>Of particular note is that the observed cytoskeletal alterations during MOSE cell progression have also been reported in several established human ovarian cancer lines that represent late stage aggressive disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1203" pm="."><plain>A comparison of our results to microarray data sets from established human ovarian cancer cell lines and benign or normal OSE as a reference [21], [22] demonstrated a highly significant overlap in the changes of cytoskeleton and regulatory genes (see Table 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1205" pm="."><plain>Similar changes in genes overrepresented in these functional categories were observed by proteomic comparison of several established and widely used ovarian cancer cell lines; it was concluded that these gene changes were not associated with a specific sub-type of ovarian cancer but rather with the cells' aggressive and invasive behavior [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1206" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our data reveal a stepwise accumulation of genetic changes affecting the actin cytoskeleton that are not readily apparent when analyzing human ovarian cancer samples, which are largely representative of late stage disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1212" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by recent observations demonstrating that interference with actin dynamics is more effective than microtubule disturbance in inhibiting human ovarian cancer cell motility [43], and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton can be achieved by re-introduction of actin-binding proteins such as calponin [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1215" pm="."><plain>Our studies show the sequential loss of stress fibers during MOSE progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1216" pm="."><plain>This may be associated with the aberrant expression and localization of cytoskeleton regulators such as vinculin, FAK, and α-actinin, since these regulators form complexes with other membrane proteins such as integrins that together generate signals to regulate proliferation and migration of normal and tumor cells [26], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1217" pm="."><plain>We have reported the increase in cell proliferation during MOSE progression [12] that correlates well with the changes in the cytoskeleton architecture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1218" pm="."><plain>Of note, the aberrant expression of α- and β-tubulin, keratin 7, and other cytoskeleton regulators has been reported in drug-resistant ovarian tumors [48], indicating that dysregulation of the cytoskeleton may also contribute to multi-drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1219" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, FAK inhibition augmented docetaxel-mediated apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells [49], [50], suggesting that the effects of the cytoskeleton and its regulators are not limited to regulation of cell morphology, adhesion and motility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1220" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cytoskeleton and its regulators -especially of the actin cytoskeleton in early stages- may be effective chemotherapeutic targets as has been already shown for the microtubule system [27], [51]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1234" pm="."><plain>Upon activation, PKCβII is translocated to the membrane and pericentrosomal regions [55], [56] which requires the presence of a well-organized actin cytoskeleton [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1235" pm="."><plain>PKCβII can directly bind to actin, which in turn modulates its substrate specificity via determination of substrate proximity [58], suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton controls the target substrate and, therefore, the regulated signaling pathways [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1236" pm="."><plain>One could speculate that the overexpression and sequestration of activated PKCβII during neoplastic progression provides a survival mechanism, or its proximity to other signaling components may serve to provide the cell with a constitutive endogenous signaling compartment, stimulating cell survival, migration and invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1237" pm="."><plain>The overexpression and pericentrosomal aggregation of PKCβII observed in MOSE-L cells concurrent with actin microfilament disorganization, taken together with previous findings, suggests that the two events may be inherently linked. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1240" pm="."><plain>It also modulates the distribution of F-actin and can lead to a dissociation of vinculin from focal adhesions in transformed cells [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1241" pm="."><plain>Hence, the podosomes-like structures observed in MOSE-L cells may be the indirect result of over-expressed or sequestered PKCβII, but this needs to be investigated further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1242" pm="."><plain>Concurrent with the actin cytoskeleton disorganization, aberrant localization of APC was observed during progression to the malignant MOSE-L phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1243" pm="."><plain>APC serves as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, acting as a key tumor suppressor gene that is often mutated in colon cancer [34] but has also been implicated in ovarian cancer development [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1244" pm="."><plain>APC is a multifunctional protein, influencing both microtubule assembly and bundling [61] as well as actin polymerization and cell polarity [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1245" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that APC may act in a more regulated fashion by i) direct association with microtubules [63], ii) binding cytoskeleton regulating proteins including IQGAP1 [62], [64] and iii) interacting with intermediate filaments [65], all of which suggest that the cytoskeletal architecture is critical for APC localization [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1246" pm="."><plain>Thus, the early changes in the cytoskeleton in our MOSE cell system may have a direct impact on the subcellular localization of APC influencing its function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1247" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in normal colon cells, APC is strongly localized in the nucleus while appearing increasingly in the cytoplasm in colon carcinoma [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1248" pm="."><plain>APC shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, sequestering β-catenin to induce degradation in the cytoplasm or dampen β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity in the nucleus [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1249" pm="."><plain>However, the binding to DNA, base excision DNA repair proteins, and phosphotyrosine phosphatases indicates other, yet to be determined functions of APC in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1250" pm="."><plain>The loss of full-length APC activates a DNA demethylase in colon cells and increased the expression of genes that maintain an undifferentiated cellular state [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1251" pm="."><plain>These observations together with the loss of APC during progression of our MOSE-derived cells strongly support a tumor-suppressing effect of nuclear APC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1252" pm="."><plain>In summary, gene expression profiling during neoplastic progression of MOSE cells revealed that cytoskeleton associated genes were significantly impacted as cells transitioned from a benign to a malignant stage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1255" pm="."><plain>We provide further evidence that progressive disruption of the cytoskeleton architecture plays a pivotal role in subcellular organization of signaling intermediates, particularly with respect to coordinated signal transduction events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1256" pm="."><plain>Thus, cytoskeleton dysregulation may influence trafficking of proteins and vesicles within the cell, changing the proximity of substrates and enzymes that subsequently lead to aberrant downstream signaling pathways and cellular responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1257" pm="."><plain>Finally, our data supports the hypothesis that structural rearrangements of the cytoskeletal architecture are crucial for neoplastic progression, conveying signals from the extracellular matrix to the nucleus that allow cancer cells to adapt to their microenvironment via transcription factor activation and subsequent change of gene expression (see recent review [69]). </plain></SENT>
