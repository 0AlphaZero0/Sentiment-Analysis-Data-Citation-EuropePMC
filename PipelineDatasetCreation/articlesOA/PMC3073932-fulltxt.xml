We report the regulatory response of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> to carbon starvation, based on combined high-throughput proteome and transcriptome analyses. Our results identify cell cycle changes in gene expression in response to carbon starvation that involve the prominent role of the FixK FNR/CAP family transcription factor and the CtrA cell cycle regulator. Notably, the SigT ECF sigma factor mediates the carbon starvation-induced degradation of CtrA, while activating a core set of general starvation-stress genes that respond to carbon starvation, osmotic stress, and exposure to heavy metals. Comparison of the response of swarmer cells and stalked cells to carbon starvation revealed four groups of genes that exhibit different expression profiles. Also, cell pole morphogenesis and initiation of chromosome replication normally occurring at the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition are uncoupled in carbon-starved cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Starvation for nutrient and energy sources are common stresses confronted by bacteria in natural environments. Bacteria have limited energy reserves, so they need robust mechanisms to quickly shift between rapid and slow growth, as well as a strategy for long-term survival during periods of prolonged starvation. The response to starvation comprises an initial stage of scavenging and metabolic adaptation. If the missing essential nutrients are not replenished, there is a second stage of physiological adaptation, which includes the inhibition of growth and cell division, in order to retain viability.</p><p>We have used <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, a gram-negative oligotrophic bacterium <xref rid="pone.0018179-Poindexter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, as a model system to study the response to carbon deprivation. <italic>C. crescentus</italic> has a dimorphic life cycle.

An equivalent master regulator has not been identified. We have recently identified two factors involved in the adaptation of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> to carbon starvation: the SpoT ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase, which contributes to the regulation of the DnaA protein stability and initiation of DNA replication <xref rid="pone.0018179-Lesley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and the CrfA small noncoding regulatory RNA controlling the mRNA stability of 27 transcripts <xref rid="pone.0018179-Landt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>A comparison of gene expression profiles of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> growing under carbon- and nitrogen-limited continuous flow cultures was recently reported <xref rid="pone.0018179-England1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In these experiments, slow cell growth was supported by a constant supply of nutrients at low concentration, and the gene expression profiling captured the metabolic adaptations to the relative levels of carbon and nitrogen. This study identified genes differentially induced in carbon- versus nitrogen-limited conditions, among which are those predicted to require the alternative sigma factor RpoN for complete induction <xref rid="pone.0018179-England1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Here, we have studied the cells' response to an abrupt loss of carbon source resulting in the inhibition of mass accumulation and cell cycle progression. We performed a global analysis of the differences between growing and carbon-starved <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cultures, through combined high-throughput proteome and transcriptome assays. By analyzing the response at the protein level, we took into account the fact that <italic>C. crescentus</italic> uses a complex array of regulatory strategies that include targeted proteolytic events <xref rid="pone.0018179-McAdams1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We identified genetic regulatory pathways that mediate the transduction of carbon starvation signals and found that the SigT ECF sigma factor controls a core set of genes that are activated by carbon depletion, osmotic stress and exposure to heavy metals. We identified gene clusters that are differentially expressed upon carbon starvation at specific stages of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The proteome and transcriptome profile of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells starved for carbon</title><p>Transfer of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cultures in exponential growth to media lacking a carbon source results in immediate growth arrest.

In order to identify proteins that participate in the carbon starvation response, we incubated cultures in minimal M2 medium in the absence of glucose, and the respective non-starved controls in the presence of 0.2&#x00025; glucose, for 30 and 60 minutes, as described in the Methods section. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 2471 distinct proteins across all conditions tested, accounting for 65.6&#x00025; of 3767 <italic>C. crescentus</italic> predicted protein-coding genes.

Functional categories comprising transport and metabolism of amino acids (COG E), nucleotides (COG F), carbohydrates (COG G) and cell motility (COG N) were significantly enriched in proteins whose levels decreased upon carbon starvation. On the other hand, the categories comprising energy production and conversion (COG C), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (COG P) and defense mechanisms (COG V) were significantly enriched in proteins whose levels increased upon carbon starvation.

Among the proteins that change significantly, there was notable downregulation of three essential cell cycle regulators (CtrA, DnaA and GcrA), and two proteins (PopZ and ParA) that mediate chromosome segregation <xref rid="pone.0018179-McAdams1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018179-Bowman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018179-Figge1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The decrease in the levels of DnaA, an essential protein that serves both as an activator of replication initiation and global transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0018179-Hottes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, is consistent with the previously reported starvation-induced ClpP-mediated proteolysis of DnaA <xref rid="pone.0018179-Gorbatyuk1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The decrease in DnaA levels prevents the initiation of DNA replication. The CtrA response regulator inhibits DNA replication in the swarmer cell, and acts as a transcription factor regulating the expression of nearly 100 genes. It was previously shown that CtrA is proteolyzed in swarmer cells starved for carbon, but with different kinetics than that observed under normal growth conditions <xref rid="pone.0018179-Lesley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018179-Gorbatyuk1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Given the number of CtrA-regulated genes that change upon carbon starvation, it is clear that, at least in part, an important role of CtrA in the starvation response relies on its function as transcription factor. Additionally, the level of the FtsZ cell division protein, that is essential for cytokinesis, is shown to decrease significantly upon carbon starvation; FtsZ was previously shown to decrease during stationary phase in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>

However, electron microscope images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018179-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) revealed the presence of incipient stalks under these conditions.

For each one of the 3767 genes analyzed, we created a profile vector composed of two values: i) log-ratio between expression values measured for swarmer cells after 15 minutes of carbon starvation and the non-starved control, ii) log-ratio between expression values for stalked cells after 15 minutes of carbon starvation and non-starved control. The non-starved controls values were obtained by linearly interpolating the data from <xref rid="pone.0018179-McGrath1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, at the corresponding time-points (15 minutes into the cell cycle, as a control for swarmer cells, and 75 minutes for stalked cells). We defined a gene as not responding to carbon starvation if the fold-change in expression was less than 2&#x000d7;. Similarly, we defined a gene as responding to carbon starvation if the fold-change in expression was greater than 3&#x000d7;. We only considered genes that, for both carbon starved swarmer and stalked cells, either responded to carbon starvation or did not (no change: &#x02212;1&#x0003c;|log-ratio|&#x0003c;1; change: |log-ratio|&#x0003e;1.585). We then clustered the profiles of the genes using a bottom-up hierarchical clustering approach (Bioconductor R package), using the Pearson correlation distance and complete linkage for measuring inter-cluster distances. To search for conserved motifs, we extracted 250 bp of sequence (from &#x02212;200 to &#x0002b;50 with respect to the translational start site) for the genes in each cluster, and used MEME <xref rid="pone.0018179-Bailey2" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, with the following parameters: distribution of motif occurrences: zero or one per sequence; minimum motif width: 6; maximum motif width: 25.
