<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, studies on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling networks can now capture the phosphorylation state of hundreds to thousands of proteins across multiple conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the function of many of these protein modifications, or the enzymes responsible for modifying them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To address this challenge, we have developed an approach that enhances the power of clustering techniques to infer functional and regulatory meaning of protein states in cell signaling networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We have created a new computational framework for applying clustering to biological data in order to overcome the typical dependence on specific a priori assumptions and expert knowledge concerning the technical aspects of clustering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple clustering analysis methodology (‘MCAM’) employs an array of diverse data transformations, distance metrics, set sizes, and clustering algorithms, in a combinatorial fashion, to create a suite of clustering sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These sets are then evaluated based on their ability to produce biological insights through statistical enrichment of metadata relating to knowledge concerning protein functions, kinase substrates, and sequence motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We applied MCAM to a set of dynamic phosphorylation measurements of the ERRB network to explore the relationships between algorithmic parameters and the biological meaning that could be inferred and report on interesting biological predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further, we applied MCAM to multiple phosphoproteomic datasets for the ERBB network, which allowed us to compare independent and incomplete overlapping measurements of phosphorylation sites in the network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We report specific and global differences of the ERBB network stimulated with different ligands and with changes in HER2 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall, we offer MCAM as a broadly-applicable approach for analysis of proteomic data which may help increase the current understanding of molecular networks in a variety of biological problems. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Proteomic measurements, especially modification measurements, are greatly expanding the current knowledge of the state of proteins under various conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Harnessing these measurements to understand how these modifications are enzymatically regulated and their subsequent function in cellular signaling and physiology is a challenging new problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Clustering has been very useful in reducing the dimensionality of many types of high-throughput biological data, as well inferring function of poorly understood molecular species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, its implementation requires a great deal of technical expertise since there are a large number of parameters one must decide on in clustering, including data transforms, distance metrics, and algorithms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previous knowledge of useful parameters does not exist for measurements of a new type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this work we address two issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>First, we develop a framework that incorporates any number of possible parameters of clustering to produce a suite of clustering solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These solutions are then judged on their ability to infer biological information through statistical enrichment of existing biological annotations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Large and complex high-throughput proteomic experimental studies are becoming more accessible through the use of powerful, swiftly developing platforms such as mass spectrometry (MS), flow cytometry (FC), and various kinds of protein microarrays (PMA) [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>As one particular example of increasing attention, there has been an explosion in large-scale datasets for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) network signaling by the combination of protein post-translational modification enrichment followed by quantitative MS methods [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) networks, such as those activated by the ERBB family of receptors, phosphorylation plays a central role in the translation of extracellular cues into phenotypic changes, such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation on proteins in the RTK network induce a variety of signaling events including protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activation and inactivation, and cellular localization changes, such as translocation to the nucleus or recruitment to the plasma membrane [6]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Understanding RTK networks, and the phosphorylation that occurs within them, will be essential for understanding RTK signaling in normal and dysregulated conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry measurement of phosphorylation events in cellular signaling networks is greatly increasing our understanding of the specific modifications occurring in the cell as well as their relative changes in response to network perturbations, such as ligand stimulation or kinase inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, the pace of identification of phosphorylation sites in cellular networks has outstripped our ability to understand the function and regulation of the measured phosphorylation sites as evidenced by the sharp increase in phosphorylation database repository sizes, such as Phospho.ELM [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised computational learning methods, applied to quantitative phosphoproteomic data, provides one method by which to infer function and regulation of phosphorylation within cell signaling networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown success in application of unsupervised learning to phosphoproteomic data [10]–[12], however each has presented the results of a single clustering solution, and to date, no extensive study of the relationship between unsupervised learning and phosphoproteomic data has been produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Phosphoproteomic data represents a new challenge in unsupervised learning and currently, no gold standard exists as a method for judging the success of a clustering solution of phosphoproteomic data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised learning approaches, such as various types of clustering algorithms, have been heavily utilized to productive effect in the biological community in application to other kinds of high-throughput biomolecular measurements including gene sequence [13], gene expression [14], and metabolomics [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised learning algorithms, often referred to as clustering, seek to group components of a multidimensional dataset into clusters where intra-cluster differences are minimized and inter-cluster differences are maximized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Successful application of clustering has demonstrated its usefulness in reducing dataset dimensionality and providing biological hypotheses through the use of inference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Application of unsupervised learning to biological datasets is extensive and includes a seemingly endless option of algorithms, such as Kmeans [14], hierarchical clustering [16], self organizing maps [17], and affinity propagation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since most clustering algorithms base clustering solutions on the similarity, or dissimilarity, between two vectors of measurements based on a distance metric, the metric used will have an impact on the final solution as will any alteration applied to the vectors by data transformations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Several studies have examined the effect different distance metrics [19]–[21] and data transformations [21], [22] have on clustering solutions of experimentally-derived data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In addition to choosing an appropriate algorithm, distance metric, and data transformation, scientists are also faced with having to determine a suitable number of clusters (K) in which to partition their dataset, since few algorithms incorporate concurrent optimization of K. A variety of methods for determining the natural cluster structure of a dataset have been proposed, see [23] for an example of their comparative performances using a set of microarray experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Taken as a whole, the historical application of unsupervised learning to microarray data, as well as other large biological datasets, indicates a vast landscape of decisions required to apply unsupervised learning effectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We view this vastness as offering an opportunity for enhanced capability to gain biochemical and biological insights, via an approach that takes advantage of the diversity by seeking consistencies and contrasts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In this work we create a framework, Multiple Clustering Analysis Methodology (MCAM), in which one can apply a vast array of algorithms, distance metrics, data transformations, and cluster set sizes, in a combinatorial fashion, i.e. by the exhaustive combination of all chosen parameters, to a biological dataset and then subsequently compile and evaluate the outcome of all solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In this framework, enrichment for biological terms within clustering partitions, relative to the dataset, gives us a metric for evaluating the success of any particular clustering implementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The use of this framework allows scientists to apply unsupervised learning in a way that requires no a priori knowledge or assumptions regarding the most useful clustering algorithm, distance metric, data transformation, or set size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We apply MCAM to diverse phosphoproteomic time-course datasets arising from studies of the ERBB network, where interesting biological enrichment includes Gene Ontology terms, protein domains, kinase and phosphopeptide binding domain predictions, and amino acid sequence motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We explore results from these analyses for relationships between biological metrics and the parameters of clustering and develop methods for combining results of clustering to produce robust biological hypotheses and inference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Using this information we explore the difference between two independent measurements of ERBB signaling and find interesting modules of signaling that may be responsible for the migratory potential of HER2 amplification in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The implementation of MCAM was done through a mix of Matlab and Perl scripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The Perl programs for analyzing enrichment have been incorporated directly into the PTMScout interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ptmscout.mit.edu">http://ptmscout.mit.edu</ext-link>) [24] and the Matlab tools to generate MCAM cluster sets and analyze resulting enrichment are available for download from PTMScout as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>PTMScout is an open-access web and data resource that contains experimental information concerning protein phosphorylation and lysine acetylation, tools for analyzing proteomic datasets, and the ability for users to directly load new experiments for analysis and data-sharing purposes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The MCAM framework is depicted in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Our specific interest was to cluster dynamic phosphorylation measurements of the ERBB network in order to find phosphorylation events with similar temporal dynamics leading to possible hypotheses regarding shared regulation or shared functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In the MCAM framework, a biological dataset, here dynamic phosphorylation measurements, is first subjected to a set of data transformations, such as log transformation or mean-centering; this transformed data is then clustered via the exhaustive combination of different algorithms, distance metrics, and solution set sizes (K). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In our implementations, this produces on the order of 1,500 to 2,500 clustering sets, which we refer to as an MCA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Each set in an MCA represents the complete clustering solution of a single combination of clustering parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Next, we calculate enrichment in all biological metric terms, as well as markers for time dynamics, Table 1, within each cluster, compared to the full dataset, using the hypergeometric function and the False Discovery Rate, FDR [25], procedure to correct for multiple hypothesis testing for every metric across a set, Figure 1B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Enrichment in biological metrics will give us a method by which we can judge the fitness of a clustering solution for known biological information, where those categories include information about structure and function of a protein as well as information about the regulation and function of the particular phosphorylation sites, Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Finally, we test, for every parameter of clustering, the impact on the biological information if all sets with that parameter are removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Parameters are removed from the final set when the removal of that parameter results in a significant improvement of overall biological enrichment and does not significantly decrease the enrichment of any single category of biological information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This pruning, or parameter refinement, allows us to remove clustering solutions which, according to the current biological metrics, are ineffective at producing solutions of biological import. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We call this post-pruned set of solutions , for the final Multiple Clustering Analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It is important to consider that each clustering solution in an MCA is derived by the quantitative measurements alone, in an unsupervised manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, biological enrichment is used to shape the final MCA representing a feature selection step in the MCAM method.  is typically on the order of 500 clustering sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>With this final MCA we can begin to compile the biological information that is contained, explore how clustering parameters compare to each other using mutual information, how clustering parameters relate to particular biological metrics, and consider biological hypotheses generated throughout all of these steps. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, indeed, the choice of ‘optimal’ parameters will be based on the desired type of categorical relationships, since almost all sets are required to capture the full array of possible information. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>MCAM was developed to capitalize on the success unsupervised learning has had on biological inference in the past and apply it to a new challenge in the field, that of understanding the function and regulation of phosphorylation in the ERBB network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>Since the dynamic trajectory of a phosphorylation site will be shaped by the combination of the kinase and phosphatase activities, as well as any protective influence accumulated through binding to other proteins, and the exposure to all of these proteins by localization with or away from their regulatory proteins, then co-regulation of multiple phosphorylation sites may yield testable hypotheses regarding one or all of these possible shared traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Encouragingly, biological information is enriched in dataset partitions derived through separation by clustering, whereas multiple random controls do not demonstrate a significant relationship with biological category enrichment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>In addition to using this information to gain understanding of the phosphorylation events in the ERBB network, we also undertook to account for the fact that a large number of mathematically correct solutions can be derived through the use of various data transformations, distance metrics, algorithms, and target set sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>We found that given a variety of clustering solutions, one could see almost any pair of phosphopeptides co-cluster, which may not necessarily be a product of co-regulation that can be linked directly to spatial localization, shared functionality, or shared enzymatic regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we feel any single clustering implementation will have hypotheses likely to yield testable and supportable information as well as a good mix of those that may not. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>Each clustering set within an MCA represents the dimensionality reduction of a large, multidimensional dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="509" pm="."><plain>However, we found there is unique value in the majority of all clustering sets in , according to the variety of biological enrichment, and so no single set could be considered as an optimal solution and evaluated in a traditional way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="510" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the most significant development that had to be made in MCAM was to reduce the complexity of a large number of clustering sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="511" pm="."><plain>To this end we focused on two aspects of information: 1) Understanding how the parameters affected the final clustering solution, and how this related the power of any particular type of biological inference that could be made, based on statistically enriched information and 2) How to derive meaningful and testable biological hypotheses, through inference, concerning the function and regulation of protein phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="512" pm="."><plain>We found the resulting methods provided important insights when comparing similar measurements, indirectly, across multiple datasets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="513" pm="."><plain>Through the use of this technique we found that indeed, optimal clustering parameters one would choose for clustering a dataset would vary greatly dependent on the type of information that was desired at the outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>However, for those biological categories chosen in this study, there were a few parameters that performed badly across the board, including Hierarchical clustering and the differential transform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>These are somewhat unsurprising since the differential transform will reduce the vector size by one dimension, which in a dataset with few measurements may be detrimental to the ability to separate the measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>However, it is an important observation to mention that lessons found in one dataset should not be extrapolated to all datasets, even of the same type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>Although the cosine and correlation distance metrics were uninformative in producing biological enrichment in the EGF4 dataset, they were useful in clustering various portions of the HER2 dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>This observation highlights the importance of a broad-spectrum application of multiple parameters of clustering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>It is important to consider the impact the feature selection process has on the final result in the MCAM method, which is applied during the parameter refinement, or pruning, step of the MCAM method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>Given the varied relationships we observed between particular types of information and the parameters of clustering that best gave rise to them, it is likely that the final result will change with the addition of new biological features, or the alteration to existing features, such as the improvement of GO annotations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="521" pm="."><plain>One can imagine the parameters pruned during the feature selection process would decrease with the addition of new features, which would redefine the value of a successful clustering solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="522" pm="."><plain>Although this suggests the results may need to be reconsidered as annotations improve, we feel this parameter refinement process helps to avoid the consideration of a large portion of currently uninformative sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="523" pm="."><plain>The open source nature of the MCAM software project allows for flexibility in altering the specific categories and the thresholds used during parameter refinement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="524" pm="."><plain>We found that there is no single ‘optimum’ clustering solution, or one that performed in the top quartile of all biological metrics of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="525" pm="."><plain>Depending on the application, a small number of solutions could be chosen and analyzed in a way that is more traditionally performed in the field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="526" pm="."><plain>However, we decided to focus on allowing the agreement of many solutions to highlight a potential area of robust biological inference through the agreement of biological enrichment and alternately the agreement of co-clustering of phosphorylation dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="527" pm="."><plain>These methods produced a large list of possibly interesting biological inferences, of which we highlighted just a few possibilities to demonstrate MCAM's power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="528" pm="."><plain>In Figure 4 we highlight two ‘robust’ clusters based on repeated enrichment of categorical terms, which creates a hybrid cluster from a combination of multiple clustering sets within , based on a particular enrichment label of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="529" pm="."><plain>The hybrid cluster, like any single cluster produced from a single clustering method, represents a cluster of phosphopeptides that are strongly co-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="530" pm="."><plain>The first cluster, Figure 4A, was produced based on enrichment for co-regulation of phosphorylation sites on proteins involved in the MAPK cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="531" pm="."><plain>For those proteins not currently annotated in the MAPK cascade, there is individual evidence that they are involved in regulating MAPK activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="532" pm="."><plain>FAM59A was recently named GAREM, which stands for Grb2-associated and regulator of Erk/MAPK activity [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="533" pm="."><plain>Specifically, phosphorylation of Y453 on GAREM was required for association with Grb2 and subsequent activation of Erk by EGF stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="534" pm="."><plain>PTPN18, a protein tyrosine phosphatase also known as BDP1, has been implicated in regulation of HER2 directed MAPK signaling activation [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="535" pm="."><plain>The study specifically found that PTPN18 was capable of inhibiting activation of mitogenic signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="536" pm="."><plain>The robust co-regulation of PTPN18 Y389 phosphorylation with other components of the MAPK cascade, shown here, further implicates PTPN18 in MAPK signaling downstream of EGF stimulation, and highlights a particular mechanism for PTPN18 activity, that of Y389 phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>This modification may possibly act as a negative regulator of BDP1 activity, thereby relieving its function as a negative regulator of MAPK activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, if Y389 phosphorylation on PTPN18 potentiates its ability to shut down MAPK signaling, then these dynamics suggest it occurs subsequently with MAPK activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>ARHGEF5, also known as TIM, is a RhoGEF, which has been shown to activate Rac, which is upstream of another MAPK family member, JNK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the JNK cascade may be concurrently activated or that this particular RhoGEF has a role in the ERK1/ERK2 cascade directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MCAM has been useful not only in highlighting a known co-regulation event, that of EGFR phosphorylation on sites that recruit SHC1 to the receptor with that of SHC1 phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated following recruitment to the receptor, but also in highlighting proteins not yet generally recognized as playing a role in the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>This result also supports a role for these proteins in the MAPK pathway in human mammary epithelial cells as previous cell lines explored in previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the example of highlighting GAREM (FAM59A) phosphorylation on Y453 as playing an important biochemical role in the indicated pathway strengthens the hypothesis that PTPN18 Y389 phosphorylation is also an important biochemical mechanism in the MAPK pathway downstream of EGFR activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="544" pm="."><plain>Since we can find no specific study on the effect of PTPN18 Y389 phosphorylation, this hypothesis could not have come from literature mining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we observe that traditional application of a single clustering implementation would likely not have highlighted this group of proteins in a way that would have linked PTPN18 Y389 and GAREM Y453 phosphorylation with that of EGFR Y1172 and MAPK Y187, since this event occurs in less than 15% of clustering set solutions in . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>In Figure 4B we highlight another ‘robust’ cluster, which indicates the dynamics of phosphorylation of Y44 on ENO1 are very similar to that of cortactin and paxillin phosphorylation, two proteins and phosphorylation sites that play a role in cell motility [29], [30] and are annotated as being localized to ‘lamellipodium’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>However, since there is relatively little evidence that paxillin is localized to lamellipodia, but instead has a strong association with mature focal adhesions [29], it may be that ‘lamellipodium’ has been used as a blanket term for leading edge formations in the Gene Ontology since GO is lacking finer gradations of leading edge compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>What is common to both paxillin and cortactin is localization in invadopodia [31], [32], a term not currently included in GO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>Such similarity of dynamics indicates potential co-regulation, which is dependent on a variety of factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that all three sites may be targets of Src [30], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>In addition to shared enzymatic control, similarity of dynamics might also be dependent on shared localization, especially when enzyme activation is localized to an area such as focal adhesions, invadopodia, or lamellipodium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>To better conjecture where this co-regulation is occurring we looked at additional robust associations with ENO1 phosphorylation and found in addition to paxillin and cortactin this site is most closely associated with phosphorylation on a protein called AFAP1L2, which stands for actin filament associated protein like-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>Despite several other phosphorylation sites on focal adhesion proteins, including integrin  (ITGB4), p130Cas/BCAR1, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), none of these sites is similarly regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>Additional evidence supporting this is that the parental EGF subset of the HER2 dataset also indicates that ENO1 and paxillin phosphorylation are tightly coupled with a third protein, Annexin A2, which has been implicated in cell spreading and migration [35] as well as formation of invadopodia [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>Finally, a recent proteomic study found enolase is enriched in invadopodia [37] further supporting the hypothesis that co-regulation of enolase, paxillin, and cortactin phosphorylation is through shared cellular localization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>The temporal association of ENO1 phosphorylation with that of cortactin and paxillin is intriguing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>ENO1, in full and dimeric form, is a metabolic enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>However, a short isoform of the same gene product has been shown to block Myc transcription factor activity by binding the Myc promoter [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>This begs the question of whether ENO1 is playing a role in lamellipodium, invadopodia, or focal adhesions, related to its metabolic activity or some other gene product of yet to be discovered functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>ENO1 phosphorylation on Y44 has long been known and when originally studied did not show a noticeable affect directly on its catalytic activity [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>However, in these studies it was observed that only a small percentage, roughly 5%, of total enolase was phosphorylated and so catalytic differences due to phosphorylation may have been imperceptible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>Perhaps compartmentalization of a fraction of altered enzymatic activity could play an important functional role; this activity may be confined to lamellipodia, invadapodia, or focal adhesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>Despite the excess of ATP in the cell, the induction of an ATP gradient within invadopodia could conceivably act as a method of invadopodia formation, since many components, such as F-actin, would be sensitive to a shift in the ATP to ADP ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>There are other indications that phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes may indeed be playing a functional role and driving tumor progression [39] and our results may indicate a role for enolase phosphorylation specifically in the metastatic potential of tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="565" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that using the concepts developed in MCAM, we could compare independent measures of the ERBB network and dissect signaling alterations occurring between different perturbations of the network, including ligand and receptor level differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="566" pm="."><plain>Using the co-occurrence matrix we were able to look “globally” at the differences between the networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="567" pm="."><plain>This study indicated that despite HER2 amplification, EGF stimulation drove signaling that was more similar between the two cell lines than it was for the same cell line under two different ligand stimulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="568" pm="."><plain>The greatest difference in signaling occurred when EGF stimulation of wild type cells was compared with HRG stimulation of HER2 overexpressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="569" pm="."><plain>We can dissect the signaling differences further by looking for those associations that have the most extreme differences between conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="570" pm="."><plain>When we did this, we were fascinated to find that in the presence of HER2 overexpression, EGF drives very different dynamics on two phosphorylation sites of the adaptor protein SHC1 and sites on focal adhesion protein p130Cas/BCAR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>SHC1 is known to be recruited to EGFR by two different phosphopeptide binding events and it subsequently recruits, and activates, members of the MAPK cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>Specifically, both Y349 and Y427 phosphorylation on SHC1 has been shown to recruit Grb2 [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="573" pm="."><plain>Through its SH2 domain, SHC1 is recruited to EGFR Y1197 phosphorylation and through its PTB domain, it is recruited to EGFR Y1172 phosphorylation [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="574" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is no surprise that subsequent phosphorylation of SHC1 on Y427 and Y349 would be tightly co-regulated with that of EGFR Y1172 and Y1197 phosphorylation when the network is stimulated with EGF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="575" pm="."><plain>However, what is surprising is this co-regulation is broken for only Y349 in the presence of HER2 overexpression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="576" pm="."><plain>Instead of being most closely co-regulated with the receptor phosphorylations it is instead most closely co-regulated with Y228 phosphorylation on catenin delta-1, CTTND1, a protein known to be interact with E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="577" pm="."><plain>The authors of the original study found that HER2 amplification drives a higher migratory potential and posited that breakup of E-cadherin junctions would be essential to this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="578" pm="."><plain>Our finding may therefore indicate that SHC1 plays an important role in this process and that the differential regulation of Y349 and Y427 is perhaps driven by two populations of SHC1, one of which is localized at cell-cell junctions and which is differentially regulated, indicated by the sustained phosphorylation of SHC1 Y349 relative to Y427 phosphorylation, and a second population that is recruited to the receptor, which is probably the dominant population in EGF stimulation of wild type HMECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="579" pm="."><plain>The sequence surrounding catenin delta-1 Y228 matches known preferences for SHC1 SH2 recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="580" pm="."><plain>In addition, multiple sites on the focal adhesion protein p130Cas/BCAR1 experience differential regulation in the presence of HER2 overexpession. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="581" pm="."><plain>Increased migration would come as a result of the disruption of both cell-cell contacts and cell-substrate contacts, so these sites might indicate a particular role in how cell-substrate contacts are disrupted in HER2 overexpressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="582" pm="."><plain>All of these data may help us in understanding the aggressiveness of tumor cells with HER2 amplification. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="584" pm="."><plain>Permutations of clustering parameters and their judgement of success by pertinent categorical data has the capability of producing a wide array of solutions that together span a meaningful range of data separation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="585" pm="."><plain>MCAM, as developed, can be applied directly to any dataset currently in the PTMScout database, and any proteomic dataset that measures phosphorylation or lysine acetylation can be added by the public to PTMScout for analysis by MCAM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="586" pm="."><plain>Extension to any type of multidimensional biological measurements simply requires the alteration of the target categorical data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="587" pm="."><plain>For example, in addition to using gene and protein annotation information, one could look for known transcription factors when mining gene expression data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="588" pm="."><plain>Another benefit of MCAM is that it provides a method for comparing the relationship between independent measurements of a system, even if the overlap of measurements is incomplete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="589" pm="."><plain>This methodology provides a new method for understanding the relationship of quantitative measurements with each other, and importantly provides a means in which to judge the outcome of a parameter of clustering with regards to resulting power of inference. </plain></SENT>
