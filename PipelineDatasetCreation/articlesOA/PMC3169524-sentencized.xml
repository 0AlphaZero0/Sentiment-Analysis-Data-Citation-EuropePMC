<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While cells lacking RPN4 exhibit a decreased non-adaptable proteasome pool, loss of UBR2, an ubiquitin ligase that regulates Rpn4 turnover, results in elevated Rpn4 levels, which upregulates UPS components. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite tight transcriptional co-regulation of the UPS and oxidative detoxification systems, the impact of proteasome capacity on lifespan is independent of the latter, since elimination of Yap1, a key regulator of the oxidative stress response, does not affect lifespan extension of cells with higher proteasome capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since elevated proteasome capacity results in improved clearance of toxic huntingtin fragments in a yeast model for neurodegenerative diseases, we speculate that the observed lifespan extension originates from prolonged elimination of damaged proteins in old mother cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Oxidative and other forms of damage to cellular components occur throughout the lifespan of organisms [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Young cells are protected by efficient repair and elimination systems, while aging cells gradually accumulate damaged macromolecules and organelles leading eventually to a catastrophic functional deterioration and cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Many reports document a gradual decline in repair and maintenance systems in aging cells [2], suggesting that impaired repair and clearance of damaged macromolecules represents a crucial origin of age-related cellular dysfunction [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Ribosomes, chaperones and two proteolytic systems, the proteasome and the autophagosomal/lysosomal pathway, are responsible for the maintenance of protein homeostasis [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>If translation and chaperone-assisted protein folding/disaggregation fail, larger protein aggregates or damaged organelles are cleared by macroautophagy in all eukaryotes, while specific proteins are removed from the cytoplasm by chaperone-mediated autophagy in mammals [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Both activities result in destruction of damaged molecules in an enclosed hydrolytic environment, the lysosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Damaged proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells are eliminated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The proteasome is a highly conserved, multicatalytic enzyme composed of more than 33 subunits, which form two entities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The central proteolytic core (CP) contains the proteolytically active sites sequestered within an enclosed cylinder, while a regulatory complex (RP) mediates substrate recognition, processing and transport into the catalytic chamber of the CP [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Crucial components of the RP are six paralogous ATPases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>They actively unfold bound proteins, a process that is required for the passage of substrates through a narrow gate leading into the interior of the CP [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Substrate binding by the proteasome requires covalent modification of a target protein with a polyubiquitin chain, which is attached to a substrate via a three-step enzymatic cascade involving ubiquitin activation by E1 enzymes, ubiquitin conjugation by E2 proteins and covalent linkage of ubiquitin to substrates by E3 ubiquitin ligases [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Many studies demonstrate a decline in proteasome function with age in different organisms [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Proteasome impairment is reported at several levels, including decreased transcription of certain proteasomal subunits in mice [10], dissociation of the holocomplex in Drosophila [11], and reduced proteolytic capacity in different aged mammalian tissues and organs [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In contrast, centenarians and the long-lived naked mole rats exhibit elevated proteasome levels and activity [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Initial genetic approaches suggest a role for proteasome function in modulating longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In the fission yeast Saccharomyces pombe, the maintenance of a quiescent G0 state is dependent on functional proteasomes [15], and downregulation of proteasome RP subunits in C. elegans leads to a profound shortening of lifespan [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila indicate that overexpression of proteasome-related genes might exert a positive effect on lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of the proteasome biogenesis factor Ump1 are reported to extend yeast stationary phase survival [17], although replicative lifespan has not been investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of the proteasomal deubiquitinating subunit Rpn11 extends lifespan in flies [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>While enhanced proteasome activity was speculated to be the cause of lifespan extension in both studies, the underlying impact of UPS component overexpression on proteasome biology was not fully elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Studies in yeast suggest a proteasome independent function of a free Rpn11 pool in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology, thus extended lifespan in flies overexpressing Rpn11 might result from functions of Rpn11 that are independent of the proteasome [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Here we present a genetically defined system utilizing transcriptional regulation of the UPS to study the effect of decreased and elevated proteasome capacity on yeast replicative lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Expression of UPS genes in yeast and mammals is regulated by a feedback mechanism [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In the absence of proteotoxic stress, the UPS-related transcription factor Rpn4 has a short half-life of several minutes, being rapidly ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Ubr2 and degraded by the proteasome [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This feedback loop ensures a fast and tightly regulated increase in proteasome levels during protein stress; increased degradation of proteasome substrates reduces turnover of Rpn4, promoting a compensatory elevation of proteasomal gene transcription [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Cells deleted for RPN4 exhibit reduced basal non-adaptable proteasome levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In contrast, loss of the E3 ligase Ubr2 leads to Rpn4 stabilization, which in turn results in elevated proteasome abundance and increased UPS capacity [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Utilizing this system, we found that proteasome abundance correlated with longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Deletion of RPN4 shortened lifespan, while loss of UBR2 dramatically increased lifespan, demonstrating a beneficial effect of elevated proteasome function on cell physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The same correlation between reduced and elevated proteasome capacity is evident from phenotype analysis in the presence of proteotoxic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Increased turnover of structurally unstable proteins as well as enhanced clearance of aggregation prone huntingtin fragments was observed in cells with elevated proteasome function, whereas loss of UBR2 failed to induce lifespan extension in cells with compromised proteasome function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>These findings argue for a model in which the beneficial effect of increased proteasome capacity on longevity is related to improved elimination of damaged or aggregation prone proteins and thus improved proteostasis, possibly representing a major function of the proteasomes in aging cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To more broadly define the importance of proteasome function in aging, we measured replicative lifespan (RLS) for several yeast mutants that recapitulate the individual processes causing proteasome dysfunction in mammalian aging and cell senescence: loss of activity, impaired assembly/structural integrity and decreased abundance [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The proteasomal ATPases Rpt1-6 are essential components of the catalytic cycle of the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Mutants with inactivated ATP-hydrolysis are viable but show impaired substrate turnover [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the observed decline in proteolytic capacity of the proteasome with aging in multicellular eukaryotes, ATPase mutants in 5 of these 6 components exhibited reduced RLS (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The varying degree in RLS reduction is in agreement with previous findings that the ATPases play non-redundant roles in proteasome-mediated substrate turnover [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Several further studies (Figure 1B) emphasize the requirement of normal proteasome function for normal lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>First, deletion of the proteasome biogenesis factor UMP1, which is required for correct proteasome maturation [24], leads to reduced RLS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Second, deletion of the only non-essential integral proteasome core subunit PRE9, which results in impaired proteasome assembly and impaired proteolytic capacity [25], shortens RLS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Third, a ubp6Δ strain is also short-lived. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Ubp6 is a proteasome associated deubiquitinating enzyme, which influences ubiquitin chain length of proteasome-bound substrates and thereby impacts the turnover of proteasome substrates [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Lastly, cells lacking the transcriptional regulator of proteasome expression, the C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor RPN4, which are characterized by a reduced, non-adaptable proteasome pool [20], [21], exhibit a 40% reduction in mean RLS (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that defects in several different aspects of proteasome biology are sufficient to shorten lifespan. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Since reduction in proteasome function resulted in decreased RLS, we reasoned that an increase in proteasome number might enhance longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>An ideal candidate to manipulate proteasome levels is Rpn4, due to its specific function as a regulator of proteasomal gene transcription [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a rise in Rpn4 protein levels would increase proteasome abundance and might positively impact lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Loss of either of two proteins is known to result in elevated Rpn4 protein levels: the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr2 [22], and Mub1, a protein required for Ubr2-mediated Rpn4 ubiquitination [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>To test whether elevated Rpn4 levels enhance longevity, we determined the RLS of strains lacking UBR2 or MUB1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, both ubr2Δ and mub1Δ mother cells were significantly longer-lived than wild type cells (Figure 1C, 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This effect was dependent on Rpn4, since deletion of RPN4 abrogated lifespan extension in ubr2Δ or mub1Δ strains (Figure 1C, 1D), arguing for a model in which the enhanced longevity of ubr2Δ and mub1Δcells resulted from stabilization of Rpn4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Importantly, RPN4 is not required for lifespan extension in a long-lived strain lacking TOM1 (Figure 1E), another E3 ligase involved in transcriptional regulation [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrate that lifespan extension by Rpn4 stabilization is specific for UBR2 and MUB1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Rpn4 stabilization is necessary but not sufficient for a positive effect on lifespan, since compromised proteasome function, induced by loss of PRE9, prevents lifespan extension in ubr2Δ cells (Figure 1F). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Consistent with increased Rpn4 abundance in cells lacking UBR2 (Figure 2A) or MUB1 we observed increased transcription of proteasomal genes, both for components of the RP (RPN11 and RPT2) and the CP (PRE1 and PRE6) (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
