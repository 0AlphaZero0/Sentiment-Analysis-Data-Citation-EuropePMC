<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wild-type β2m contains 99 amino acids and has a classical β-sandwich fold comprising seven anti-parallel β-strands that is stabilized by its single inter-strand disulfide bridge between β-strands B and F (Fig. 1B) [4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high resolution structures of monomeric native β2m from humans and several of its variants have been solved by solution NMR [7–10] and X-ray crystallography [4,11–16]. β2m contains five peptidyl–prolyl bonds, one of which (His31-Pro32) adopts the thermodynamically unfavoured cis-isomer in the native state (Fig. 1B) [4,7,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another interesting feature of monomeric native β2m is the conformational dynamics of the D-strand and the loop that connects the D- and E-strands (the DE-loop) (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the concentration of β2m circulating in the serum of patients suffering from renal dysfunction is enhanced up to 60-fold compared with healthy individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This causes the deposition of β2m as amyloid fibrils in osteoarticular tissues, leading to pathological bone destruction and the condition known as dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) (Fig. 2) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, a poor correlation between the β2m concentration in the serum and fibril load in osteoarticular tissues in long-term dialysis patients suggests that additional factors must be responsible for the initiation of β2m aggregation in vivo [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, in vitro studies have shown that β2m is remarkably intransigent to assembly into amyloid fibrils at neutral pH, remaining predominantly monomeric for several months at pH 7.5, 37 °C, when incubated at protein concentrations more than 20-fold higher than those found in dialysis patients (∼ 3.2 μm [21]) [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of these findings, factors have been sought that could facilitate protein aggregation of β2m in vivo, including the age of patients [27], the duration of kidney failure [28], the dialysis procedure itself [29–31], post-translational modifications of full-length β2m [32–40] and bimolecular collision between β2m and biological molecules abundant in osteoarticular tissues or encountered during dialysis [26,41–51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>As a result, a multitude of factors have been shown to enhance the aggregation of β2m in vitro and are implicated in vivo, including Cu2+ [47,52–59], glycosaminoglycans [26,41,60], lysophosphatidic acid [49], non-esterified fatty acids [48,50] and collagen [41,42,61]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Instead, the formation of one or more non-native precursors that are accessible by dynamic fluctuations from the native protein is required before aggregation can occur [9,18–20,63–69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Such fluctuations may expose aggregation-prone sequences normally sequestered in the native structure [70], consistent with local and/or more global unfolding events being a common feature in the aggregation mechanisms of globular proteins [58,67,71–80]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In pioneering work, Chiti et al. [81] used a series of spectroscopic probes to show that wild-type β2m folds via two structurally distinct intermediates, known as I1 and I2, en route to the globular native state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The first intermediate along the folding reaction coordinate, I1, is populated within 5 ms of dilution of the protein from denaturant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This species shows substantial elements of non-random structure and contains a disorganized hydrophobic core in which several hydrophobic residues remain exposed to solvent [81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The second folding intermediate, I2, forms within milliseconds of the population of I1 and displays native-like secondary structure and ordered packing of side chains within the hydrophobic core. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Further folding of I2 occurs on a timescale of seconds to minutes at 30 °C, suggesting substantial energetic barriers to the attainment of the globular native fold [62,81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Although folding of wild-type β2m is a cooperative process as judged by equilibrium denaturation [81], I2 nonetheless accumulates, reaching a population of about 14 ± 8% at equilibrium at pH 7.4, 30 °C, as judged by capillary electrophoresis [82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the concentration of I2 was found to correlate with the rate of elongation using seeds formed from ex vivo amyloid fibrils at pH 7.4, 30 °C, consistent with this native-like folding intermediate being directly (or indirectly via further conformational changes) capable of amyloid elongation [82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A slow folding intermediate, reminiscent of I2, has also been described by others [34,83]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Building on the observations made by Chiti and colleagues [82], more detailed studies of the folding and unfolding mechanism of wild-type β2m, combined with mutagenesis of the sequence, demonstrated that the transition between the slow folding intermediate I2 and the native fold is rate limited by trans to cis isomerization of the His31-Pro32 peptide bond, which led to the kinetically trapped intermediate being termed IT [67–69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, folding studies of a variant of β2m in which Pro32 is replaced with Val using manual mixing experiments at low temperature (2.8–4.0 °C) monitored by CD and NMR revealed that the slow folding step is abolished, trapping β2m in a non-native species presumably with a trans His31-Val32 peptide bond [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Pro32 is highly conserved in β2m in different organisms [84] and trans to cis peptidyl–prolyl isomerization at this site has been shown previously to be responsible for the slow refolding commonly found in other immunoglobulin domains [85–91]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, however, P32V β2m is not able to elongate amyloid fibrillar seeds in vitro or to nucleate fibril formation, suggesting that a trans His31-Xaa peptide bond is necessary, but not sufficient, to endow β2m with its amyloidogenic properties [68]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To gain a more detailed understanding of the kinetic folding mechanism of β2m and the role of different partially folded species in linking the folding and aggregation energy landscapes, Jahn and co-workers [67] analysed the folding and unfolding kinetics of β2m under an array of conditions, including analysis of the folding mechanism of the variant P32G. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Using global analysis of the resulting kinetic data, the authors proposed a five-state model for the folding mechanism of wild-type β2m involving parallel folding pathways initiated from cis or trans His31-Pro32 in the unfolded state [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The five-state model has been challenged by Sakata and co-workers [69] who proposed that a simpler four-state model satisfies their obtained microscopic and macroscopic rates of β2m unfolding and refolding using chevron analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In particular, using their approach Sakata et al. were unable to detect spectroscopically the accumulation of the folding intermediate containing a native cis-His31-Pro32 peptide bond (IC), suggesting that this species is non-existent or populated to levels below the detection limit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, both folding models suggest that IT is low but significantly populated under physiological conditions at equilibrium, consistent with the poor ability of wild-type β2m to elongate fibrillar seeds at neutral pH in vitro [26,67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Replacement of Pro32 with glycine (P32G) resulted in a simple three-state folding mechanism in which an intermediate, presumably with a trans His31-Gly32 peptide bond akin to IT, accumulates during folding, reaching an equilibrium concentration of approximately 30% [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Importantly, by titrating the population of IT populated at equilibrium for the wild-type protein and P32G by varying the solution conditions, Jahn et al. [67] showed that the population of IT correlates with the rate of fibril elongation in vitro, suggesting that IT is a key link between the folding and aggregation energy landscapes for this protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This could occur directly by this species showing an ability to elongate amyloid seeds, or indirectly via further conformational excursions to other species accessible from this folding intermediate [9,20,66,67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Interrogation of the conformational properties of P32G using NMR suggested large conformational changes involving residues in the BC- and FG-loops, the D-strand and the N-terminal region of the protein that presumably arise from the isomerization of Pro32 and subsequent partial unfolding of the protein [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>These regions map precisely to the regions reported previously to be perturbed in the kinetic folding intermediate IT, suggesting a close structural relationship of the two species [67]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The intransigence of wild-type β2m to form amyloid fibrils when incubated for extended periods of time at neutral pH at concentrations substantially higher than those found in vivo [21,25,26] can be rationalized in light of the finding that the amyloidogenic precursor, IT, is both transiently sampled and maintained at low concentrations at equilibrium in the wild-type protein under ambient conditions [25,67,82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In order to explore the thermodynamics and kinetics of amyloid assembly from β2m at physiological pH in vitro, therefore, a plethora of conditions have been used to increase the population of species akin (but not necessarily identical) to IT at equilibrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>These include the addition of Cu2+ ions and urea [46,47,53,92], organic solvents [60,83], collagen [41,42], glycosaminoglycans or other biologically relevant factors [26,60,93], SDS or lysophospholipids [48–51,94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Changes in the physicochemical environment, including ultrasonication [95], heat treatment [96], high salt and stirring/agitation [97], have also been employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These apparently very different conditions have in common the principle that they perturb the equilibrium position of the cis/trans His31-Pro32 peptide bond and hence enhance the amyloidogenic potential of the wild-type protein [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the N- and/or C-terminal regions of the sequence have also been shown to enhance amyloid formation of β2m at physiological pH [8,9,25,26,32,98,99], whilst other mutations that focus on the DE-loop region demonstrated variable effects on the thermodynamic stability of the protein depending on the amount of strain introduced [14,16,20,100,101]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>DE-loop mutations such as D59P that introduce loop strain show a decreased folding free energy compared with the wild-type protein and an enhanced potential to aggregate, whereas a release of loop strain such as in W60G leads to super-stable variants which have reduced amyloidogenic features [13,14,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, DE-loop cleavage variants such as ΔK58 or cK58 (which contain a specific cleavage at Lys58 with or without removal of Lys58, respectively) have been demonstrated to be highly aggregation-prone [34,102–104]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Together these studies are indicative of a fragile and delicate amino acid network required for the stabilization of the cis isomer at His31-Pro32 that is required both for binding to the MHC I heavy chain [16] and to maintain a soluble native structure for the monomeric protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that Cu2+ ions may play a role in initiating or enhancing aggregation of wild-type β2m in DRA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Cu2+ has been shown to bind to native human β2m with moderate affinity (Kapp = 2.7 μm) and specificity (Cu2+ &gt; Zn2+ &gt;&gt; Ni2+) [46,106]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Binding involves coordination to the imidizole ring of His31 [7,107]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Non-native states of wild-type β2m also bind Cu2+ ions; in this case the three other histidines in the sequence (His13, His51, His84) coordinate Cu2+ with a Kapp ∼ 41 μm [107]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, binding of Cu2+ ions increases the concentration of non-native (so-called ‘activated’) forms of monomeric β2m, named by Miranker and co-authors as M*, which triggers the formation of dimeric, tetrameric and hexameric species (&lt; 1 h) believed to be on-pathway to amyloid-like fibrils [47,106]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Cu2+ binding is required for the conformational changes leading to the formation of M* and to the generation of early oligomeric species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>However, once these oligomeric species and subsequent fibrillar aggregates are formed, Cu2+ is not essential for their stability [52,54,56,57,108]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>By creating two variants, P32A and H13F, Miranker and colleagues [55,58] were able to crystallize dimeric and hexameric forms of β2m (the latter after Cu2+-induced oligomerization). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed that dimeric P32A and hexameric H13F contain a trans His31-Ala32 and a trans His31-Pro32 peptide bond, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Each oligomer is composed of monomers that retain a native-like fold, yet display significant alterations in the organization of aromatic side chains within the hydrophobic core, most notably Phe30, Phe62 and Trp60 (Fig. 3A,B, in blue), which the authors speculate could be important determinants of amyloid assembly [53,55,58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>How these static structures relate to the transient intermediates formed during folding or populated during aggregation, however, remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Importantly in this regard, P32A and H13F lack an enhanced ability to assemble into amyloid fibrils compared with wild-type β2m [55,58], reminiscent of the behaviour of P32V [68,69]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, ΔN6 (in which β2m is cleaved at Lys6) [32], cK58 and ΔK58 [34,102,103,117,118] and wild-type β2m in the presence of SDS/2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/other additives [20,41,42,50,51,66,119] all exhibit decreased solubility, increased local and global unfolding events and enhanced amyloidogenicity at pH values close to physiological. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the variant ΔN6, since this species is found as a significant component (∼ 26%) in ex vivo amyloid deposits and exhibits an increased affinity for collagen compared with the wild-type protein, suggesting a role for this protein in the development of DRA [61,120]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Pioneering work by Esposito and colleagues showed that ΔN6 experiences a global decrease in conformational stability compared with wild-type β2m and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the authors proposed that the D-strand facilitates intermolecular interactions to form oligomeric assemblies prior to the development of long straight amyloid fibrils at pH 6.5, 37 °C [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the variants cK58 and ΔK58 were found to be highly aggregation-prone, presumably due to enhanced conformational dynamics, especially for strand D, and a concomitant increase in concentration of the amyloidogenic folding intermediates at equilibrium [34,103]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the mutation W60G which also lies in the DE-loop diminishes the potential of this variant to extend fibrillar seeds of the human wild-type protein at pH 7.4 in the presence of 20% (v/v) TFE [16], consistent with the dynamics within this region of the protein playing a crucial role in β2m assembly at neutral pH [13,14,19,20,66,121]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These studies therefore reinforce the importance of interrogating the conformational dynamics of β2m and its truncation variants in more detail in order to understand the aggregation properties of this species and, more generally, how other non-native species that retain a globular fold aggregate in vitro and in vivo [116]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Major breakthroughs in understanding the properties that endow non-native states of β2m with their amyloidogenic properties have arisen from NMR studies of wild-type β2m and several variants of the protein by exploiting the capabilities of modern NMR methods for rapid and sensitive data acquisition [7,9,11,20,32,55,58,66–68,103,109]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, recent studies of the folding kinetics of wild-type β2m using real-time NMR combined with amino acid selective labelling of Phe, Val and Leu provided the first glimpses of the amyloid precursor of β2m under conditions close to physiological [109]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>However, extensive peak broadening caused by conformational dynamics on a microsecond to millisecond timescale ruled out detailed assignment and structure elucidation of IT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Following on from this work, studies of the folding kinetics of wild-type β2m in different concentrations of TFE using real-time NMR revealed that the native protein is generated with double exponential kinetics from IT for all resonances studied, indicative of an energy landscape that is more complex than the single barrier suspected hitherto [66,67,69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>By contrast with the behaviour of the wild-type protein, W60G folds to the native state from IT with mono-exponential kinetics, indicative of a more simple folding energy landscape for this less amyloidogenic variant [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the authors propose that a species that is more disordered than IT (named a ‘native-unlike’ or D state), formed maximally in 20% (v/v) TFE, is responsible for elongating wild-type β2m seeds [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The wild-type protein under those conditions has also been simulated using molecular dynamics [122]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Exploiting the sensitivity of β2m conformations to the concentration of TFE, the authors were able to find conditions wherein IT is maximally populated from W60G, reaching 30–40% population in 18% (v/v) TFE (at pH 6.6, 33 °C), and were able to assign 63 backbone amide resonances (out of 93 amide bonds) unambiguously for this species (BMRB code 16587) (Fig. 3C) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Incomplete assignment of the IT state in W60G and considerable peak overlap by native state resonances, however, hampered the assignment of the backbone conformation of the peptidyl–prolyl bond at Pro32 and a more detailed structural and dynamic characterization of this intermediate [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Most recently, the difficulties in determining the conformational properties of IT have been overcome by using the β2m truncation variant ΔN6 as a structural mimic of this species (Fig. 3A,B, in red) [9,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>High resolution NMR studies directly comparing the 1H–15N HSQC spectra of ΔN6 and IT revealed that the major species populated by ΔN6 in solution at pH 7.5, 25 °C, closely resembles the transient folding intermediate IT (Fig. 3D,E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Using ΔN6 as a structural model for IT, full resonance assignment and structural elucidation were possible, revealing the structural and dynamical properties of this non-native conformer of β2m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The results showed that under the conditions employed ΔN6 retains a native fold but undergoes a major re-packing of several side chains within the hydrophobic core to accommodate the non-native trans-conformation of the His31-Pro32 peptide bond (Fig. 3A,B, in red). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the side chains involved map predominantly to the same residues that undergo structural reorganization in the presence of Cu2+ ions, although the precise packing of residues remains different in many cases (Fig. 3A,B) [9,55,58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Despite adopting a thermodynamically stable [9,25] native-like topology, ΔN6 is a highly dynamic entity, possessing only limited protection from hydrogen exchange together with pH- and concentration-dependent sensitivity of its backbone dynamics on a microsecond to millisecond timescale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that increased conformational dynamics of ΔN6 correlate with an increase in its amyloidogenic properties presumably by enabling the formation of one or more rarely populated conformers that have an enhanced potential to assemble into amyloid fibrils [9,32,123]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>One of the key events in this amyloid switch is protonation of His84, which experiences a large pKa shift from ∼ 4 to ∼ 7 upon peptidyl–prolyl isomerization of the His31-Pro32 peptide bond (Fig. 4A) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The involvement of His84 in the initiation of β2m amyloid fibril formation has been proposed previously using computational methods [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Oligomeric structures which become available after peptidyl–prolyl isomerization and exploration of conformational space upon His84 protonation have been proposed previously in association with Cu2+ binding [55,58], in the presence of dithiothreitol [124] or by the binding of nanobodies [125]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the last two conditions result in the formation of oligomers that are domain swapped, as proposed hitherto for β2m assembly under native conditions using computational methods [126] or Cu2+ treatment [106]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Whether domain swapping occurs in DRA, however, remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Another open question is the structural and dynamic similarities and differences between trans intermediates formed under different conditions (such as alterations of pH and temperature, Cu2+ treatment, mutagenesis (ΔN6) or addition of organic solvent (TFE)) and how these map to the structure determined for ΔN6 at neutral pH [9] or that of the more ephemeral amyloid precursors that form from this protein or from the folding intermediate IT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, these data are suggestive of a mechanism of assembly under different solution conditions that contains many features in common. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Despite the finding that ΔN6 comprises ∼ 26% of β2m in amyloid deposits in patients with DRA, this species is not found in the serum of people with renal dysfunction [127]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of these findings, formation of ΔN6 has been proposed to occur as a post-assembly event [123]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Most recently, however, it has been demonstrated that ΔN6 is not only able to nucleate fibrillogenesis efficiently in vitro at physiological pH as discussed above (Fig. 4B) [9,25,26] but, as a persistent trans-Pro32 state, ΔN6 is also able to convert wild-type β2m into an aggregation-competent conformer by bimolecular collision between the two monomers (Fig. 4B) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, only catalytic amounts (1%) of ΔN6 are sufficient to convert significant quantities of the wild-type protein into amyloid fibrils (Fig. 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Detailed interrogation of bimolecular collision between native wild-type β2m and ΔN6 using NMR revealed the molecular mechanism by which this prion-like templating might occur [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>First, ΔN6 binds specifically, but transiently, to native wild-type β2m, possibly involving residues of β-strands A, B and D and the DE-loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This interaction changes the native configuration of Pro14 within the AB-loop which is highly dynamic as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations [63,122] and X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1C,D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Pro14 dynamics have been shown hitherto to be responsible for an alternative β2m conformation in which the hydrogen bonding between β-strands A and B is severely impaired [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Inter-strand hydrogen bonding between those two strands, together with the correct attachment of the N-terminal hexapeptide, has been demonstrated to be crucial in maintaining a low concentration of IT at equilibrium [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Binding of ΔN6 to wild-type β2m, therefore, leads to the disruption of important interactions between the N-terminal hexapeptide and the BC-loop, leading to accelerated relaxation kinetics towards the amyloidogenic trans His31-Pro32 isomeric state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The truncation variant ΔN6 is thus capable of driving the innocuous native wild-type protein into aggregation-competent entities, reminiscent of the action of prions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Such an observation rationalizes the lack of circulating ΔN6 in the serum and, given the natural affinity of this species for collagen (which is enhanced relative to wild-type β2m [61]), explains why assembly of fibrils occurs most readily in collagen-rich joints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Rather than being an innocuous post-assembly event, therefore, proteolytic cleavage of β2m to create one or more species truncated at the N-terminus could be a key initiating event in DRA, enabling the formation of a species that is not only able to assemble de novo into amyloid fibrils but can enhance fibrillogenesis of wild-type β2m. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The latter is accomplished by initiating the ability of the wild-type protein to nucleate its own assembly, or by cross-seeding fibril elongation of ΔN6 seeds with wild-type monomers (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this review we have highlighted the importance of conformational dynamics for the initiation and development of β2m amyloid formation commencing from the natively folded state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Detailed analysis of the folding, stability and amyloidogenicity of a number of different proteins has revealed that a polypeptide chain can adopt a diversity of structures within a multidimensional energy landscape, the thermodynamics and kinetics of which are dependent on the protein sequence and solution conditions employed [128]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>One key feature that appears to identify amyloidogenic proteins from their non-amyloidogenic counterparts is a lack of structural cooperativity that is revealed by enhanced conformational dynamics on a microsecond to millisecond timescale, often portrayed by increased rates of proteolysis, hydrogen exchange and R2 NMR relaxation rates [115]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Such motions may expose sequences with high amyloid potential that are usually hidden within the native structure [70] or may endow surface properties that enable new protein–protein interactions to form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Studies of β2m have contributed substantially to this view, resulting most recently in a high resolution structure for the amyloid-initiating folding intermediate IT and the beginnings of a molecular understanding of why increased conformational dynamics make this species highly aggregation-prone [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Rather than an innocuous post-assembly event, the work suggests proteolytic cleavage as a cataclysmic event that releases a species that is not only able to spawn further aggregation-prone species but is also able to convert the wild-type protein into an amyloidogenic state via conformational conversion akin to the activity famously associated with prions [129–131]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Finally, many studies of β2m amyloid assembly under a wide range of conditions, some close to physiological and others utilizing metal ions or solvent additives to drive fibrillogenesis at neutral pH, have together revealed common principles of β2m self-assembly which are related by the formation of non-native species initiated by a cis to trans His31-Pro32 switch despite the wide range of conditions employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Further work is now needed to define the origins of molecular recognition between monomers and oligomers that form as assembly progresses into amyloid fibrils at neutral pH and to define the extent of further conformational changes required to form the cross-β structure of amyloid [132–135]. </plain></SENT>
