Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). It has several distinct functional domains in addition to the Abl kinase domain. The SH3 and SH2 domains cooperatively play important roles in autoinhibiting its kinase activity. Adapter molecules such as Grb2 and CrkL interact with proline-rich region and activate multiple Bcr-Abl downstream signaling pathways that contribute to growth and survival. Therefore, the oncogenic effect of Bcr-Abl could be inhibited by the interaction of small molecules with these domains. Apoptin is a viral protein with well-documented cancer-selective cytotoxicity. Apoptin attributes such as SH2-like sequence similarity with CrkL SH2 domain, unique SH3 domain binding sequence, presence of proline-rich segments, and its nuclear affinity render the molecule capable of interaction with Bcr-Abl. Despite almost two decades of research, the mode of apoptin's action remains elusive because 3D structure of apoptin is unavailable. We performed <italic>in silico</italic> three-dimensional modeling of apoptin, molecular docking experiments between apoptin model and the known structure of Bcr-Abl, and the 3D structures of SH2 domains of CrkL and Bcr-Abl. We also biochemically validated some of the interactions that were first predicted <italic>in silico</italic>. This structure-property relationship of apoptin may help in unlocking its cancer-selective toxic properties. Moreover, such models will guide us in developing of a new class of potent apoptin-like molecules with greater selectivity and potency.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aberrant expression of the <italic>Bcr-Abl</italic> oncogene is found with the frequency of &#x000b1;95&#x00025; of CML cases, and sporadically in other malignancies <xref rid="pone.0028395-Pisabarro1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-QuintasCardama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus for therapeutic applications, especially for CML treatment, Bcr-Abl is an attractive target for rational drug design, although so far, only its tyrosine kinase domain has been utilized. Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, contains a number of distinct domains such as SH3, SH2, kinase domains, DNA binding domains, actin-binding domains, nuclear localization signals, nuclear export signal, and four proline-rich motifs that function as binding sites for the adaptor proteins such as, Grb2 and CrkL <xref rid="pone.0028395-QuintasCardama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Several potent inhibitors have been developed and studied extensively <xref rid="pone.0028395-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Imatinib is currently widely used for the treatment of CML patients. Most chronic phase CML patients treated with imatinib as first-line therapy, initially maintain excellent response. However, failure of response occurs in advanced-stage CML patients due to drug resistance caused frequently by mutations within- or in the proximity to Bcr-Abl's ATP-binding pocket. Other types of changes have also been documented. For example, CML stem cells obtained from some patients with imatinib resistance, down-regulation the expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN could be detected <xref rid="pone.0028395-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors namely, dasatinib, nilotinib or bosutinib are effective on most of the Bcr-Abl mutations, some p-loop mutations or T315I substitution provide a very difficult resistance to most of the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors currently in use <xref rid="pone.0028395-QuintasCardama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Chomel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Schiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Other therapeutic strategies besides small molecule approach include the use of monoclonal antibodies <xref rid="pone.0028395-Schnaiter1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Current understanding of resistance mechanisms include the ability of cancer cells to remove drugs (drug efflux) by the different transporters such as MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) or P-glycoprotein, lack of bioavailability of drugs, and inhibition of transporter molecules such as SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1), responsible for drug transport into the cell (drug influx), or mutations altering the interaction of drug with its target. These mechanisms however do not fully explain drug-resistance observed in all instances. One of the possible reasons could be the protein dynamics due to drug-protein binding (protein dynamics due to folding, change in shape and size). It is known that the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl is negatively regulated, in normal situation, by cooperative combination of the SH3 and SH2 domain by internally engaging the SH2 domain <xref rid="pone.0028395-Nagar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Nagar2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Generally, SH3 domains serve as modules that mediate protein-protein associations along with SH2 domains and thus regulate cytoplasmic signaling. SH2 domains play important roles in (i) in cellular communication, (ii) in a variety signal transduction pathways, and (iii) in recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated sites respectively. But inappropriate communication or misreading of the phosphorylated site could lead to undesirable activation of pathways <xref rid="pone.0028395-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Pawson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Negative regulation of Bcr-Abl by blocking these domains by apoptin-inspired small molecule to control its oncogenic role would be an attractive approach, as compared to conventional targeted drug design <xref rid="pone.0028395-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In this study, we present a possible alternative approach of inhibition of Bcr-Abl through surface interaction of SH3 domain by the apoptin molecule rather than binding to a narrowly-defined domain.</p><p>Apoptin has gained significant attention in recent years, both as a lead for the development of cancer-specific therapeutics, and also for its potential use as an indicator of cellular transformation processes. Apoptin is a 13.6 kD viral protein encoded by the <italic>VP3</italic> gene of Chicken Anemia Virus and is composed of 121 amino acids <xref rid="pone.0028395-Adair1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Los1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It induces apoptosis independently of death receptor pathways in a broad range of transformed and cancer cells. Apoptin localizes in the nucleus in cancer cells, however in non-transformed or primary cells it is localized to the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0028395-Heilman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The cellular localization of apoptin is influenced by its phosphorylation status at theronine-108. Phosphorylated T-108 inhibits nearby nuclear export signal, thus leading to nuclear accumulation of apoptin <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Poon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Wagstaff1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Apoptin phosphorylation has been proposed to be regulated by Akt-activated CDK-2 and PKC kinase <xref rid="pone.0028395-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Los2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika4" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, nuclear localization of apoptin and its interaction with specific signaling proteins plays a crucial role in its selective toxicity <xref rid="pone.0028395-Poon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Wagstaff1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-nenVanOorschot1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Highly organized recognition of specific target binding partners by signaling proteins is an important aspect of many cellular processes. The specificity of these interactions is determined by the physical, structural and chemical properties of the interacting proteins. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the 3D structures of the involved proteins is necessary to understand such interactions. Unfortunately, the 3D molecular structure of apoptin revealing its precise structure-function relationship has not yet been resolved by conventional crystallography or NMR studies. Determination of the 3D molecular structure requires that the molecule be in crystal form suitable for X-ray crystallographic study or to be of less than 30 kD for accurate NMR study. In case of apoptin, the 3D molecular structure could not be attained due to the inability of the molecule to be crystallized, and the nature of the molecule to stay in solution as globular multimers <xref rid="pone.0028395-Leliveld1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The alternative technique to study protein structures and to predict interactions with other proteins is &#x02018;homology modeling&#x02019; and &#x02018;virtual protein docking&#x02019; experiments. This novel method to identify the function of proteins, based directly on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm, is broadly known as &#x02018;computational protein modeling&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0028395-Rychlewski1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While employing this approach, it is possible to build the best-predicted structure of the protein from its amino acid sequences (target) on the basis of known 3D structure of related family members (templates). The &#x02018;low resolution&#x02019; models obtained by homology modeling provide essential information of the spatial arrangement of important groups of residues.</p><p>Here we report for the first time, a simulated 3D model of apoptin generated by using homology modeling as a backup alternative to the conventional, crystallography- or NMR-based methods. We then use the calculated structural coordinates of apoptin to study its interaction with the 3D structure of CML-associated oncoprotein Bcr-Abl. Furthermore, we biochemically confirmed the accuracy of at least some elements of the model by showing that the modeled interaction between apoptin and Bcr-Abl indeed physically occurs between both proteins. We also examined the pathways and interacting network from a global perspective and experimentally validated some of the important molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Apoptin is toxic to both Bcr-Abl positive and -negative cells, and it inhibits Bcr-Abl phosphorylation/activation</title><p>The known domains of apoptin were designed and presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) to understand its cytotoxicity in relation to its various domains.

This preliminary observation was further substantiated by &#x02018;pull-down assay&#x02019; and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) studies using the Bcr-Abl<sup>p210</sup> stably expressing 32D<sup>p210</sup> cells and compared to the Bcr-Abl non-expressing 32D<sup>DSMZ</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). For the GST-pull down assay recombinant GST and GST-conjugated apoptin were purified from IPTG stimulated transformed bacterial clones harboring the respective plasmids. The membrane was probed with anti-Bcr-Abl primary antibody. A representative blot from such an experiment shows the presence of Bcr-Abl (Lane 5) in the GST-Apoptin pull-down product (220 kD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). This 220 kD protein &#x02018;pulled down&#x02019; by apoptin, was confirmed by the presence of a similar band in the lysates of 32D<sup>p210</sup> cells with stable expression of Bcr-Abl<sup>p210</sup>. This <italic>in vitro</italic> assay demonstrated apoptin interactions with Bcr-Abl. Non-specific interactions in the absence of GST-Apoptin (beads control, lane 4) were not detected. We further confirmed Bcr-Abl and apoptin interactions by Co-IP when GFP-Apoptin was transiently expressed in Bcr-Abl expressing 32D<sup>p210</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Apoptin interacts with Bcr-Abl via a specific motif</title><p>To identify the precise nature of apoptin and Bcr-Abl interaction in CML cells, we mapped the sites on apoptin responsible for interaction with specific region of Bcr-Abl<sup>p210</sup>.

Mutants were selected according to their specific nature of SH-domain mutations to probe if apoptin interacted with the SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl. Full length Bcr-Abl, and its derivates with intact SH3-domain interacted with GST-Apoptin and were &#x02018;pulled-down&#x02019; by glutathione sepharose beads, while other mutants lacking intact SH3 domain failed to show such interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Bioinformatics analysis of molecules known to interact with (Bcr-)Abl</title><p>Global gene expression data for K562 cells was analyzed as published <xref rid="pone.0028395-Mandal2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

We have been able to build a model of apoptin by applying a comparative or homology protein modeling approach despite low identity (about 31&#x00025;) and similarity (about 52&#x00025;) of the templates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;C, and E</xref> shows the sequence alignment of the templates, ribbon view, space filling full-length model of apoptin, and Ramachandran plot, and solvent accessible surface area respectively. This model was used to virtually examine various binding interactions with Bcr-Abl by performing virtual docking experiment between apoptin and the X-ray crystal structure of Bcr-Abl (PDB code: 2ABL). First, accessible surface area for apoptin was identified. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g004">figure 4E</xref>, the large cream colored area is the hydrophobic region, the sites for protein-interaction, purple-red areas and blue areas are hydrophilic regions, purple-red indicates hydrogen bonding acceptors (for example, C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;O) and blue regions indicate hydrogen bond donors (for example, N-H or O-H).</p><p>Using this model, we have been able to identify the nature of interactions and hydrogen bonding between the residues of SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl and apoptin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028395-t003">Table 3</xref>). Subsequently, we have experimentally verified the observed interaction between apoptin and the SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. In this model system, 13 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, red) of SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl are approximated within 2.5 &#x000c5; of apoptin and 13 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, light-green) of apoptin are within 2.5 &#x000c5; of Bcr-Abl residues. Interestingly, some of the proline rich PxxP sequences (aa: 81&#x02013;86, QPKPPSKKR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g005">Fig. 5AB</xref>) are involved in these interaction among other nearby residues and at least five pairs of direct hydrogen bonding are possible between them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028395-t002">Table 2</xref>). This low-resolution model provides information about the interaction between Bcr-Abl and apoptin and it helps us to explain the probable mode of action; moreover, our experimental pull-down assay' and co-immunoprecipitation studies confirm occurrence of those interactions in cell nuclei.</p><p>We not only show for the first time, that Tat-apoptin, a cell-penetrating conjugate of apoptin strongly binds to the SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl, but also it modifies the phosphorylation status and thus the activity of Bcr-Abl, and several of its downstream targets. These changes lead to the anti-proliferative effect and induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rapidly dividing CML cells. Using human CML cell line, K562 and Bcr-Abl<sup>p210</sup> expressing murine cell line 32D<sup>p210</sup> as models, we observed that these cells are significantly responsive to apoptin. These highly proliferating human and murine cell lines have a high cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl<sup>p210</sup> pool and thus the cell culture condition mimic the blast crisis stage of CML. Furthermore, as in CML, the central mitogenic Ras-MAPK cascade is also activated, similarly as in our model cell lines. Our findings corroborate well with previous studies, by Kardinal and colleagues, involving a similar approach directed towards the Grb2-SoS-Ras-MAP kinase (Erk) pathway <xref rid="pone.0028395-Kardinal1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In these experiments, small, high affinity peptides blocking the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 were applied. Their results indicate that peptide based inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase or its down-stream targets could be valuable anti-CML tool if combined with conventional cytotoxic therapy <xref rid="pone.0028395-Kardinal1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We have also observed that apoptin-derived peptides capable of interaction with SH3 domain are toxic against Bcr-Abl expressing cells (data not shown). We have further demonstrated that apoptin, unlike Imatinib/Gleevec, was effective both against Bcr-Abl positive and also Bcl-Abl negative cells. We thus hypothesize that apoptin-based therapeutics would be not only more effective, but have the additional advantage that they would be less prone to the development of resistance.</p><p>Activation of Bcr-Abl is critical for the development of CML.

Using bioinformatics approaches, we visualize the relationship between these component molecules and pathways using global gene expression data. A comprehensive analysis of molecular interactions of Bcr-Abl target molecules that are either directly (solid lines or solid lines with arrows) or indirectly (broken lines or broken lines with arrows) involved are shown in an interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interrelationship between molecules is clearly visualized their activated (pink color) or repressive (green color) states. In this figure, expression values are also shown. As shown in diagram 3A, the network of genes and proteins is very complex and in the context of drug design it is essential to consider these interrelationships to avoid drug toxicity.</p><p>In our previous studies, we have shown that direct apoptin-Akt interaction initiates nuclear trafficking of Akt. Interestingly, nuclear Akt, instead of activating an anti-apoptotic response initiates apoptosis by a process that is only partially understood <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika5" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our observation corroborates well with recent data from other studies, showing that Akt inhibitors have been only moderately successful in experimental cancer therapy <xref rid="pone.0028395-Workman1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Furthermore, similar to the earlier observed nuclear transfer of Akt, we have also observed the nuclear transport of apoptin-interacting protein Bcr-Abl. We hypothesize that nuclear re-location of Bcr-Abl may markedly affect its biologic properties.</p><p>The adaptor proteins CrkL forms a complex with Bcr-Abl leading to Bcr-Abl&#x02013;dependent phosphorylation of CrkL and subsequent phosphorylation of c-Cbl may contribute to Bcr-Abl dependent activation of PI3 kinase <xref rid="pone.0028395-Sattler2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Multiple downstream targets of PI3 kinase have been identified. But apoptin interaction might block complex formation between the adapter protein CrkL and Bcr-Abl. Nuclear localization of apoptin is essential to block the complex formation between Bcr-Abl and CrkL. We have examined the nuclear localization of apoptin as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028395-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. As previously mentioned, apoptin is a cytoplasmic molecule but nuclear localization occurs upon phosphorylation at Thr108 in transformed cells, thus in CML-cells it is predominantly nuclear. These interactions and trans-activation of CrkL and c-Crk II by activated Bcr-Abl kinase and their functional consequences are well documented <xref rid="pone.0028395-Feller1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Posern1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time that apoptin inhibits phosphorylation of CrkL in Bcr-Abl expressing cells. This observation indicates that apoptin can indirectly affect growth-supportive role of phosphorylated CrkL by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase. Overall, these observations signify apoptin as a negative-modulator of Bcr-Abl kinase activity, and indirectly, of the multiple cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways that are fuelled by Bcr-Abl. We also consistently observed the activation of Akt upon apoptin and/or imatinib treatment in Bcr-Abl expressing cells. Akt is a downstream target for Bcr-Abl kinase and known to interact with apoptin. However it also functions independently of Bcr-Abl, for example, it is one of the key effectors of the PI3-K/PDK1-2 pathway upon cell membrane triggering. Beside its pro-survival function, activated Akt if located in the nucleus, will promote cell death rather than cell survival <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika4" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika5" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028395-Trotman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>STATs act as regulators of cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0028395-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0028395-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. We have previously reported that apoptin productively interacts with the SH3 domain of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-K <xref rid="pone.0028395-Maddika3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the current study, we report for the first time that apoptin inhibits STAT5 activation in Bcr-Abl expressing cell lines. Furthermore, since STAT5 also regulates the Bfl-1 family gene A1 that reportedly collaborates with <italic>c-myc</italic> and is required for Bcr-Abl transformation <xref rid="pone.0028395-Sawyers1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, this observation strongly supports the role of apoptin as a proliferation inhibitor of CML cells.</p><p>Different components of the Bcr-Abl downstream pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of CML and are highly active compared to normal cells. Hyperactivation of STATs, Ras-MAPK or CrkL-integrin pathways lead to the development of characteristic CML pathologic features. Apoptin affects many of these signaling events, and thus it is well suited for targeting the cellular signaling environment of Bcr-Abl expressing cancer cells. In addition, apoptin is a good candidate to serve as a model/lead molecule for the development of smaller peptides or peptidomimetics that would target multiple cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways. This may be of advantage also for CML-treatment because advanced highly mutated CML-cells may no longer solely rely on Bcr-Abl as the driver of cell proliferation (hence, acquired resistance to Imatinib). Apoptin acts on multiple targets related to cell proliferation by blocking their association with Bcr-Abl rather than binding. Thus, this is an alternative approach to the conventional target based rational drug design to block the interactions of adapter molecules rather than binding a small molecule to the active site. When a small molecule diffuses into a macromolecule, it alters the shape and size of the macromolecule leading to its conformation change. These changes in shape, size, and dynamics could lead to the activation/deactivation of undesired bio-molecules that in turn may yield detrimental effects.</p><p>To improve the potency and specificity of small apoptin-like peptides, designing new small molecules with proper shape, number of proline residues in appropriate positions, and capability of nuclear trafficking is essential. To avoid undesirable drug effects, repetitive evaluation of potency, examination of global gene expression, and extensive bioinformatics analysis are indispensable until a drug-like molecule with desired properties is achieved. Present study, model-structure-function relationship, provides such opportunities to design next generation of apoptin-like molecules with desired properties. We are aware of limitations of computational modeling of protein structure. However since we are able to confirm by biochemical methods the predicted intermolecular interactions, we are convinced that the provided model is highly accurate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Three-dimensional/3D modeling</title><p>The homology modeling approach was used to generate 3D structures of apoptin, a viral protein encoded by the <italic>VP3</italic> gene of Chicken Anemia Virus that is composed of 121 amino acids (13.6 kDa).
