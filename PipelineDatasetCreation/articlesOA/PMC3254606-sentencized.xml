<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has several distinct functional domains in addition to the Abl kinase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SH3 and SH2 domains cooperatively play important roles in autoinhibiting its kinase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adapter molecules such as Grb2 and CrkL interact with proline-rich region and activate multiple Bcr-Abl downstream signaling pathways that contribute to growth and survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the oncogenic effect of Bcr-Abl could be inhibited by the interaction of small molecules with these domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Apoptin is a viral protein with well-documented cancer-selective cytotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Apoptin attributes such as SH2-like sequence similarity with CrkL SH2 domain, unique SH3 domain binding sequence, presence of proline-rich segments, and its nuclear affinity render the molecule capable of interaction with Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite almost two decades of research, the mode of apoptin's action remains elusive because 3D structure of apoptin is unavailable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We performed in silico three-dimensional modeling of apoptin, molecular docking experiments between apoptin model and the known structure of Bcr-Abl, and the 3D structures of SH2 domains of CrkL and Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We also biochemically validated some of the interactions that were first predicted in silico. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This structure-property relationship of apoptin may help in unlocking its cancer-selective toxic properties. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of the Bcr-Abl oncogene is found with the frequency of ±95% of CML cases, and sporadically in other malignancies [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Thus for therapeutic applications, especially for CML treatment, Bcr-Abl is an attractive target for rational drug design, although so far, only its tyrosine kinase domain has been utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, contains a number of distinct domains such as SH3, SH2, kinase domains, DNA binding domains, actin-binding domains, nuclear localization signals, nuclear export signal, and four proline-rich motifs that function as binding sites for the adaptor proteins such as, Grb2 and CrkL [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Several potent inhibitors have been developed and studied extensively [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Imatinib is currently widely used for the treatment of CML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most chronic phase CML patients treated with imatinib as first-line therapy, initially maintain excellent response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, failure of response occurs in advanced-stage CML patients due to drug resistance caused frequently by mutations within- or in the proximity to Bcr-Abl's ATP-binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Other types of changes have also been documented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, CML stem cells obtained from some patients with imatinib resistance, down-regulation the expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN could be detected [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors namely, dasatinib, nilotinib or bosutinib are effective on most of the Bcr-Abl mutations, some p-loop mutations or T315I substitution provide a very difficult resistance to most of the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors currently in use [2], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Other therapeutic strategies besides small molecule approach include the use of monoclonal antibodies [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Current understanding of resistance mechanisms include the ability of cancer cells to remove drugs (drug efflux) by the different transporters such as MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) or P-glycoprotein, lack of bioavailability of drugs, and inhibition of transporter molecules such as SLC22A1 (solute carrier family 22 member 1), responsible for drug transport into the cell (drug influx), or mutations altering the interaction of drug with its target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms however do not fully explain drug-resistance observed in all instances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of the possible reasons could be the protein dynamics due to drug-protein binding (protein dynamics due to folding, change in shape and size). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is known that the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl is negatively regulated, in normal situation, by cooperative combination of the SH3 and SH2 domain by internally engaging the SH2 domain [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Generally, SH3 domains serve as modules that mediate protein-protein associations along with SH2 domains and thus regulate cytoplasmic signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>SH2 domains play important roles in (i) in cellular communication, (ii) in a variety signal transduction pathways, and (iii) in recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated sites respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>But inappropriate communication or misreading of the phosphorylated site could lead to undesirable activation of pathways [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Negative regulation of Bcr-Abl by blocking these domains by apoptin-inspired small molecule to control its oncogenic role would be an attractive approach, as compared to conventional targeted drug design [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present a possible alternative approach of inhibition of Bcr-Abl through surface interaction of SH3 domain by the apoptin molecule rather than binding to a narrowly-defined domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Apoptin has gained significant attention in recent years, both as a lead for the development of cancer-specific therapeutics, and also for its potential use as an indicator of cellular transformation processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Apoptin is a 13.6 kD viral protein encoded by the VP3 gene of Chicken Anemia Virus and is composed of 121 amino acids [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>It induces apoptosis independently of death receptor pathways in a broad range of transformed and cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Apoptin localizes in the nucleus in cancer cells, however in non-transformed or primary cells it is localized to the cytoplasm [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The cellular localization of apoptin is influenced by its phosphorylation status at theronine-108. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated T-108 inhibits nearby nuclear export signal, thus leading to nuclear accumulation of apoptin [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Apoptin phosphorylation has been proposed to be regulated by Akt-activated CDK-2 and PKC kinase [21], [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Thus, nuclear localization of apoptin and its interaction with specific signaling proteins plays a crucial role in its selective toxicity [19], [20], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Highly organized recognition of specific target binding partners by signaling proteins is an important aspect of many cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The specificity of these interactions is determined by the physical, structural and chemical properties of the interacting proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Therefore, detailed knowledge about the 3D structures of the involved proteins is necessary to understand such interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the 3D molecular structure of apoptin revealing its precise structure-function relationship has not yet been resolved by conventional crystallography or NMR studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Determination of the 3D molecular structure requires that the molecule be in crystal form suitable for X-ray crystallographic study or to be of less than 30 kD for accurate NMR study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In case of apoptin, the 3D molecular structure could not be attained due to the inability of the molecule to be crystallized, and the nature of the molecule to stay in solution as globular multimers [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The alternative technique to study protein structures and to predict interactions with other proteins is ‘homology modeling’ and ‘virtual protein docking’ experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This novel method to identify the function of proteins, based directly on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm, is broadly known as ‘computational protein modeling’ [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>While employing this approach, it is possible to build the best-predicted structure of the protein from its amino acid sequences (target) on the basis of known 3D structure of related family members (templates). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The ‘low resolution’ models obtained by homology modeling provide essential information of the spatial arrangement of important groups of residues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Here we report for the first time, a simulated 3D model of apoptin generated by using homology modeling as a backup alternative to the conventional, crystallography- or NMR-based methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We then use the calculated structural coordinates of apoptin to study its interaction with the 3D structure of CML-associated oncoprotein Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we biochemically confirmed the accuracy of at least some elements of the model by showing that the modeled interaction between apoptin and Bcr-Abl indeed physically occurs between both proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We also examined the pathways and interacting network from a global perspective and experimentally validated some of the important molecules. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Using this model, we have been able to identify the nature of interactions and hydrogen bonding between the residues of SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl and apoptin (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have experimentally verified the observed interaction between apoptin and the SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>In this model system, 13 aa (Fig. 5B, red) of SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl are approximated within 2.5 Å of apoptin and 13 aa (Fig. 5B, light-green) of apoptin are within 2.5 Å of Bcr-Abl residues. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>This low-resolution model provides information about the interaction between Bcr-Abl and apoptin and it helps us to explain the probable mode of action; moreover, our experimental pull-down assay' and co-immunoprecipitation studies confirm occurrence of those interactions in cell nuclei. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>We not only show for the first time, that Tat-apoptin, a cell-penetrating conjugate of apoptin strongly binds to the SH3 domain of Bcr-Abl, but also it modifies the phosphorylation status and thus the activity of Bcr-Abl, and several of its downstream targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>These changes lead to the anti-proliferative effect and induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rapidly dividing CML cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Using human CML cell line, K562 and Bcr-Ablp210 expressing murine cell line 32Dp210 as models, we observed that these cells are significantly responsive to apoptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>These highly proliferating human and murine cell lines have a high cytoplasmic Bcr-Ablp210 pool and thus the cell culture condition mimic the blast crisis stage of CML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as in CML, the central mitogenic Ras-MAPK cascade is also activated, similarly as in our model cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Our findings corroborate well with previous studies, by Kardinal and colleagues, involving a similar approach directed towards the Grb2-SoS-Ras-MAP kinase (Erk) pathway [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, small, high affinity peptides blocking the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 were applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Their results indicate that peptide based inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase or its down-stream targets could be valuable anti-CML tool if combined with conventional cytotoxic therapy [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>We have also observed that apoptin-derived peptides capable of interaction with SH3 domain are toxic against Bcr-Abl expressing cells (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>We have further demonstrated that apoptin, unlike Imatinib/Gleevec, was effective both against Bcr-Abl positive and also Bcl-Abl negative cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>We thus hypothesize that apoptin-based therapeutics would be not only more effective, but have the additional advantage that they would be less prone to the development of resistance. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, we have shown that direct apoptin-Akt interaction initiates nuclear trafficking of Akt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, nuclear Akt, instead of activating an anti-apoptotic response initiates apoptosis by a process that is only partially understood [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Our observation corroborates well with recent data from other studies, showing that Akt inhibitors have been only moderately successful in experimental cancer therapy [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, similar to the earlier observed nuclear transfer of Akt, we have also observed the nuclear transport of apoptin-interacting protein Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that nuclear re-location of Bcr-Abl may markedly affect its biologic properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The adaptor proteins CrkL forms a complex with Bcr-Abl leading to Bcr-Abl–dependent phosphorylation of CrkL and subsequent phosphorylation of c-Cbl may contribute to Bcr-Abl dependent activation of PI3 kinase [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Multiple downstream targets of PI3 kinase have been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>But apoptin interaction might block complex formation between the adapter protein CrkL and Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Nuclear localization of apoptin is essential to block the complex formation between Bcr-Abl and CrkL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>We have examined the nuclear localization of apoptin as shown Figure 2A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>As previously mentioned, apoptin is a cytoplasmic molecule but nuclear localization occurs upon phosphorylation at Thr108 in transformed cells, thus in CML-cells it is predominantly nuclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>These interactions and trans-activation of CrkL and c-Crk II by activated Bcr-Abl kinase and their functional consequences are well documented [35], [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time that apoptin inhibits phosphorylation of CrkL in Bcr-Abl expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>This observation indicates that apoptin can indirectly affect growth-supportive role of phosphorylated CrkL by inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Overall, these observations signify apoptin as a negative-modulator of Bcr-Abl kinase activity, and indirectly, of the multiple cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways that are fuelled by Bcr-Abl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>We also consistently observed the activation of Akt upon apoptin and/or imatinib treatment in Bcr-Abl expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Akt is a downstream target for Bcr-Abl kinase and known to interact with apoptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>However it also functions independently of Bcr-Abl, for example, it is one of the key effectors of the PI3-K/PDK1-2 pathway upon cell membrane triggering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Beside its pro-survival function, activated Akt if located in the nucleus, will promote cell death rather than cell survival [23], [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>STATs act as regulators of cell proliferation [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal regulatory region of Abl protein contains the SH2 and SH3 domains which are important for the regulation of activity in vivo [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that apoptin productively interacts with the SH3 domain of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-K [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we report for the first time that apoptin inhibits STAT5 activation in Bcr-Abl expressing cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since STAT5 also regulates the Bfl-1 family gene A1 that reportedly collaborates with c-myc and is required for Bcr-Abl transformation [65], this observation strongly supports the role of apoptin as a proliferation inhibitor of CML cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Different components of the Bcr-Abl downstream pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of CML and are highly active compared to normal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Hyperactivation of STATs, Ras-MAPK or CrkL-integrin pathways lead to the development of characteristic CML pathologic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Apoptin affects many of these signaling events, and thus it is well suited for targeting the cellular signaling environment of Bcr-Abl expressing cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>In addition, apoptin is a good candidate to serve as a model/lead molecule for the development of smaller peptides or peptidomimetics that would target multiple cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>This may be of advantage also for CML-treatment because advanced highly mutated CML-cells may no longer solely rely on Bcr-Abl as the driver of cell proliferation (hence, acquired resistance to Imatinib). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Apoptin acts on multiple targets related to cell proliferation by blocking their association with Bcr-Abl rather than binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Thus, this is an alternative approach to the conventional target based rational drug design to block the interactions of adapter molecules rather than binding a small molecule to the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>When a small molecule diffuses into a macromolecule, it alters the shape and size of the macromolecule leading to its conformation change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>These changes in shape, size, and dynamics could lead to the activation/deactivation of undesired bio-molecules that in turn may yield detrimental effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>To improve the potency and specificity of small apoptin-like peptides, designing new small molecules with proper shape, number of proline residues in appropriate positions, and capability of nuclear trafficking is essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>To avoid undesirable drug effects, repetitive evaluation of potency, examination of global gene expression, and extensive bioinformatics analysis are indispensable until a drug-like molecule with desired properties is achieved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Present study, model-structure-function relationship, provides such opportunities to design next generation of apoptin-like molecules with desired properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>We are aware of limitations of computational modeling of protein structure. </plain></SENT>
