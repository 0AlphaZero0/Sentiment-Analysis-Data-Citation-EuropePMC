We analyzed pooled serum samples from 4 groups of patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5 samples/group), collected prospectively and actively monitored for a minimum of 5 yrs. Patients groups were (i) histological diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia with no evidence of cancer &#x02018;BPH&#x02019;, (ii) localised cancer with no evidence of progression, &#x02018;non-progressing&#x02019; (iii) localised cancer with evidence of biochemical progression, &#x02018;progressing&#x02019;, and (iv) bone metastasis at presentation &#x02018;metastatic&#x02019;. Pooled samples were immuno-depleted of the 14 most highly abundant proteins and analysed using a 4-plex iTRAQ approach. Overall 122 proteins were identified and relatively quantified. Comparisons of progressing <italic>versus</italic> non-progressing groups identified the significant differential expression of 25 proteins (p&#x0003c;0.001). Comparisons of metastatic <italic>versus</italic> progressing groups identified the significant differential expression of 23 proteins. Mapping the differentially expressed proteins onto the prostate cancer progression pathway revealed the dysregulated expression of individual proteins, pairs of proteins and &#x02018;panels&#x02019; of proteins to be associated with particular stages of disease development and progression. The median immunostaining intensity of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), one of the candidates identified, was significantly higher in osteoblasts in close proximity to metastatic tumour cells compared with osteoblasts in control bone (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0353, Mann Whitney U). Our proteomic approach has identified leads for potentially useful serum biomarkers associated with the metastatic progression of prostate cancer. The panels identified, including eEF1A1 warrant further investigation and validation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In Europe and the US, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosis and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men <xref rid="pone.0030885-Damber1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Gronberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Moreover, the incidence has increased since the widespread introduction of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing <xref rid="pone.0030885-Freedland1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Most patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed at an early stage, but even with screening over 7&#x00025; of cases develop metastatic disease <xref rid="pone.0030885-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In men with distant metastasis the prognosis is poor, with an average survival of 24 to 48 months. Bone is the most common site for prostate cancer metastasis and is associated with bone pain, spinal cord compression and marrow failure <xref rid="pone.0030885-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Currently, bone metastatic lesions are determined by imaging such as isotope bone scanning, however, the identification of a serum based biomarker(s) for predicting the susceptibility of patients to develop bone metastasis could enable a more accurate clinical assessment of the disease and help guide therapy.</p><p>The diagnosis of prostate cancer is most commonly made by a triad of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, digital rectal examination (DRE), and histological assessment of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy material <xref rid="pone.0030885-LaSpina1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although PSA is a FDA approved biomarker for prostate cancer detection, its usefulness is controversial as it has been shown to be unreliable for disease diagnosis, and in particular for distinguishing indolent from aggressive forms of the disease <xref rid="pone.0030885-Lilja1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-vanGils1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, PSA is associated with a high degree of false-positive and false-negative test results, as levels may be elevated in non-cancer conditions of the prostate, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Thus, additional biomarkers are urgently needed which could improve the diagnostic specificity of PSA and predict the likelihood of disease progression.</p><p>Blood and its products, such as plasma and serum are ideal fluids for the identification of cancer biomarkers since they contain proteins both secreted and shed from cancer cells, combined with the ease of sampling. However, the variable composition and large dynamic range of proteins present in plasma (estimated to be 10<sup>10</sup> orders of magnitude or more), pose formidable challenges in identifying clinically relevant biomarkers amongst the background of abundant proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulin and transferrin <xref rid="pone.0030885-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Of the 22 or so most abundant proteins in plasma, these constitute more than 99&#x00025; of the mass of the total plasma proteins, while the remaining 1&#x00025; are thought to be composed of the medium/low abundance proteins and include the biomarker pool <xref rid="pone.0030885-Qian1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The large orders of magnitude in protein concentration have hampered previous mass spectrometry based efforts aimed at identifying clinically relevant biomarkers, mainly due to a suppression of ionization of the low abundance proteins by the higher abundance proteins <xref rid="pone.0030885-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, prior removal of some of the most highly abundant proteins has been shown to improve the detection of relatively lower abundant proteins <xref rid="pone.0030885-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Pieper1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although there are many different protein fractionation methodologies based on differences in molecular weight, shape, charge, pI, hydrophobicity and affinity through specific biomolecular interactions, it has been reported that high abundance protein separation using the antibody based IgY-12 immunodepletion system is highly reproducible <xref rid="pone.0030885-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Amongst the proteomic technologies used for biomarker identification, &#x02018;isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation&#x02019; (iTRAQ) has the advantages of being relatively high throughput, and can simultaneously provide information on peptide quantitation and identification, as previously reported by us and others <xref rid="pone.0030885-Glen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030885-Keshamouni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Briefly, in a typical workflow samples are reduced, alkylated and proteolytically digested to generate peptides. The peptides are labeled with a set of iTRAQ reagents (in a 4 or 8-plex format), pooled and fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX). The fractions are then analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with the resultant mass spectra providing sequence information (from the peptide fragments), and relative quantification (from the reporter group ions).</p><p>In an effort to identify novel proteins associated with the metastatic progression of human prostate cancer, we have performed a 4-plex iTRAQ analysis using pooled serum samples collected prospectively from 4 well defined groups of patients who were actively monitored for at least 5 years, and selected to represent the spectrum of prostatic disease. Following data analysis, a number of candidates were found to be significantly differentially expressed in cancer samples compared with benign samples. One of the candidates identified as being significantly up-regulated in cancer groups was eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), and was further investigated by immunohistochemistry using prostate tissue samples from localized and metastatic cases. The biomarker leads identified in our &#x02018;discovery&#x02019; phase study, including eEF1A1 are discussed in relation to their significance to prostate cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and serum collection</title><p>Peripheral blood was collected prospectively from patients attending the Urology clinic at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital at the time of their initial visit, following written informed consent.

Regarding the differentially expressed proteins, some of these have previously been reported as candidate prostate cancer biomarkers such as CRP, alpha-2-macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, beta-2-microglobulin and fibronectin, which provides confidence to our dataset and provides an independent confirmation of these candidates <xref rid="pone.0030885-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030885-Cima1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Of the proteins previously associated with prostate cancer; CRP is an acute phase reactant (APR) protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation.

Thus, our finding of elevated levels of CRP in metastatic cases is consistent with previous studies. In addition to CRP, many other proteins seen to be differentially expressed between patient groups were found to class to the APR protein family and include fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, alpha-1- acid glycoprotein, alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030885-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins showed that a number of these such as C4, C4a, C5, C5b, C9 and C6 mapped to the classical inflammatory pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030885.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Although this finding is perhaps not surprising as it is well documented that the presence of a tumour activates an inflammatory response, another possibility is that at least some of these APR proteins could have been secreted &#x02018;ectopically&#x02019; by the tumour cells themselves. In support of this possibility, previous studies have reported that renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer cell lines may produce and secrete common plasma proteins such as albumin, prealbumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, transferrin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin <xref rid="pone.0030885-Yoshimura1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Mbeunkui1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Serum B2M levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0030885-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, B2M has functionally been implicated in prostate cancer as its over-expression in cancer cells induced rapid tumour growth in bone, while disrupting B2M signaling by specific small interfering RNA produced a regression of previously established prostate tumours <xref rid="pone.0030885-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, B2M may potentially serve as a biomarker for prostate cancer progression and a novel drug target for the treatment of bone metastasis which requires further study.</p><p>Other candidates up-regulated in one or more of the cancer groups compared with the BPH group were fibronectin 1, afamin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein chain B, ceruloplasmin and beta-2-glycoprotein 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030885-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, fibronectin was very recently shown to be amongst the five-protein signature panel with potential for Gleason score prediction <xref rid="pone.0030885-Cima1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, in a recent study fibronectin has been shown to be involved in initiating lung cancer metastasis <xref rid="pone.0030885-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, thus making fibronectin an attractive candidate biomarker and therapeutic target.</p><p>Another promising candidate identified in our study was Afamin, which was found to be up-regulated in the non-progressing group compared with BPH group, but was down-regulated in the progressing and metastatic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030885-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Afamin is a member of the albumin gene family expressed by the liver and kidneys, and has been shown to be a specific binding protein for vitamin E. Interestingly, our data is consistent with a previous study which showed a decrease in afamin levels in ovarian cancer where it has been proposed as a candidate biomarker <xref rid="pone.0030885-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Thus, the potential of afamin as a candidate prostate cancer biomarker requires further study.</p><p>eEF1A1, is a member of the elongation factor proteins that normally functions to mediate the selection and binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome during protein synthesis, and ensures translational accuracy. eEF1A1 was of particular interest to us as we had previously shown its levels to be increased in higher metastatic variant prostate cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0030885-Glen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and another study had reported that down-regulation of eEF1A1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in Du145 cells led to an inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration <xref rid="pone.0030885-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Interestingly a truncated form of eEF1A1 known as prostate tumour inducing gene 1 (PTI-1) has been shown to be expressed in prostate carcinoma patient-derived blood samples and proposed to be a sensitive biomarker for prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0030885-Sun2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Additionally, PTI-1 was shown to be expressed in prostate cancer tissues but not in BPH or normal prostate tissues <xref rid="pone.0030885-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our finding of increased eEF1A1 expression in osteoblasts in the vicinity of metastatic prostate cells, is in line with previous reports indicating a cross-talk between prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts during bone metastasis <xref rid="pone.0030885-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Prostate cancer bone metastasis are typically osteoblastic (i.e. involve excessive bone formation), and it is well known that tumour cells can stimulate osteoblasts to proliferate and differentiate. Thus, eEF1A1 over-expression seen in osteoblasts may occur as a response to the presence of tumour cells. The increased expression of eEF1A1 in the serum of patients with cancer compared with BPH is an important finding as is suggests that the search for novel cancer biomarkers should encompass not only those factors secreted directly by the cancer cells but also &#x02018;surrogate markers&#x02019; produced indirectly as a reaction to the presence of tumour cells.</p><p>During our analysis we identified and quantified 122 unique proteins (of which 75 were qualified by &#x02265;2 unique peptides). This is in line with a previous iTRAQ study analysing serum samples with similar MS instrumentation <xref rid="pone.0030885-Tonack1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Although depletion strategies can improve sensitivity for detection of less abundant proteins, this approach itself is associated with limitations as the higher abundant proteins are known to act as a &#x02018;sponge&#x02019; by complexing with lower molecular weight proteins. For instance, a targeted analysis of alpha-2-macroglobulin binding partners indicated that this highly abundant plasma glycoprotein can bind various cytokines, growth factors and heat shock proteins <xref rid="pone.0030885-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Consistent with this, we were unable to detect PSA during our iTRAQ analysis despite it being known to be present at relatively high concentrations in the cancer and metastatic patient groups. PSA is known to complex with alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, both of which were targets for removal by the IgY-14 affinity column <xref rid="pone.0030885-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Thus, it is important that future biomarker studies analyze both the bound and flow-through fractions in order to increase the repertoire of disease candidates identified.</p><p>Although our study identified the differential expression of a number of proteins, it is becoming apparent that a single biomarker is unlikely to provide the required sensitivity and specificity, due to the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0030885-Mikolajczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Thus, it has been proposed that accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis are likely to depend on the measurement of a panel of biomarkers, perhaps utilising emerging multiplex technologies which could fast forward these panels into the clinic. In support of this, our data has shown that levels of certain combinations of proteins could be seen to fluctuate as the disease developed and progressed. Certain proteins were seen to be differentially expressed either individually, as pairs or as panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030885-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study has reported that by using a combination of proteins (complement component 4a (C4a) and protein C inhibitor), a statistically significant value for predicting prostate cancer recurrence was demonstrated in men who underwent prostatectomy <xref rid="pone.0030885-Rosenzweig1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Thus, our study adds weight to other published studies demonstrating the importance of evaluating pairs or panels of carefully selected proteins to increase the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of cancer.</p><p>To our knowledge, our study appears to be the first iTRAQ based approach aimed at identifying leads for potentially useful biomarkers of progression and metastasis in prostate cancer, using patient serum. If the findings are validated in a larger cohort of patients, then the detection of eEF1A1 in the serum of patients with prostate cancer at the time of their initial diagnosis, may be able to predict the likelihood of disease progression and those patients be offered radical treatment options at an early stage of their disease.</p><p>With a number of biomarker studies already conducted over the years and others in the pipeline, what is becoming evident is that in order for a biomarker (or panel of biomarkers) to reach routine clinical use it must pass through five phases of development <xref rid="pone.0030885-Pepe1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Pepe2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, our study represents one of the initial steps (&#x02018;exploratory phase&#x02019;) along this process. Many of the candidates identified in our and other studies await rigorous clinical validation using large cohorts of patient samples, together with robust long-term clinical and pathological information in subsequent phase 2&#x02013;5 studies, as proposed by Pepe <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Pepe1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030885-Pepe2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In addition to the leads identified, what has emerged is that due to the sizable inflammatory response to the presence of a tumour, future biomarker identification strategies could benefit by the pre-fractionation of APR proteins from the sera of cancer patients in addition to the removal of common highly abundant serum proteins, so that the cancer proteome can be mined even more deeply. The panel of proteins identified, including eEF1A1 warrant further investigation and validation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0030885.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
