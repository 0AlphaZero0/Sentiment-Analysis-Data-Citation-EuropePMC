</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Saprophytism, probably one of the most common lifestyle for micro-organisms, involves living in dead or decaying organic matter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For most pathogens, saprophytism is limited to necrotrophism (the use of the host cadaver). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This step of the infection process is essential for the proliferation and horizontal transmission of these microorganisms (transfer of infection within a single generation) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, there have been very few studies addressing this major issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle implies substantial metabolic changes for microorganisms [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The death of the host is a critical event which compels the micro-organisms to cope with a new series of challenges: competition with the commensal organisms and opportunistic incomers, stress, and nutrient deficiencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, necrotrophism is likely to be highly regulated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a suitable model for studying the time course of the infection process, including necrotrophism in the insect cadaver. Bt is an ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium belonging to the Bacillus cereus (Bc) group [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Its spores are found in a large variety of environments, such as soils, dead and living insects and plant phylloplane [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, Bt probably does not grow in soil and reports of natural epizootic episodes are very rare [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Unlike soil bacteria, such as Streptomyces spp and B. subtilis, Bc group genomes contain a large number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that Bt multiplies in the host cadaver [1], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Bt carries plasmids encoding specific insecticidal toxins responsible for their insecticidal properties [7]. Bt spores and toxins are ingested by larvae, and the toxins bind to specific receptors on the midgut epithelial cells, inducing cell lysis and creating favorable conditions for the development of the bacteria [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The vegetative bacteria multiply in the insect hemocoel and cause septicemia [1], [9]. Bt also harbors genes encoding exported virulence factors including enterotoxins, hemolysins, phospholipases and proteases [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The transcription of most of these virulence genes in bacteria growing in a rich medium is activated at the onset of stationary phase by the quorum-sensing system PlcR-PapR [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>PlcR-regulated factors account for about 80% of the extracellular proteome of Bt during early stationary phase in rich medium [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, the expression of the PlcR-regulated genes is repressed when the bacteria enter sporulation [14] and the stationary phase secretome of Bt and B. anthracis (Ba) growing in a sporulation medium is mainly composed of the metalloprotease NprA [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>NprA (also designated NprB and Npr599 in Ba) cleaves tissue components such as fibronectin, laminin and collagen, thus displaying characteristics of pathogenic factors [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Transcription of nprA is activated during the late stationary phase by the regulator NprR [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>NprR is a quorum sensor activated by its cognate signaling peptide, NprX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>NprR-NprX functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system: the pro-signaling peptide NprX is exported from the cell, and after being processed to its active form is reimported, and binds to NprR allowing the recognition of its DNA target and the activation of nprA transcription [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The first stages of Bt infection are relatively well documented, but the fate of the bacteria after death of the host remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Here, we report evidence that the necrotrophic lifestyle of Bt is a specific and highly regulated process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The quorum-sensing system NprR-NprX controls at least 41 genes some of which are required for Bt to survive in the insect cadaver and to complete its development in vivo ending with the production of spores. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We tested whether NprR, the activator of nprA transcription [16], is involved in the pathogenicity of Bt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The LD50 s of the Bt 407 Cry− (wt) strain and of the nprR-deficient (ΔRX) strain in the insect model Galleria mellonella were measured in two ways: by feeding larvae with spores mixed with the insecticidal toxin Cry1C and by injection of vegetative bacteria into the insect hemocoel (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The LD50 s of two strains did not differ significantly in either of the two conditions indicating that NprR was not required for pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Consistently, an nprA-deficient strain was similarly found not to be affected in pathogenicity (not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We investigated the involvement of NprR in the infection process by comparing, in vivo, the expression kinetics of nprA with that of the protease gene mpbE, reflecting the transcriptional activities of NprR and PlcR, respectively [16], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The reporter strains grew similarly in insect larvae and a constitutively expressed PaphA3-lacZ fusion was used as the reference standard (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Transcription of mpbE increased between 0 h and 24 h after injection and gradually decreased thereafter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nprA transcription was low between 0 h and 24 h, increased between 24 h and 48 h and then decreased sharply (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Thus, NprR is active later in the infection process than PlcR, and after the death of the host. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated i) whether NprR was involved in the sporulation process of Bt in the insect cadaver, and ii) whether sporulation is responsible for the survival of the bacteria in the insect cadaver. We compared the sporulation efficiencies of the wt and ΔRX strains in both LB and sporulation-specific medium (HCT) (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In HCT, the sporulation efficiencies of the two strains were similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>However, in LB medium, the total number of viable spores of the ΔRX strain was half that for the wt strain (8.30×107 vs 1.58×108), suggesting that NprR is involved in the sporulation of Bt in rich medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Next, we monitored the counts of wt and ΔRX strain spores in insect larvae over 96 h (Figure 2B and Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>For the wt strain, heat-resistant spores were detected 24 h after injection and their number increased until 48 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>From 48 h to 96 h, the number of spores remained stable and represented one third of the total bacterial population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The large number of non sporulated bacteria 96 h after the death of the insect suggests that sporulation was not the main mechanism allowing Bt to survive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>For the ΔRX strain, less than one percent of the bacterial population was heat-resistant spores throughout the infection process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the number of heat-resistant spores from 48 h to 72 h is likely due to the germination of the spores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>We suspected that the low number of spores is not a cause but a consequence of the inability of the ΔRX strain to survive in the insect cadaver. To test this idea, we tested the survival of a sigK-deficient strain (Figure 2C): SigK is a sigma factor involved in the transcription of late sporulation genes in the mother cell, and sigK-deficient strains are not able to form viable spores [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The total population of the sigK strain in the insect cadaver was similar to the total population of the wt strain, indicating that NprR ensures the survival of Bt by a process independent of sporulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Gene expression ratios between the wt and the ΔRX strains were determined 3 h after the onset of stationary phase (t3), when nprA transcription increases sharply [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>For 107 genes, this expression ratio was greater than 2 (p&lt;0.05) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790</ext-link>), suggesting that NprR has a direct or indirect effect on their transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine genes, with a relative expression ratio greater than 4, and a significance value (p) smaller than 0.01, were considered for subsequent analysis. </plain></SENT>
