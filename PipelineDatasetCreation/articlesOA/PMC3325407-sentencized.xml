</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Many genes have been associated with normal variation in human pigmentation (Sturm 2009; Sturm and Larsson 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of those, OCA2 [MIM 611409], named for an abnormal pigmentation phenotype, oculocutaneous albinism type II (OCA2 [MIM 203200]), is a large gene extending over 300 kb on chromosome 15. OCA2 encodes the protein P, a transmembrane protein, and has been shown to play a role in pigmentation in both humans and mice (Frudakis et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In humans, it has been implicated in iris, skin, and hair pigmentation (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The exact function of P is unknown though it has been suggested to process and traffic tyrosinase, regulate melanosomal pH, or regulate glutathione metabolism (Toyofuku et al. 2002; Staleva et al. (2002); Sturm et al. 2001; Edwards et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mutations in OCA2 are known to cause oculocutaneous albinism type 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the gene is also known to play a role in variation in normal pigmentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In European populations, it is primarily associated with blue irises. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Several sites in and around OCA2 have been reported to be the functional variant or to be tightly linked to the functional variant leading to blue eyes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These sites include a three-SNP haplotype (rs4778138, rs4778241, rs7495174) and four individual SNPs, rs1129038, rs12913832, rs916977, and rs1667394 (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007; Mengel-From et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Four of the SNPs (rs1129038, rs12913832, rs916977, rs1667394) are actually located in introns of the Hect Domain and RCC1-like Domain 2 (HERC2 [MIM 605837]), which are located 10 Kb upstream of OCA2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These are thought either to be located in or near an upstream regulatory region of OCA2 or to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with functional elements in HERC2 and affect a possible HERC2 regulation of OCA2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The actual function of HERC2 is unknown but it shows homology to known E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>One of the HERC2 SNPs (rs1667394) has been associated with blond hair in Europeans (Sulem et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Specific polymorphisms and the haplotypes are illustrated in Fig. 1; all 21 SNPs studied are listed in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The derived allele of another SNP at OCA2, rs1800407, has been associated with green/hazel eyes in Europeans (Branicki et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Rs1800407 is an arginine to glutamine missense mutation (Arg419Gln) found in exon 13 of the OCA2 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Sturm et al. (2008) concluded that the derived allele of rs1800407 increased the penetrance of the blue eye phenotype associated with the derived allele of rs12913832.Fig. 1Schematic of BEHs and rs1800414. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This figure shows the approximate locations of the three blue-eye associated haplotypes (blue rectangles) and rs1800414 (red arrow) at OCA2 and HERC2 genes. OCA2 extends farther in the pter direction </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The derived allele at a missense SNP (rs1800414, His615Arg) in exon 19 of OCA2 has been reported to be specific to East Asia (Yuasa et al. 2007; Anno et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Edwards et al. (2010) showed an association between the derived allele of rs1800414 (C, 615Arg) and lighter skin pigmentation in a sample of individuals of East Asian ancestry from Canada and confirmed their results using an independent sample of Han Chinese. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here we present our results on the global distributions of haplotypes and specific SNPs in the region of OCA2 and HERC2, genes that have been implicated in pigmentation variation in Europeans and East Asians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We also examine the LD between the SNPs and haplotypes of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Finally, we use long-range haplotype tests to show that OCA2 is or has been under selection in Europe and the derived allele of rs1800414 is, or has been, under selection in East Asia. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the C allele of the missense SNP rs1800414 is found almost exclusively in East Asia (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Within East Asia there is a general cline in the frequency of the C allele with the lowest frequencies in Western China, midrange frequencies in Southeast Asia, and high frequencies in Eastern East Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The major exception to this pattern is the Malaysians; in our small sample the derived allele is absent, but the Malays are an Austronesian group and they show similar frequencies to our other Austronesian populations (Micronesians and Samoans). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We showed that the strongest signal of selection in Europe and Southwest Asia is at the TG allele of BEH2 and any signal seen at BEH1 and BEH3 is likely due to hitchhiking (Figs. 8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Along with the distribution data, this strongly suggests that the TG allele of BEH2 is, contains, or is in strong LD with the blue eye causal mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>It is possible that BEH2 is in the promoter region of OCA2 and the blue eye allele lowers the amount of OCA2 expressed either in the iris or globally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>This result also raises the question of why blue eyes would be under selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Since there is no known biological advantage to having blue eyes, we think a likely answer is sexual selection that in Europe and Southwest Asia individuals with blue eyes are, or were, preferred as mates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Another possible explanation is that the blue eye phenotype is not being selected for; rather the TG allele of BEH2 has another phenotype, such as lighter skin pigmentation, which is under selection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In East Asia, we show that the C allele of the missense SNP rs1800414 is also under selection (Fig. 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Again this result is not completely unexpected since this allele has been associated with lighter skin pigmentation in East Asians, and variants affecting skin pigmentation have previously been shown to be targets of selection (Edwards et al. 2010; Izagirre et al. 2006; Lao et al. 2007; Norton et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the TG allele of BEH2 has a much more restricted global distribution compared to the ACA allele of BEH1 and the CA allele of BEH3, the other two haplotypes published as associated with blue eyes (Duffy et al. 2007; Sturm et al. 2008; Kayser et al. 2008; Sulem et al. 2007;Mengel-From et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>We also show that the TG allele of BEH2 has a strong signal of selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Cook et al. (2009) showed melanocytes homozygous for the blue-eye associated allele of rs12913832 of BEH2 produced significantly less melanin than heterozygotes or those that were homozygous for the ancestral allele, but did not control for other SNPs in the region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests that BEH2 may contain the causal allele for blue eyes or at minimum is the best marker for the region in LD that does contain the causal allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that the C allele of rs1800414 is both restricted to East Asia and under selection in that region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This research provides further evidence for lighter pigmentation evolving by means of selection at least partly independently in Europeans and East Asians but at some genes in common. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>These results, taken together with those from several forensic studies predicting iris pigmentation in mixed populations (Mengel-From et al. 2010; Spichenok et al. 2010; Valenzuela et al. 2010; Walsh et al. 2010; Pospiech et al. 2011), suggest that the SNPs of BEH2 (rs1129038 and rs12913832) are the best markers for blue eyes for forensic purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>A recent study by Liu et al. (2010) found that rs12913832 has the strongest effect when eye color is measured quantitatively and can explain most of the variance in eye color amongst Europeans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, several questions need to be answered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="?"><plain>Are the SNPs in BEH2 responsible for the blue eye phenotype seen in Europeans or simply in strong LD with the causative allele? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="?"><plain>Is BEH2 in a promoter region for OCA2? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="?"><plain>Are blue eyes under sexual selection or is the TG allele also responsible for an additional selected phenotype such as light skin pigmentation? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Both Eiberg et al. (2008) and Sturm et al. (2008) suggest that the BEH2 falls into a regulatory region of OCA2; however, Eiberg et al. believe the causal allele is a 166 kb haplotype that happens to contain the two SNPs of BEH2 and Sturm et al. suggest that rs12913832 is the causal allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Eiberg et al. based their conclusion on lower activity when they used their blue-eye associated haplotype in a luciferase assay compared to other haplotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Sturm et al. based their conclusion on not finding a better associated SNP of known SNPs in the 5′ region of OCA2 or the 3′ end of HERC2 and that the probability of there being an unknown SNP with a stronger association was unlikely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Further research will be needed to answer these questions. </plain></SENT>
