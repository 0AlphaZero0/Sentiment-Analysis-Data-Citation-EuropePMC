</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that over 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) which results in approximately 600,000 HBV related deaths each year, primarily from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In geographic regions with low HBV endemicity, the virus is normally acquired in adulthood through horizontal routes of transmission, which include high risk sexual behaviour, receipt of blood products, blood-blood contact or injecting drug use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in countries with intermediate and high endemicity, HBV is primarily acquired by vertical transmission perinatally or early in childhood [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There are approximately 8.4 million individuals chronically infected with HBV in Viet Nam and it was estimated that in 2005 this resulted in 23,300 HBV-related mortalities [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Previous reports of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence have suggested levels as high as 15–20% in the general population [5]–[13]; with reported prevalences in neonates, children and adolescents of 12%, 18% and 20%, respectively [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Universal HBV vaccination was introduced in Viet Nam in 2003; however, despite this, mathematical models have predicted that Viet Nam in the future faces an enormous burden of HBV-related liver disease [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Eight HBV genotypes (designated A through H) and several subgenotypes have been identified to date, and these have distinct geographic distributions [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition, a complex recombinant of genotypes C, A and G, first described in Viet Nam in 2000 [15], has been proposed to be a new genotype designated “I” [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However this remains controversial as the mean genetic divergence of the Vietnamese HBV A/C/G recombinant is &lt;8% from genotype C across the entire genome and is thus considered as having arisen from intragenotypic, not intergenotypic, divergence [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This variant was subsequently identified in Laos [18], China [19], [20], India [21] and in emigrants and children adopted from Viet Nam and living in France and Canada [22], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>An additional genotype “J” has also been proposed for a virus isolated from one Japanese male [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections in individuals with chronic HBV infection are increasingly common due to shared routes of transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Globally, it is estimated that 4 million chronically HBV-infected individuals are coinfected with HIV [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on the prevalence of coinfections in Southeast Asia because of a lack of routine screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Zhou et al. reported a large serosurvey of HIV, HBV and HCV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) along the Chinese-Myanmar border and indentified 20% HIV-HBV coinfections and 11% HIV-HBV coinfections in Chinese and Burmese IDUs, respectively, with a comparable prevalence of HIV-HBV-HCV triple infections (19% and 10%, respectively) in each population [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Unlike HBV, the HIV epidemic in Viet Nam is concentrated in high risk groups, such as IDUs, commercial sex workers (CSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A study from Hai Phong in Northern Viet Nam reported a HBsAg prevalence of 10.3% in HIV-infected individuals [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In industrialised countries, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has lead to a significant decline in deaths attributable to HIV; however, liver disease has since emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV infected individuals coinfected with HBV and HCV [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Management of HBV in HIV-infected individuals is also complicated by the emergence of drug resistant viruses and HAART-associated hepatotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The use of antiretroviral drugs may result in the emergence of cross-resistance mutations in the HBV pol gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it has been reported, that in HIV-HBV coinfected patients treated with lamivudine, resistance mutations within the YMDD motif in the HBV polymerase reverse transcriptase (RT) domain occur at a rate of approximately 25% per year, compared to approximately 16% in HBV monoinfected patients [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Although there is a well established predominance of HBV genotypes B and C in Southeast Asia, including Viet Nam, previous reports suggest that there may be significant genetic heterogeneity at the subgenotype level; HBV subgenotypes B2, B4, C1 and C5 have been reported in Viet Nam with subgenotypes B4 and C1 predominating [13], [40], [42]–[46]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Emerging data has shown that HBV viral load and naturally occurring mutant strains may be closely associated with progression to severe liver disease [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>For example, genotype C has a higher frequency of mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and deletions in the preS region of the genome and is associated with higher viral loads than genotype B [41]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>It is now clear that, as in many countries in Southeast Asia, HBV is endemic in Viet Nam and contributes to a significant burden of liver disease in the country. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The present report provides one of the most comprehensive studies of HBV in Viet Nam to date, involving distinct geographical regions and populations with different risk factors for infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome of HBV infection and the response to treatment and vaccination is influenced by a number of factors including coinfection with other blood-borne viruses, viral genotype, virus specific mutations in the pre-core and basal core promoter regions of the genome and a number of host factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The present study has involved molecular analysis to analyse viral load, viral genotype and core and pre-core mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In addition our studies have examined coinfections with other blood-borne viruses including HIV, HCV and HDV – all of which would be expected to impact on HBV pathogenesis, and on the overall development and progression of liver disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The results of this study have confirmed the high level of endemicity of HBV in Viet Nam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>As expected, levels of HBsAg are highest in the higher risk groups such as IDUs and CSWs, however, levels were also elevated in the dialysis cohorts from each region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Core IgM was detected in 27 samples and, while this may be suggestive of acute infection, confirmation is difficult due to the possibility of persistent detectable IgM in chronic infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Serological analysis of HBsAg negative samples in eight groups in the study also demonstrated that some 50% of individuals tested had evidence of resolved HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Our study also identified a very high prevalence of blood-borne viral coinfections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>As expected, this was most evident in the IDU cohort, where serological analysis revealed that 53%, 28% and 26% of hepatitis B infected participants were coinfected with HCV, HIV and HDV, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In fact, a significant proportion of these individuals had either triple or quadruple infections, with 18% of hepatitis B infected IDU patients infected with HIV, HCV and HDV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of coinfection in the sex worker cohort, although marked, was less significant with 10%, 15% and 9% of the hepatitis B infected participants also infected with HCV, HIV and HDV, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was little evidence of coinfections in the hepatitis B infected participants from lower risk groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>High levels of HIV-HBV coinfection have significant implications for the introduction of HAART for HIV treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that it would be advisable that all HIV infected individuals in Viet Nam, if possible, should be screened for active HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>A recent study from the US has shown that patients with chronic HBV, as defined by HBsAg positivity, had a much higher risk for developing the composite outcome of an AIDS-defining illness or death compared to individuals who were HBV negative [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Studies from South Africa have indicated that lamivudine, when employed as a sole HBV active drug in a HAART regimen, may not reliably suppress HBV replication [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>As such, at least two drugs with anti-HBV activity (tenofovir plus lamivudine or plus emtricitabine) should be employed in the setting of HIV-HBV coinfection [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Indeed, tenofovir-based regimens are now being introduced as front line therapy of HIV infections in Viet Nam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This would also be expected to prevent the development of HBV resistance which can occur when single agents are employed, as we have found in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of such treatment should also, if possible be accompanied by measurement of both HIV and HBV viral loads to assess the efficacy of treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In addition to specific treatments, efforts should be enhanced to provide HBV vaccination to individuals with or at risk of HIV infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The present study also demonstrated significant levels of HDV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence across the cohorts of 10.7% (patients infected with HBV coinfected with HDV) is in a marked contrast to previous reports in Viet Nam, where rates of approximately 1% were described [11], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The variation in HBV-HDV coinfection rates across the cohorts could be stratified between high and low risk exposure groups, with the vast majority of HDV infections occurring in the IDU and CSW cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The difference between this and previous studies most likely reflects the inclusion of these defined high risk cohorts from urban centres. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of HBV DNA in HBV-HDV coinfected participants showed a significant reduction in detectable HBV viral load and a higher rate of e antigen negativity, when compared to the HBV monoinfected cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that levels of HDV exposure in Viet Nam are significantly higher than previously recognised and that the burden of liver disease associated with HBV-HDV infection may be more substantial than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies demonstrated that HBV genotypes B4 and C1 predominated, but there were also smaller levels of B2 and C5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In agreement with a previous study, we did not identify the putative genotype I, suggesting that this recombinant remains rare in Viet Nam [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>The lack of proofreading ability of the HBV polymerase, together with the high viral titre in active HBV infection, results in a high mutation rate during virus replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Genetic mutations and deletions in the pre-S and basal core promoter regions of the HBV genome including T1753V, A1762T, G1764A, and C1766T have been associated with more severe liver disease and the development of HCC [67], [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The basal core promoter mutations 1762T/W and 1764A/R were detected in 26% and 24% of specimens, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Previous reports of heterogeneity in the BCP/PC region of HBV in Viet Nam identified prevalence rates of up to 32% 1753C/A, 68% 1762T/1764A, 70% 1858C and 12% 1896A in genotype C viruses compared to 28% 1762T/1764A, 0% 1858C and 34% 1896A in genotype B [69], [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>We identified the precore stop mutation G1896A in 35% (n = 82/236) of all samples, and this varied significantly with viral genotype, with a higher incidence in genotype B compared to genotype C, which is in agreement with previous studies [69], [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Contrastingly, the basal core promoter mutations 1762T and 1764A were detected more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B, and 1858C was identified only in genotype C viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Although the numbers were too low to reach statistical significance, we also identified a difference in the G1896A and A1762T/G1764A mutations at the subgenotype level, which has also been previously reported [71]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Of increasing concern is the emergence of mutations in epitopes of the HBV S gene which have been associated with immune escape [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>As the HBV pol gene overlaps the S gene, mutations in the pol gene could result in non-synonymous mutations in the corresponding open reading frame. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Thus, mutational pressure on the pol gene may potentially alter the antigenic characteristics of the surface protein, which could in turn alter vaccine efficacy and affect serological diagnostic assays targeting this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>We have found that 31% of our sequences contained mutations in the immunodominant region of the S gene and have identified a high number of potential immune escape mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Of particular note, 2.2% of sequences analysed contained the major vaccine escape mutation G145A as a dominant or as a mixed population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the preS region demonstrated that a total of 5% of specimens had preS deletions (primarily identified in high risk individuals), 5.5% contained amino acid mutations in the start codon of the preS2 and 5.3% had an F22L mutation in the preS2, all of which have been significantly associated with the development of HCC [68]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>The role of host immunogenetics in influencing the rates of spontaneous HBV clearance and the development of persistent infection is poorly understood. IL28B genetic variants have previously been associated with natural and therapy-associated clearance of HCV [48], [72]–[74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In contrast, recent studies have found no significant differences in IL28B allele frequencies between individuals who spontaneously clear or those who develop a persistent HBV infection [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a Chinese study by Li and colleagues demonstrated an association between the rs12979860 CC genotype (associated with a favourable HCV response to therapy and higher natural clearance rates) with elevated IL28B protein levels in serum and with lower HBV viral loads (&lt;105 copies/ml) compared to both CT and TT genotypes. IL28B genotype has also recently been implicated in rates of HBeAg seroconversion (appearance of anti-HBe) following interferon-α treatment and also HBsAg clearance after follow up, although the latter effect was modest and further studies are required to corroborate these findings [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>In our study, comprising untreated, HBV monoinfected Vietnamese individuals, we did not observe a significant association between the IL28B genotype and clearance of HBsAg or variation in HBV DNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Although we noted an association between Il28B and HBeAg status, this did not reach statistical significance which may be due to the low T allele frequency (7%) in Viet Nam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Our analysis does not exclude a role for this locus in influencing HBV viral replication and disease progression; however, our results suggest that, unlike the effect noted for spontaneous clearance of HCV, this host variant does not exert a strong influence on the course of HBV infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a number of studies including the present have clearly shown that Viet Nam is facing a huge burden of HBV related liver disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Thus, the enhancement of HBV screening efforts in Viet Nam, in association with both vaccination and, if economically possible, treatment for chronic infection, should be prioritised to limit the future impact of serious liver disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in HIV infected individuals, testing for HBV should be implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Currently recommended treatment of coinfected individuals with a tenofovir-based regimen would provide effective therapy for both viruses and would be expected to prevent the emergence of HBV drug resistance mutations. </plain></SENT>
