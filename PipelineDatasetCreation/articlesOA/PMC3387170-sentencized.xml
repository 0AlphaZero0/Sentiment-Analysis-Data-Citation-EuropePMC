</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Despite the central role of DNA damage repair in determining efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) or cytotoxic chemotherapy, developing specific inhibitors of DNA damage repair is a relatively unexplored area of research [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, high throughput screening is a central function in the drug discovery process [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To date, this strategy has only recently been applied to experimental radiotherapy [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The most common high-throughput screens are biochemical assays that screen for compounds that interact with an isolated protein on an assay plate [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a cell-based approach provides insight into the permeability profile of active compounds and enables the identification of compounds with unique mechanisms of action [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Charged-coupled device (CCD) camera- based plate imaging systems allow for high throughput quantitation of cellular and subcellular fluorescence in whole cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These high content cell based assays allow for screening compounds that impact cellular functions, such as cell cycle, cell motility, apoptosis and DNA repair [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Current disadvantages of this approach include limited throughput related to incompatibility of some steps of a complex screening procedure with full automation, the relatively high cost of reagents and data-management issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Despite these technical hurdles, there is significant interest in applying high content screening to primary drug screening [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Exposure to IR and many chemotherapy agents, including DNA synthesis inhibitors, DNA alkylators and topoisomerase I inhibitors, result in DNA double strand breaks (DSB) [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A single unrepaired DSB may result in cell death demonstrating the critically important role of DNA damage repair in maintaining genomic integrity [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An emerging concept is that the physiological target of IR is not DNA alone but rather DNA in the three-dimensional context of chromatin within a complex and highly regulated protein-DNA structure [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>ATM and related kinases phosphorylate Serine 139 on H2AX to form foci of γ-H2AX immunoreactivity at DNA DSB sites that can be visualized by light microscopy [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of H2AX at DSBs has been implicated in the timely recruitment and/or retention of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins such BRCA1, MRE11/RAD50/Nbs1 complex, MDC1 and 53 bp1 to sites of DNA damage [9], [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Downstream signal transduction pathways may result in DNA damage repair (homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining), cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [17]. γ-H2AX interacts with NuA4, INO80 and SWRC, proteins that play a key role in chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The cohesion complex, which joins sister chromatin allowing for efficient homologous recombination repair of DSB appear to localize to sites of DSB via interaction with the INO80 complex [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Persistence of γ-H2AX between 3 to 24 hours following experimental treatment is strongly associated with unrepaired DNA DSB and sensitivity to DNA damaging therapies [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we performed a proof-of-concept screen to identify agents that increased persistence of γ-H2AX at 4 hours after drug treatment and ionizing radiation by inhibiting DNA damage repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Using a reverse chemical genetics approach, a secondary focus of this study is to elucidate the molecular target of lead compounds identified by the screen [6]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>For instance, wortmannin, caffeine or LY294002 have not been clinically useful radiosensitizers due to lack of tumor cell specificity resulting in an unacceptable toxicity profiles [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Although we hypothesize that the radiosensitizing effects of MS0019266 and MS0017509 is due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase resulting in impaired DNA double strand break repair, an indirect effect related to redistribution of cells within the cell cycle cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Since MS0019266 was slightly more effective at inducing apoptosis and cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells than MS0017509, we further investigated its effect on gene expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a 96-well colony forming assay was developed with the goal of identifying radiosensitizers [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In addition to providing information on DNA damage repair, this 96-well γ-H2AX assay could potentially be multiplexed for a high-content readout [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Our protocol utilized pooling of compounds, which is a commonly used approach to improve efficiency of resource intensive high-content screening protocols [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, this strategy has the potential risks of additivity, synergy and antagonism that could result in both false positives and false negatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We eliminated the risk of false positives through subsequent interrogation of individual compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>A further disadvantage of pooled compound experiments is that the DMSO concentration is higher to achieve adequate drug concentrations and this is another potential confounding variable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>To address the risk of false negatives associated with pooling, we propose subsequent screening of individual compounds from a larger chemical library that can be justified by our success in this pilot screen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MS0019266 and MS0017509 are promising compounds that may be candidates for further development as radiosensitizing compounds as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and polo-like kinase 1. </plain></SENT>
