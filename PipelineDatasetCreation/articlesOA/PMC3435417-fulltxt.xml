One family of highly conserved, stress response genes is the growth arrest and DNA damage-45 (<italic>Gadd45</italic>) genes. The expression of these genes is induced by a host of genotoxic, drug, and environmental stressors. Here we examined the impact of altering the expression of Gadd45alpha (Gadd45a), a member of the Gadd45 protein family that is expressed throughout the developing cortices of mice and humans. To manipulate levels of Gadd45a protein in developing mouse cortex, we electroporated cDNA plasmids encoding either Gadd45a or Gadd45a shRNA to either overexpress or knockdown Gadd45a levels in the developing cortices of mice, respectively. The effects of these manipulations were assessed by examining the fates and morphologies of the labeled neurons. Gadd45a overexpression both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> significantly impaired the morphology of neurons, decreasing neurite complexity, inducing soma hypertrophy and increasing cell death. Knockdown of Gadd45a partially inhibited neuronal migration and reduced neurite complexity, an effect that was reversed in the presence of an shRNA-resistant Gadd45a. Finally, we found that shRNA against MEKK4, a direct target of Gadd45a, also stunted neurite outgrowth. Our findings suggest that the expression of Gadd45a in normal, developing brain is tightly regulated and that treatments or environmental stimuli that alter its expression could produce significant changes in neuronal circuitry development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from the McKnight Brain Research Foundation and the Evelyn F. and William L.

Gadd45a is reported to be localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and it is well known that activation or overexpression of Gadd45a inhibits cell growth and may induce cell death <xref rid="pone.0044207-RosemarySiafakas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

While Gadd45a expression has been detected in the early stages of mouse forebrain development <xref rid="pone.0044207-Kaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, it remains unclear as to whether its expression persists or is inducible in developing and postnatal cerebral cortex.</p><p>In the adult brain, induction of Gadd45b, but not Gadd45a, can promote neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0044207-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Increased neuronal activity in the hippocampus induced by either electroconvulsive treatment or by exploration of novel environments has been shown to significantly increase Gadd45b expression in hippocampal neurons, which in turn leads to demethylation of specific promoter regions of growth factor genes including BDNF and FGF <xref rid="pone.0044207-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Like Gadd45b, Gadd45a has been implicated in DNA demethylation; however, the results of a recent study suggest that its effects within the nucleus may, in part, be mediated by its ability to bind to RNA <xref rid="pone.0044207-Sytnikova1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Knockout of Gadd45a in mice can induce early neural tube defects in a small percentage of mice, an observation that raises the possibility that Gadd45a plays an active role in the developing CNS <xref rid="pone.0044207-Hollander1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Treatment of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, N1E-115, with the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), has been shown to specifically upregulate Gadd45a protein expression and induce neurite outgrowth from these cells via activation of the MAP3K, MEKK4 <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yamauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Neurons were isolated from E16.5 mouse brains that had been electroporated <italic>in utero</italic> at E15.5 with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP; to visualize cell morphology) plus either a plasmid encoding Gadd45a shRNA to reduce Gadd45a levels or a plasmid encoding Gadd45a to increase Gadd45a levels. Control groups were transfected with an empty vector (pLKO) plus a vector encoding GFP or a vector encoding GFP alone. These neurons were maintained in culture for 6 days (6DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s004">S4</xref>). The cultures were fixed at 6DIV and individual GFP-positive neurons and the extent of process outgrowth from the cell somas were analyzed using the Sholl method <xref rid="pone.0044207-Redmond1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The vast majority of the GFP-positive processes analyzed were positive for the dendrite marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s005">Fig. S5</xref>), but may have included axons. We found that Gadd45a shRNA significantly reduced the numbers of distal processes elaborated by these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2C and E</xref>) compared to control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similarly, increasing the levels of Gadd45a in neurons by expressing the Gadd45a plasmid reduced the numbers of processes distal to their somas, which themselves were often enlarged and irregularly shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2D and F</xref>). The results of the Sholl analyses suggested that overexpression of Gadd45a increased growth of processes proximal to the neuronal somas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>), but it is more likely that this finding reflected an increase in the size of the somas of these cells compared to cells electroporated with either control or shRNA vectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). To ensure that the shRNA effects that we observed were attributable to specific decreases in Gadd45a levels, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a construct encoding an shRNA-resistant Gadd45a protein (R-Gadd45a) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) and co-electroporated this construct and that encoding the Gadd45a shRNA.

Our inability to rescue growth of distal processes in these cells (&#x0003e;70&#x02013;80 &#x000b5;m from the soma) by co-expressing shRNA resistant Gadd45a with the Gadd45a shRNA could be due to unequal expression of the Gadd45a shRNA and R-Gadd45a constructs in the neurons, the imbalance leading to an excess Gadd45a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0044207-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0044207.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Gadd45a regulates neurite outgrowth from cortical neurons in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Method used to transfect, culture and analyze transfected cortical neurons.

We found that knockdown of Gadd45a reduced the complexities of the dendritic arbors of the electroporated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g003">Fig. 3A, B</xref>) while the somas of electroporated neurons overexpressing Gadd45a were enlarged and were often multipolar in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044207-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Thus, similar to our observations in vitro, decreased levels of Gadd45a expression in neurons in vivo reduced the extent of the dendritic arbors of these cells, while increased levels of Gadd45a expression produced neurons with irregular and hypertrophied soma morphology. In view of the observation that upregulation of Gadd45a can also trigger apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0044207-RosemarySiafakas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it is possible that the changes that we observed in the somas of neurons overexpressing Gadd45a in vitro and in vivo are early signs of impending cell death. This possibility is supported by our observation that C6-R cells overexpressing Gadd45a displayed not only stunted processes but also increased cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). In examining the cortical sections, we noted that majority of neurons either overexpressing or with reduced levels of Gadd45a reached their final migratory destination within the superficial layers of neocortex.

In neuroblasts and other cell lines, Gadd45a has been reported to exert downstream effects on cell growth and differentiation through the MAPK pathway, including MEKK4, ERK1/2 and p38 <xref rid="pone.0044207-Takekawa1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yamauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. MEKK4 signaling has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yamauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and neuronal migration <xref rid="pone.0044207-Sarkisian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, in the N1E-115 cell line, induction of neurite outgrowth by Gadd45a was blocked in the presence of MEKK4 siRNA <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yamauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These observations, together with our MEKK4 data suggest that at least one Gadd45a mechanism regulating neuronal migration and arborization complexity involves MEKK4 signaling. It is likely that Gadd45a, like other Gadd45 proteins, also exerts its effects through other mechanisms of action. In adult mouse, it has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy selectively induces Gadd45b expression in brain and demethylation of the promoters of growth factor genes (e.g., BDNF and FGF) known to control hippocampal neuronal morphology <xref rid="pone.0044207-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Experimental evidence exists both for <xref rid="pone.0044207-Barreto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and against <xref rid="pone.0044207-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> a role for Gadd45a in regulating gene expression by promoting DNA demethylation. The results of a recent study suggest that the effects of Gadd45a on demethylation occur via its interactions with RNA <xref rid="pone.0044207-Sytnikova1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Further investigation will be required to determine the extent to which Gadd45a signaling involves downstream MAPK signaling targets and epigenetic regulation of growth factor genes. Whatever the mechanism, our data show that altered expression levels of Gadd45a can disrupt normal development of neurons.</p><p>We detected Gadd45a mRNA and protein in developing and young adult cortex. The <italic>Gadd45a</italic> gene normally encodes an&#x0223c;18 kDa protein, however, while generating both tagged and untagged Gadd45a constructs to test our antibody specificity, we detected multiple isoforms of Gadd45a protein in cell lines expressing our constructs encoding mouse Gadd45a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044207.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The presence of multiple Gadd45a isoforms is consistent with previous reports that show that Gadd45a can be cleaved and/or alternatively spliced <xref rid="pone.0044207-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Sanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. For example, exposure of epithelial cells to toxins such as arsenic results in production of alternate Gadd45a isoforms <xref rid="pone.0044207-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is unclear whether these Gadd45a isoforms are normally present in developing brain and if they play a role in regulating cellular activities. In addition, while all neural cell types may express low levels of Gadd45a, its presence in neurons remains to be confirmed. In our hands, antibodies that detect Gadd45a on western blots were ineffective in detecting this protein in brain sections (data not shown). The relatively low levels of Gadd45a expressed in normal brain as evidenced by western blot may have contributed to our inability to detect this protein in brain sections. Since the Gadd45 protein family is highly conserved across most cell types and has been shown to be upregulated in the brain in response to various stimuli (e.g. ultrasound <xref rid="pone.0044207-Hocevar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>) it is very likely that Gadd45a is present in neurons. In addition, a recent study found that Gadd45a (endogenous or tagged) is localized to the nuclei of RKO and HEK293 cells where it colocalizes and interacts with other RNA-binding proteins <xref rid="pone.0044207-Sytnikova1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus it would not be surprising if future studies identified similar localization in cortical neurons.</p><p>We observed that knockdown of Gadd45a in cortical neurons disrupted the outgrowth of neurites, an effect that was partially reversed by co-expression of a Gadd45a shRNA-resistant protein in these cells. These results suggest that Gadd45a may contribute to the process of neurite arborization in developing neurons. Interestingly, we found that the gross cytoarchitecture of the forebrains of Gadd45a knockout mice was comparable to that of wildtype mice (data not shown). At this point, we cannot explain this observation without further experimentation but would suggest that either the absence of Gadd45a in the knockout mice does induce differences in the morphology of neurons which are more subtle than those obtained using Gadd45a shRNA, or that the absence of Gadd45a expression in knockout mice is compensated for by other Gadd45 isoforms. This second possibility is supported by the observation that activation of <italic>Gadd45g</italic>, which is expressed in developing mouse and human cortex <xref rid="pone.0044207-Kaufmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-McLean1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, is sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation <xref rid="pone.0044207-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A third possibility is that in utero electroporation induces a more exaggerated phenotype than that obtained in knockout mice. Examples of this phenomenon have been observed for other key regulators of neuronal migration and differentiation (e.g., DCX and FMRP) <xref rid="pone.0044207-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Manent1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Saffary1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Our findings that treatment of young mice with VPA induced rapid increases in Gadd45a protein levels in the cortex and that overexpression of Gadd45a has adverse effects on neurite arborization and survival of neurons may be clinically relevant in view of reports that children exposed to VPA in utero have a higher risk of impaired cognitive function than children exposed to other antiepileptic drugs <xref rid="pone.0044207-Meador1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A single, high dose of VPA (e.g. 400&#x02013;800 mg/kg) is routinely administered to prenatal and early postnatal rodents by numerous research groups to induce autistic-like behaviors in these animals <xref rid="pone.0044207-Kuwagata1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yochum1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Our data suggest that these abnormal behaviors may be due, in part, to overproduction of Gadd45a in the brain. In addition to VPA, other HDAC inhibitors (e.g. trichostatin A, PCI-247810), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. indomethacin, sulindac), and various environmental stressors (e.g., hypoxia, ischemia, UV light, osmotic stress, X-rays, seizures and ultrasound) have been shown to induce Gadd45a expression <xref rid="pone.0044207-Hocevar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Chiou1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Henshall1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Liebermann1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044207-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In humans, blood levels of Gadd45a have been positively correlated with increasing levels of radiation exposure <xref rid="pone.0044207-Kabacik1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Since we were able to detect Gadd45a in both the blood and cortex of developing mice, it may be worthwhile to determine whether it is possible to detect injuries or stress-induced damage to the developing brain by monitoring changes in Gadd45a in the blood.</p><p>Collectively, our data suggest that Gadd45a signaling is required for proper neuronal morphogenesis during peak periods of neuronal maturation. It is clear that small increases or decreases in Gadd45a expression levels can alter neuron development. Because expression of Gadd45a appears to be tightly regulated in developing cortex and its expression is likely to affect brain circuitry and function, it will be important to improve our understanding of the impact that commonly used drugs and environmental stimuli that can alter Gadd45a levels have on cortical development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal protocols were approved by and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Western blot results show that shRNA#688 specifically reduced levels of both AU1-tagged Gadd45a (CT and NT) proteins (black arrows) but does not reduce levels of the shRNA-resistant R-Gadd45a-AU1 (NT) (red arrows).
